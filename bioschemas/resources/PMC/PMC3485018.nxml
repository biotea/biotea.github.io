      <abstract>
        <p>Circadian clocks are the endogenous oscillators that regulate rhythmic physiological and behavioral changes to correspond to daily light-dark cycles. Molecular dissections have revealed that transcriptional feedback loops of the circadian clock genes drive the molecular oscillation, in which PER/CRY complexes inhibit the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer to constitute a negative feedback loop. In this study, we identified the type II protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as an interacting molecule of CRY1. Although the <italic>Prmt5</italic> gene was constitutively expressed, increased interaction of PRMT5 with CRY1 was observed when the <italic>Per1</italic> gene was repressed both in synchronized mouse liver and NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, rhythmic recruitment of PRMT5 and CRY1 to the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter was found to be associated with an increased level of histone H4R3 dimethylation and <italic>Per1</italic> gene repression. Consistently, decreased histone H4R3 dimethylation and altered rhythmic <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression were observed in <italic>Prmt5</italic>-depleted cells. Taken together, these findings provide an insight into the link between histone arginine methylation by PRMT5 and transcriptional regulation of the circadian <italic>Per1</italic> gene.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Circadian clocks are the endogenous oscillators that drive metabolic, physiological, and behavioral rhythms with an intrinsic period of approximately 24 hours <xref rid="pone.0048152-Schibler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The circadian clocks are entrained to day-night cycles generated by the rotation of the Earth. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus functions as a central clock, which orchestrates peripheral clocks present in almost every tissue, even in cultured cells <xref rid="pone.0048152-Stephan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Balsalobre1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Yamazaki1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Yagita1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. At the molecular level, transcriptional/translational feedback loops underlie the mammalian circadian clocks that give rise to molecular oscillation through the action of transcriptional factors such as CLOCK/BMAL1 transcriptional activators and PER/CRY transcriptional repressors <xref rid="pone.0048152-Reppert1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Lowrey1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer transactivates clock genes including <italic>Pers</italic> (<italic>Per1, Per2, Per3</italic>) and <italic>Crys</italic> (<italic>Cry1, Cry2</italic>) via binding to the E-box on their promoter region. The resulting PER/CRY complexes translocate into the nucleus with a timed delay, and then inhibit the CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation.</p>
      <p>CRYs are flavin/pterin-containing proteins and were initially identified as plant blue-light receptors due to their structural similarity to photolyase, which repairs DNA photoproducts in response to UV irradiation <xref rid="pone.0048152-Cashmore1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although mammalian CRYs have been reported to have no direct DNA repair activity, it has been suggested that mammalian CRYs participate in DNA repair through transcriptional regulation of the <italic>Xpa</italic> gene, a component of nucleotide excision repair, in a circadian rhythm-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0048152-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Genetically modified mice with two <italic>Crys</italic> inactivated are completely arrhythmic, indicating that CRYs are critical components of the central circadian pacemaker <xref rid="pone.0048152-vanderHorst1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Vitaterna1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Accumulating evidence suggests that post-transcriptional modifications of CRY play an important role in circadian rhythm regulation. For example, casein kinase I phosphorylates PERs, which associates with CRYs, leading to translocation of the PERs/CRYs complexes and inhibition of CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription <xref rid="pone.0048152-Vielhaber1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Camacho1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Akashi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Blau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. CRY1 undergoes ubiquitination by F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (FBXL3), which results in its subsequent degradation <xref rid="pone.0048152-Busino1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Godinho1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Siepka1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Recent study suggests that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates CRY1 and destabilizes it in response to nutrient signals in the mouse liver <xref rid="pone.0048152-Lamia1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It has also been reported that CRY1 inhibits the CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation through regulation of histone modifications. In fact, it has been shown that CRY1 negatively regulates <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and mSin3B <xref rid="pone.0048152-Naruse1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Dimethylation of histone H3K9 and recruitment of HP1Î± to the <italic>Dbp</italic> (<italic>albumin D site-binding protein</italic>) gene promoter might be the general mechanism for CRY-mediated transcription repression <xref rid="pone.0048152-Ripperger1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we demonstrate that type II protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which is known as a transcriptional corepressor due to its dimethylation activity on histone H4R3, interacts with CRY1 in the synchronized mouse liver and NIH3T3 cells. In contrast to rhythmic expression of <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Per1</italic> genes, non-rhythmic expression of the <italic>Prmt5</italic> gene was observed. However, rhythmic recruitment of CRY1 and PRMT5 to the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter coincides with the rhythmic dimethylation of histone H4R3 and <italic>Per1</italic> gene repression. Consistently, we found decreased H4R3 dimethylation and alteration of rhythmic <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression in <italic>Prmt5</italic>-depleted cells.</p>

        <title>CRY1 interacts with PRMT5</title>
        <p>To identify possible histone-modifying enzymes involved in CRY1-mediated circadian clock gene regulation, we first immunoprecipitated CRY1-associated proteins from 293T cells overexpressing Flag-tagged CRY1 and performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048152.s004">Table S1</xref>). Interestingly, type II protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) was identified as a CRY1-interacting partner. To verify the interaction between CRY1 and PRMT5, we overexpressed Flag-tagged CRY1 and HA-tagged PRMT5 in 293T cells. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag antibody, followed by Western blot analysis with the anti-HA antibody. While immunoprecipitation with control IgG showed no specific PRMT5 interaction, the overexpressed CRY1 clearly interacted with PRMT5 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). When cell extracts were reciprocally immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody and Western blot analysis with the anti-Flag antibody was performed, a significant interaction of PRMT5 with CRY1 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To eliminate the possibility that overexpressed proteins are nonspecifically immunoprecipitated by anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies, we performed immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis using overexpressed untagged PRMT5 and CRY1 in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g001">Figures 1A, 1B, S</xref>1A, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048152.s001">S1B</xref>). We also tested the interaction between CRY1 and NF-ÎºB (p65) as a negative control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048152.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).</p>

To avoid nonspecific immunoprecipitation by anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies, immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis was performed using overexpressed untagged PRMT5 and CRY1 (right panel).

The lysates from the 293T cell overexpressing deletion fragments of CRY1 and HA-tagged PRMT5 were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag antibody and immunoblotted with the anti-HA antibody. IgG was used as the negative control.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We further investigated the interaction region of CRY1 with PRMT5 using a variety of deletion mutants, i.e., Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 1 to 374), Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 370 to 470), and Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 471 to 586) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). HA-tagged PRMT5 equally interacted with Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 370 to 470) and Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 471 to 586), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). However, our results suggest that CRY1 (aa 471 to 586) was less strongly associated with PRMT5, since expression of Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 471 to 586) was weak or unstable compared to that of Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 370 to 470) in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g001">Figures 1D, S</xref>1D, and S1E). Interestingly, we detected each homodimeric form of Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 370 to 470) and Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 471 to 586) in the Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g001">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048152.s001">S1D, and S1E</xref>).

        <title>PRMT5 acts as a transcriptional repressor of the <italic>Per1</italic> gene</title>
        <p>PRMT5 is known to be a transcriptional corepressor due to its activity on the dimethylation of histone H3R8 and H4R3 <xref rid="pone.0048152-Wysocka1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition, we isolated PRMT5 as an associated protein of the CRY1 transcriptional repressor. Therefore, we tested whether it has a transcriptional inhibitory effect on CLOCK/BMAL1-driven circadian clock gene regulation using the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter luciferase-reporter containing E-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

        <p>Given that the <italic>Prmt5</italic> gene was not rhythmically expressed, we investigated whether PRMT5 interacts rhythmically with CRY1 when <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression was either activated or repressed in the mouse liver. We performed immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis using nuclear extracts with the anti-PRMT5 and CRY1 antibodies, which were confirmed their specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048152.s002">Figures S2A and S2B</xref>). The endogenous interaction of PRMT5 with CRY1 increased when <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression was repressed (CT 21) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g004">4A</xref>). In contrast, when <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression was activated (CT 9), a weak interaction of PRMT5 with CRY1 was observed. To confirm rhythmic interaction of PRMT5 and CRY1 in the synchronized NIH3T3 cells, we performed the same immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis. As expected, the interaction of PRMT5 with CRY1 increased when the expression level of the <italic>Per1</italic> gene was low at 36 hours after synchronization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g004">4B</xref>).

        <title>Rhythmic recruitment of PRMT5 to the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter</title>
        <p>CRY1 binds to the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer and represses <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression. Therefore, we next investigated the association of PRMT5 and CRY1 with the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter in the mouse liver samples harvested during the circadian cycle. ChIP assay revealed that binding of CRY1 and PRMT5 to the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter increased when <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression was repressed at night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g005">5A</xref>). However, CRY1 and PRMT5 dissociated from the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter in the activation phase of gene expression in the daytime. Collectively, the rhythmic recruitment of CRY1 and PRMT5 to the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter occurred in an anti-phasic manner with rhythmic <italic>Per1</italic> expression. Since PRMT5 catalyzes the dimethylation of Arg 3 on histone H4 (H4R3me2), which is generally known as a transcription repressive mark, we investigated whether rhythmic PRMT5 recruitment to the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter coincides with enrichment of dimethylated H4R3. We found that dimethylation of H4R3 at the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter fluctuated in phase with the rhythmic recruitment of PRMT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g005">5A</xref>). As expected, the acetylated histone H3K9 activation mark (H3K9Ac) anti-phasically oscillated with H4R3 dimethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, we were unable to detect any significant rhythmic enrichment of PRMT5, CRY1, H4R3me2, and H3K9Ac at the upstream genomic region, which is 6 kb away from the E-box of the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter. To further confirm our results, we performed the same ChIP assay when <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression was activated or repressed using a synchronized NIH3T3 cell model. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, we again found that increased recruitment of PRMT5 and CRY1 coincided with increased H4R3 dimethylation and decreased H3K9 acetylation at 36 hours after synchronization when the <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression was repressed. In contrast, we observed that decreased binding of PRMT5 and CRY1 to the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter was associated with decreased H4R3 dimethylation and increased H3K9 acetylation at 48 hours after synchronization when the <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression was activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048152-g005">5B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Regulation of histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation on specific lysine residues plays a crucial role in the gene expression that underlies circadian rhythm. In fact, rhythmic p300-mediated H3 acetylation has been reported at various circadian genes <xref rid="pone.0048152-Etchegaray1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. CRY1 negatively regulates <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) <xref rid="pone.0048152-Naruse1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Rhythmic enrichment of trimethylation of H3K4 and dimethylation of H3K9 were observed at the <italic>Rev-erbÎ±</italic> gene promoter <xref rid="pone.0048152-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Dimethylation of histone H3K9 and recruitment of HP1Î± to the <italic>Dbp</italic> (<italic>albumin D site-binding protein</italic>) gene promoter might be the general mechanism for CRY-mediated transcription repression <xref rid="pone.0048152-Ripperger1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In addition, Polycomb group EZH2 regulates di- and tri-methylation of H3K27 at the <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> promoters <xref rid="pone.0048152-Etchegaray2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Recently, it has been proposed that H4K4 trimethylation by MLL1 methyltransferase, which forms complex with CLOCK-BMAL1 is required for circadian transcription <xref rid="pone.0048152-Katada1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Histone demethylase JARID1a also plays an important role in circadian transcription by inhibiting HDAC1 <xref rid="pone.0048152-DiTacchio1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this study, we suggest that PRMT5 interacts with CRY1 and is involved in circadian <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression through the rhythmic arginine dimethylation of H4R3.</p>
      <p>PRMT5 is a type II arginine methyltransferase that catalyzes the monomethylation and symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues <xref rid="pone.0048152-Bedford1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Branscombe1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. PRMT5 has multiple functions including transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing, apoptosis, and ribosome biogenesis. As a splicing regulator, PRMT5 mediates RNA splicing by methylation of Sm proteins, components of the spliceosome <xref rid="pone.0048152-Meister1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homolog of <italic>PRMT5</italic> has been found to be important in regulating pre-mRNA splicing <xref rid="pone.0048152-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In addition, PRMT5 functions as a transcriptional regulator in a variety of mechanisms. For example, PRMT5-mediated methylation of transcriptional elongation factor SPT5 results in alteration of RNA polymerase II-dependent gene expression <xref rid="pone.0048152-Kwak1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. PRMT5 has also been demonstrated to act as a transcriptional corepressor based on its dimethylation activity on H3R8 and H4R3 <xref rid="pone.0048152-Fabbrizio1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Pal1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Pal2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Tae1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Lacroix1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Cesaro1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Majumder1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Rank1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Recently, two reports demonstrated that PRMT5 is involved in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian clock regulation. Hong et al. found that PRMT5 is a critical determinant of period length in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0048152-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Moreover, Sanchez et al. found that PRMT5 is required for the control of alternative splicing of clock genes such as <italic>PRR9</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0048152-Sanchez1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. They further showed that a <italic>Drosophila PRMT5</italic> homologue (<italic>dart5-1</italic>) is associated with alterations in splicing of the <italic>period</italic> and several clock-associated genes, indicating that PRMT5 links the circadian clock to the regulation of alternative splicing.</p>
      <p>Although we cannot exclude the possibility that mammalian PRMT5 also regulates alternative splicing of circadian clock genes, our results indicate that mammalian PRMT5 may act as a transcriptional corepressor in circadian <italic>Per1</italic> gene regulation. First, we found that PRMT5 interacts with the CRY1 transcriptional repressor. In addition, overexpression of PRMT5 augmented the transcriptional repression activity of CRY1 in the reporter assay. Consistent with our finding, the presence of an unknown transcriptional corepressor that binds to the C-terminal region of CRY1 had been postulated because its deletion abolished target gene repression <xref rid="pone.0048152-Chaves1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Second, rhythmic association of PRMT5 with CRY1 at the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter coincided with rhythmic dimethylation of H4R3 and transcriptional repression of the <italic>Per1</italic> gene. More importantly, we observed that depletion of <italic>Prmt5</italic> results in a significant reduction of H4R3 dimethylation and alteration of rhythmic <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression.</p>
      <p>Although more studies are required to discover species-specific roles of PRMT5, we expect that our observations may have resulted from the different structures of CRYs, since the amino acid composition and length of the C-terminal region of mammalian CRY are quite different from that of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY <xref rid="pone.0048152-Todo1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-vanderSpek1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In addition, some species-specific mechanisms of circadian clock regulation by CRY have been previously suggested <xref rid="pone.0048152-Wijnen1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. For example, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY is a major circadian photoreceptor for light entrainment, while mammalian CRY is not required for photo-entrainment.</p>
      <p>In this study, we also observed decreased enrichment of CRY1 at the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter in <italic>Prmt5</italic>-depleted cells. These results imply that PRMT5 may regulate CRY1 translocation to the nucleus and/or its degradation. In fact, there is speculation that PRMT5 may regulate the nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling of several proteins such as NF-AT family members <xref rid="pone.0048152-Richard1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Moreover, it has recently been reported that methylation of RAF proteins by PRMT5 is involved in the degradation of RAF proteins in the RAS signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0048152-AndreuPrez1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Similarly, we observed up-regulation of <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression and decreased enrichment of PRMT5 and H4R3me2 at the promoter in <italic>Cry1</italic>-depleted cells. In contrast, a less pronounced effect of <italic>Cry2</italic> depletion on <italic>Per1</italic> gene regulation was observed, implying that CRY1 may have a major role in PRMT5-mediated <italic>Per1</italic> gene repression. Supporting our observations, several reports indicate that CRY1 may function as the main transcriptional repressor in CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transcription <xref rid="pone.0048152-Kiyohara1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Sato1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048152-Langmesser1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. However, we do not exclude the possibility that both CRY1 and CRY2 may be required for the full repression of the <italic>Per1</italic> gene.</p>
      <p>When we overexpressed Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 370 to 470) or Flag-tagged CRY1 (aa 471 to 586) in 293T cells, each of the CRY1 fragments formed a homodimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048152.s001">Figures S1D and S1E</xref>). Based on our observation, there is a possibility that PRMT5 interacts with CRY1 when it forms a homodimer. However, we did not detect homodimerization of full-length CRY1 in standard Western blot analysis. Although it is unclear whether homodimerization of each of CRY1 fragment <italic>in vitro</italic> has a physiological impact on PRMT5 interaction or circadian rhythm, it has been previously reported that homodimerization of the N-terminal of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cryptochrome photoreceptor plays an important role in light signaling <xref rid="pone.0048152-Sang1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study demonstrates that PRMT5 interacts with CRY1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although non-rhythmic expression of the <italic>Prmt5</italic> gene was observed, rhythmic recruitment of CRY1 and PRMT5 to the <italic>Per1</italic> gene promoter coincides with the rhythmic dimethylation of histone H4R3 and <italic>Per1</italic> gene repression. Consistently, we found decreased H4R3 dimethylation and alteration of rhythmic <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression in <italic>Prmt5</italic>-depleted cells. Our study provides an insight into the link between histone modification by PRMT5 and mammalian circadian clock gene <italic>Per1</italic> regulation.</p>

        <p>NIH3T3 and 293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. To synchronize NIH3T3 cells, they were kept for 2â3 days until the cells reached confluence, and then were treated with 100 nM dexamethasone. Two hours after treatment, the medium was replaced with DMEM. At the indicated times, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested for RNA and protein extraction. For the ChIP assay, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde in PBS (1% final concentration) for 15 min. The committee for experimental animal research at Sogang University approved the animal experiments. Male BALB/c mice (Samtaco, Osan, Korea) were maintained for 2 weeks on a 12 hr: 12 hr light-dark cycle and then released to constant darkness. On the third day in constant darkness, the livers were harvested at the indicated times and kept frozen at â80C until use. For the ChIP assay, the livers were chopped into small pieces and fixed with formaldehyde in PBS (1% final concentration) for 15 min at room temperature. To stop the crosslinking, 1.25 M glycine was added (1% final concentration) for 5 min. Tissues were stored in liquid N<sub>2</sub> until use.</p>
