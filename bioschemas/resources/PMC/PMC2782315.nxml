      <abstract>
        <p>The generation of various phosphoinositide messenger molecules at distinct locations within the cell is mediated via the specific targeting of different isoforms and splice variants of phosphoinositide kinases. The lipid messenger PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> is generated by several of these enzymes when targeted to distinct cellular compartments. Several splice variants of the typeÂ IÎ³ isoform of PIPK (PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> 5-kinase), which generate PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, have been identified, and each splice variant is thought to serve a unique functional role within cells. Here, we have identified two novel C-terminal splice variants of PIPKIÎ³ in human cells consisting of 700 and 707 amino acids. These two splice variants are expressed in multiple tissue typesÂ and display PIPK activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, both of these novel splice variants display distinct subcellular targeting. With the addition of these two new splice isoforms, there are minimally five PIPKIÎ³ splice variants that have been identified in mammals. Therefore, we propose the use of the HUGO (Human Genome Organization) nomenclature in the naming of the splice isoforms. PIPKIÎ³_i4 (700 amino acids) is present in the nucleus, a targeting pattern that has not been previously observed in any PIPKIÎ³ splice variant. PIPKIÎ³_i5 (707 amino acids) is targeted to intracellular vesicle-like structures, where it co-localizes with markers of several types of endosomal compartments. As occurs with other PIPKIÎ³ splice variants, the distinctive C-terminal sequences of PIPKIÎ³_i4 and PIPKIÎ³_i5 may facilitate association with unique protein targeting factors, thereby localizing the kinases to their appropriate cellular subdomains for the site-specific generation of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The signalling pathways that utilize members of the PtdIns<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> family of lipids to transduce messages from one functional complex to another are as distinct as they are complex. PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> is positioned at the crossroads of many of these signalling cascades, as it may be metabolized by phospholipase C to generate Ins(1,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> and 1,2-diacylglycerol, further phosphorylated at the 3-position of the inositol ring by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to generate PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] or used directly as a messenger molecule by binding to proteins containing PH (pleckstrin homology), PX (phox homology), FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) or comparable domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, the method of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generation utilized in these pathways results in its availability being far from ubiquitous. Rather, PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> seems to be synthesized in a highly site-specific manner at distinct subcellular locales where it is directly utilized as a signalling molecule, thereby modulating the activity, conformation, assembly or disassembly of proteins at these sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The spatial and temporal metabolism of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> has emerged as a crucial regulator of multiple cellular processes, including actin reorganization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], focal-adhesion dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], endocytosis and exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], nuclear signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>Most cellular PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generation is fulfilled by the Î±, Î² and Î³ isoforms of the typeÂ I PIPKs (PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> 5-kinases). Although retaining high homology within the lipid kinase domain, each isoform exhibits a distinct subcellular localization pattern and functional specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is believed that the N- and C-terminal sequence divergence of each PIPKI isoform contributes to this diversity in targeting and function. PIPKIÎ± participates in both nuclear and cytoplasmic PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generation, where it has been implicated in the regulation of RNA polyadenlyation machinery and growth-factor-induced reorganization of the cytoskeletal superstructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The cellular roles of PIPKIÎ² are less defined, but a function for PIPKIÎ² in actin assembly and endocytosis has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>The newest member of the typeÂ I family, PIPKIÎ³ (type IÎ³ PIPK), is a workhorse for site-specific PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generation in a plethora of cytoplasmic processes. PIPKIÎ³ is a fundamental regulator of the assembly and disassembly of sites of cell-matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and cellâcell interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] termed focal adhesions and adherens junctions respectively. Importantly, the human PIPKIÎ³ is known to encode at least two alternative splice variants, PIPKIÎ³640 and PIPKIÎ³668 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These splice variants differ by the inclusion of exon 17, which encodes a 28-amino-acid C-terminal extension specific to PIPKIÎ³668 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This 28-amino-acid extension has been demonstrated to confer specific subcellular targeting and function on PIPKIÎ³668, where it consequently regulates focal adhesion dynamics, EGF (epidermal growth factor)-stimulated directional migration, basolateral targeting of E-cadherin, and endocytosis of the TfnR (transferrin receptor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Aside from mediating specific proteinâprotein interactions, this extension also affords several methods of regulating PIPKIÎ³668 activity, as it is tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated by Src [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and cyclin-dependent kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] respectively. In addition, PIPKIÎ³ can be directly phosphorylated by EGFR (EGF receptor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These phosphorylation events are in turn antagonized by specific phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the absence of a specific C-terminal extension, PIPKIÎ³640 also plays a specific cellular role, as it is the major contributor of the PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> utilized in G-protein-coupled-receptor-mediated Ins(1,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p>
      <p>A third PIPKIÎ³ splice variant consisting of 688 amino acids was described in mouse and rat neuronal tissue by Giudici et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition to containing the 28-amino-acid C-terminal extension of PIPKIÎ³668, this novel splice variant also contained a unique 26-amino-acid sequence inserted prior to the extension first defined in PIPKIÎ³668 and appears to be neuronal-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Although Giudici et al. uncovered the presence of a sequence homologous with this insertion in the human genome, they did not confirm its existence in human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Here, we provide evidence that two unique PIPKIÎ³ C-terminal splice variants do indeed exist in human cells. The two novel splice variants consist of 700 and 707 amino acids, possess PIPK activity, and are expressed in a multitude of cell typesÂ and tissues. Importantly, these splice variants display subcellular localization patterns that are unique from PIPKIÎ³640 or PIPKIÎ³668, suggesting that each splice variant likely fills a distinct functional role within cells. Since the discovery of these two new splice variants further complicates the PIPKIÎ³ nomenclature, all further instances of PIP5K1C gene products mentioned in the present paper have been assigned nomenclature based on the guidelines established by the Genetic Nomenclature Committee of HUGO (Human Genome Organization) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Following this convention, the unique PIPKIÎ³ mRNAs described herein are referred to as PIPKIÎ³_v4 and PIPKIÎ³_v5, whereas their protein products are termed PIPKIÎ³_i4 and PIPKIÎ³_i5.</p>

        <title>Cloning of PIPKIÎ³ splice variants</title>
        <p>mRNA from mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A was isolated using the Micro-FastTrackâ¢ 2.0 mRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen). 3â²-RACE (3â² rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed with the GeneRacer system (Invitrogen) using primers specific to a portion of PIPKIÎ³ exon 16 (5â²-GCCTCTGCTGCTGTTGAAGTAGAAA-3â²) and the supplied 3â² adaptor primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were run on agarose gels, and individual DNA bands were excised, purified and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). Full-length PIPKIÎ³_v4 and PIPKIÎ³_v5 were amplified from MCF10A cDNA using the 5â² primer (5â²-ATGGAGCTGGAGGTACCGGA-3â²) and 3â² primer (5â²-TTACCCAAAGCCCTTCTGGAAA-3â²).</p>

        <title>Identification of PIPKIÎ³ mRNAs in MCF10A human epithelial cells</title>
        <p>The human PIPKIÎ³ mRNA that encodes PIPKIÎ³_i1 or PIPKIÎ³_i2 contains 17 or 18 exons respectively, with exon 18 consisting of the translational stop codon for both proteins as well as a long 3â²-UTR region (â¼3Â kb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). When Western-blotting cell lysates from MCF10A cells were incubated with a pan-PIPKIÎ³ antibody, an immunoreactive band was observed at a slightly greater molecular size than that attributable to PIPKIÎ³_i2. This provided evidence that there may be other PIPKIÎ³ splice variants that have yet to be identified. In order to identify the putative novel PIPKIÎ³ species in MCF10A epithelial cells, mRNA was extracted from cells and subjected to reverse transcriptionâPCR. Initially, any unidentified splice variant was expected to share exon 18 as a 3â²-UTR. In subsequent PCRs, primers were used that targeted internal exons, along with a primer targeting the 3â²-UTR, to amplify PIPKIÎ³ mRNAs. These amplicons were subcloned into a T/A cloning vector and â¼50 clones per region were screened via restriction-enzyme digest and DNA sequencing for variations in exon structure. Although some variation of exon structure was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and results not shown), each alternative splicing event that was detected by this method resulted in a transcript that was shorter than PIPKIÎ³_v2. Because the immunoreactive band we had observed in MCF10A lysates was of greater molecular size, these smaller splice variants were not characterized further.</p>

            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) The full-length PIPKIÎ³_v4 and PIPKIÎ³_v5 transcripts were amplified from MCF10A-epithelial-cell cDNA using a primer targeted to the conserved 5â²-end of the PIPKIÎ³ transcript and a second primer matching the putative 3â² alternatively spliced exon identified via 3â²-RACE. The less prominent band running immediately below PIPKIÎ³_v5 was also sequenced and found to be non-specific. (<bold>B</bold>) A revised exon map of the human PIPKIÎ³ gene illustrates the four major C-terminal splice variants that have been identified. The overall lengths of PIPKIÎ³ transcripts listed are approximate estimates based on the defined open reading frames plus the 3â² untranslated region. Two novel exons, which have been termed exon 16b and 16c, make up the alternatively spliced C-termini of the PIPKIÎ³_v4 and PIPKIÎ³_v5 transcripts. Interestingly, the PIPKIÎ³_v4 transcript is longer than that of PIPKIÎ³_v5, but PIPKIÎ³_v4 mRNA encodes a shorter protein, owing to a stop codon in exon 16b. PIPKIÎ³ transcripts were identified in our initial experiments that lacked portions of exons 3 or 5, or all of exon 14, but these splice variants were not further characterized.

        <p>Since the previously described splice variants of PIPKIÎ³ display alternative splicing of the 3â² end of their mRNA to encode a unique C-terminal tail region, we hypothesized that the unknown splice variant may contain a longer unique C-terminus distinct from that of PIPKIÎ³_i2. The PIPKIÎ³ gene is quite long, being over 70Â kb in length (chromosome 19; 3 581 182â3 651 445); however, the mRNA which encodes PIPKIÎ³_v2 is only â¼5Â kb. Although this is not uncommon, it leaves the possibility that other splicing events can incorporate sequences that are assumed to be intronic. Interestingly, introns 16â17 of the human PIPKIÎ³ sequence, which in PIPKIÎ³ pre-mRNA lies between the majority of the PIPKIÎ³ coding sequence and the 84Â bp which encode the unique C-terminus of PIPKIÎ³_i2, is also quite large (â¼5.3Â kb). If another PIPKIÎ³ C-terminal splice variant were encoded by the PIPKIÎ³ gene, it is likely that this intron would contain the source sequence for the unique extension. With this in mind, we performed 3â²-RACE on MCF10A cDNA using a forward primer directed towards exon 16. The amplicons were then analysed by agarose-gel electrophoresis, individual bands were extracted for ligation into a T/A vector, and the ligated inserts were sequenced. The sequence information obtained from 3â²-RACE indicated the presence of a previously unidentified exon mapping to intron 16â17 (3 589 519â3 589 881) of the PIPKIÎ³ gene. PCR was then performed to amplify the full-length splice variant using a primer directed towards the known start codon of PIPKIÎ³ and the predicted stop codon and its 5â² flanking sequence. This resulted in the identification of two splice variants containing the novel exon, which we have named according to HUGO guidelines as PIPKIÎ³_v4 and PIPKIÎ³_v5 (Table 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). PIPKIÎ³_v4 was predicted to contain a reading frame of 2103 nucleotides, whereas the reading frame of PIPKIÎ³_v5 was expected to contain 2124 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Interestingly, both splice variants utilize the novel exon 16c. In the case of PIPKIÎ³_v5, this exon encodes a unique 67-amino-acid C-terminus. By contrast, the unique C-terminus of PIPKIÎ³_v4 is encoded by a second novel exon, 16b, whereas exon 16c makes up a portion of its 3â²-UTR. Upon identification of the splice variant mRNAs in MCF10A cells, we then sought to determine whether these messages were evolutionarily conserved.</p>

        <title>The coding regions of PIPKIÎ³_v4 and PIPKIÎ³_v5 are evolutionarily conserved</title>
        <p>The PIPKIÎ³_v2 splice variant has been conserved through evolution, as the DNA sequence encoding its distinctive 28-amino-acid C-terminal extension is present in most vertebrates, with a high level of conservation within mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This conservation underlines the importance of this splice variant in multiple cellular functions. Using the unique C-terminal amino acid sequences of human PIPKIÎ³_i4 and PIPKIÎ³_i5, a thorough BLASTN search was performed of both the complete and incomplete genome assemblies available on ENSEMBL. Putative orthologues of PIPKIÎ³_i5 were identified in multiple vertebrate species, indicating that the function of PIPKIÎ³_i5 is most likely conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, PIPKIÎ³_i4 orthologues were identified in <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> (rhesus macaque monkey) and <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic> (chimpanzee), but our search of translated sequence databases did not yield PIPKIÎ³_i4 orthologues in the other species where sequence information was available. In contrast with this finding, the presence of the PIPKIÎ³_i4 protein was observed in canine, mouse and rat cell lines via Western blot (see below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Since a full assembly of the mouse genome has recently been completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], we searched the mouse PIPKIÎ³ gene for the PIPKIÎ³_v4 coding sequence. We did observe a nucleotide sequence in introns 16â17 of the mouse PIPKIÎ³ gene that partially matches the human PIPKIÎ³_v4 coding sequence. However, we have not been able to translate this sequence into a putative version of the mouse PIPKIÎ³_i4 protein, owing to apparent gaps in the genomic sequence. Our unsuccessful attempts to identify the mouse PIPKIÎ³_i4 orthologue reinforce the notion that the mouse genome assembly may require localized review and revision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p>

        <title>PIPKIÎ³_v4 and PIPKIÎ³_v5 are expressed as human cellular proteins</title>
        <p>To verify that these unique messages were expressed in human cells as proteins, polyclonal antibodies were made to specifically detect each of the novel splice variants. Recombinant peptides corresponding to each C-terminus of the novel splice variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) were used to immunize rabbits, and antibodies were affinity-purified from bulk sera over an antigen column. These antibodies were analysed by Western blotting HeLa cell lysates transfected with each of the PIPKIÎ³ splice variant constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The antibodies specifically detected their target splice variant, with no evident cross-reactivity with other PIPKIÎ³ splice variants. The specificity of these antibodies was further confirmed by siRNA knockdown of total cellular PIPKIÎ³ and Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The results of these Western blots confirm that the band detected by each splice variant antibody is the intended target protein.</p>
        <p>With functional and specific polyclonal antibodies towards PIPKIÎ³_i4 and PIPKIÎ³_i5, we were then able to Western-blot epithelial and fibroblast cell line lysates from human, mouse, rat and canine cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>(C), each cell line tested via Western blot expressed both the PIPKIÎ³_i4 and PIPKIÎ³_i5 splice variants, with an apparent molecular mass of approx. 100Â kDa. Since these splice variants are detectable in human, canine, mouse and rat cell lines, this confirms that the expression of PIPKIÎ³_i4 and PIPKIÎ³_i5 is evolutionarily conserved within mammals. Interestingly, PIPKIÎ³_i4 appears as a tight doublet in some cell lines. PIPKIÎ³_i2 also appears as several discrete bands via Western blotting, and this may be due to the phosphorylation events that occur on its C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore, PIPKIÎ³_i4 may undergo phosphorylation or other post-translational modifications that affects its apparent molecular mass.</p>
        <p>To determine the tissue distribution of these splice variants, 20Â Î¼g of C57BL/6 mouse tissue lysates was Western-blotted with each of the anti-(splice-variant) antibodies as well as the anti-pan-PIPKIÎ³ antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>(D), each of the PIPKIÎ³ splice variants displays a distinct expression pattern in mouse tissue. Consistent with previous reports, PIPKIÎ³_i2 is most strongly expressed in brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], but is also expressed in greater quantities in the heart and lungs. PIPKIÎ³_i4 is strongly expressed in the pancreas and liver, but is also present in lesser quantities in the brain, heart, lung and kidney. PIPKIÎ³_i5 is present in large amounts in the heart and large intestine, but is also present in the lung, pancreas and thyroid, and, to a lesser extent, brain, stomach and kidney. Interestingly, the apparent molecular mass of the PIPKIÎ³_i5 mouse orthologue is approx. 5â10Â kDa lower than that of the human form. This size shift could be the result of a second alternative splicing event that has removed a portion of the mouse PIPKIÎ³_i5 mRNA. In mouse brain tissue lysates, two bands appear that are immunoreactive to the anti-PIPKIÎ³_i5 polyclonal antibody, but neither corresponds to the major species of PIPKIÎ³_i5 observed in other mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). It is possible that the lower band is the brain-specific PIPKIÎ³ splice variant (PIPKIÎ³_i3), identified by Giudici et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], which shares partial sequence homology with the human PIPKIÎ³_i5 variant described here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The upper band is approx. 100Â kDa, and, in view of its molecular mass, is potentially the full mouse orthologue of PIPKIÎ³_i5. Importantly, the expression profiles of each of the PIPKIÎ³ splice variants are indicative of a specialized role for each of these proteins in a particular tissue.</p>

        <title>PIPKIÎ³_i4 is a nuclear-targeted splice variant</title>
        <p>The 28-amino-acid C-terminal extension that is present on PIPKIÎ³_i2 is directly responsible for the targeting of this splice variant to focal adhesions in mesenchymal cells and to cellâcell contacts in polarized epithelial cells. This occurs via the association of this unique C-terminus with talin or E-cadherin and AP (adaptor protein) complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that the unique C-terminal PIPKIÎ³ variants described here also facilitate proteinâprotein interactions which target each splice variant to a discrete location within the cell.</p>
        <p>To explore the subcellular targeting of these new splice variants, we stained cells with polyclonal antibodies to pan-PIPKIÎ³, PIPKIÎ³_i4 and PIPKIÎ³_i5. Unfortunately, the PIPKIÎ³_i5 polyclonal antibody resulted in very poor staining in all cell lines tested. When MCF10A cells were stained with a anti-pan-PIPKIÎ³ polyclonal antibody, we observed PIPKIÎ³ localization largely at cellâcell contacts where it co-localizes with the adhesion molecule E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). A portion of this staining is likely to be indicative of PIPKIÎ³_i2, the functional contribution of which to E-cadherin biology is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the anti-pan-PIPKIÎ³ polyclonal antibody also shows some reactivity towards punctuate nuclear structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Interestingly, our anti-PIPKIÎ³_i4 polyclonal antibody indicated a localization of this variant to subnuclear structures, and, to a lesser extent, the cytoplasm, in MCF10A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), and NRK (normal rat kidney) cells (results not shown). Another type-I PIPK, namely PIPKIÎ±, targets to subnuclear sites known as ânuclear specklesâ. where it associates with splicing factors to regulate mRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. PIPKIÎ³_i4 staining co-localized with SC-35, a marker of nuclear speckles, but not nucleolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). This result is striking, as PIPKIÎ³ has not been previously identified as a nuclear PIPKI. To further assess the targeting of PIPKIÎ³_i4, HeLa cells were fractionated into their nuclear and cytosolic components, and these lysates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-PIPKIÎ³ polyclonal antibodies. Blotting with the anti-pan-PIPKIÎ³ antibody indicated that PIPKIÎ³ is mainly located in the cytosolic fraction, but a discernable amount of PIPKIÎ³ was present in the nuclear fraction as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). In agreement with the results from blotting with anti-pan-PIPKIÎ³ antibody, PIPKIÎ³_i4 was identified in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Interestingly, PIPKIÎ³_i4 appeared as a doublet in the nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, fraction. This probably indicates post-translational modification of PIPKIÎ³_i4, which is consistent with our observations of this splice variant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>(C). Taken together, these results support the presence of PIPKIÎ³_i4 in the nucleus and suggest that PIPKIÎ³_i4 could be functionally active in cytoplasmic as well as nuclear processes.</p>

        <title>PIPKIÎ³_i5 targets to discrete cytoplasmic domains</title>
        <p>As our attempts to utilize the anti-PIPKIÎ³_i5 polyclonal antibody for immunofluorescenve staining were unsuccessful, HA-tagged PIPKIÎ³_i5 was expressed in HeLa cells and its localization was observed. PIPKÎ³_i5 was found to target to the plasma membrane as well as to punctuate and enlarged cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). To confirm the nature of these structures, HeLa cells transfected with PIPKIÎ³_i5 were stained for various markers of endosomal compartments. PIPKIÎ³_i5 was found to partially co-localize with a subset of vesicles that stained positive for TfnR (recycling endosomes), EEA1 (early endosomes), CD63 (multi-vesicular bodies/late endosomes), and, to a lesser extent, LAMP1 (lysosomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). As we observed some co-localization of PIPKIÎ³_i5 with LAMP1, this could indicate active degradation of PIPKIÎ³_i5. However, degradation of PIPKIÎ³_i5 was not observed, as treatment of these cells with chloroquine did not alter PIPKIÎ³_i5 expression levels (results not shown). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, only a subset of PIPKIÎ³_i5-positive vesicles co-localized with any of these endosomal markers. However, these results suggest that PIPKIÎ³_i5 may be an active participant in endosomal trafficking events at multiple locations within the endosomal system.</p>

        <title>PIPKIÎ³_i5 is functionally distinct from PIPKIÎ³_i2</title>
        <p>Although the C-terminus of PIPKIÎ³_i4 is quite distinct from that of the other human splice variants, the C-terminus of PIPKIÎ³_i5 shows partial similarity to that of PIPKIÎ³_i2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). In particular, the W<sup>647</sup>VYSPLH<sup>653</sup> (one-letter amino acid code) motif present in PIPKIÎ³_i2 shows a high level of similarity to the sequence W<sup>647</sup>IYSPRH<sup>653</sup> in the C-terminus of PIPKIÎ³_i5. In PIPKIÎ³_i2, this sequence modulates the association of PIPKIÎ³_i2 with talin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and AP complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To determine potential PIPKIÎ³_i5 functional overlap with PIPKIÎ³_i2, HeLa cells expressing PIPKIÎ³_i5 were stained for endogenous talin or Î±-adaptin. PIPKIÎ³_i5 did not co-localize with talin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) or Î±-adaptin (results not shown) in HeLa cells. In addition, PIPKIÎ³_i5 did not co-immunoprecipitate with talin1, talin2 or Î±-adaptin (results not shown), confirming that, although the C-terminus of PIPKIÎ³_i5 contains this similar sequence, it does not target to the same cellular domains and probably cannot functionally compensate for PIPKIÎ³_i2.</p>

        <p>PIPKIÎ³_i2 directly associates with E-cadherin in polarized epithelial cells, both at cellâcell contacts and in TfnR-positive recycling endosomes, and the targeting of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane by PIPKIÎ³_i2 requires both PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generation and the association of PIPKIÎ³_i2 with AP1B via its unique C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. HeLa cells do not express E-cadherin; instead, cellâcell contacts in HeLa cells are mediated by N-cadherin, another member of the classical cadherin family. N-cadherin also directly associates with PIPKIÎ³ via its conserved kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and, as the kinase domain of PIPKIÎ³_i5 is identical with that of PIPKIÎ³_i2, we tested to see whether PIPKIÎ³_i5 could associate with N-cadherin <italic>in vivo</italic>. In HeLa cells co-stained for PIPKIÎ³_i5 and N-cadherin, we observed co-localization of PIPKIÎ³_i5 and N-cadherin at both cellâcell contacts and within cytoplasmic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). In addition, this targeting of PIPKIÎ³_i5 required kinase activity, as a kinase-dead mutant (D316A) of PIPKIÎ³_i5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] localized diffusely within cells and did not co-localize with N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). However, N-cadherin-based cellâcell junctions were not disrupted in HeLa cells expressing PIPKIÎ³_i5 D316A, indicating that the generation of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> by PIPKIÎ³_i5 is not required for the trafficking of N-cadherin to the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results are consistent with a functionally distinct role for PIPKIÎ³_i5 in cadherin biology.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The popular nomenclature used for splice variants of PIPKIÎ³, including those based on amino acid composition or apparent molecular mass, suffers from ambiguity. Splice variants derived from different species may contain similar exons and serve identical biological functions, but often differ in amino acid number and consequently their molecular mass. In addition, PIPKIÎ³ splice variants are post-translationally modified, which alters their apparent molecular mass on gel electrophoresis. In the present paper we have proposed and implemented a standardization of nomenclature which conforms to the HUGO Genetic Nomenclature Committee (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genenames.org">http://www.genenames.org</ext-link>) and HGVS (Human Genome Variation Society) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hgvs.org">http://www.hgvs.org</ext-link>) guidelines for transcripts and protein products respectively of the PIP5K1C gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Continued use of this standardized nomenclature will greatly simplify communication between investigators who study PIPKIÎ³ biology.</p>
      <p>Alternative splicing of RNA transcripts is an efficient cellular mechanism that increases the diversity of its protein products, thereby enhancing the overall functional specificity of a particular protein family. Much recent work has been devoted to delineating the mechanisms by which the unique C-terminal domain of PIPKIÎ³_i2 is able to confer functional specificity on this splice variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. PIPKIÎ³_i2 functions by its C-terminus associating with protein-targeting factors (i.e., talin, AP complexes), which then target the kinase to focal adhesions or cellâcell contacts respectively. Once targeted to its site of function, PIPKIÎ³_i2 then generates PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, which regulates the activities of proteins in the vicinity. Importantly, several proteins that directly associate with PIPKIÎ³_i2 are also PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In the present paper we have described two previously undefined splice variants of the PIP5KIC gene, PIPKI_i4 and PIPKIÎ³_i5, each of which contains a unique C-terminal domain. It is very probable that these unique C-termini direct the specific functions of PIPKIÎ³_i4 and PIPKIÎ³_i5 via the association of each kinase with distinct protein-targeting factors in a manner that parallels PIPKIÎ³_i2. By this mechanism, the results presented here suggest that PIPKIÎ³_i4 and PIPKIÎ³_i5 may fill specific functional roles within the nucleus and endosomal transport system respectively.</p>
      <p>The existence of a nuclear phosphoinositide signalling pathway that is independent of the cytoplasmic phosphoinositide cycle has been established, albeit that it remains relatively poorly defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Several nuclear phosphoinositide kinases have been identified, including another type-I PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> 5-kinase, PIPKIÎ± [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Recently, the PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generated by PIPKIÎ± at sites of concentrated pre-mRNA processing factors known as nuclear speckles was shown to regulate the activity of the nuclear poly(A) polymerase Star-PAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Interestingly, our data indicates several striking parallels between PIPKIÎ± and our newly discovered PIPKIÎ³_i4 splice variant. First, endogenous PIPKIÎ³_i4 was found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of HeLa cells and also co-localizes with nuclear-speckle markers, both in a manner similar to PIPKIÎ± [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, endogenous PIPKIÎ±, but not PIPKIÎ³, was detectable in Star-PAP immunoprecipitates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Moreover, another PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>-generating enzyme, PIPKIIÎ², targets to nuclear speckles and also does not associate with Star-PAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which supports the hypothesis that there are several discrete pools of nuclear PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> that are generated by PIPKIÎ³_i4, PIPKIÎ± or PIPKIIÎ². In other words, the specific targeting of these kinases and their association with a unique subset of proteins allows each to fill a distinct functional niche in nuclear phosphoinositide signalling pathways.</p>
      <p>Secondly, it is important to note that PIPKIÎ³_i4 is not visible in the nucleus upon overexpression, a localization phenotype that is identical with that of overexpressed PIPKIÎ± [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, endogenous PIPKIÎ± and PIPKIÎ³_i4 have been observed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, which leads us to speculate that the nuclear targeting of these kinases must be regulated in some manner. It is possible that post-translational modification of the unique C-terminus of PIPKIÎ³_i4, or interaction of a nucleartargeted protein with this sequence, could modulate its nuclear entry. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>(C), PIPKIÎ³_i4 appears as a doublet in the nuclear, but not in the cytosolic, fraction of HeLa cells. Therefore, nuclear PIPKIÎ³_i4 could be modified as a signal for nuclear retention or functional specificity within a nuclear subdomain. However, evidence supporting these speculations is lacking, and further investigation is required to determine the method of import as well as the potential nuclear functions of PIPKIÎ³_i4.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the PIPKIÎ³_i3 splice variant identified by Giudici et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] shares 75% sequence identity with the first 20 amino acids of the PIPKIÎ³_i5 C-terminus. In agreement with our data, Guidici et al. reported that PIPKIÎ³_i3 localized to vesicle-like and punctuate cytoplasmic structures when expressed in non-neuronal cells, where they also observed modest co-localization with vesicular markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, as the splice variant identified by Giudici et al. seems to be limited to mouse neurons, we propose that the much more ubiquitous human PIPKIÎ³_i5 could serve to perform similar biological functions in non-neuronal cells.</p>
      <p>The role of phosphoinositides in the regulation of the endosomal network has been well defined for 3â²-phosphorylated polyphosphoinositides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], but less is known about the role of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> in these signalling pathways. However, it is probable that PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> may also be a potent regulator of endosomal transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and the targeting of PIPKIÎ³_i5 to endosomal compartments suggests that the generation of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> could regulate endosomal system function or even transport between endosomal subdomains. As the type-I PIPKs have been shown to phosphorylate 3-phosphoinositides <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], an alternative explanation is that, given a certain subcellular condition or protein interaction partner, the substrate preference of PIPKIÎ³_i5 could be changed to utilize 3-phosphoinositides, thereby generating lipid messengers in addition to PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>. However, this shift in PIPK substrate preference has not yet been shown to occur <italic>in vivo</italic> in organisms other than <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>The significance of the sequence similarity between the talin and AP complex binding/regulatory site that is present in the C-terminus of PIPKIÎ³_i2, and its âsisterâ sequence that is present in the C-terminus of PIPKIÎ³_i5 cannot be overlooked. Our data indicate that, in the light of this similarity, PIPKIÎ³_i5 does not associate with talin or APs and is not targeted in a manner similar to PIPKIÎ³_i2. Although both PIPKIÎ³_i2 and PIPKIÎ³_i5 colocalize with cadherins, the mechanism by which PIPKIÎ³_i5 is involved in N-cadherin function likely differs from that of PIPKIÎ³_i2. When kinase inactive PIPKIÎ³_i2 or PIPKIÎ³_i1 (which lacks a C-terminal tail) was expressed in polarized epithelial cells, trafficking of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane was hindered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], indicating that both kinase activity as well as the unique C-terminus of PIPKIÎ³_i2 is required for efficient basolateral targeting of E-cadherin. HeLa cells expressing PIPKIÎ³_i5 D316A showed no apparent inhibition of N-cadherin trafficking to cellâcell contacts, but co-localization of PIPKIÎ³_i5 and N-cadherin was lost. These data suggest that PIPKIÎ³_i5 potentially regulates the post-endocytic trafficking of N-cadherin rather than its exocytosis. Since PIPKIÎ³_i5 is partially localized at several types of endosomal compartments, this splice variant is positioned to regulate the endosomal trafficking of N-cadherin, E-cadherin or other proteins at multiple steps within the endosomal system. However, further study is required to resolve the nature of the endosomal compartment at which PIPKIÎ³_i5 and N-cadherin co-localize, and to determine the extent of regulation by PIPKIÎ³_i5.</p>
