      <abstract>
        <p>Human <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutations are associated with developmental tooth abnormalities and adolescent onset of a broad range of ectodermal defects. Here we show that Î²-catenin pathway activity and adult epithelial progenitor proliferation are reduced in the absence of WNT10A, and identify Wnt-active self-renewing stem cells in affected tissues including hair follicles, sebaceous glands, taste buds, nails and sweat ducts. Human and mouse <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutant palmoplantar and tongue epithelia also display specific differentiation defects that are mimicked by loss of the transcription factor KLF4. We find that Î²-catenin interacts directly with region-specific LEF/TCF factors, and with KLF4 in differentiating, but not proliferating, cells to promote expression of specialized keratins required for normal tissue structure and integrity. Our data identify WNT10A as a critical ligand controlling adult epithelial proliferation and region-specific differentiation, and suggest downstream Î²-catenin pathway activation as a potential approach to ameliorate regenerative defects in <italic>WNT10A</italic> patients.</p>

  <body>
    <p>W<italic>NT10A</italic> is the most commonly mutated gene in human non-syndromic selective agenesis of permanent teeth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutations are also associated with the ectodermal dysplasia syndromes Odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia (OMIM #257980) and SchÃ¶pfâSchulzâPassarge syndrome (OMIM #224750)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Patients with <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutations exhibit variable developmental dental defects including microdontia of primary teeth, defective root and molar cusp formation, and complete absence of secondary dentition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Non-dental anomalies, such as palmoplantar keratoderma, thinning hair, sweating abnormalities, a smooth tongue surface and defective nail growth, appear beginning in adolescence or even later<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, suggesting possible roles for <italic>WNT10A</italic> in epithelial regeneration. In line with this, genome-wide association studies identified an association between a <italic>WNT10A</italic> intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that correlates with lower <italic>WNT10A</italic> mRNA levels, and male pattern baldness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Delineating the basis for these phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms of WNT10A action will be crucial in understanding the developmental and regenerative functions of WNT10A, and designing potential therapeutic approaches for affected individuals.</p>
    <p>Here we describe a new human pedigree carrying a predicted loss-of-function mutation in <italic>WNT10A</italic> and delineate the functions and mechanisms of WNT10A signalling in dental development and adult epithelial renewal by analysing human patient tissue and loss-of-function mouse mutants. We demonstrate that Wnt-activated self-renewing stem cells are present in the adult tissues affected by <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutation, and identify WNT10A/Î²-catenin signalling as a broadly used mechanism controlling epithelial progenitor proliferation. In addition to proliferative defects, we unexpectedly identified a requirement for WNT10A/Î²-catenin signalling in permitting regionally restricted, suprabasal differentiation programmes in tongue filiform papillae and palmoplantar epidermis, explaining the smooth tongue and palmoplantar keratoderma phenotypes observed in human patients. We show that in differentiating suprabasal cells, but not basal progenitor cells, Î²-catenin complexes with KLF4, a suprabasally restricted transcription factor required for epidermal differentiation programmes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, allowing Î²-catenin to switch from pro-proliferative to pro-differentiation modes. Our data further suggest activation of the Î²-catenin pathway as a potential means for restoring normal epithelial functions in <italic>WNT10A</italic> patients.</p>

        <title>Human pedigree with a novel loss-of-function <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutation</title>
        <p>Here we report a 41-year-old woman of Indian descent who contacted our dermatology clinic complaining of thinning hair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), onychodystrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), palmoplantar scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>) and decreased palmoplantar sweating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). The patient's tongue surface was abnormally smooth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g,h</xref>). Taste testing did not reveal decreased sensitivity to salt, sweet and bitter tastes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i,j</xref>); however, her affective (like versus dislike) taste response was blunted compared with her affective response to odors. Her low ability to taste quinine was concordant with genotyping for a <italic>TAS2R19</italic> allele associated with quinine sensitivity (heterozygous A:G for <italic>rs10772420</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and homozygosity for the non-taster diplotype (AVI/AVI) for bitter receptor gene <italic>TAS2R38</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). She had low alveolar bone density and a history of severe dental defects including small, conical primary teeth with taurodontism, and complete failure of secondary dentition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1k</xref>).</p>
        <p>Genetic testing ruled out mutation of the ectodermal dysplasia-associated genes <italic>EDA</italic>, <italic>EDAR</italic> and <italic>EDARRAD</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Instead, the patient was homozygous for a single nucleotide G&gt;A transversion at position c.756+1 (c.756+1 G&gt;A) of <italic>WNT10A</italic>, which mutates a conserved mRNA splice donor site for intron 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l</xref>). The proband's younger brother was homozygous for the same mutation and had similar symptoms including conical primary teeth, failure to develop permanent teeth, alopecia and palmoplantar scaling. Both parents were heterozygous carriers, and a male second cousin on her paternal side also reported dental abnormalities.</p>
        <p>qPCR of <italic>WNT10A</italic> transcripts isolated from the patient's plucked scalp hairs revealed the presence of normally spliced exon 1 and exon 2 transcripts at levels comparable to those detected in a similarly aged control female of Indian descent. However, transcripts resulting from splicing of intron 3 were present at &lt;10% of control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1m</xref>). The predicted translation product is truncated after amino acid 252 (Gln), resulting in absence of 16 of the 24 conserved C-terminal cysteine residues necessary for disulfide bridge formation, Wnt protein secondary structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and binding to Frizzled receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. As human patients with a wide range of different <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutations including homozygous missense mutations and mutations predicted to truncate the protein at nine amino acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> display overlapping phenotypes, these likely result from loss of <italic>WNT10A</italic> function.</p>

        <p>Adult mice with global or constitutive epithelial <italic>Wnt10a</italic> deletion displayed increasingly sparse hair with age. HFs undergo periodic cycles of growth (anagen), regression (catagen) and rest (telogen), driven by rarely proliferating epithelial stem cells in the permanent KRT15+ CD34+ bulge region, and rapidly proliferating progenitors in the adjacent KRT15+ CD34â secondary hair germ (SHG)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Immunofluorescence for pan-hair shaft keratins produced a signal in mutant HFs, and cuticle structure appeared grossly normal by scanning electron microscope (SEM); however, mutant hair shafts were shorter and thinner than controls, with disorganized internal structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2aâj</xref>). To investigate the mechanisms underlying these defects, we induced epithelial <italic>Wnt10a</italic> deletion at successive time points in <italic>K5-rtTA tetO-Cre Wnt10a</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice. <italic>Wnt10a</italic> loss from P9 (embryonic anagen) caused premature HF regression, cessation of matrix cell proliferation and decreased cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5aâbâ²</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2k,l</xref>). Deletion at P18 delayed initiation of anagen, indicated by histology and absent SHG proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5câdâ²</xref>), and prevented timely <italic>TL-GFP</italic> activation and external hair growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5kâm</xref>).

TBs contain Type I, II and III taste receptor cells, marked, respectively, by expression of ENTPD2, PLCÎ²2 and SNAP-25, and required for glial-like supporting function, and detection of sweet, umami, bitter and sour tastes. While forced Î²-catenin activation preferentially induces Type I fate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, <italic>Wnt10a</italic> or Î²-catenin deletion reduced marker expression for all three cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3s</xref>).

        <title>WNT10A controls region-specific epithelial differentiation</title>
        <p>Patients and mice with <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutations exhibit severe tongue and palmoplantar abnormalities that are highly region specific, and cannot entirely be explained by decreased progenitor cell proliferation. We therefore asked whether WNT10A loss also affects specialized tissue differentiation. Remarkably, we found that expression of the hard keratin genes <italic>Krt36</italic> (<italic>Krt1-5</italic>) and <italic>Krt84</italic> (<italic>Krt2-16</italic>) that specifically characterize tongue filiform papillae was reduced or absent in <italic>Wnt10a</italic> mutant tongue, or following inducible epithelial Î²-catenin deletion, even though rudimentary papilla structures were present and included differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9aâd</xref>). This result is consistent with co-expression of <italic>Axin2-tdT</italic> with HOXC13, a transcription factor required for <italic>Krt36</italic> and <italic>Krt84</italic> expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2iâiâ³</xref>). Nuclear Î²-catenin and TCF4 also localize to HOXC13+ cells, which are non-overlapping with LEF1+ proliferating progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6aâd</xref>). Inducible epithelial <italic>Wnt10a</italic> or Î²-catenin deletion caused absence of nuclear, or all, Î²-catenin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9eâh</xref>), and loss of LEF1 and HOXC13 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9eâ²âm</xref>).</p>
        <p>Human <italic>WNT10A</italic> patients display skin scaling and cracking of skin in palmoplantar, but not other, skin regions.

Consistent with this, we observed nuclear-localized Î²-catenin and TCF3 in mouse footpad epidermis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 6e,f and 7r</xref>). LEF1 expression was undetectable in this tissue, and TCF1 and TCF4 were mainly associated with sweat ducts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6gâi</xref>). Global <italic>Wnt10a</italic> loss or inducible epithelial Î²-catenin deletion caused decreased KRT9 protein and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9nâr</xref>). By contrast, the suprabasal keratin gene <italic>Krt10</italic> and the terminal differentiation proteins filaggrin and involucrin, which locate to epidermis in all body regions, were unaffected by <italic>Wnt10a</italic> or Î²-catenin deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9jâr</xref>). Similarly, while KRT10 and loricrin expression was comparable in WNT10A patient and sex- and age-matched control plantar epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9sâ²âtâ³</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6s,t</xref>), KRT9 protein was decreased in our <italic>WNT10A c.756+1 G&gt;A</italic> patient, and in an unrelated patient homozygous for a <italic>WNT10A c.391 G&gt;A</italic> mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9sâvâ³</xref>), and <italic>KRT9</italic> mRNA levels were lower in patient plantar skin than in control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6u</xref>).</p>

        <title>Î²-catenin complexes in differentiation and proliferation</title>
        <p>Our surprising finding that WNT10A/Î²-catenin signalling is required for region-specific differentiation as well as progenitor proliferation suggested that Î²-catenin may complex with transcriptional co-activators that are specifically expressed in differentiating versus proliferating cells, allowing its localization to distinct sets of target genes. We therefore examined potential transcriptional partners that are differentially expressed in suprabasal versus basal epithelial cells. A strong candidate was KLF4, which localizes to suprabasal epidermis, but is low or absent in the basal layer, and is required for embryonic tongue filiform papillae differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. KLF4 expression overlapped with nuclear Î²-catenin and HOXC13 in adult tongue filiform papillae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>), but was unaffected by loss of either <italic>Wnt10a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10a</xref>) or Î²-catenin, indicating that it is not regulated by WNT10A/Î²-catenin signalling. Inducible epithelial <italic>Klf4</italic> deletion in adults caused defects in filiform papilla structure and loss of HOXC13, but did not affect LEF1 expression or basal proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7bâe</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10b,c</xref>). Nuclear Î²-catenin remained detectable in LEF1-, as well as LEF1+, filiform papilla cells in <italic>Klf4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10d</xref>); thus, nuclear Î²-catenin is insufficient for HOXC13 expression in the absence of KLF4. Consistent with this, mutation of epithelial Î²-catenin to a constitutively active form in <italic>Krt5-rtTA tetO-Cre Ctnnb1</italic><sup><italic>fl(Ex3)/+</italic></sup> mice enhanced HOXC13 levels in differentiating filiform papilla cells, but did not induce its ectopic expression in basal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7fâi</xref>).</p>
        <p>These data suggested that KLF4, Î²-catenin and TCF4 might co-regulate differentiation genes in filiform papillae. To test whether Î²-catenin, KLF4 and TCF4 form a complex in differentiating filiform papilla cell nuclei, we used proximity ligation assay (PLA), which detects interacting epitopes that are separated by less than 30â40ânm (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). PLA with antibodies to Î²-catenin and KLF4, TCF4 and KLF4 or Î²-catenin and TCF4 produced signals in differentiating cell nuclei but not in progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10eâg</xref>, yellow arrows). Conversely, PLA for Î²-catenin and LEF1 produced positive signals in proliferating basal cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10h</xref>, white arrows). Signals were not detected in tissue lacking Î²-catenin or <italic>Klf4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10eâh</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7j,k</xref>), or using only one antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7l,m</xref>), indicating specificity of the assay. Î²-catenin/LEF1 complexes formed in the absence of KLF4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7n,o</xref>), and, interestingly, TCF4/KLF4 complex formation was unaffected by Î²-catenin deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7p,q</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine whether KLF4 plays a similar role in region-specific footpad epidermal differentiation, we examined its localization in this tissue. Immunofluorescence revealed KLF4 expression in suprabasal footpad epidermis where it co-localized with TCF3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7r,s</xref>), and was unaffected by Î²-catenin deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10i</xref>). Inducible epithelial <italic>Klf4</italic> deletion in adults caused enhanced pigmentation and flaking of footpad skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7t,u</xref>), a phenotype overlapping with the effects of loss of KRT9 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). In line with this, KRT9 protein and mRNA expression were significantly reduced in <italic>Klf4</italic> mutant footpad epidermis compared with controls, while <italic>Krt10</italic> expression was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10j,k,q</xref>). As in dorsal tongue epithelium, nuclear and cytoplasmic Î²-catenin localization was unaffected by <italic>Klf4</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10l</xref>). PLA revealed direct interactions of TCF3 and KLF4, and Î²-catenin and KLF4, in suprabasal footpad epidermal nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10m,n</xref>), and direct interactions of Î²-catenin and TCF3 in both basal and suprabasal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10o</xref>). Gain-of-function mutation of epithelial Î²-catenin enhanced Î²-catenin/TCF3 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10p</xref>). A consensus TCF/LEF-binding motif conserved in dog, horse and human localizes 16,185âbp downstream of the mouse <italic>Krt9</italic> transcription start site (TSS), close to a predicted KLF4-binding site. ChIP assays confirmed binding of KLF4, TCF3 and Î²-catenin to this region in footpad epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10r</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our data support a model in which, in KLF4- basal cells, Î²-catenin promotes proliferation via interactions with LEF1 in filiform papillae and TCF3 in footpad epidermis. In suprabasal cells, which express KLF4 in a non-Î²-catenin-dependent manner, Î²-catenin instead complexes with KLF4 and TCF4 in filiform papillae, and with KLF4 and TCF3 in footpad epidermis, to activate specialized suprabasal differentiation programmes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10s</xref>). The regional specificity of LEF1, TCF3 and TCF4 expression may underlie the distinct transcriptional programmes activated by WNT10A/Î²-catenin signalling in filiform papillae versus footpad epidermis.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we delineate the developmental and regenerative defects underlying ectodermal phenotypes in humans and mice carrying <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutations. We demonstrate that WNT10A/Î²-catenin signalling controls progenitor cell proliferation in a highly diverse set of epithelia characterized by distinct tissue organizations, differentiation pathways and cellular turnover rates. Using lineage tracing experiments with <italic>Axin2-Cre</italic><sup><italic>ERT2</italic></sup>, we identified self-renewing <italic>Axin2</italic>-expressing cells in the tissues affected by loss of WNT10A function. While we cannot exclude that additional pathways regulate <italic>Axin2</italic>, its expression in skin epithelia is removed by Î²-catenin deletion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Thus, our data suggest that Wnt-active self-renewing stem cells contribute to regeneration of <italic>Wnt10a</italic>-dependent tissues. However, Wnt signalling is not universally associated with epithelial regeneration, as we were unable to detect <italic>Axin2</italic>-expressing progenitors in rodent incisor epithelium. Unexpectedly, in addition to directing normal embryonic tooth morphogenesis and adult progenitor cell proliferation, we find that WNT10A is required for region-specific differentiation, explaining the smooth tongue and palmoplantar keratoderma phenotypes observed in patients with <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutations.</p>
      <p>Using genetic mouse models, we show that long-term absence of WNT10A causes HF miniaturization and sebaceous gland enlargement, with retention of bulge stem cells. This phenomenon is also observed in human androgenetic alopecia, consistent with identification of a <italic>WNT10A</italic> variant associated with lower expression levels and male pattern baldness. Functional studies of the <italic>WNT10A</italic> variant may shed further light on the aetiology of this common condition. Conversely, WNT10A's broad functions in epithelial proliferation suggest its possible requirement in skin squamous and basal cell tumours, which depend on Î²-catenin signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. In line with this, WNT10A overexpression <italic>in vitro</italic> promotes an invasive and self-renewing phenotype in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>.</p>
      <p>Sebaceous gland stem cells reside in the HF isthmus and sebaceous gland peripheral layer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. We find that these regions express several independent Wnt reporters, and contain <italic>Axin2</italic>+ self-renewing stem cells that give rise to the sebaceous gland. Paradoxically, impaired Wnt/Î²-catenin signalling in <italic>Wnt10a</italic> mutants, and in mice expressing dominant negative LEF1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), causes sebaceous gland enlargement. Decreased signalling in the absence of <italic>Wnt10a</italic> may alter the balance between proliferation and differentiation of sebaceous gland stem cells. Alternatively, <italic>Axin2</italic> may simply mark sebaceous gland stem cells rather than reflecting a cell autonomous requirement for Wnt signalling, and sebaceous gland enlargement could be caused by altered bulge cell fate. Further experiments will be required to distinguish between these models.</p>
      <p>Although <italic>Wnt10a</italic> expression localizes to embryonic appendage anlagen, we find that its requirements in embryogenesis are largely restricted to developing teeth, where it is required for normal levels of Î²-catenin signalling and <italic>Shh</italic> expression, explaining the tooth size and cusp abnormalities observed in mutant mice and human patients. In parallel, reduced expression of the direct Wnt target gene <italic>Dlx3</italic>, which is required for root formation, explains the root defects. The key roles of WNT10A in molar cusp and root development suggest potential utility of this molecule in dental engineering strategies.</p>
      <p>While microdontia and taurodontism are concordant between human patients and mouse mutants, patients with <italic>WNT10A</italic> mutations also display secondary tooth agenesis. Lack of this phenotype in mouse mutants is not surprising, as mice do not develop a secondary dentition. Interestingly, some <italic>Wnt10a</italic> mutant mice develop ectopic molar M4 teeth that are loosely anchored and preferentially lost, a phenotype that has not been described in human WNT10A patients. Careful examination of the dentition in very young, severely affected patients might similarly reveal ectopic formation of primary molars. Alternatively, differences in the mechanisms controlling patterning of dental development in humans and mice could explain the absence of ectopic primary molar formation in human patients.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms underlying repression of Wnt signalling in quiescent stem cells and its subsequent activation as cells enter a proliferative phase have been well studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. However, how this pathway is controlled as proliferating cells make the critical transition to differentiation is much less clear. Using footpad and tongue epithelia as relatively simple model systems, we find that inducible epithelial <italic>Klf4</italic> deletion mimics region-specific differentiation, but not proliferative, defects seen in the absence of <italic>Wnt10a</italic> or epithelial Î²-catenin. Our data indicate that in basal cells, where KLF4 is low or absent, nuclear Î²-catenin complexes with LEF1 in filiform papillae and with TCF3 in footpad epidermis to control basal proliferation. By contrast, in differentiating cells, nuclear Î²-catenin directly associates with KLF4 and TCF4 in filiform papillae, and with TCF3 and KLF4 in footpad epidermis to regulate expression of region-specific differentiation genes. This mechanism may be generalizable to other specialized epithelia, such as HFs, TBs, sweat ducts and nails, that exhibit Î²-catenin signalling in differentiating as well as proliferating cells. In line with this, in addition to controlling HF progenitor cell proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, Wnt/Î²-catenin signalling has been implicated in the regulation of hair keratin gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>, and we observed disorganized internal hair shaft structures in <italic>Wnt10a</italic> mutant mice.</p>
      <p>While KLF4 is broadly expressed in suprabasal cells and plays general roles in epidermal differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, we identified region-specific differences in the expression of LEF/TCF family members in filiform papillae versus footpad epidermis. These may contribute to the ability of Î²-catenin/KLF4/LEF/TCF complexes to direct region-specific differentiation programmes. Global analysis of the target genes activated by these distinct complexes will be a fascinating area for further study.</p>
      <p>Our finding that KRT9 expression is regulated by WNT10A through the Î²-catenin pathway has important therapeutic implications for <italic>WNT10A</italic> patients. Aside from dental defects that require corrective surgery, palmoplantar fissuring is the most troubling clinical manifestation in these patients and results in significant discomfort. Given the known role of KRT9 in ensuring integrity of palmoplantar epidermal cells, it is likely that decreased KRT9 is an important contributor to this phenotype. Current treatments, including topical urea to soften the epidermis and steroids to reduce inflammation secondary to epidermal fragility, are non-specific and poorly effective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Our data suggest topical application of appropriately formulated small molecule Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway activators as a potentially more effective approach to treat this condition by enhancing KRT9 levels in palmoplantar epidermis.</p>

        <title>Two-bottle preference tests and brief-access gustometer tests</title>
        <p>We used two-bottle choice tests and brief-exposure tests, respectively, to assess preference and acceptance of taste solutions. For the two-bottle preference tests, cohorts of 8â14 <italic>Wnt10a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and 9â16 <italic>Wnt10a</italic><sup><italic>â/â</italic></sup> littermates received ascending concentration series for 48âh each of two sweet compounds (sucrose and saccharin), two bitter compounds (quinine hydrochloride (QHCl) and denatonium benzoate), two sour compounds (HCl and citric acid), NaCl and capsaicin.</p>
        <p>We carried out brief-access tests on several groups of 7â14 <italic>Wnt10a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and 7â16 <italic>Wnt10a</italic><sup><italic>â/â</italic></sup> littermates. Mice were weighed daily for the duration of the experiment, immediately before their placement in an MS160-Mouse gustometer (DiLog Instruments, Inc., Tallahassee, FL). Each gustometer included a 14.5 Ã 30 Ã 15âcm test chamber with a motorized shutter to control taste solution access. Taste solutions were contained in bottles on a rack that was mechanically controlled to provide the mouse with access to any one of eight specific taste solutions. For each bottle, the drinking spout was connected with a high-frequency alternating current contact circuit. This permitted detection and recording of each lick of the spout<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>. Zero concentration and washout trials (see below) utilized deionized water. Reagent grade taste compounds (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) were dissolved in deionized water at room temperature.</p>
        <p>To control for any instrument-specific variation, repeat tests on each mouse were always conducted with the same gustometer and equal numbers of wild-type and mutant mice were tested with each of our eight gustometers. Mice were trained to sample taste solutions during 5âs access periods by depriving them of water for 22.5âh, placing them for 25âmin in a gustometer with the shutter open, returning them to their home cage and supplying them with water ad libitum for 1âh. This cycle was repeated for 2 more days, with the exception that in the two subsequent cycles, the access shutter was closed 5âs after each time the mouse started drinking and was then re-opened after 7.5âs. All tested mice were successfully entrained using these procedures.</p>
        <p>We administered each of the eight compounds to the control and mutant mice in three test sessions over two cycles. Responses to sucrose, quinine hydrochloride, HCl and NaCl were assayed in the first cycle, and the remaining compounds were tested in the second cycle. One 25âmin session was conducted per day, and tested only one compound. For the hedonically positive compounds sucrose and saccharin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>, mice received free access to food and water for 24âh followed by 2âml of water and 1âg of food, and were tested 24âh later. Mice then received unlimited access to food and water for 24âh before being prepared for the next test. Following testing with distasteful (hedonically negative) compounds, mice received unlimited water for 1âh before being deprived of water to prepare for the next session. For testing with hedonically positive compounds, the highest concentration was administered first to interest the mouse in accessing the drinking fluid. We then presented, in random order, once each of five different compound concentrations. For each measurement, the shutter was opened for 5âs, and the number of times the mouse licked the drinking spout was recorded. The shutter was then closed for 7.5âs, followed by presentation of the next taste solution. When testing hedonically negative compounds, we included additional one-second washout sessions with water between taste tests to cleanse the mouse's palate of the unpleasant compound and encourage it to keep licking the spout.</p>
        <p>For each taste compound, we carried out separate statistical analyses. We averaged the results of identical tests for each compound and concentration to calculate the mean number of licks for each animal. Mixed-design analyses of variance with factors of group (wild type or experimental) and concentration were carried out using the values for each individual animal. Mice that failed to respond during any presentation of a particular concentration of a taste compound were excluded from statistical analyses for that compound. To determine differences between groups of mutant and control mice in consumption of specific taste solution concentrations, and to assess differences in the response of each group to individual taste compound concentrations, we used post hoc least-significant difference tests (STATISTICA10, Stat Soft Inc.). <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered significant in all analyses.</p>
