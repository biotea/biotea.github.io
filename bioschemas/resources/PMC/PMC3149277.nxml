        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Intramembrane proteolysis governs many cellular control processes, but little is known about how intramembrane proteases are regulated. iRhoms are a conserved subfamily of proteins related to rhomboid intramembrane serine proteases that lack keyÂ catalytic residues. We have used a combination of genetics and cell biology to determine that theseÂ âpseudoproteasesâ inhibit rhomboid-dependent signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, thereby regulating sleep. iRhoms prevent the cleavage of potential rhomboid substrates by promoting their destabilization by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation; this mechanism has been conserved in mammalian cells. The exploitation of the intrinsic quality control machinery of the ER represents a new mode of regulation of intercellular signaling. Inactive cognates of enzymes are common, but their functions are mostly unclear; our data indicate that pseudoenzymes can readily evolve into regulatory proteins, suggesting that this may be a significant evolutionary mechanism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Intramembrane proteases are widespread and control important cellular processes, but many questions remain about their function and regulation. There are four known families: presenilins/gamma secretase, implicated in Alzheimer's disease and Notch signaling (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Haass and De Strooper, 1999</xref>); site-2 protease, first discovered as a regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref rid="bib7 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Goldstein, 1997; Makinoshima and Glickman, 2006</xref>); signal peptide peptidase (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Weihofen etÂ al., 2002</xref>); and the most recently discovered, rhomboids (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Urban etÂ al., 2001</xref>). Rhomboids are serine proteases, conserved across all kingdoms of life, and they regulate processes as diverse as growth factor signaling, mitochondrial morphology, parasitic invasion, and bacterial protein translocation (<xref rid="bib13 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Freeman, 2008; Urban, 2009</xref>). Extensive cell biology, biochemistry, and structural determination have provided insights into rhomboid mechanism, although, as with the other intramembrane proteases, much less is known about how rhomboid-dependent processes are regulated. This is a key question, as proteolysis is irreversible and often has potent cellular consequences.</p>
      <p>Phylogenetic analysis of rhomboids identified a subgroup of rhomboid-like proteins that lack essential catalytic residues (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Freeman, 2007</xref>). These âiRhomsâ (for inactive rhomboids [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Freeman, 2007</xref>]) are mysterious because, despite their predicted lack of protease activity, they are present in all sequenced metazoans, and their high degree of sequence identity implies selective pressure. Little is known about their function, but human iRhom1/Rhbdf1 has been reported to be necessary for the survival of some epithelial cancer cells (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Yan etÂ al., 2008</xref>) and may be linked to GPCR-mediated EGFR transactivation (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zou etÂ al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>iRhoms exemplify a more general phenomenon: the existence of conserved but catalytically inactive cognates of enzymes. The widespread occurrence of this type of predicted protein has onlyÂ been apparent since genome sequences have been available (<xref rid="bib24 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Pils and Schultz, 2004; Bartlett etÂ al., 2003</xref>), and their function is largely unknown. They are not generally encoded by pseudogenes and are therefore presumed to be expressed. Bioinformatic analysis has led to the suggestion that inactive enzyme cognates are disproportionately involved in regulatory processes (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pils and Schultz, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, active rhomboids are cardinal regulators of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Urban etÂ al., 2001</xref>), and although it is unclear whether this activity is conserved in mammals (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blobel etÂ al., 2009</xref>), recent evidence supports some evolutionary conservation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adrain etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Until now, nothing has been reported about iRhom function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We have used a combination of genetics and cell biology to discover that <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom regulates EGFR signaling. The EGFR pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has become a model for understanding how signaling pathways are regulated with theÂ precision that is necessary to control their multiple developmental and physiological roles (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Shilo, 2003</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom isÂ expressed predominantly in neuronal cells, and its loss causesÂ a âsleepâ-like phenotype that is indistinguishable from gain-of-EGFR signaling in the central nervous system. Consistent with this, genetic interactions show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom counteracts the function of active rhomboids, specifically acting to inhibit EGFR signaling. As well as revealing the biological roleÂ of <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom, we have investigated the cellular mechanism of iRhom function. Both fly and mammalian iRhoms,Â which are localized in the ER, inhibit secretion and intracellular levels of specific client proteins by promoting proteasomal degradation. Overall, these data imply that iRhoms regulate secretion of specific client proteins, which include the EGF family of growth factors. We show that they can target clients for proteasomal removal by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In this way, fundamental cellular quality control machinery is exploited as a mechanism for regulating growth factor signaling.</p>

        <title>iRhoms Lack Proteolytic Activity</title>
        <p>Biochemical and structural analysis of rhomboid proteases hasÂ identified the two essential catalytic residues as being serine-201 and histidine-254 (numbered according to <italic>E.Â coli</italic> GlpG) (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wang etÂ al., 2006</xref>). Phylogenetic alignment of eukaryotic rhomboid-like proteins identified a well-conserved subfamily in which one or both of these catalytic residues were missing, despite otherwise having clear sequence and topological similarity to the active rhomboids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Freeman, 2007</xref>). The human genes have been named Rhbdf1 and Rhbdf2, but the generic term iRhoms has been proposed to distinguish them from the active proteases (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Freeman, 2007</xref>). The degree of conservation of these iRhoms, which are only found in metazoans, suggests that they are under evolutionary selective pressure, but as they are not predicted to be active proteases, their function is unclear. iRhoms have three prominent distinctions from active rhomboids: a much longer N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a large and extremely conserved loop domain (the iRhom homology domain) between the first two transmembrane domains, and an invariant proline residue that is N terminal to the expected location of the catalytic serine (i.e., GPx replacing the GxS rhomboid catalytic motif). The significance of the iRhom-specific proline was investigated by generating variants of active rhomboids in which the residue immediately before the catalytic serine was mutated to proline. This mutation abolished the enzymatic activity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rhomboid-1 and strongly reduced mouse RHBDL-2 activity in a cell culture assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>Bâ1D). The proline mutation also virtually abolished the inÂ vitro activity of the purified bacterial rhomboid AarA (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Strisovsky etÂ al., 2009</xref>), demonstrating that it directly disrupts the enzyme (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E).</p>
        <p>This prediction that iRhoms are themselves catalytically inert was tested by analyzing <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom, human iRhom1 (Rhbdf1), and mouse iRhom2 (Rhbdf2) in a cell culture proteolysis assay. No proteolytic activity was detected against the <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR ligands Gurken or Spitz, nor against mouse EGF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>Bâ1D), all substrates of multiple rhomboids (<xref rid="bib35 bib36 bib1" ref-type="bibr">Urban etÂ al., 2002a, 2002b; Adrain etÂ al., 2011</xref>). We have further tested <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian iRhoms against a variety of other rhomboid substrates without detecting any proteolytic activity (data not shown). Overall, these data support the idea that iRhoms have no proteolytic activity and demonstrate that their characteristic proline is sufficient to disrupt the rhomboid active site.</p>

        <title><italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom Is Expressed in Neuronal Cells and Is Located in the ER</title>
        <p>Unlike most sequenced metazoans, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has only a single iRhom, encoded by the <italic>rhomboid-5</italic> gene. In situ hybridization showed that <italic>rhomboid-5/iRhom</italic> RNA is expressed exclusively in the central nervous system of embryos: transcripts are strongly detected in the ventral nerve cord and brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). In the third instar larva, <italic>rhomboid-5/iRhom</italic> expression was also largely restricted to neural tissue: specifically behind the morphogenetic furrow in the developing eye (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B), where the adult retina develops, and in the embryonic brain, with elevated levels in the optic lobes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). In adults, too, iRhom RNA is highly enriched in the nervous system and brain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flyatlas.org">http://www.flyatlas.org</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>Individual active rhomboid proteases have specific locations in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D) or in mitochondria (<xref rid="bib18 bib35 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lee etÂ al., 2001; Urban etÂ al., 2002a; McQuibban etÂ al., 2003</xref>). We used COS7 cells to determine the localization of HA-tagged <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom, human iRhom1, and mouse iRhom2. All were located specifically in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as demonstrated by characteristic perinuclear and reticular staining and by colocalization with the ER marker protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D). This is supported by an earlier observation that human iRhom1 is located in the ER in HNSCC 1483 cancer cells (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zou etÂ al., 2009</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title><italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom Mutants Phenocopy Neuronal EGFRÂ Activation</title>
        <p>To investigate iRhom function, we used homologous recombination to generate a null mutant of <italic>Drosophila iRhom</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref> available online). None of the three mutant lines that we isolated had discernible developmental defects. Homozygous mutations did, however, cause a severe decrease in the daytime activity pattern of adult flies compared to wild-type or heterozygous controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S1</xref>). The specificity of this phenotype was confirmed by transheterozygotes between the targeted mutation and a pre-existing deletion for the region having the same phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). Furthermore, <italic>UAS-iRhom</italic> expressed under the control of the neuron-specific <italic>ELAV-Gal4</italic> driver fully rescued the activity of the mutant flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B), whereas expression in muscle cells, under the control of <italic>how24B-Gal4</italic>, did not. This confirms the specificity of the phenotype and demonstrates that iRhom is required specifically in neurons, a result that is consistent with the nervous system-restricted expression pattern (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Aâ2C).</p>
        <p>During the day, <italic>iRhom</italic> mutant flies sometimes do not move for periods of 1Â hr, which is highly unusual. Prolonged periods of inactivity could, in principle, be caused by increased resting (aÂ sleep-like state) or an impaired ability to move. To distinguish these two possibilities, we measured the activity of flies during periods of wakefulness. During their relatively few active periods (147 over the course of the experiment, compared to 820 in the control), mutants showed no reduction of movement; in fact, in those periods, they moved slightly more than wild-type or heterozygous controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C). To confirm this, we analyzed video recordings and found mutants and wild-type to have the same walking speed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>D). This indicates that <italic>iRhom</italic> mutant flies can move normally and implies that their overall inactivity is due to an increase in periods of inactivity between active episodes. Consistent with this, sleep, typically defined as periods of inactivity greater than 5Â min (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Greenspan etÂ al., 2001</xref>), was significantly increased in <italic>iRhom</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>E).</p>
        <p>This same inactivity phenotype is caused by activation of EGFR signaling upon transient CNS expression of Rhomboid-1 and Star (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Foltenyi etÂ al., 2007</xref>). This is significant because of the well-established functional relationship between active rhomboids and EGFR activation (<xref rid="bib38 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Wasserman etÂ al., 2000; Urban etÂ al., 2001</xref>). Our results are therefore consistent with loss of <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom in the nervous system leading to activation of EGFR signaling, thereby decreasing daytime activity. This would imply that, under wild-type conditions, iRhom promotes wakefulness by inhibiting EGFR activity.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.4">
        <title><italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom Is a Specific Inhibitor of EGFR Signaling</title>
        <p>The cellular mechanism by which EGFR signaling in the CNS regulates <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep patterns is not yet understood, so to investigate further the genetic relationship between iRhoms and EGFR, we used the well-characterized systems of imaginal disc development. We looked for genetic interactions to test the hypothesis that iRhoms act as physiological inhibitors of EGFR activity. Halving the dose of iRhom, which alone caused no phenotype, strongly enhanced the rough eye caused by EGFR hyperactivity induced by Rhomboid-1 overexpression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). Conversely, removal of iRhom suppressed the eye phenotype caused by reduction of EGFR signaling, for example when Argos, Sprouty, or a dominant-negative form of the EGFR was overexpressed in the eye (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B). Both of these synergistic interactions imply that iRhom inhibits EGFR signaling; this was directly demonstrated by iRhom overexpression (using GMR-Gal4) suppressing the rough eye caused by the overexpression of active Rhomboid-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>C).</p>
        <p>In another set of experiments, we examined the consequences of <italic>iRhom</italic> heterozygosity in combination with reduction in the known EGFR inhibitory molecules Sprouty and Argos. Removing one copy of <italic>sprouty</italic> triggered a mild extra wing vein phenotype in 6.4% of adult flies grown at 29Â°C; this was enhanced to 74.5% when the dose of <italic>argos</italic> was simultaneously halved (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). Similarly, halving <italic>iRhom</italic> strongly enhanced the <italic>sprouty</italic> heterozygous wing phenotype: 62.5% of wings had mild, and 3.65% hadÂ strong extra vein phenotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). The additive effect of all three genes was further demonstrated in the triple-heterozygote combination, wherein mild (+) and severe (++) extra vein phenotypes were further increased to 87.5% and 10.3%, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). Together, all of these synergistic genetic interactions indicate that iRhom acts in the same pathway as Argos and Sprouty and is an inhibitor of EGFR signaling.</p>
        <p>Importantly, we also tested whether other developmentally significant signaling pathways were similarly perturbed by changes in the dose of iRhom. In an extensive series of experiments, we found no evidence for genetic interactions with Wg, Notch, Hedgehog, or Dpp signaling (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Overall, we conclude that <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom inhibits EGFR activity inÂ vivo; that this role is particularly prominent in the nervous system but can be detected in the developing wing and eye under sensitized conditions; and that, although we cannot rule out a role in pathways that have not been tested, this effect is largely specific to the EGFR-signaling pathway.</p>
        <p>To confirm that disruption of the EGFR pathway also can explain the sleep-like iRhom phenotype, we looked for similar genetic interactions affecting activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>E). Reduction of EGFR signaling by RNAi knockdown of the EGF receptor itself, or its activating ligand Spitz, significantly rescued the iRhom loss-of-function phenotype, supporting the idea that the lethargy in the mutant flies is indeed caused by excess EGFR activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>E).</p>

For this, we turned to cell culture, asking whether iRhoms can interfere with the function of active rhomboid proteases. When Gurken, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGF family ligand, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rhomboid-1 are coexpressed in COS7 cells, Gurken is cleaved and its extracellular domain is released into the culture medium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A) (unlike Spitz, Gurken does not require the action of Star [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Yogev etÂ al., 2008</xref>]). Coexpression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom inhibited the release of soluble Gurken induced by Rhomboid-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A). This effect was specific, to the extent that the release into the medium of two other proteins, Delta, a transmembrane protein subject to metalloprotease shedding, and Wnt3A, a secreted protein, was unaffected by iRhom expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>B and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>A). We also ruled out a different kind of nonspecific effect by coexpressing with Gurken and Rhomboid-1 similar levels of an unrelated polytopic ER protein, Unc93B (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brinkmann etÂ al., 2007</xref>). This caused no reduction of Gurken release (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C), implying that the iRhom effect was not a nonspecific consequence of overexpressing a polytopic membrane protein (for example, caused by overload of the ER). We also found that the release of Spitz, another <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR ligand, is similarly blocked by iRhom coexpression (data not shown). Together, these results show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom specifically inhibits EGFR ligand release from cells. Because iRhoms are conserved in all metazoans, we asked whether their function might be conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. When human iRhom1 (data not shown) or mouse iRhom2 were coexpressed with mouse EGF and the mouse active rhomboid, RHBDL2 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adrain etÂ al., 2011</xref>), secretion of soluble EGF was inhibited (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D), implying that both mammalian iRhoms had a similar function to their <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart.</p>

        <title>iRhoms Specifically Reduce Intracellular Levels of EGF Family Ligands</title>
        <p>The specific inhibitory effect of iRhom on the accumulation of soluble Gurken in the cell culture medium was also reflected in cell extracts, but in this case, we detected two distinct effects. First, iRhom coexpression reduced Gurken cleavage by Rhomboid-1, expressed as relative substrate conversion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E). Second, the total level of intracellular Gurken, intact and cleaved, was reduced by iRhom coexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E). Again, controls imply that this was a specific effect: the polytopic ER protein Unc93B did not reduce Gurken cleavage or intracellular levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>F), and neither Wnt3A nor Delta were destabilized by iRhom expression (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref>B and S2C). Finally, all of these effects were efficiently rescued by the additional expression of an ER-targeted version of Rhomboid-1, but only slightly rescued by high levels of wild-type Rhomboid-1, which is located in the Golgi apparatus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>G). This result is important for a number of reasons. First, it further demonstrates that the iRhom effect is not caused by a nonspecific disruption of the secretory pathway. Second, once Gurken has been solubilized by an active rhomboid, it is no longer subject to iRhom-mediated destabilization. Third, the fact that ER-restricted Rhomboid-1 rescues much more efficiently than Golgi-localized Rhomboid-1 argues that iRhom function occurs in the ER, not later in the secretory pathway. The slight rescue by wild-type Rhomboid-1 presumably reflects the low steady-state level in the ER as it is trafficked to the Golgi apparatus.</p>

        <title>iRhom Acts in Absence of Active Rhomboid</title>
        <p>Two classes of mechanism could explain our data: the iRhoms might either inhibit the function of active rhomboid proteases, for example by a dominant-negative effect, or could act directly on substrates, destabilizing them and preventing them from being cleaved by proteases. We took advantage of the absence of endogenous rhomboid activity in COS7 cells (<xref rid="bib33 bib1" ref-type="bibr">Urban and Freeman, 2003; Adrain etÂ al., 2011</xref>) to distinguish these models by testing the effect of iRhom in the absence of an active rhomboid. Human iRhom1 or mouse iRhom2 were coexpressed with EGF and other EGF family ligands. Under these conditions, ligand release was dependent on ADAM family metalloproteases, which were not chemically inhibited (as they were in some previous experiments). Strikingly, the secretion and intracellular levels of all EGFR ligands tested (EGF, TGFÎ±, Epiregulin [EPR], Amphiregulin [AREG], Betacellulin [BTC], and Neuregulin 4 [Nrg4]) were downregulated by the expression of either iRhomÂ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3</xref>AâS3D). Two control proteins, prolactin, a constitutively secreted protein, and Delta,Â a membrane protein that is subject to metalloprotease shedding, but not cleaved by rhomboids, were unaffected by iRhom expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S3</xref>E). As before, specificity was demonstrated by showing that Unc93B did not cause the same effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>Aâ6C and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3</xref>AâS3D). By repeating the experiment in HeLa cells, we also confirmed that the specific downregulation of EGF by iRhoms was not limited to COS cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S3</xref>F). These experiments clearly demonstrate that iRhoms can downregulate mammalian EGF family ligands (not all of which are rhomboid substrates [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adrain etÂ al., 2011</xref>]) in the absence of any active rhomboid, thereby strongly supporting a model whereby iRhoms act directly on EGFR ligands (or possibly other clients), rather than by inhibiting the rhomboid enzymes themselves.</p>
        <p>We further tested this model by examining whether a mutant version of EGF (A1031F) that cannot be cleaved by rhomboids but is susceptible to ADAM release (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adrain etÂ al., 2011</xref>) was sensitive to iRhom coexpression. Both human iRhom1 and mouse iRhom2 downregulated EGF<sup>A1031F</sup> and inhibited its release into the medium of COS7 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D). This further confirms that iRhoms can act on proteins that are not themselves substrates of rhomboid proteases.</p>
        <p>Is the iRhom effect simply a consequence of an interaction between a catalytically dead rhomboid and a potential substrate? We tested this by investigating whether catalytic mutants of mouse RHBDL2 would mimic the iRhom effect on EGF. No downregulation of EGF was detected upon expression of an ER-targeted mutant of RHBDL2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>E).</p>
        <p>In summary, these experiments lead us to conclude that <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian iRhoms share a conserved function; that iRhoms inhibit rhomboid-catalyzed release of growth factors by acting on the potential rhomboid substrates, rather than by inhibiting the enzymes themselves; and that the iRhoms have a specific function beyond just being catalytically inactive rhomboid proteases. An important further conclusion is that, although iRhoms show significant specificity, they can act on proteins that are not direct rhomboid substrates.</p>

        <title>iRhoms Trigger Proteasomal Degradation of Rhomboid Substrates</title>
        <p>The observed reduction of EGF family ligands induced by iRhoms suggested that they might be degraded in the cell. WeÂ therefore asked whether inhibition of the proteasome wouldÂ suppress iRhom-induced downregulation. Myc-tagged mouse EGF was coexpressed with iRhom1 in the presence orÂ absence of proteasomal inhibitors. As expected, iRhom expression caused a substantial reduction of EGF, both in cell extracts and secreted into the culture medium. This reduction was completely rescued by treatment with MG132, implying thatÂ the destabilization of EGF depended on proteasomal activityÂ (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A). This result was confirmed with another proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S4</xref>A). We also used qPCR to show that the observed increases in EGF levels were not caused by nonspecific transcriptional effects of the proteasome inhibitors (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4</xref>B and S4C). Because EGF resides in the secretory pathway, it is not directly accessible to proteasomes in the cytoplasm. However, proteins can be extracted from the ER for proteasomal destruction in a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brodsky and Wojcikiewicz, 2009</xref>). The location of iRhoms in the ER is consistent with a potential role in promoting ERAD. Interestingly, even in the absence of iRhom, MG132 treatment also slightly increased the steady-state level of intracellular EGF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A), implying that, even under normal conditions, some EGF is degraded by the proteasome.</p>
        <p>The conclusion that iRhom drives EGF into the ERAD machinery suggests that the two proteins might directly interact in the ER. Indeed, Flag-tagged EGF was specifically coimmunoprecipitated by HA-tagged human iRhom1 and mouse iRhom2, whereas control proteins, TGN36 and prolactin, were not (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B).</p>
        <p>To monitor the kinetics of intracellular EGF, which can leave the cell by secretion or be degraded by the proteasome, we performed a pulse-chase experiment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C). Because iRhom is expressed before the label is added, the iRhom effect is already apparent at the earliest stage of the chase, complicating the interpretation of this experiment. Nevertheless, this kinetic analysis is fully consistent with the steady-state data (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S4</xref>A). In untreated cells, a pulse of labeled EGF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C, blue diamonds) disappears from cells during a 3Â hr time course. As expected, coexpression of iRhom1 reduces the level of EGF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C, green triangles); again, all EGF disappears during theÂ 3Â hr chase. Addition of MG132 to inhibit the proteasome increases the initial level of EGF, confirming that ERAD contributes to EGF homeostasis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A), but most of the EGF is still secreted by the cell over 3Â hr (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C, red squares). Interestingly, coexpression of iRhom in cells in which the proteasome is inhibited (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C, purple crosses) slows down EGF secretion. This partial ER-anchoring effect by iRhom when it cannot promote ERAD is consistent with its direct binding to EGF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Finally, the inÂ vivo relevance of this model was tested by using <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics to look for evidence that ERAD contributes to the normal regulation of EGFR signaling. Inhibition of EGFR signaling by overexpression of either Sprouty or Argos was suppressed by RNAi knockdown of the ERAD factors Hrd1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>D) or EDEM2 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S4</xref>D). This implies that ERAD does indeed regulate EGFR signaling in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye. Overall, these data suggest that EGF levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and perhaps in mammals are normally kept in balance by low-level ERAD and that iRhoms exploit this mechanism to regulate growth factor signaling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>E).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report that iRhoms, which evolved from active rhomboids, act in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as negative regulators of rhomboid-dependent proteolysis, thereby inhibiting EGF receptor signaling in the nervous system. iRhom mutants have activity defects that are consistent with a role for EGFR signaling in controlling sleep in flies. We have shown that iRhom function, binding to EGF family ligands in the ER and allowing them to be targeted for degradation by ERAD, is shared between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. These results provide an unexpected and conserved mechanistic link between the cellular quality control machinery and the regulation of growth factor signaling.</p>

        <title>ER Quality Control and the Regulation of Intramembrane Proteolysis</title>
        <p>Intramembrane proteases are potentially dangerous enzymes: they catalyze the irreversible cleavage of proteins that trigger important cellular processes. Their regulation is therefore paramount, but little is known about how this is achieved under physiological conditions. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence suggest that intramembrane proteases rely heavily on regulated segregation of substrate and enzyme (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Freeman, 2008</xref>). For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the type II membrane protein Star regulates access of substrates to rhomboids (<xref rid="bib18 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lee etÂ al., 2001; Urban etÂ al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, the trafficking of the site-2 protease substrates SREBP or ATF6 to the Golgi apparatus, the location of S2P, is highly regulated (<xref rid="bib26 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sakai and Rawson, 2001; Shen etÂ al., 2002</xref>). Here, we report a new mechanism, the specific destabilization of substrates in the ER, ultimately preventing access to an active rhomboid. Our point is not that these diverse control strategies share common mechanisms, but that they all comply with the regulatory logic of segregating substrate and enzyme. This contrasts with the regulation of soluble proteases, in which there is greater emphasis on regulating enzyme activity. This distinction reflects the greater ability to restrict and control the cellular location of membrane proteins than soluble proteins.</p>
        <p>ERAD was first discovered as a mechanism for removing misfolded components of the TÂ cell receptor complex (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lippincott-Schwartz etÂ al., 1988</xref>). It is now clear that it contributes more generally to ER quality control and homeostasis (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brodsky and Wojcikiewicz, 2009</xref>). Our data extend the biological consequences of ERAD by demonstrating that it has been recruited in metazoans as a way of regulating intercellular signaling. Although many ERAD components have been identified, the molecular details of how proteins are targeted for recognition and retrotranslocation remain unclear (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brodsky and Wojcikiewicz, 2009</xref>). iRhoms are polytopic ER membrane proteins that can bind to at least two rhomboid substrates (this work and <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Nakagawa etÂ al., 2005</xref>). They could enhance ERAD actively byÂ introducing clients into the retrotranslocation machinery or passively by prolonging ER retention, thereby increasing the probability of exposure to ERAD. We do not know how many proteins iRhoms affect; our genetic and cell biological data show significant specificity, but the fact that mammalian iRhomsÂ target EGF ligands that are not rhomboid substrates (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S4</xref>) implies that they have evolved additional clients.</p>

        <title>Regulation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGF Receptor Signaling</title>
        <p>Our data also demonstrate the physiological significance of iRhoms in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: they are specific regulators of EGFR signaling. In mammals, our data also show that iRhoms can inhibit secretion of EGF family ligands, but in contrast to flies, the physiological significance is not yet clear. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGF receptor is probably the most genetically well-characterized growth factor receptor in any system (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Shilo, 2003</xref>), and it is striking how many distinct proteins contribute to its control. Our experiments demonstrate that iRhom is a new type of regulator of EGFR activityâthe most upstream control element in the pathway yet discovered. A theme that has emerged is the importance of negative feedback as a way of limiting the extent and/or amplitude of signaling (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Freeman, 2000</xref>). The fact that iRhom is transcriptionally activated in the developing eye imaginal disc (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B) in cells with active EGFR signaling implies that, at least in that context, iRhom could also participate in a feedback loop. Intriguingly, its expression pattern shows that, in the eye at least, its expression peaks at a time when EGFR signaling needs to be switched off (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Freeman, 1996</xref>). Degradation of EGFR ligands could therefore represent a robust way of preventing inappropriate EGFR signaling.</p>
        <p>Although we can detect the role of iRhom in the development of the wing and eye under genetically sensitized conditions, the only prominent phenotype caused by loss of <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom is behavioral. This is consistent with its expression pattern, which is largely restricted to the nervous system. An important open question is whether the activity phenotype of iRhom mutant flies is a consequence of a developmental or physiological defect. Loss of iRhom causes flies to undergo excessive periods of inactivity during the daytime, when wild-type flies are active. In fact, iRhom mutants appear to be the first loss-of-function mutations to have an excess sleep-like phenotype (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cirelli and Bushey, 2008</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> has become a genetic model to investigate the neuronal and molecular mechanisms of sleep (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Greenspan etÂ al., 2001</xref>), and our data support the recent report that abnormally high EGFR activity in the CNS leads to inactivity in flies (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Foltenyi etÂ al., 2007</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="sec3.3">
        <title>Evolutionary Significance of iRhoms</title>
        <p>The iRhoms have evolved from rhomboid proteases that lost their catalytic activity but retained their location in the secretory pathway and the ability to bind their substrates. This allowed them to acquire new functions as specific regulators of secreted proteins, without retaining a direct mechanistic interaction with the proteases. Because many mutations will lead to loss of catalytic activity, the evolution of regulatory proteins from âdeadâ enzymes might be quite common. The expression pattern, cellular location, and substrate binding capacity of such proteins provide an ideal platform for the subsequent acquisition of specific regulatory properties. Consistent with this idea is the striking existence of inactive cognates of most proteasesâindeed of many enzymes of all families (<xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Pils and Schultz, 2004; Rawlings etÂ al., 2010</xref>). Little or nothing is known about most of these pseudoenzymes, the widespread existence of which has only become apparent as genomes have been extensively sequenced. But we find it an attractive idea that many will have regulatory functions related to the enzymes from which they evolved.</p>

                <title>Generation of iRhom Knockout Flies</title>
                <p>The <italic>iRhom<sup>KO1/KO1</sup></italic> flies were generated by ends-out homologous recombination (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gong and Golic, 2003</xref>), using the pW25 vector backbone (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Gong and Golic, 2004</xref>). 3.5 kb of genomic DNA flanking the coding region of <italic>rhomboid-5/iRhom</italic> were cloned by recombineering (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Testa etÂ al., 2003</xref>) from a BAC (BACR30M19) containing the <italic>rhomboid-5/iRhom</italic> locus. All coding regions and cloning junctions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A transgene insertion donor line on the third chromosome was used for targeting, as the <italic>rhomboid-5/iRhom</italic> gene is located on the second chromosome.</p>
                <p>The targeting fragment was liberated and linearized in the female germline using FLP and I-<italic>Sce</italic>I, respectively, and progeny were screened for movement of the mini-white marker to the second chromosome, as well as its resistance to eyFLP (indicating that it is no longer flanked by FRT sites, as in the donor).</p>
                <p>The successful generation of three homologous recombinants was confirmed by Southern blot and PCR with specific primers to detect the insertion of the mini-white marker and the disruption of the endogenous <italic>iRhom</italic> locus (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>). The junctions of the resulting PCR products were sequenced to confirm site-specific integration of the targeting construct.</p>

                <title>Cell Culture-Based Assays</title>
                <p>Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For COS7-based overexpression assays, cells were first transfected in 6-well plates using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche) using 250Â ng of substrate and 25Â ng of rhomboid or iRhom (= 1x) expression plasmids. The total DNA amount was adjusted to 1 Î¼g with pcDNA3.1(+) vector. Eighteen hours post-transfection, cells were washed once in PBS and the secretion assay was then performed for 30Â hr in serum-free medium unless stated otherwise. The culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 16,000Â g for 10 min, and proteins precipitated by adding TCA (12% w/v). Precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation, washed in acetone and solubilised in 30 Î¼l 1x SDS PAGE sample buffer; cell extracts were lysed in 150 Î¼l of sample buffer. 15 Î¼l of each were then electrophoresed. Samples were typically electrophoresed on 4%â20% SDS-PAGE gels (Novagen) and analyzed by Western blotting using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:2000, Sigma) or mouse monoclonal anti-HA 16B12 (1:2000, Covance), polyclonal anti-actin (1:20 000, Abcam), polyclonal anti-Myc A-14 polyclonal (1:2000, Santa Cruz). Secondary HRP-coupled antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotech. HRP activity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Substrate conversion of Grk and levels of EGF, TGFÎ± and Delta were calculated from the densitometric analysis of X-ray films from Western blots or radioactive exposure using Image quant software.</p>
                <p>For co-immunoprecipitation experiments 60%â80% confluent HEK293 ET cells were transfected with the cDNA constructs indicated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C using polyethyleneimine (PEI, 25Â kDa linear, Polysciences). 20-24Â hr post-transfection cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated on ice in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150Â mM NaCl, 50Â mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The post-nuclear supernatants were pre-cleared by incubating with mouse IgG-agarose (Sigma) for one hour at 4Â°C. The HA-tagged iRhoms where immunoprecipitated using anti-HA affinity gel (Sigma) for one hour at 4Â°C, and the beads were subsequently washed three times with cold lysis buffer containing 300Â mM NaCl. The immunoprecipitaes were eluted with 1x SDS PAGE sample buffer containing 50Â mM DTT, and reduced for 15Â min at 37Â°C prior SDS-PAGE. The samples were analyzed SDS-PAGE and the FLAG-tagged co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting.</p>
                <p>For pulse chase analysis COS7 cells in 10cm plates were transfected with 1500Â ng FLAG-EGF with or without 600Â ng of iRhom1 and the total DNA amount was adjusted to 6 Î¼g with pcDNA 3.1 empty vector. 24Â hr post transfection, cells were pre-treated with either DMSO vehicle or 10 Î¼M MG132 in complete DMEM/10% FCS for 3.5Â hr. After this, cells were washed in PBS and then starved for 20Â min in DMEM lacking cysteine and methionine containing dialyzed amino acids and supplemented with 10Â mM HEPES pH 7.4 plus DMSO or MG132 as indicated above. Cells were then exposed to a precise 10Â min pulse of 35S Met/Cys (a total of 240 mCi in 5Â ml of medium) in the same medium, after which the radiolabel was removed. Cells were chased for the indicated time periods in complete medium supplemented with excess methionine and cysteine, containing DMSO or MG132, after which they were lysed on ice in 800 Î¼l IP buffer (10Â mM Tris pH 7.4, 150Â mM NaCl, 1% TX-100 plus complete protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Clarified supernatants were then pre-cleared with 30 Î¼l mouse IgG-agarose (Sigma) for one hour at 4Â°C, followed by immunoprecipitation overnight with 30 Î¼l of anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were then washed 3 times at room temperature in 1Â ml of IP buffer containing 300Â mM NaCl. Immunoprecipitates were then electrophoresed on 8% tris-glycine gels after which they were fixed, exposed for 20Â min in 1.5Â M sodium salicylate in 30% Methanol and dried, before exposure to photograpic film at â70Â°C.</p>

                <title>Quantitative RT-PCR Measurements of EGF mRNA Levels</title>
                <p>For assaying relative mouse EGF mRNA levels upon overexpression in the presence or absence of iRhoms Â± lactacystin or MG132, RNA was extracted from COS7 cells using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was then synthesized from RNA using the Superscript III kit (Invitrogen) based on 400Â ng of total RNA in a 10 Î¼l reaction. qPCR was performed on the resultant cDNA using gene expression mastermix using probes for EGF (Mm01316968_m1) and GAPDH (Hs00266705_g1) (Applied Biosystems). For comparison, the levels of EGF mRNA were normalized relative to the GAPDH levels in each sample. Subsequently, the relative amounts of EGF mRNA in the various treatments were expressed as a fraction of the treatment where EGF alone was overexpressed.</p>

        <p>iRhoms Are Inactive Members of the Rhomboid-like Family</p>
        <p>(A) iRhoms are highly conserved and lack the catalytic serine and/or histidine (arrows) of active rhomboids. Distinctive iRhom elements are long N termini, a conserved iRhom homology domain (IRHD, blue), and an invariant proline residue (red) before the catalytic serine. Protein names and identifiers are indicated. Note that the gene for <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom (Swiss-Prot:Q76NQ1; Rhomboid-5) is ambiguously predicted (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Freeman, 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>(B and C) Western blots assaying proteolytic activity in COS7 cells. Flag-tagged Gurken and Star (Grk+S) (B) or Flag-Spitz and Star (Spi+S) (C) were cotransfected with HA-tagged versions of Rhomboid-1 (R1), a catalytic serine-to-alanine mutant of Rhomboid-1 (SA), a mutant Rhomboid-1 with an iRhom-like proline (AP), or <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom. Cleavage of substrate inside the cells (extract) and secreted into the supernatant (sup) was detected with anti-Flag antibody. Cell extracts were also probed with anti-HA and anti-actin as controls for rhomboid expression and gel loading. Wild-type Rhomboid-1 cleaves and releases Spitz and Gurken; the SA mutant, AP mutant, and iRhom show no activity. Once cleaved, Spitz is rapidly secreted, explaining the absence of a cleavage product in the cell extract (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Urban and Freeman, 2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>(D) A similar experiment using mouse HA-tagged RHBDL2 (mR2) and myc-tagged mouse EGF. The alanine-to-proline mutation (AP) strongly reduced EGF secretion, and neither human iRhom1 nor mouse iRhom2 showed any catalytic activity. Mammalian iRhoms have been reported to be proteolytically processed (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Nakagawa etÂ al., 2005</xref>), explaining the multiple bands in cell extracts. This assay was done in the presence of 10 Î¼M BB94 to inhibit metalloprotease shedding. Throughout the paper, âMâ represents a mock transfection control and âSAâ represents a serine-to-alanine catalytic mutant.</p>
        <p>(E) The iRhom-like proline mutation in the active site of a bacterial rhomboid protease abolishes its enzymatic activity. AarA (WT), its catalytic serine-to-alanine mutant (S150A, SA), and iRhom-like mutant (A149P, AP) were overexpressed in <italic>E.Â coli</italic> and purified in the presence of detergent. The substrates TatA and LacY TM2 were inÂ vitro translated and radiolabeled. Enzyme and substrates were incubated at 37Â° for 40 min. Wild-type AarA concentrations were 280Â nM for TatA and 560Â nM for LacY TM2. Mutants were equimolar to the wild-type or 5-fold higher when indicated (5Ã). Cleavage products (P) were separated from the substrates (S) by SDS PAGE and detected by autoradiography.</p>

Expression of iRhom in muscle under the control of <italic>how24B-Gal4</italic> (nÂ = 38) does not rescue the activity pattern.</p>
        <p>(C) Waking activity, expressed as an average number of beam crossings in each minute in which activity was detected, was slightly increased in <italic>iRhom<sup>KO1/KO1</sup></italic> (nÂ = 17) flies compared to <italic>iRhom<sup>KO1</sup>/+</italic> (nÂ = 16) and wild-type controls (nÂ =Â 21).

        <p>(D) The movement of wild-type (nÂ = 5) and <italic>iRhom<sup>KO1/KO1</sup></italic> (nÂ = 5) flies was filmed. Fly movement was tracked during an active period, and the average walking speed (excluding short stops) was calculated in arbitrary units. Error bars represent mean Â± SEM.</p>
        <p>(E) Sleep, defined as periods of inactivity greater to or equal than 5 min, was significantly elevated in <italic>iRhom<sup>KO1/KO1</sup></italic> flies (nÂ = 39) compared to heterozygous (<italic>iRhom<sup>KO1</sup>/+</italic>, nÂ = 33) and wild-type (nÂ = 44) controls.

        <p><italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom Inhibits EGFR Signaling</p>
        <p>(A) The rough eye caused by sevenless-driven Rhomboid-1 overexpression (<italic>sev-rho-1</italic>/+) is strongly enhanced by halving the dose of iRhom (<italic>iRhom<sup>KO1</sup></italic>/+; <italic>sev-rho-1</italic>/+).</p>
        <p>(B) Loss of iRhom suppressed the rough eyes caused by reduction of EGFR signaling mediated by UAS-driven: <italic>dominant negative Egfr</italic> (<italic>U-DN-Egfr</italic>); <italic>argos</italic> (<italic>U-argos</italic>); and <italic>sprouty</italic> (<italic>U-sty</italic>). The driver in all cases was the eye-specific <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic>.</p>
        <p>(C) Expression of <italic>UAS-iRhom</italic> under the control of <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> suppressed the rough eye caused by <italic>sev-rhomboid-1</italic> expression. This was particularly obvious at the anterior edge of the eye indicated by white arrowheads.</p>
        <p>(D) Genetic interactions in the wing. Examples of wing phenotypes and severity levels indicated by wild-type (WT), mild (+), and severe (++) are shown.

        <p>iRhom Inhibits Secretion of EGF Family Ligands</p>
        <p>(AâC) COS7 cell supernatants (sup) were analyzed for Grk secretion, and cell extracts were blotted for levels of HA-tagged iRhom and Unc93B (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brinkmann etÂ al., 2007</xref>). The ratios of iRhom to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rhomboid-1 (R1) indicate relative amounts of transfected DNA.</p>
        <p>(A) Rhomboid-1 (R1)-induced secretion of Flag-Grk was inhibited by increasing amounts of iRhom.</p>
        <p>(B) Secretion of the FLAG-tagged Delta was unaffected by increasing amounts of iRhom.</p>
        <p>(C) Overexpression of the ER resident polytopic membrane protein Unc93B did not interfere with Grk secretion.</p>
        <p>(D) Mouse iRhom2 (iR2) inhibited mouse RHBDL2 (R2)-induced secretion of EGF. Secreted mouse EGF was detected by anti-EGF. The metalloprotease inhibitor BB94 suppressed nonspecific shedding of EGF. Increasing amounts of HA-tagged mouse iRhom2 (bottom) inhibited RHBDL2-mediated EGF secretion (top).</p>
        <p>(E and F) <italic>Drosophila</italic> iRhom destabilizes intracellular Gurken. Rhomboid-1-mediated Grk processing was inhibited by iRhom (E), but not Unc93B (F). Histograms show relative substrate (S) to product (P) conversion from the western blots above. The iRhom-to-Rho1 (iRhom:R1) and Unc93B:R1 ratios indicate relative amounts of transfected DNA. Equal loading was confirmed by probing cell extracts for actin levels. Error bars represent mean Â± SD.</p>
        <p>(G) The iRhom effect was rescued by expression of ER-localized, but not Golgi-localized, active rhomboid. KDEL-tagged Rhomboid-1 (R1-KDEL), but not theÂ inactive serine-to-alanine mutant Rhomboid-1 (Rho1 SA-KDEL), induced secretion of Grk in supernatants. A constant amount of iRhom inhibited Grk secretion (8ÃÂ more iRhom DNA transfected than R1-KDEL). Increasing amounts of HA-tagged R1-KDEL rescued Grk secretion. Using the same approach, untagged Rhomboid-1, which is Golgi localized (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D), did not rescue Grk secretion (right). HA-tagged iRhom, R1-KDEL, and R1 were detected in cell extracts. Flag-tagged Grk was detected in the supernatants (top) and extracts (middle). The Grk substrate band was absent when R1-KDEL is used because of efficient processing when substrate and enzyme are both in the ER.</p>

        <p>iRhoms Induce Degradation of EGFR Ligands Independently of Active Rhomboids</p>
        <p>(A and B) Secretion and intracellular levels of the indicated EGFR ligands were decreased by human iRhom1 (iR1-HA) and mouse iRhom2 (iR2-HA) but unaffected by mouse Unc93B.</p>
        <p>(C) Secretion and intracellular levels of Flag-tagged Delta were unaffected by iR1, iR2, and Unc93B. EGFR ligands and Delta were detected with myc and Flag antibodies, respectively. The effects of mammalian iRhoms and Unc93B on intracellular levels of EGF, TGFÎ±, and Delta were quantified from three independent experiments and plotted as relative percentages (error bars indicate standard deviations). Levels of iRhom1, iRhom2, and Unc93B were monitored by anti-HA antibodies in the cell extracts. In all panels, blots were probed with anti-actin to control for equal loading.</p>
        <p>(D) HA-tagged human iRhom1 and mouse iRhom2, but not Unc93B, reduced secretion and intracellular levels of Flag-EGF-A1031F.</p>
        <p>(E) iRhom1 and iRhom2 destabilize myc-EGF levels in cell extracts, but a KDEL-tagged (and therefore ER-localized) catalytically inactive mutant of mouse RHBDL2 (HA-R2SA-KDEL) has no effect.</p>

        <p>iRhoms Destabilize EGFR Ligands by ERAD</p>
        <p>(A) Secretion and intracellular protein levels of myc-EGF were increased upon MG132 treatment at 10 Î¼M for 12Â hr (compare DMSO-treated lane 1 with MG132-treated lane 2 in supernatant and extracts). The inhibition of myc-EGF secretion and intracellular myc-EGF levels caused by human iRhom1-HA coexpression (compare lane 1 with lane 3) was rescued by MG132. The histogram quantifies the data: intracellular stabilization was expressed as the ratio of band intensity of MG132 treatment divided by DMSO control. MG132 stabilized steady-state levels of myc-EGF 3.4- Â± 1.7-fold in the absence of coexpressed iRhom1 and 28.5- Â± 15.2-fold in the presence of iRhom1. Error bars represent mean Â± SD.</p>
        <p>(B) EGF coimmunoprecipitates with both iRhom1 and iRhom2. The proteins were coexpressed in HEK293 cells as indicated. Two control proteins, TGN36 and prolactin (PRL), showed no interaction with either iRhom. The levels of each protein in the cell lysates are shown in the middle and bottom panels.</p>
        <p>(C) A 10Â min pulse of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine/cysteine was used to label Flag-tagged EGF, and its kinetics were followed for 3Â hr Â± MG132 and Â± human iRhom1 (iR1). An autoradiogram of immunoprecipitated Flag-EGF (arrowhead) showed that iRhom1 reduced EGF levels at all chase time points (compare lanes 1/2, 5/6, and 9/10). MG132 increased EGF levels (compare lanes 1/3, 5/7, and 9/11) and rescued iRhom1-induced EGF destabilization (compare lanes 2/4, 6/8, and 10/12). The star indicates an unspecific degradation product. Quantification of the autoradiogram showed that, when the proteasome is inhibited, iRhom1 reduced the rate of secretion of EGF (compare slopes of red and purple lines).</p>
        <p>(D) Expression of EGFR inhibitors Sprouty (<italic>GMR/+; U-sty/U-GFP)</italic> or Argos (<italic>GMR/+; U-argos/U-GFP</italic>) caused a rough eye. Reduction of ERAD by RNAi knockdown of Hrd1 (<italic>GMR/+; U-hrd1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) suppressed this EGFR inhibition.</p>
        <p>(E) Model of iRhom function. EGF (in green) secretion is homeostatically regulated by ERAD; iRhoms (in red) bind to EGF, holding it in the ER and thereby enhancing ERAD and inhibiting secretion.</p>

        <p>(A) At the top is the donor construct, as it would appear on the third chromosome (Chr III) when initially introduced by P-element transformation. <italic>FRT</italic> sites allow the FLP recombinase to free the DNA from its chromosomal integration site. This results in circular extra-chromosomal donor DNA, which is subsequently linearized by I-<italic>Sce</italic>I. Homologous recombination can then occur between the donor construct comprising 5â² and 3â² homology arms either side of the mini-white marker gene (<italic>whs</italic>), which is flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites. Note that donor transformant lines carry the donor construct on the third chromosome and the <italic>iRhom/rhomboid-5</italic> locus is on the second chromosome. Upon successful homologous recombination, the <italic>whs</italic> marker becomes genetically linked to the second chromosome, and the donor construct loses its <italic>FRT</italic> sites, which was exploited to enrich for correct targeting events as described in <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>. The lower panels show the recombination event between the extra-chromosomal donor DNA (after FLP- mediated excision and I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cutting) with the genomic locus containing <italic>iRhom/rhomboid-5</italic>. The black bar indicates the position of the DNA probe used to screen for correct site-specific integration by Southern blot. Note that the probe was generated against genomic sequence just outside the 5â² homology arm, to detect the wild-type 5kb genomic fragment after <italic>Hin</italic>DIII digest upon site specific integration. Correct targeting replaces the <italic>iRhom</italic> genomic region with the <italic>whs</italic> marker, leading to the loss of a <italic>Hin</italic>DIII site, which increases the predicted size of the genomic <italic>Hin</italic>DIII DNA fragment to 11kb.</p>
        <p>(B) Southern blot analyzing three independent mutant fly lines (<italic>KO1</italic>, <italic>KO2</italic> and <italic>KO3</italic>) with the mini-white marker on chromosome II. All three homozygous mutant lines (<italic>KO1-3/KO1-3</italic>) showed the expected 11kb fragment predicted by the correct targeting, while a <italic>Hin</italic>DIII digest of genomic DNA from heterozygous (<italic>+/KO1-3</italic>) lines resulted in a 5kb wild-type and 11kb mutant fragment.</p>
        <p>(C) Genomic PCR strategy detecting a correct genomic targeting replacing the <italic>iRhom/rhomboid-5</italic> locus with the mini-white gene. Note one primer was designed outside the 3â² homology arm, and the second within the mini-white gene; a PCR product can only be formed when correct targeting occurs. Correct integration was further confirmed by sequencing the PCR product covering the insertion region.</p>
