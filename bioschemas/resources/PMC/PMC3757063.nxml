      <abstract>
        <p>Cilia are architecturally complex organelles that protrude from the cell membrane and have signalling, sensory and motility functions that are central to normal tissue development and homeostasis. There are two broad categories of cilia; motile and non-motile, or primary, cilia. The central role of primary cilia in health and disease has become prominent in the past decade with the recognition of a number of human syndromes that result from defects in the formation or function of primary cilia. This rapidly growing class of conditions, now known as ciliopathies, impact the development of a diverse range of tissues including the neural axis, craniofacial structures, skeleton, kidneys, eyes and lungs. The broad impact of cilia dysfunction on development reflects the pivotal position of the primary cilia within a signalling nexus involving a growing number of growth factor systems including Hedgehog, Pdgf, Fgf, Hippo, Notch and both canonical Wnt and planar cell polarity. We have identified a novel ENU mutant allele of <italic>Ift140</italic>, which causes a mid-gestation embryonic lethal phenotype in homozygous mutant mice. Mutant embryos exhibit a range of phenotypes including exencephaly and spina bifida, craniofacial dysmorphism, digit anomalies, cardiac anomalies and somite patterning defects. A number of these phenotypes can be attributed to alterations in Hedgehog signalling, although additional signalling systems are also likely to be involved. We also report the identification of a homozygous recessive mutation in IFT140 in a Jeune syndrome patient. This ENU-induced Jeune syndrome model will be useful in delineating the origins of dysmorphology in human ciliopathies.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Skeletal ciliopathies are an emerging field of human disease in which skeletal birth defects arise due to abnormal communication between cells. This failure in communication arises following mutation in components of the primary cilia, a hair-like structure present on every cell. The skeletal ciliopathies are debilitating and in severe cases lead to death in early infancy. However, the mechanisms by which these malformations come about remains unclear. Mouse models are often used to delineate the causes of human birth defects and we have identified a model that mimics one of these conditions known as Jeune syndrome. It is the first mouse model with a mutation in the <italic>Ift140</italic> gene, and these mice exhibit phenotypes that are often seen in this set of human syndromes. We have complimented this study with the discovery of a patient that presents with Jeune Syndrome resulting from mutation of human <italic>IFT140</italic>. This model will allow us to explore the role of IFT140 and the primary cilia in normal human development and provide insight into the field of human skeletal ciliopathies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Primary cilia provide highly regulated cellular sensory functions with diverse roles in the development and maintenance of many tissues and organs <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Berbari1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Primary cilia protrude from the surface of most eukaryotic cells except fungi and higher plants. The structural support for this arrangement comes from a tubulin-based scaffold known as the axoneme, the assembly and function of which is coordinated through a centriole-derived basal body. The basal body is tethered to the plasma membrane by transition fibres that are believed to form a selective gate or pore which functions to control the movement of proteins between the cytoplasm and cilium <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Rosenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The sensory function of the cilia derives from the deployment of plasma membrane-spanning receptors and channels within the ciliary membrane that provide a link between the extracellular environment and the cytoplasm <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Berbari1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Components of the primary cilia have to be transported from their site of synthesis within the cytoplasm to the cilium itself using a microtubule motor-based system known as intraflagellar transport (IFT). The axoneme grows from the distal tip and individual axonemal subunits must be transported along the nascent axoneme by IFT <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Kozminski1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The IFT complex is simultaneously in close physical association with both the axoneme and the ciliary membrane enabling transport of membrane bound proteins such as growth factor receptors <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Rosenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Given the blind ending structure of the cilia, IFT must proceed in a two-way fashion. The IFT particle is composed of at least two distinct sub-complexes, complex B and complex A, which are specialized for either outbound (anterograde) transport or the return (retrograde) journey respectively <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Piperno1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Piperno2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Kozminski2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The IFT particles form linear arrays known as IFT trains, which are transported by different motor protein complexes depending on the direction of movement. The anterograde transport complex B uses a kinesin-based motor while the retrograde transport complex A uses a dynein-based motor system <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Hirokawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The IFT-A complex consists of at least 6 subunits with a highly stable core sub-complex of three proteins, while the IFT-B complex consists of around 14 subunits with a salt-stable core of 9 <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Taschner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The nature of the interaction between the IFT-A and B complexes and their respective motor protein complexes remains unclear but anterograde transport components become cargo for the retrograde complex and the converse is also true <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Pazour1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus, mutation of any individual subunit is likely to impact on the function of the entire system. However, each transport complex has specific roles within the cilia, mutations within IFT-B tend to result in short or absent cilia while mutations in IFT-A more typically result in distorted cilia with a distended tip due to accumulation of stranded IFT cargo <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Pigino1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Over the past decade our appreciation of the importance of primary cilia function in development and disease has grown rapidly. There are now at least 12 disorders that have been attributed to mutations in cilia proteins and collectively they impact on nearly every organ system in the body <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Novarino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The skeletal ciliopathies are a diverse group of conditions involving congenital malformation of variable skeletal systems including the craniofacial skeleton, ribs and limbs. One example is the short-rib polydactyly (SRP) group which includes at least 6 distinct autosomal recessive conditions including Jeune syndrome <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Common features of the SRPs include a small thoracic cage due to a failure of normal rib growth, shortened tubular bones and pelvic defects. In addition, individual conditions present with a diverse range of soft-tissue defects including malformations of the heart, intestine, genitalia, pancreas, liver and polycystic kidneys. There is significant phenotypic overlap between these conditions and recent identification of causative genetic mutations confirms that the difficulty in distinguishing the features of particular SRPs stems from defects common to the structure or function of the primary cilia <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The primary cilia are endowed with an array of signal transduction components such as ion channels, receptor tyrosine kinases, Notch receptors and matrix receptors including the Hedgehog signalling components Ptch1, Smo1 and Gli, PDGFRa, IGFR1, EGFR and Tie2 <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Christensen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The function and activity of these sensory components is regulated, at least in part, by controlling their localisation within the cilia and in part by controlling access to downstream signalling components. The co-localisation of multiple signal transduction components within the cilia raises the possibility that the cilia act as a site to coordinate cross talk between signalling systems <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Christensen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Thus, the broad range of phenotypes resulting from mutations in primary cilium-associated proteins is likely due to cell type specific disturbances in a range of different signalling systems.</p>
      <p>We carried out an ENU mutagenesis screen to identify genes with critical functions during early embryonic development <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Caruana1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and have identified a mutant with a strong primary cilia phenotype. Linkage and candidate gene sequencing identified a missense mutation in the core IFT-A gene <italic>Ift140</italic>. This mutation results in mid-gestation lethality, exencephaly, craniofacial dysmorphism, skeletal malformation and mixed poly- and oligodactyly. A number of these defects can be attributed to disregulated Hedgehog signalling while other defects indicate involvement of additional signalling systems. Based on the identification of an <italic>Ift140</italic> mutation in this mouse model we also sequenced the human orthologue in a cohort of SRP and Jeune syndrome patients. We present the identification of a novel <italic>IFT140</italic> mutation in a case of Jeune syndrome. IFT140 has recently been implicated in Mainzer-Saldino and Jeune syndromes and conditional deletion in mice causes a polycystic kidney phenotype <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Schmidts1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Perrault1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Jonassen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Together these data confirm the validity of our mouse model of Jeune syndrome and will underpin further investigations into the mechanisms responsible for this condition.</p>

        <p>Linkage analysis in <italic>cauli</italic> identified a 7 Mb locus on chromosome 17 between markers rs3667809 and rs3684506 harbouring 218 genes. The <italic>Ift140</italic> gene was prioritised as a strong putative candidate due to the similarity of the <italic>cauli</italic> phenotype with other ciliopathy mouse models <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Cameron1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Patterson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Ashe1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Direct sequencing of the <italic>Ift140</italic> gene (NCBI RefSeq transcript NM_134126.3) identified a T to A substitution in exon 19 at position 2564 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; c.2564T&gt;A), resulting in an isoleucine to lysine amino acid change at position 855 of the protein (p.I855K).</p>
        <p>We utilized two algorithms designed to assess the potential effect of the isoleucine to lysine mutation on Ift140 function. The prediction output from PolyPhen-2 for the <italic>cauli</italic> Ift140 p.I855K mutation indicates a âpossibly damagingâ effect of the mutation on protein function, with a PSIC score of 0.503. SIFT prediction output denotes that the mutation is ânot toleratedâ, with a probability of 0.00, projected to be deleterious. Alternative amino acids found at this residue in other species (Threonine and Valine) were all predicted to be âtoleratedâ by this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This residue resides within a coiled-coil domain immediately upstream of the first tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of mouse IFT140, as predicted by the algorithms TPRpred and coils/pcoils <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Lupas1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/">http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/</ext-link>). Interestingly, secondary structure prediction using the PSIPRED algorithm <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Buchan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> indicates that the I855K mutation will not disrupt the Î±-helix in which it is embedded and therefore likely has a subtle impact on the overall structure of Ift140. Thus, the implications of the I855K change for mutant Ift140 function are unclear.</p>
        <p>Ultrastructural examination of the primary cilia of E10.5 <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> limb buds by SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g001">Figures 1F and G</xref>) revealed, that when present, cilia morphology was severely disrupted in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant embryos. Cilia in these mice were much broader and had a bulbous appearance, consistent with the accumulation of cargo at the tip due to a retrograde transport defect.</p>

<italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos exhibit multiple developmental defects</title>
        <p>Morphological differences between <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos were analysed using a number of techniques. Skeletal preparations of surviving E16.5 mutant embryos (nâ=â2) revealed severe craniofacial defects including failure of calvarial development, cervical vertebral fusion and agenesis or hypoplasia of many facial bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g002">Figures 2AâF</xref>). The exoccipital was fused to the first cervical vertebra. The shape of the exoccipital, bassioccipital and basisphenoid, appeared relatively normal. In contrast, the tympanic ring, alisphenoid and palatine were absent or rudimentary while the maxilla and premaxilla were hypoplastic and malpositioned due to the absence of components with which they would normally articulate. Examination of the thoracic skeleton revealed severe rib defects in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos when compared to the ordered structure seen in <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g002">Figures 2G and H</xref>). Although the normal complement of 13 ribs was present, anomalies of the ribs in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos include abnormal costovertebral articulations (the joints between the heads of each rib and the thoracic vertebrae), lateral bifurcation (branching) and thickened ossified protuberances (exostoses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). Due to the gestational lethality observed in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos further skeletal analysis was not possible. To further examine the origins of axial defects observed in skeletal preparations, somite patterning was analysed in E11.5 embryos by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation with the somatic marker <italic>myogenin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g002">Figures 2IâL</xref>). Consistent with the rib phenotype identified in older embryos, somites in E11.5 <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants were extremely disorganised with a bifid appearance, more evident in somites located in the rostral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g002">Figures 2J and L</xref>). This pattern is in stark contrast to the highly ordered somite pattern seen in <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g002">Figures 2I and K</xref>). Sections of wholemount embryos confirmed the disruption of normal <italic>myogenin</italic> staining and revealed the accumulation of blood within distended and irregularly located inter-somitic vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g002">Figures 2K and L</xref>). In addition to the obvious cranial neural tube defects, irregularities in the integrity of the axial neural tube were also revealed by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation analysis. <italic>Msx1</italic> marks the dorsal-most neural tube cell population and in E11.5 wildtype controls appears as a continuous line of staining, while in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants staining is irregular and discontinuous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g002">Figures 2M and N</xref>). Analysis of older embryos (E12.5) with a <italic>Sox9 in situ</italic> probe reveals the straight, aligned neural tube of <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g002">Figure 2O</xref>) in comparison to the irregular and extremely convoluted neural tube seen in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g002">Figure 2P</xref>).</p>

<italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant embryos begin to die at E13.5 during the stage when palatal fusion occurs. It is therefore difficult to determine if older mutants have a specific palate fusion defect or whether palate fusion is impeded due to a global disruption of growth preceding death. To investigate the impact of the <italic>cauli</italic> mutation on palatal development we performed histological analysis at E13.5 in healthy individuals. Coronal sections through the palatal shelves of <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos at E13.5 identified hypoplastic palatal shelves in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants, suggesting that palate fusion would be impeded in older mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g003">Figures 3A and B</xref>). Histological analysis of E13.5 <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos also highlighted numerous deformities of the internal organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g003">Figures 3CâF</xref>). Although the kidneys in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos appear grossly normal and comparable to <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> kidneys, an unusual cavity is evident around these structures, consistent with an accumulation of fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g003">Figures 3C and D</xref>).

        <title>Molecular signalling is disrupted in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> limb buds</title>
        <p>The Shh/Grem1/Fgf loop is a key signalling system responsible for controlling the outgrowth and patterning of the limb <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Benazet1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Components of this signalling system were analysed in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> limb buds by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Many members of the Shh/Grem1/Fgf signalling loop show disrupted expression between <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> control and <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant limb buds at E11.5â13.5 days of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Ectopic <italic>Shh</italic> expression is evident along the anterior margin of <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figures 4AâD</xref>). Expression of <italic>Ptch1</italic>, the <italic>Shh</italic> receptor and a <italic>Shh</italic>-responsive gene, is reduced posteriorly but expanded anteriorly across limb buds of <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants consistent with the presence of anterior Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figures 4EâH</xref>). The distinct expression pattern of the Bmp antagonist <italic>Grem1</italic> seen in <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> limb buds is altered in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figures 4IâL, Mâ² and Nâ²</xref>). <italic>Grem1</italic> expression appears weaker in mutants compared to controls but is expanded both anteriorly and posteriorly. <italic>Gli3</italic>, a major mediator of <italic>Shh</italic> signalling in the limb, is spatially restricted in the anterior portion of the fore- and hindlimb buds of <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figures 4MâP</xref>). Expression of <italic>dHand</italic>, which has a major role in limb patterning at least in part through a reciprocal regulatory interaction with <italic>Shh</italic>, is reduced posteriorly but expanded into the anterior limb bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figures 4QâT</xref>). <italic>Dusp6</italic> (<italic>Mkp3</italic>) is a downstream mediator of Fgf signalling. Expression of <italic>Dusp6</italic> is elevated across the anterioposterior axis but is anteriorly expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figures 4UâX</xref>). Consistent with this, while <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression is maintained in a distinct pattern outlining the AER at the distal tip of wildtype and <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> limb buds, expression is elevated in mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figures 4YâBâ²</xref>). In addition, <italic>Fgf8</italic> staining also indicates that in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants there is a disruption in the location of the AER at the border between the dorsal and ventral limb bud ectoderm relative to <italic>Ift140<sup>+/+</sup></italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figures 4Kâ² and Lâ²</xref>). <italic>Twist1</italic> has been demonstrated to have a central role in patterning the limbs and in particular has been shown to regulate <italic>Shh</italic> expression. Given the alteration in <italic>Shh</italic> expression in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants it was important to examine the level and location of <italic>Twist1</italic> expression. Interestingly, expression of <italic>Twist1</italic> in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants did not appear to undergo any substantial spatial alteration but did appear to be repressed in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figures 4Câ²âFâ²</xref>). Analysis of digit number was often difficult in younger embryos when overt signs of digit outgrowth where not yet apparent. <italic>Sox9</italic> expression highlights the presence of digital rays within the autopod revealing oligodactyly, proximal and distal branching of digits and polydactyly in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryo limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g004">Figures 4Gâ²âJâ²</xref>).</p>

        <p>Epithelial cadherin (E-cad) is a component of cell to cell adherens junctions and is required for the maintenance of tight intracellular junctions and oriented alignment of the cytoskeletal networks <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Knust1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Cytoskeletal filamentous actin (F-actin) also localises to these adhesion junctions and is important for regulating tight junction functions within and between cells <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Tsukita1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In wildtype epithelium, E-cad and F-actin closely co-localise at discrete cellular junctions clearly defining cell borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). However in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants adherens junctions become diffuse and dispersed in the mutant epithelium and E-cad and F-actin become partially delocalised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In a proportion of <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> epithelial cells, very high levels of E-cad can be seen in a thick band around the cell periphery and a network of E-cad and F-actin appears within the cytoplasm of many of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
        <p>The prediction that the I855K mutation is likely to have a modest impact on structure of Ift140 prompted us to investigate the impact of the <italic>cauli</italic> missense mutation on Ift140 function by examining the distribution of Ift140 in the primary cilia of limb bud epithelial cells. In wildtype epithelium Ift140 localises to the base and tip of the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). In <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant epithelium there were undetectable levels of Ift140 in the majority of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g005">Figure 5G</xref>) while in rare cases (â¼5%) a small amount of Ift140 could be seen in association with a mutant cilium. The lack of detectable Ift140 in mutant cilia prompted an investigation of the levels of Ift140 expressed by mutant cells. Western blot of protein extracted from whole E11.5 embryos indicated a reduction of Ift140 protein to approximately 85% of wildtype levels in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/+</sup></italic>embryos and approximately 30% of wildtype levels in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). We then examined the level of <italic>Ift140</italic> mRNA in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant and wildtype littermates by real-time PCR and observed an approximately 30% decrease in <italic>Ift140<sup>caul/caulii</sup></italic> embryos compared to wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). This data suggests that the <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> phenotype results from haploinsufficiency. To examine this hypothesis further, we generated <italic>Ift140</italic> null embryos. Western blot analysis confirmed the loss of Ift140 in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g005">Figure 5J</xref>) and analysis of <italic>Ift140<sup>â/â</sup></italic> embryos demonstrated an identical phenotype to that observed in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g005">Figures 5K and L</xref>) with the exception that <italic>Ift140<sup>â/â</sup></italic> embryos die at around E11.5, two days earlier than <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos. The similarity of the phenotypes in the two models supports the theory that the cauli phenotype results from haploinsufficiency.</p>

        <title>An <italic>IFT140</italic> mutation identified in a human patient with Jeune Syndrome</title>
        <p>Patient JS 1-1 was the product of the first pregnancy to healthy, first-cousin Sudanese parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). There was no extended family history of skeletal disorders. Short limbs (less than 5<sup>th</sup> centile for gestational age) and a short chest cage were noted on a third trimester ultrasound performed for growth assessment. No other abnormalities were observed at this time. The couple were counselled about a likely poor prognosis given the degree of thoracic hypoplasia. The child was delivered at 37 weeks of gestation with a birth head circumference of 37 cm (&gt;98<sup>th</sup> centile) and birth length of 48 cm (50<sup>th</sup> centile). The baby was in poor condition and required high frequency ventilation with high peak pressures (32 mm Mercury) due to pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension. On examination, the child had short square fingers and hands with five digits each, low nasal bridge, normal ears and palate, and hepatomegaly. A small muscular ventricular septal defect was found on echocardiography, and ultrasound of the enlarged liver showed normal hepatic texture. Normal liver and renal function was documented. The baby deteriorated, despite ventilation, and died aged 7 days. Post mortem radiography was obtained and revealed short long bones, with metaphyseal cupping, bowed femora and humeri, short ribs and thorax, trident appearance to the acetabular roofs, and advanced tarsal bone ossification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g006">Figures 6BâE</xref>). These features are considered typical of classic Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy) syndrome.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>There are now at least 12 clinical entities defined as ciliopathies <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Novarino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Given the ubiquity of the primary cilia and the number of signalling systems that make use of the cilium as a site in which to deploy receptors and other signalling components, the number of congenital and acquired conditions attributed to defects in cilia function is expected to rise. Mutations in <italic>IFT140</italic> have recently been identified in the skeletal ciliopathies Mainzer-Saldino (OMIM 266920) and Jeune (OMIM 208500) syndromes <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Schmidts1" ref-type="bibr">[this paper and 18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Perrault1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These mutations do not appear to cluster to a particular domain within the IFT140 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003746-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). While there is significant phenotypic overlap between these two syndromes, including radiological and renal findings, there are also significant differences, such as the existence of skin pigmentation anomalies in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome and polydactyly in Jeune syndrome. These phenotypic differences may be attributable to the impact of specific mutations on the function of IFT140 within the cilium. Mutation of <italic>IFT80</italic>, a component of the anterograde transport complex B, has also been demonstrated to cause Jeune syndrome <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Beales1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. IFT140 resides within the retrograde complex A, thereby suggesting substantially different consequences for the mechanisms of transport within the cilia. Further, mutations in additional IFT components including TTC21B/IFT139, DYNC2H1 and WDR19/IFT144 have been reported in association with Jeune syndrome <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Dagoneau1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Bredrup1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Schmidts2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Similarly, IFT-A complex mutations have been associated with Sensenbrenner syndrome, a condition with substantial clinical overlap with Jeune syndrome <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Bredrup1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This suggests that the common phenotypes resulting from each of these mutations are a result of defective cilia function rather than the specific mutation and indicates that this sub-group of skeletal ciliopathies may represent a spectrum of malformations rather than distinct syndromes. There are clear limitations to this view of skeletal ciliopathies since IFT-A complex mutations also lead to clinically distinct entities such as isolated nephronophthisis <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Bredrup1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. These complexities highlight the need to understand the developmental mechanisms underlying specific skeletal ciliopathies through study of appropriate animal models.</p>
      <p>The <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant mouse phenocopies many of the features of Jeune syndrome although the mouse phenotype is generally more extreme than in humans. The severe dysmorphology seen in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos is incompatible with continued development beyond mid-gestation in the majority of cases. Despite considerable efforts only a very small number of embryos have been obtained beyond E15.5 and in these cases severe skeletal malformation was observed. Skeletal phenotypes include severely disorganised ribs with extensive exostoses, vertebral and palatal defects and agenesis/hypoplasia of the craniofacial skeleton. These phenotypes are broadly consistent with those observed in Jeune syndrome cases including the case presented here. The range of phenotypes observed in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos is also broadly similar to that exhibited by other IFT-A mutant mice <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Ashe1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Liem1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> consistent with the concept that defective cilia function underpins the dysmorphology observed in each case.</p>
      <p>The severity of the <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant phenotype may also reflect the nature of the Ift140 mutation in this model. While the <italic>cauli</italic> strain arose following a missense mutation in <italic>Ift140</italic> we have observed a substantial reduction in both protein and RNA levels in mutant tissues. These data together with the identical phenotype observed in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> and <italic>Ift140<sup>â/â</sup></italic> embryos suggests that the <italic>cauli</italic> phenotype results from loss of Ift140 rather than altered function following amino acid substitution. Ift140 is an essential component of the IFT-A complex and retrograde transport will be severely compromised in its absence. Thus, it is likely that much of the developmentally important signalling normally mediated through the primary cilia is compromised in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos resulting in the devastating phenotype observed.</p>
      <p>A missense mutation would normally not be expected to result in RNA degradation and it is not clear why the <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutation results in loss of one third of the <italic>Ift140</italic> RNA population. One possible explanation for this observation is that the c2564T&gt;A mutation, which is 17 bp upstream of the 3â² splice site in exon 19, leads to an abnormal splicing event. It is likely that this would introduce a nonsense mutation downstream of the splicing event and the aberrantly spliced RNA would then be subject to nonsense mediated decay <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In support of this, the <italic>cauli</italic> mutation disrupts predicted overlapping SRSF5 and SRSF6 binding sites raising the possibility that an exonic splice enhancer (ESE) could be impacted <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. ESEs have been shown to be an integral part of both ubiquitous and alternate splicing mechanisms and exonic mutations disrupting them can result in exon-skipping and the generation of non-sense mutations <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Dietz1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Woolfe1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. There are a growing number of conditions attributable to mutation of an ESE <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Caputi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Eriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Moseley1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Boichard1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Cartegni1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The somites in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant embryos exhibit a dramatic loss of normal patterning, exhibiting both branching and irregular distribution. There does not appear to be an obvious loss of individual somites suggesting that segmentation of the lateral plate mesoderm proceeds relatively normally. However, irregular morphology of somites suggests that some aspects of somitogenesis, such as the mesenchymal to epithelial transition, may not be regulated appropriately. These somite patterning anomalies are likely responsible for the later rib defects in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> since the ribs are derived from the dermomyotome, a dorsolateral compartment of the somites <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In addition, the existence of bony protuberances emanating from many <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant ribs suggests a disregulation of osteogenesis. <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants exhibit elevated <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression within the flank indicating that rib exostoses may result from altered Hh signalling. Mutants are significantly growth retarded relative to littermates, which is most likely related to the mid-gestational demise of most mutants but may also be affected by reduced axial growth. <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants exhibit a convoluted neural tube, a phenotype thought to be caused by disruption of coordination between neural tube and axial elongation. Convergent extension defects have been linked to the disruption of primary cilia formation previously <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Ferrante1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Disrupted convergent extension during neurulation results in failure to narrow the mid-line thereby promoting neural tube closure defects <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Wallingford1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants exhibit both cranial and lumbar level neural tube closure defects and it will be interesting in future studies to examine neurulating <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> embryos for defects in convergent extension activities.</p>
      <p>The polydactylous phenotype observed in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants is similar to that reported in other cilia mutant mouse lines and is highly reminiscent of patterning defects exhibited by a number of Shh signalling mutants <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Cameron1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Liem1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Hui1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The primary cilia function downstream of Shh and IFT proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for all Shh signalling downstream of Smo <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Huangfu1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The relative distribution of Gli3 activator and Gli3 repressor across the anterior-posterior axis of the limb bud is a crucial determinant of autopod patterning <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Shh signalling inhibits the proteolytic cleavage of full length Gli3 into the shorter Gli3 repressor form which is both dependent on IFT and occurs within the primary cilia <xref rid="pgen.1003746-May1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Haycraft1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Liu3" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Loss of IFT results in reduced production of Gli3 repressor and consequently an increase in activation of genes such as <italic>Grem</italic> and <italic>dHand</italic>, whose expression is linked to Shh and Gli3 action. Our analysis demonstrates that expression of these genes is expanded into the anterior of the autopod in <italic>cauli</italic> embryos where Gli3 repressor normally predominates, indicating that a loss of Gli3 repression has occurred. The ectopic expression of <italic>Ptch1</italic> in the anterior limb bud is consistent with previously described IFT-A mutants <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Ashe1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and may result from Gli activator effects due to reduced Gli cleavage. An altered ratio of Gli3 repressor to the full-length activator form across the limb paddle results in production of a variable number of additional digits in a number of different mouse models <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Hui1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Sheth1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> and very likely underlies the polydactyly phenotype in cauli embryos.</p>
      <p>The expression of <italic>Shh</italic> is regulated by a complex network of transcription factors. Ectopic expression of <italic>dHand</italic> similar to that observed in the anterior limb bud of <italic>cauli</italic> embryos has been shown to be sufficient to induce ectopic <italic>Shh</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003746-Charite1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. In addition, Twist1 has been shown to repress <italic>Shh</italic> expression in the anterior limb bud and <italic>Twist1</italic> null mice have polydactyly <xref rid="pgen.1003746-ORourke1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. We observed a repression of <italic>Twist1</italic> in <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants and it is therefore possible that the reduction in <italic>Twist1</italic> levels is responsible for releasing the repression of Shh in the anterior limb bud. Further experimentation will be required to establish if this is the case and what role these changes have on autopod morphology.</p>
      <p>Polydactyly is observed in 100% of <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> hindlimbs and 50% of forelimbs. On the other hand, approximately one quarter of <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> forelimbs exhibit oligodactyly while it is never seen in the hindlimbs. The variable phenotype between fore- and hindlimbs is difficult to reconcile and suggests that inherent differences in signalling or temporal differences in developmental mechanisms between fore- and hindlimbs result in disparate outcomes. While the co-existence of both oligodactyly and polydactyly within forelimb autopod appears contradictory, especially in light of the highly penetrant polydactyly in the hindlimb autopod, it is important to note that digit number is a continuum and that the final outcome is the result of a complex interplay of transcriptional influences. Mixed forelimb oligo/polydactlyly is also observed in mice with reduced <italic>Twist1</italic> levels <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Krawchuk1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. <italic>Twist1</italic> is at the heart of a transcriptional network involved in the control of <italic>Fgf</italic> and <italic>Shh</italic> signalling within the developing limb <xref rid="pgen.1003746-ORourke1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Partial loss of <italic>Twist1</italic> results in reduced growth of the posterior limb bud and an expansion of the anterior limb bud due to ectopic anterior <italic>Shh</italic> expression <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Krawchuk1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. The ectopic anterior Shh also posteriorises anterior digits and the pattering of the resulting autopod is highly variable. It is unclear why there is incomplete penetrance of each of these outcomes but this may result from stochastic variation in the level of <italic>Shh</italic> and <italic>Fgf</italic> signalling. We observe anterior ectopic <italic>Shh</italic> and it is possible that a similar mechanism operates in the <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> forelimb. In particular, given the likelihood that the <italic>cauli Ift140</italic> mutation primarily disrupts IFT rather than any specific impact on Hh signalling, differences in the level of transport during development could provide significantly variable signalling outcomes. Defects in retrograde transport have been demonstrated to result in the accumulation of large amounts of IFT cargo along the length of the axoneme <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Pigino1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> which likely blocks even residual levels of transport. However, the primary cilium is disassembled and reformed anew during each cell cycle and it is possible that a higher level of signalling is achieved in the newly formed cilium and that this declines as the amount of stranded cargo increases. Since rapid cell proliferation is a hallmark of embryonic development, the opportunity for differences in the level of Hh signalling is high, especially with respect to generating differential outcomes between rapidly and slowly proliferating populations.</p>
      <p>Motile cilia function at the node, the embryonic organiser, and help determine cardiac left-right asymmetry by the generation of directional flow of signalling components <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Slough1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Looping of the heart tube is the first visible manifestation of the consequences of nodal signalling during breaking bilateral symmetry. IFT is required in both primary and motile cilia and as such it is likely that mutation of <italic>Ift140</italic> disrupts ciliary transport in the motile cilia of the node. The consequences of disrupted IFT for motility are unclear but 50% of mice with immotile nodal cilia are able to generate normal left-right asymmetry. This suggests a mechanism of signalling in nodal cilia that are normally motile that is independent of the directional flow of signalling components in establishing asymmetry <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. In addition, cilia have been found in developing heart tissue of E9.5âE12.5 mouse embryos <xref rid="pgen.1003746-IbaezTallon1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Shh generated by the pulmonary endoderm has been shown to be important in the specification of progenitors required for atrial and pulmonary trunk septation and disruption of this signalling results in both atrial and atrioventricular septation defects <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. It is therefore likely that mutation of <italic>Ift140</italic> impacts on cardiogenesis both during the looping phase and during later septation events.</p>
      <p>The early demise of <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant embryos precludes an analysis of a number of issues that are likely to result from <italic>Ift140</italic> mutation. A targeted deletion of <italic>Ift140</italic> in collecting ducts results in polycystic kidneys beginning around postnatal day 5 <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Jonassen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> consistent with the previous association of <italic>IFT140</italic> mutations with a range of kidney pathologies including cysts <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Perrault1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutant kidneys appear normal at E13.5 which excludes agenesis but is too early to assess more typically IFT-A associated defects. Similarly, the <italic>IFT140</italic> mutation described here in the patient with Jeune syndrome did not result in any obvious kidney dysfunction but this may be due to the early post-natal lethality of the condition in this case. An <italic>Ift144</italic> mutation has been shown to result in craniofacial defects such as cleft palate <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Ashe1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> but <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants die around the stage at which palate fusion occurs. Since <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants are often growth retarded relative to littermates it is likely that palatal shelf elevation and fusion could be delayed making it difficult to determine if <italic>Ift140</italic> mutation results in cleft palate. Similarly, mid-gestational lethality of <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mutants makes it difficult or impossible to study the impact of <italic>Ift140</italic> mutation on a range of other organ systems. Further analysis of these issues will require the use of conditional <italic>Ift140</italic> alleles such as the one presented here, the value of which has already been demonstrated in the study of kidney pathology <xref rid="pgen.1003746-Jonassen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The data presented here describes the first <italic>Ift140</italic> mouse model of Jeune syndrome. We support this with the identification of a recessively inherited <italic>IFT140</italic> mutation in a patient with Jeune syndrome. The difference in severity of the phenotype between mice and humans harbouring IFT140 mutations makes a direct comparison difficult. However, this unique ENU-induced <italic>Ift140<sup>cauli/cauli</sup></italic> mouse model will continue to provide insights into the mechanisms controlling normal limb and skeletal development and the congenital anomalies that arise when these signalling systems are perturbed. These insights will be invaluable in increasing our understanding of the origins of Jeune syndrome and related skeletal ciliopathies and provide a foundation for further analysis of the signalling systems regulated through the primary cilium.</p>
