      <abstract>
        <p>ATBF1/ZFHX3 is a large transcription factor that functions in development, tumorigenesis and other biological processes. ATBF1 is normally localized in the nucleus, but is often mislocalized in the cytoplasm in cancer cells. The mechanism underlying the mislocalization of ATBF1 is unknown. In this study, we analyzed the nuclear localization of ATBF1, and found that ectopically expressed ATBF1 formed nuclear body (NB)-like dots in the nucleus, some of which indeed physically associated with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) NBs. We also defined a 3-amino acid motif, KRK<sup>2615-2617</sup>, as the nuclear localization signal (NLS) for ATBF1. Interestingly, diffusely distributed nuclear SUMO1 proteins were sequestered into ATBF1 dots, which could be related to ATBF1's physical association with PML NBs, known SUMOylation hotspots. Furthermore, ATBF1 itself was SUMOylated. ATBF1 SUMOylation occurred at more than 3 lysine residues including K<sup>2349</sup>, K<sup>2806</sup> and K<sup>3258</sup> and was nuclear specific. Finally, the PIAS3 SUMO1 E3 ligase, which interacts with ATBF1 directly, diminished rather than enhanced ATBF1 SUMOylation, preventing the co-localization of ATBF1 with SUMO1 in the nucleus. These findings suggest that nuclear localization and SUMOylation are important for the transcription factor function of ATBF1, and that ATBF1 could cooperate with PML NBs to regulate protein SUMOylation in different biological processes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The AT-motif binding factor 1/zinc finger homeobox 3 (ATBF1/ZFHX3) is a 404-kD transcription factor containing four homeodomains and multiple zinc-finger motifs <xref rid="pone.0092746-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It functions in multiple biological processes including embryonic development <xref rid="pone.0092746-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, mammary gland development <xref rid="pone.0092746-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, neuronal differentiation <xref rid="pone.0092746-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0092746-Ishii1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and neuronal death in response to DNA damage or oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0092746-Jung2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. For example, loss of a single allele of the <italic>Atbf1</italic> gene in mice results in severe preweaning mortality and partial embryonic lethality <xref rid="pone.0092746-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. ATBF1 abnormalities play a role in multiple human diseases including tumorigenesis <xref rid="pone.0092746-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Sun3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, Kawasaki disease (KD), and atrial fibrosis <xref rid="pone.0092746-Burgner1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0092746-Gudbjartsson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. For example, <italic>ATBF1</italic> is the second most frequently mutated gene in human prostate cancer <xref rid="pone.0092746-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Grasso1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, its expression is frequently reduced in multiple types of cancers <xref rid="pone.0092746-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0092746-Mabuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and tissue-specific deletion of <italic>Atbf1</italic> in mouse prostates causes neoplastic alterations (Sun et al., manuscript submitted).</p>
      <p>ATBF1 was originally identified as a transcriptional repressor of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) <xref rid="pone.0092746-Morinaga1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and a number of studies have demonstrated that ATBF1 interacts with other transcription factors to regulate the transcription of many genes <xref rid="pone.0092746-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, including those involved in enterocyte and myogenic differentiation and early development of the pituitary gland <xref rid="pone.0092746-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0092746-Kataoka1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and those that encode for membrane and secretory proteins (Sun et al., manuscript submitted). As expected for a transcription factor, ATBF1 is localized in the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0092746-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Sun3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Mabuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In human breast, gastric, skin, head and neck and possibly other cancers however, ATBF1 is often mislocalized to the cytoplasm, and the mislocalization is associated with histopathologic progression and worse patient survival <xref rid="pone.0092746-Sun3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Mabuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A higher nuclear ATBF1 level was also associated with lower expression of oncogenic MUC5AC and a better prognosis in gastric cancer <xref rid="pone.0092746-Kocer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Mori1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While a previous study has demonstrated that ATBF1 translocates to the nucleus with RUNX3 in response to TGFÎ² stimulation in gastric cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0092746-Mabuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the mechanisms controlling the cellular localization of ATBF1 remain to be illustrated, and whether posttranslational modifications of ATBF1 depend on or determine its nuclear localization is unknown. While ATBF1 can be phosphorylated at multiple serine residues during DNA damage response or brain development <xref rid="pone.0092746-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and modified by polyubiquitination at lysines <xref rid="pone.0092746-Dong2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, both of which affect ATBF1 stability, it is unknown whether ATBF1 undergoes other posttranslational modifications.</p>
      <p>By characterizing the nuclear localization of ATBF1 in this study, we found that ectopically expressed ATBF1 formed nuclear body (NB)-like dots in the nucleus of epithelial cells, and its nuclear localization was mediated by a 3-amino acid motif. Interestingly, ATBF1 dots were associated with one of the most common NBs seen in mammalian cells, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) NBs. Possibly related to the SUMOylation function of PML NBs, ATBF1 sequestered diffusely distributed SUMO1 into ATBF1 dots, and the sequestration was interrupted by PIAS3, an ATBF1-interacting SUMOylation E3 ligase. Furthermore, ATBF1 itself was also SUMOylated in the nucleus at more than 3 lysine residues, and ATBF1 SUMOylation was unexpectedly negatively affected by PIAS3.</p>

        <title>ATBF1 forms nuclear body (NB)-like dots in the nucleus</title>
        <p>To characterize the nuclear localization of ATBF1 in epithelial cells, we expressed EGFP-fused ATBF1 in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells, which express only scarce endogenous ATBF1, and detected EGFP-ATBF1 protein by microscopy. Whereas EGFP alone was diffusely distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, EGFP-ATBF1 was only detected in the nucleus, which was visualized by DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Surprisingly, EGFP-ATBF1 proteins massed to form nuclear body-like dots (ATBF1 dots) in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To rule out an effect of EGFP fusion on ATBF1 localization, we also expressed HA-tagged ATBF1 in 22Rv1 cells, and found the same result: nuclear ATBF1 formed dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

Deletion of AA 2238-2664 from the middle region abolished its nuclear localization (data not shown), and the EGFP-fused fragment AA2238-2664 localized into the nucleus, indicating that the NLS is located within AA2238-2664 of ATBF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Further deletions within the EGFP-ATBF1-(AA2238-2664) fragment and localization analyses demonstrated that the NLS is located in a small 27-residue fragment â AA2611-2637, because deletion of this 27-AA fragment attenuated the nuclear localization of ATBF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

We therefore mutated these three amino acids (KRK<sup>2615â2617</sup>) into alanines (AAA<sup>2615â2617</sup>), and examined whether the mutation affects ATBF1's nuclear localization. This mutation indeed prevented both EGFP-fused ATBF1 and HA-tagged ATBF1 from entering the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), confirming that the KRK<sup>2615â2617</sup> sequence is the NLS for ATBF1.</p>

        <title>Association of nuclear ATBF1 with PML nuclear bodies (NBs)</title>

Whereas ATBF1 dots did not show any association with Cajal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), some ATBF1 dots either partially overlapped or were closely associated with PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

        <title>ATBF1 associates with and alters the distribution of SUMO1 in the nucleus</title>
        <p>PML nuclear bodies (NBs) are nuclear matrix domains that serve as a scaffold for PML-NB-interacting proteins to undergo posttranslational modifications <xref rid="pone.0092746-LallemandBreitenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-rand1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A large number of proteins that interact with PML NBs have been identified. The most common feature shared among these partner proteins is their SUMOylation, although other posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation and acetylation also occur <xref rid="pone.0092746-LallemandBreitenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0092746-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, an E3 ligase of SUMOylation, the protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3), was previously shown to directly interact with ATBF1 <xref rid="pone.0092746-Nojiri1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. We therefore tested whether ATBF1 is associated with SUMO1 or has any effect on SUMO1 distribution. We transfected expression plasmids for EGFP-fused ATBF1 and/or SUMO1 into 22Rv1 cells, and visualized the proteins by immunofluorescent microscopy. Without the co-expression of ATBF1, SUMO1 protein was diffusely distributed in the nucleus and few speckles of SUMO1 were visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). When EGFP-ATBF1 was co-expressed however, SUMO1 proteins were highly concentrated into a number of speckles in the nucleus, and surprisingly, these SUMO1 speckles overlapped with ATBF1 dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). When the SUMOylation-deficient form of SUMO1, SUMO1-GA, was co-expressed, which is unable to conjugate to target proteins due to the mutation, SUMO1 failed to form speckles and co-localize with ATBF1 dots, although the mutant SUMO1-GA alone was still diffusely distributed in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results suggest that ATBF1 interacts with SUMO1 to alter its nuclear distribution.</p>

EGFP-fused SUMO1 expression plasmid, along with the expression vector pEGFP-C3 as the control, was co-transfected into 22Rv1 cells with HA-tagged ATBF1 expression plasmid, and cell lysates were then subjected to IB to determine whether SUMO1 expression can shift the ATBF1 band in a gel, which is an indicator of protein SUMOylation.

        <p>We then performed co-IP combined with IB to determine whether ATBF1 is indeed SUMOylated. HA-tagged sense- or anti-sense-ATBF1 was co-transfected with the plasmid pcSUMO1, which expresses full length SUMO1 without any tag. ATBF1 was pulled down by co-IP with anti-HA antibody beads, and then subjected to IB with either anti-HA or anti-SUMO antibody. Both SUMO1 and ATBF1 signals were detected at the same position in the gel (Lane 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), indicating the SUMOylation of ATBF1. Even in the sample without the co-transfection of SUMO1 plasmid, a faint band was also detected by the anti-SUMO1 antibody at the ATBF1 location in the gel, suggesting that ATBF1 SUMOylation occurs with endogenous SUMO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then attempted to identify the amino acids in ATBF1 that are SUMOylated. SUMOylation usually occurs at the lysine residue(s) of target proteins, and ATBF1 protein contains 225 lysines.

      <p>ATBF1 concentrates to form nuclear body-like dots in the nucleus, and its nuclear localization is mediated by a 3-AA motif KRK<sup>2615â2617</sup>. As a transcription factor, ATBF1 is expected to be located in the nucleus to function, and its nuclear localization has been confirmed in both cultured cells and human tissues <xref rid="pone.0092746-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Sun3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.

Nuclear localization is expected to be important for ATBF1 function because mislocalization of ATBF1 into the cytoplasm occurs in cancer cells and is associated with worse survival in cancer patients <xref rid="pone.0092746-Sun3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Mabuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Mori1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Whereas in gastric cancer cells ATBF1 is located in the cytoplasm and can be tanslocated into the nucleus with RUNX3 upon TGFÎ² activation <xref rid="pone.0092746-Mabuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we found that ectopically expressed ATBF1 is localized in the nucleus in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) as in normal cells. Interestingly, ATBF1 formed nuclear body-like protein dots in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In addition, we identified a 3-AA motif, Lys-Arg-Lys at residues 2615â2617 (KRK<sup>2615â2617</sup>) as the NLS that mediates the nuclear localization of ATBF1, because mutations of these residues prevented ATBF1 from entering the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The sequence of ATBF1's NLS does not match any previously predicted NLS sequences <xref rid="pone.0092746-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ATBF1 dots associate with PML NBs, and this association may be involved in protein SUMOylation. The two most common NBs in mammalian cells are PML NBs and Cajal bodies <xref rid="pone.0092746-Zimber1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-LallemandBreitenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Whereas the NB-like ATBF1 dots had no detectable association with Cajal bodies, they were associated with PML NBs, since some ATBF1 dots overlapped with some PML NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Although definitive evidence is lacking at this time, the association of ATBF1 dots with PML NBs could have functional implications. For example, PML NBs function as nuclear SUMOylation hotspots, and a large number of PML-NB-interacting proteins are also directly SUMOylated, which is the most common feature among these proteins <xref rid="pone.0092746-LallemandBreitenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0092746-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-VanDamme1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In addition, PML NBs themselves are also regulated by SUMOylation at two levels. Firstly, PML is directly SUMOylated at multiple lysine residues, and SUMOylation is essential for the formation of PML NBs <xref rid="pone.0092746-rand1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Delaune1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Evdokimov1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Secondly, PML also has a SUMO binding motif that is independent of its SUMOylation sites but is also necessary for PML NB formation <xref rid="pone.0092746-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. On the other hand, ATBF1 expression induced the aggregation of SUMO1 into ATBF1 dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), while ATBF1 did not appear to directly interact with SUMO1 (data not shown) and the PIAS3 SUMO E3 ligase altered the association between ATBF1 dots and SUMO1 dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that ATBF1 could also play a role in the SUMOylation of other proteins. The fact that ATBF1 itself was SUMOylated at multiple lysine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g002">Fig. 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g004">4</xref>) could also be related to the role of ATBF1 in the regulation of protein SUMOylation, as seen for PML NBs. The association of ATBF1 dots with PML NBs thus suggests that ATBF1 could cooperate with PML NBs to regulate protein SUMOylation. While this remains to be tested, there are published studies that appear to support this possibility. For example, ATBF1 could cooperate with PML NBs to regulate activities of the Myb oncoprotein, because Myb is subjected to SUMOylation for activity regulation, it localizes to PML NBs via direct interaction with PML, and it also directly interacts with ATBF1 to regulate its activity <xref rid="pone.0092746-Kaspar1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Dahle1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. As a large protein that associates with PML NBs, ATBF1 could be part of the PML NB scaffold for protein SUMOylation to occur. It should thus be meaningful to directly test whether ATBF1 cooperates with PML NBs to regulate protein SUMOylation and activities.</p>
      <p>ATBF1 itself is SUMOylated at multiple lysine residues. As a large transcription factor (â¼404 kD), it is anticipated that ATBF1 undergoes different types of post-translational modifications. However, only phosphorylation of several serine residues and ubiquitination have been reported thus far for ATBF1 <xref rid="pone.0092746-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092746-Dong2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Our findings in this study indicate that ATBF1 is covalently modified by SUMO1 at multiple lysine residues, including K<sup>2349</sup>, K<sup>2806</sup> and K<sup>3258</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g002">Fig. 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g004">4</xref>). We applied three approaches to confirm the SUMOylation of ATBF1, including co-localization of ATBF1 and SUMO1 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), detection of SUMO1-conjugated ATBF1 by IB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), and identification of multiple SUMOylation sites in the ATBF1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). While two of the three SUMOylation sites, K<sup>2806</sup> and K<sup>3258</sup>, are in the typical SUMOylation consensus motif (ÏKXE), one (K<sup>2349</sup>) is not. A growing number of proteins have been identified that are SUMOylated at non-consensus sequences, including SMAD4, CREB, PCNA and Daxx <xref rid="pone.0092746-Jang1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0092746-Hoege1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, which causes difficulties in identifying SUMOylation sites in large proteins such as ATBF1. There is at least another SUMOylation site in the F4 fragment of ATBF1, but we were unable to identify this site using the same approaches used for the other sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), because the F4 fragment contained 29 lysine residues, none of which was located in the consensus SUMOylation motif.</p>
      <p>SUMOylation of ATBF1 is dependent on its nuclear localization, because interruption of its nuclear localization prevented its SUMOylation in cells but had no effect on its SUMOylation in a cell-free system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Considering that ATBF1 associates with PML NBs and that PML NBs play an important role in protein SUMOylation, it is possible that PML NBs also mediate the SUMOylation of ATBF1, but the mechanism of ATBF1 SUMOylation is currently unknown. The PIAS3 SUMOylation E3 ligase was previously shown to interact with ATBF1 <xref rid="pone.0092746-Nojiri1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, but PIAS3 interrupted rather than enhanced ATBF1 SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092746-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that PIAS3 is not the SUMO1 E3 ligase that mediates ATBF1 SUMOylation. The SUMO E3 ligase for ATBF1 SUMOylation, if it exists, is currently unknown.</p>
      <p>ATBF1 plays a role in multiple biological processes such as gene transcription, development and tumorigenesis. It is certainly possible that SUMOylation of ATBF1 is important for its functions in these processes, as suggested by the fact that ATBF1 SUMOylation depended on its nuclear localization and that ATBF1 is often mislocalized into the cytoplasm in cancer cells, although the functional consequence of ATBF1 SUMOylation in different processes is unknown at this time. SUMOylation affects diverse aspects of a target protein, including its cellular localization, its interactions with other proteins, and its protein stability. At present, it is technically challenging to evaluate the effects of ATBF1 SUMOylation on its functions, because there is neither an efficient experimental system for functional studies of ATBF1 nor a SUMOylation-deficient mutant of ATBF1 for such studies.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have characterized the nuclear localization and SUMOylation of ATBF1 in epithelial cells using biochemical approaches and cellular microscopy. In addition to confirming the nuclear localization of ATBF1 in epithelial cells, we identified the NLS for ATBF1, and found that ATBF1 concentrated to form nuclear body-like dots, some of which overlapped or closely associated with PML NBs. Possibly relating to the commonly recognized SUMOylation function of PML NBs, ATBF1 sequestered SUMO1 into the ATBF1 dots, altering the distribution of SUMO1 in the nucleus. Interestingly, ATBF1 itself was SUMOylated at more than three lysine residues, and the SUMOylation depended on its nuclear localization. Finally, the PIAS3 SUMO1 E3 ligase, which directly interacts with ATBF1, diminished rather than enhanced ATBF1 SUMOylation and prevented the co-localization of ATBF1 with SUMO1 in the nucleus. Taken together, our findings suggest that SUMOylation in the nucleus is important for ATBF1 functions, and that ATBF1 could cooperate with PML NBs to regulate protein SUMOylation in different biological processes.</p>
