      <abstract>
        <p>A feedback control mechanism, or cell cycle checkpoint, delays the onset of anaphase until all the chromosomes are correctly aligned on the mitotic spindle. Previously, we showed that the murine homologue of Bub1 is not only required for checkpoint response to spindle damage, but also restrains progression through a normal mitosis (Taylor, S.S., and F. McKeon. 1997. <italic>Cell</italic>. 89:727â735). Here, we describe the identification of a human homologue of Bub3, a 37-kD protein with four WD repeats. Like Bub1, Bub3 localizes to kinetochores before chromosome alignment. In addition, Bub3 and Bub1 interact in mammalian cells. Deletion mapping was used to identify the domain of Bub1 required for binding Bub3. Significantly, this same domain is required for kinetochore localization of Bub1, suggesting that the role of Bub3 is to localize Bub1 to the kinetochore, thereby activating the checkpoint in response to unattached kinetochores. The identification of a human Mad3/Bub1-related protein kinase, hBubR1, which can also bind Bub3 in mammalian cells, is described. Ectopically expressed hBubR1 also localizes to kinetochores during prometaphase, but only when hBub3 is overexpressed. We discuss the implications of the common interaction between Bub1 and hBubR1 with hBub3 for checkpoint control.</p>

  <body>
    <p>B<sc>efore</sc> cell division, the replicated genome must be accurately segregated to ensure the continued growth and development of the daughter cells. To maintain the fidelity of chromosome segregation, eukaryotes have evolved a feedback control mechanism, often referred to as a cell cycle checkpoint (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hartwell and Weinert, 1989</xref>), which delays the onset of anaphase until all the chromosomes are correctly aligned on the microtubule spindle apparatus.</p>
    <p>Evidence that the mitotic checkpoint monitors chromosome alignment has been mounting for many years. It has long been appreciated that insect spermatocytes remain blocked at the first meiotic metaphase if one or more chromosomes are not correctly attached to the meiotic spindle (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Callan and Jacobs, 1957</xref>). In addition, analyses of mitotic newt heart cells suggested that the arrival of the last kinetochore at the metaphase plate may play a critical role in regulating anaphase onset (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zirkle, 1970<italic>a</italic>
</xref>,<italic>b</italic>).</p>
    <p>More recently, it has been shown that anaphase is inhibited until all the chromosomes achieve bipolar attachments (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rieder et al., 1994</xref>) and that unattached kinetochores generate the inhibitory signal (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rieder et al., 1995</xref>). Micromanipulation experiments with insect spermatocytes suggest that this inhibitory signal is generated by tension-sensitive kinases and/or phosphatases located at the kinetochore (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nicklas, 1997</xref>). When a chromosome is not attached to the spindle, or only mono-oriented, the kinetochores are not under tension. In the absence of tension, kinetochores express the 3F3/2 phosphoepitope, suggesting that a kinase is active, and anaphase is delayed (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gorbsky and Ricketts, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li and Nicklas, 1995</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Nicklas et al., 1995</xref>). Upon achieving a bipolar attachment, kinetochores experience tension due to opposing spindle forces. When under tension, kinetochores lack the 3F3/2 phosphoepitope, suggesting a loss of kinase activity, and anaphase ensues. Significantly, microinjection of the 3F3/2 antibody into living cells prevents kinetochore dephosphorylation and delays the onset of anaphase (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Campbell and Gorbsky, 1995</xref>).</p>
    <p>Although the evidence implicating tension as the regulator of anaphase onset in insect spermatocytes is compelling (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nicklas, 1997</xref>), it is not known whether tension is the key factor in other cell types. Furthermore, it is not known whether the effect of tension is direct. Tension at the kinetochore is known to stabilize microtubule attachment (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Nicklas and Koch, 1969</xref>) and hence microtubule attachment may be the event that directly regulates anaphase. Indeed, in mitotic PtK<sub>1</sub> cells, laser ablation of the distal, unattached kinetochore of a mono-oriented chromosome resulted in a timely anaphase, suggesting that microtubule attachment, not tension, regulates anaphase (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rieder et al., 1995</xref>). However, it has been suggested that, in these irradiated cells, the remaining attached kinetochore is still under tension due to polar ejection forces (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rieder et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
    <p>Formal demonstration that the onset of anaphase is regulated by a cell cycle checkpoint, as defined by <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hartwell and Weinert (1989)</xref>, came with the identification of several <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mutants that failed to undergo mitotic arrest in response to spindle damage (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hoyt et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li and Murray, 1991</xref>). Genetic screens identified <italic>BUB 1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, and <italic>3</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hoyt et al., 1991</xref>) and <italic>MAD 1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, and <italic>3</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li and Murray, 1991</xref>) as necessary for the preanaphase delay in response to spindle damage. Mad1, a phosphoprotein that can bind Mad2, is hyperphosphorylated in response to spindle damage (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hardwick and Murray, 1995</xref>). This phosphorylation appears to be carried out by Mps1 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hardwick et al., 1996</xref>), a protein kinase required for spindle pole body duplication and checkpoint response to spindle damage (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Weiss and Winey, 1996</xref>). Bub1 is a protein kinase that can bind and phosphorylate Bub3 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Farr and Hoyt, 1998</xref>), and appears to act upstream of Mad1 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hardwick and Murray, 1995</xref>). Both Mad3, which shares homology with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal, noncatalytic domain of Bub1, and Bub2 appear to act downstream of Mad1 phosphorylation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hardwick and Murray, 1995</xref>).</p>
    <p>One of the downstream targets of the mitotic checkpoint is likely to be the anaphase-promoting complex (APC)<sup>1</sup> or cyclosome (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Irniger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Sudakin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Tugendreich et al., 1995</xref>). Activation of APC is required to initiate both the onset of anaphase, by degrading inhibitors of sister chromatid separation such as Pds1 and Cut2 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cohen-Fix et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Funabiki et al., 1996</xref>), and the exit from mitosis, by degrading mitotic cyclins and the spindle component, Ase1 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Juang et al., 1997</xref>). Recently, Mad2 has been shown to interact with APC (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1998</xref>) and repress its activity by inhibiting cdc20, an APC activator (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Visintin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1998</xref>). Although these observations link the checkpoint pathway to the cell cycle machinery that initiates anaphase, the mechanism by which Mad2 inhibits APC remains unclear. In addition, how spindle events regulate Mad2 activity remains uncertain.</p>
    <p>The <italic>BUB</italic> and <italic>MAD</italic> genes are also required for the mitotic delay induced by mutations in centromeric DNA sequences and kinetochore proteins (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Burke, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Pangilinan and Spencer, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Wells and Murray, 1996</xref>). These observations suggested that the Mad and Bub proteins may play a role in the kinetochore attachment checkpoint described in larger eukaryotes. Additional support for this hypothesis came with the identification of vertebrate homologues of Mad2 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li and Benezra, 1996</xref>), which localize to kinetochores of chromosomes before alignment on the metaphase spindle. Indeed, XMad2 is required to maintain MPF activity in a <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract system that reconstitutes the mitotic checkpoint (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1996</xref>), and electroporation of anti-HsMad2 antibodies into HeLa cells inhibited mitotic arrest in response to spindle disruption (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li and Benezra, 1996</xref>).</p>
    <p>The murine homologue of Bub1 also localizes to the kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>). Expression of a dominant-negative mBub1 mutant in HeLa cells compromised their ability to maintain mitotic arrest in response to spindle damage. In addition, disrupting Bub1 function accelerated passage through a normal mitosis, suggesting that Bub1 monitors the interactions between microtubules and kinetochores during every cell cycle (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>). To further characterize how Bub1 activity regulates mitotic progression, we set out to analyze proteins that interact with Bub1. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Bub3 binds to and is a substrate of Bub1 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 1994</xref>). Here we describe the identification of a human homologue of Bub3, which appears to be required for kinetochore localization of Bub1. In addition, we describe a human protein that shares significant homology with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of Mad3 from budding yeast (ScMad3). However, unlike ScMad3, this human protein has a COOH-terminal extension that contains a protein kinase domain, suggesting that it is a Bub1-related protein. This human Mad3/Bub1-related protein, hBubR1, also binds to hBub3 and can localize to kinetochores during prometaphase. The implications of the common interaction between Bub1 and BubR1 with Bub3 are discussed.</p>

Based on the EST sequences, the following oligonucleotides were designed and used to screen pools of cDNAs by PCR: hBub3 Fwd 5â² GTAACAGCTGCTGGGATTACACATGGC 3â²(This is a vector- derived sequence and was used in a vector-insert PCR screen); hBub3 Rvs 5â² CTCCCTGCGCTGCTGCACGTAACC 3â²; hBubR1 Fwd 5â² TAGCTC- CGAGGGCAGGTTGC 3â²; hBubR1 Rvs 5â² CATAAACGCCCTAAT- TTAAGCCAGAG 3â²; hBub1 Fwd 5â²ACGTATGGGGCCAAGTGT- AGG 3â²; hBub1 Rvs 5â² GTCTGTTACTGTCTGGGCTTTCAA 3â². Positive subpools were screened by hybridization using either the ESTs (hBub3 and hBub1) or the PCR product (hBubR1) as probes. cDNAs were constructed using the SuperScript plasmid system for cDNA synthesis and plasmid cloning kit (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO BRL</named-content>, Gaithersburg, MD). mRNA was purified from the U2OS osteosarcoma cell line using the FastTrack Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). PCR reactions and filter hybridizations were done according to standard methods (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sambrook et al., 1989</xref>). cDNA inserts were sequenced on both strands using an ABI 373A sequencer (BioPolymers Facility, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Sequence alignments were performed using the MegAlign software (DNAStar, Madison, WI). The expression vectors were constructed by directly subcloning cDNA fragments and/or PCR amplification using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All the expression vectors are based on pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen), modified to include the 5â² untranslated sequence from the human lamin A cDNA and NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal Myc, green fluorescent protein, or GST tags. Mutagenesis of hBub3 was performed using the GeneEditor kit (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="promega">Promega Corp.</named-content>, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The hBub3ÎVAVE mutant was constructed using the following oligonucleotide: 5â² TCT ATT GAA GGC CGA AGA TCT TAT TTG GAC CCA AGC 3â², which results in a substitution of four amino acids (217 VAVE 220) with two amino acids (217 RS 218), thus introducing a novel BglII restriction site.</p>

All media reagents were from <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO BRL</named-content> unless stated otherwise. Transient transfections for immunofluorescence analysis were performed on 18-mm coverslips using the calcium phosphate method as described (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Heald et al., 1993</xref>). Transient transfections for purification of GST-hBub3 complexes were performed using Lipofectamine (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO BRL</named-content>). Briefly, 1.6 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> BHK cells were plated in 60-mm dishes, cultured for 24 h, and then washed three times with serum-free media. 1 Î¼g of DNA, purified by two rounds of cesium chloride/ethidium bromide density centrifugation, was complexed with 16 Î¼g of Lipofectamine in serum-free media at room temperature for 20 min and then added to the cells in a final volume of 1 ml of serum-free media for 16 h.

        <p>24 h after transfection, BHK cells were fixed for 5 min in 1% formaldehyde, freshly diluted from a 37% stock (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4). After fixation, cells were washed three times in PBST (PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100) and then blocked in PBST plus 5% nonfat dried milk (NFDM) for 30 min. To detect Myc-tagged proteins, the cells were incubated with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody diluted 1:500 in PBST plus 5% NFDM for 30 min. After three washes in PBST, the cells were incubated with a Cy3-conjugated donkey antiâmouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) diluted 1:500 in PBST plus 5% NFDM for 30 min. After three washes in PBST the chromatin was stained for 1 min with Hoechst 33258 at 1 Î¼g/ml in PBST. The coverslips were then inverted on microscope slides using 90% glycerol plus 10% 0.2M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, as mounting media. Kinetochores were labeled using a CREST autoimmune serum diluted 1:1,000 and a Cy3-conjugated donkey antiâhuman secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.).

To purify GSTâhBub3 complexes, 20 Î¼l of glutathione Sepharose beads (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.</named-content>, Piscataway, NJ), equilibrated in lysis buffer and resuspended as a 50% slurry, were added to the lysates and incubated at 4Â°C for 30 min. After five washes in lysis buffer, proteins were eluted off the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="millipore">Millipore Corp.</named-content>, Waters Chromatography, Milford, MA). GSTâhBub3 and Myc-tagged proteins were then labeled using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum containing both anti-GST and anti-Myc antibodies diluted at 1:1,000 in TBST (50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) plus 5% NFDM for 1 h at room temperature.

        <title>Structural Comparison of Bub3 Homologues</title>
        <p>A screen of EST databases identified a partial human cDNA with homology to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein Bub3 (ScBub3) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hoyt et al., 1991</xref>). We isolated a corresponding full-length human cDNA (hBub3, EMBL/GenBank/ DDBJ accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF053304">AF053304</ext-link>) with a 984-bp open reading frame encoding a 328-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of â¼37 kD. hBub3 shares â¼34% identity and 69% similarity with ScBub3 throughout the entire protein. Both ScBub3 and hBub3 contain four WD repeats, three in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region and one towards the COOH terminus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). hBub3 also shares significant homology with the Rae1 proteins from human (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bharathi et al., 1997</xref>), <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 1996</xref>) and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1995</xref>), which have been implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport. An alignment of the Bub3 and Rae1 homologues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) indicates that the Bub3 and Rae1 proteins represent two separate families. </p>

        <title>hBub3 Localizes to Kinetochores before Chromosome Alignment</title>
        <p>To determine the subcellular localization of hBub3, the DNA corresponding to the open reading frame was cloned into a GFP-tagged expression vector and transiently transfected into BHK cells. After fixation, chromatin was stained with Hoechst dye and kinetochores labeled with CREST autoantibodies. During interphase, the GFP fluorescence was diffusely localized in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). During prophase and prometaphase, GFP fluorescence was concentrated in pairs of foci that colocalized with the CREST antigens (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). During metaphase and anaphase, the GFP fluorescence was distributed throughout the cell, whereas the CREST antigens remained associated with the chromatin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). Based on these observations, we conclude that hBub3 localizes to kinetochores during prophase and prometaphase, but not during and after metaphase. This kinetochore localization pattern is very similar to that of murine Bub1 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>). </p>

        <title>A Domain in the NH<sub>2 </sub>Terminus of mBub1 Binds hBub3</title>
        <p>In interphase cells, ectopically expressed mBub1 is predominately cytoplasmic (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>) whereas hBub3 is nuclear (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). These different localization patterns provided an opportunity to test whether Bub3 and Bub1 associate in mammalian cells. We reasoned that if these two proteins interacted, the localization pattern of one or the other may be altered when coexpressed. The top row in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>A</italic> shows two cells expressing hBub3, only one of which is expressing mBub1. In the cell not expressing mBub1, hBub3 is exclusively nuclear. However, in the cell expressing mBub1, hBub3 localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus. This cytoplasmic sequestration of hBub3 was dependent on the amount of mBub1 cotransfected, but was not observed when a control plasmid was cotransfected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). </p>
        <p>To determine which domain of mBub1 was responsible for the cytoplasmic sequestration of hBub3, a series of mBub1 deletion mutants were cotransfected with hBub3. When the three major subdomains of mBub1 were assayed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>), only the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain (amino acids 1â331) was capable of sequestering hBub3 in the cytoplasm in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). Further deletion mapping of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of mBub1 identified a region within amino acids 201â300 as being required for localizing hBub3 in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). Closer inspection of the amino acid sequence in this region identified a domain that shows significant homology between the Bub1 proteins from mouse, human, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). This 37-amino acid region of mBub1 shares â¼36% identity with the corresponding domain in ScBub1. To test whether this domain is required for the Bub1/Bub3 interaction, we constructed a mutant lacking this region (NH<sub>2</sub>-mBub1[400Î38]). This deletion abolished the ability of the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of mBub1 to sequester hBub3 in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). </p>
        <p>To test whether the cytoplasmic sequestration of hBub3 reflects a physical interaction between the two proteins, hBub3 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in BHK cells along with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 400 amino acids of mBub1 (NH<sub>2</sub>-mBub1[400]). GST-hBub3 was then purified from cell lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathioneâSepharose beads and the affinity complexes were analyzed by Western blotting. NH<sub>2</sub>-mBub1(400) clearly purifies with the glutathione beads in a GSTâhBub3-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>C</italic>, lane <italic>4</italic>). In contrast, NH<sub>2</sub>-mBub1(400Î38), which does not sequester hBub3 in the cytoplasm, does not copurify with GSTâhBub3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>C</italic>, lane <italic>5</italic>). Based on these observations, we conclude that Bub1 and Bub3 can bind in mammalian cells, and that a 38-amino acid domain in the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus, which is conserved among the Bub1 and Mad3-related proteins, is required for this interaction.</p>

        <title>The Bub3-binding Domain of Bub1 Is Also Required for Kinetochore Localization</title>
        <p>We previously showed that the kinetochore localization domain of mBub1 resides within the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 331 amino acids (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>). To further define the kinetochore localization domain, we assayed the deletion mutants shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic> for kinetochore localization during mitosis by transient transfection into BHK cells. This analysis defined a region within amino acids 201â300 as being required for kinetochore localization, suggesting that the hBub3-binding domain and the kinetochore localization domain of mBub1 may overlap (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). Significantly, the 38-amino acid deletion that abolished the ability of mBub1 to interact with hBub3 also abolished its ability to localize to the kinetochore. These observations suggest that the Bub1/Bub3 interaction is required for localizing Bub1 to the kinetochore in mitosis.</p>

        <title>The Bub3-binding Domain Is Conserved in hBubR1</title>
        <p>The NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of Mad3 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (ScMad3, EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Z49288">Z49288</ext-link>) shares significant homology with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of Bub1 (Hardwick, K.G., and A.W. Murray, personal communication) (refer to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>C</italic> and see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). Interestingly, ScMad3 also shares homology with Bub1 within the Bub3-binding domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). This observation tempted us to speculate that perhaps Mad3 may also bind Bub3. To test this possibility, we set out to clone a mammalian homologue of ScMad3. A screen of EST databases identified a partial human cDNA with homology to the ScMad3. Using this EST, we isolated a corresponding full-length cDNA (EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF053306">AF053306</ext-link>) with an open reading frame of 3,153 bp, encoding a 1,050-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of â¼119 kD. </p>
        <p>The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of this human Mad3-like protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>C</italic>, <italic>lightly shaded box</italic>) shares â¼26% identity with ScBub1 and 35% identity with ScMad3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). However, unlike ScMad3, this human protein has a COOH-terminal kinase domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>C</italic>). Although this kinase domain shares homology with the Bub1 kinase domains, it is clearly distinct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). For example, whereas ScBub1 and mBub1 share 33% identity in the kinase domain, ScBub1 and the human Mad3/Bub1-related protein share only 20% identity. Furthermore, mBub1 is more closely related to ScBub1 (33% identity) than it is to the human Mad3/Bub1-related protein (26% identity) in the kinase domain. These observations suggest that this human protein is perhaps not an additional member of the Bub1 family, but more likely a Mad3-related protein. This human Mad3/Bub1-related kinase is identical to a Bub1-related protein recently described by <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cahill et al. (1998)</xref>. Therefore, in an effort to maintain a consistent nomenclature, we will refer to this Mad3/Bub1-related protein as hBubR1.</p>

        <title>Exogenous hBubR1 Localizes to the Kinetochore Only When Bub3 Is Overexpressed</title>
        <p>To test whether hBubR1 localizes to kinetochores, the open reading frame of its cDNA was cloned into an Myc-tagged mammalian expression vector and transiently transfected into BHK cells. During interphase, hBubR1 was predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). During mitosis, hBubR1 was diffusely distributed throughout the cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>C</italic>), although occasionally, very faint kinetochore staining was observed during prometaphase (data not shown). Note that mBub1 is also cytoplasmic when ectopically expressed in interphase BHK cells, but exhibits clear kinetochore staining in transfected prometaphase cells (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>). </p>
        <p>The different localizations of ectopically expressed hBubR1 and hBub3 during interphase allowed us to test whether these two proteins interact by performing cotransfections as described above to test the Bub1âBub3 interaction. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>A</italic> shows several cells that have been cotransfected with hBubR1 and hBub3. In the cells not expressing hBubR1, hBub3 is predominantly nuclear. In the cell coexpressing hBubR1, hBub3 is clearly localized to the cytoplasm, suggesting that hBubR1 and hBub3 can interact in mammalian cells. Significantly, in prometaphase cells coexpressing hBub3 and hBubR1, localization of hBubR1 at kinetochores was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>

        <title>A Domain Conserved between the Bub1 and Mad3-related Proteins Is Required for the hBubR1âhBub3 Interaction</title>
        <p>To test whether the homology domain defined in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>B</italic> is required for the hBubR1/hBub3 interaction, this region was deleted to generate hBubR1Î42. GSTâhBub3 was cotransfected with either hBubR1 or hBubR1Î42 into BHK cells, followed by affinity purification from cell lysates using glutathione Sepharose beads. The affinity complexes were then analyzed by Western blotting. hBubR1 clearly purifies with the glutathione beads in a GSTâ hBub3-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lane <italic>4</italic>). In contrast, hBubR1Î42 does not copurify with GSTâhBub3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lane <italic>5</italic>). In addition, hBubR1Î42 did not sequester coexpressed hBub3 in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). Furthermore, hBubR1Î42 did not localize to kinetochores when coexpressed with hBub3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>E</italic>). These observations show that hBubR1 can physically interact with hBub3 in mammalian cells, and that a domain conserved between the Bub1 and Mad3-related proteins is required for this binding.</p>

        <title>hBub3ÎVAVE Does Not Interact with mBub1 or hBubR1</title>
        <p>To define the domain of Bub3 required for binding to Bub1 and BubR1, several hBub3 mutants were generated and scored for their ability to be sequestered in the cytoplasm when coexpressed with either mBub1 or hBubR1. One mutant, hBub3ÎVAVE, which contains a four-amino acid deletion (amino acids 217â220) from within the central domain (refer to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), was not sequestered in the cytoplasm when coexpressed with either mBub1 or hBubR1, but rather remained exclusively nuclear (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). These observations suggest that Bub3 binds to both Bub1 and BubR1 in a similar manner. Kinetochore localization of hBub3ÎVAVE was not observed in transfected prometaphase cells (data not shown), suggesting that the ability to bind Bub1 or BubR1 is required for kinetochore localization of Bub3. </p>

        <title>In Vitro Phosphorylation of mBub1 and hBubR1</title>
        <p>The sequence alignment shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>B</italic> indicates that the kinase domain of hBubR1 differs significantly from the mBub1 kinase domain. In addition, hBubR1 lacks several of the residues that are usually highly conserved among most protein kinases (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hanks and Hunter, 1995</xref>). To test whether hBubR1 is indeed a protein kinase, GSTâ hBubR1 was expressed in BHK cells, affinity purified from cell lysates using glutathione Sepharose beads, and then assayed for in vitro protein kinase activity. Bound proteins were first analyzed by Western blotting to normalize the amount of GST protein used in the subsequent kinase assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The kinase assay reveals several phosphorylated proteins associated with the glutathione beads incubated in lysates from cells expressing either GST-mBub1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, lane <italic>5</italic>) and GSTâhBubR1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, lane <italic>6</italic>). These phosphorylated proteins were not detected when either equivalent amounts of GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, lane <italic>7</italic>) or equivalent amounts of glutathione beads incubated with lysates from mock transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, lane <italic>8</italic>) were compared. The major phosphorylated proteins detected in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, lanes <italic>5</italic> and <italic>6</italic> are of the molecular weights expected of GSTâmBub1 and GSTâhBubR1 respectively, (as judged by Western blotting, see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, lanes <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>). This indicates that the phosphorylated bands are GSTâ mBub1 and GSTâhBubR1, suggesting that the observed kinase activity is probably autophosphorylation. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed activities are due to another copurifying protein kinase, these data are consistent with the notion that, like ScBub1 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 1994</xref>), mBub1 and hBubR1 exhibit autophosphorylation activity in vitro. </p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We describe the cloning of a human homologue of Bub3, which, like murine Bub1, localizes to kinetochores during prometaphase (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>). In addition, we show that mBub1 and hBub3 can interact in mammalian cells. We have also identified the Bub3-binding site in Bub1. This same domain is required for kinetochore localization of Bub1, which we have previously shown is required for checkpoint function (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>). Therefore, these observations suggest that the role of Bub3 is to facilitate kinetochore localization of Bub1, thereby activating the checkpoint in response to unattached kinetochores. ScBub3 was identified as a high copy suppressor of the <italic>bub1-1</italic> allele, suggesting that ScBub1 and ScBub3 interact in yeast (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hoyt et al., 1991</xref>). Further support for this interaction came from genetic experiments, which showed that <italic>bub3Î</italic> strains have a similar phenotype to <italic>bub1Î</italic> strains (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 1994</xref>). In addition, <italic>bub1Î/bub3Î</italic> double mutants are phenotypically similar to strains with deletions of either gene, and Bub1p and Bub3p have been shown to coimmunoprecipitate when overexpressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 1994</xref>). Our observations with Bub1 and Bub3 in mammalian cells are consistent with those in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and suggest the following model: in the absence of Bub3, Bub1 cannot localize to the kinetochore and hence the checkpoint is not activated in response to unattached kinetochores.</p>
      <p>hBub3 also appears to be required for kinetochore localization of hBubR1. Whether Bub3 plays any roles in addition to kinetochore localization of Bub1 and BubR1 remains to be seen. Interestingly, hBub3 contains four WD repeats, a 40-amino acid motif found in many proteins involved in a diverse array of cellular processes, including G proteinâlinked receptor signaling, RNA processing and export, and cell cycle control (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Neer et al., 1994</xref>). The exact function of WD repeats is not clear, but it seems likely that they play a role in mediating proteinâprotein interactions. Indeed, WD repeat proteins are often part of multiprotein complexes (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Neer et al., 1994</xref>). Whether Bub3 is part of a large multiprotein complex remains to be seen. Thus far, Bub3 has been shown to interact with Bub1 and the human Mad3/Bub1-related protein, hBubR1 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 1994</xref>; this work). In addition, Bub3 and Mad3 have been shown to interact in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Hardwick, K.G., and A.W. Murray, personal communication). Recently, Mad1, Mad2, and Mad3 have been shown to interact with cdc20 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1998</xref>), which in turn has been shown to interact with the APC (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Visintin et al., 1997</xref>). Significantly, the vertebrate homologues of Mad2, Bub1, Bub3 and the Mad3-related kinase, BubR1, have been shown to localize to kinetochores before chromosome alignment (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li and Benezra, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>; this work). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the checkpoint components, including Bub1, BubR1, Bub3, Mad1, Mad2, and Mad3, may be part of a large protein complex that is recruited to unattached kinetochores. This kinetochore-bound form of the checkpoint complex may bind and inhibit cdc20, thereby preventing activation of APC, and hence delaying the onset of anaphase. Based on the observations that Mad2, Bub1, Bub3, and BubR1 are not present at the kinetochores of metaphase chromosomes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li and Benezra, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>; this work), it appears likely that the checkpoint complex dissociates from kinetochores upon achieving correct bipolar attachments. Upon dissociation, perhaps the composition or activity of the checkpoint complex is altered, rendering cdc20 active and hence allowing the onset of anaphase. However, although there is evidence that many of these checkpoint components can interact with each other (see above), the existence of such a complex has not yet been demonstrated to exist in vivo. It is therefore possible that some of these proteins interact only transiently as cells progress through mitosis.</p>
      <p>hBub3 shares significant homology with the Rae1 family of proteins, both within the WD repeats and in the central, non-WD repeat region (refer to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The <italic>S. pombe rae1</italic> gene was identified as a poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA export mutant (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1995</xref>). SpRae1 has recently been shown to interact with the <italic>S. pombe</italic> homologue of the Nic96 nucleoporin (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Yoon et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homologue of Rae1, gle2p, interacts with the Nup100p nucleoporin and other proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>gle2</italic> strains also show defects in poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA export and have grossly perturbed nuclear pores. These observations suggest that Rae1 is required for nucleocytoplasmic transport and probably does not play a direct role in cell cycle control.</p>
      <p>Despite the significant similarity between the Rae1 proteins and the human Bub3 homologue described here (39% identity), several lines of evidence suggest that hBub3 is not a member of the Rae1 family. First, a human cDNA encoding a protein with 49% identity to SpRae1 has recently been identified (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bharathi et al., 1997</xref>). This cDNA complements the temperature sensitivity of the <italic>rae1-1</italic> allele and is therefore likely to be the human Rae1 homologue. Second, an alignment of the Rae1 and Bub3 proteins identifies several amino acid sequences in the central domain, including the VATAER sequence (amino acids 174â179 in SpRae1), which are conserved in all the Rae1 proteins, but not in the Bub3 homologues. Conversely, there are several sequences, including the SSI(E/ D)GRVAVE sequence (amino acids 211â220 in hBub3), which are conserved in the Bub3 proteins, but are not conserved in the Rae1 homologues. Significantly, deletion of the VAVE sequence abolishes the ability of hBub3 to interact with mBub1 and hBubR1. Note that the <italic>S. pombe rae1-1</italic> loss of function allele results in a substitution of the glycine at position 219 with a glutamic acid (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1995</xref>). Significantly, this glycine is conserved in the Rae1 homologues, but is replaced by a serine in the Bub3 homologues.</p>
      <p>In addition to the sequence analysis, two observations indicate that hBub3 is indeed the homologue of ScBub3. First, hBub3 interacts with mBub1, as do Bub3 and Bub1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 1994</xref>). Second, hBub3 localizes to kinetochores during prometaphase, a property that one might predict based on the localizations of mBub1 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>) and the vertebrate homologues of Mad2 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li and Benezra, 1996</xref>). The significance, if any, of the similarity between the Bub3 and Rae1 proteins remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>This work also describes the identification of a novel human Mad3/Bub1-related protein, hBubR1. hBubR1 shares homology with Mad3 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and yet it is significantly larger (1,050 amino acids) than ScMad3 (515 amino acids), due to a COOH-terminal extension which contains a kinase domain. This suggests that perhaps the human Mad3/Bub1-related kinase is a second Bub1 homologue. Indeed, within the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domains, hBubR1 is more similar to ScBub1 (26% identity) than mBub1 is to ScBub1 (23% identity). In addition, a BLAST search of the yeast genome shows that the kinase most closely related to hBubR1 is ScBub1. However, an alignment of the COOH-terminal kinase domains shows that hBubR1 is clearly distinct from the Bub1 family (refer to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). Within the kinase domains, there are 85 amino acids conserved among the Bub1 homologues from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, mouse and human. However, 54 of these are not conserved in hBubR1. Indeed, within the kinase domain, mBub1 is more closely related to ScBub1 (33% identity) than it is to hBubR1 (26% identity). Within the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain, hBubR1 is significantly more similar to ScMad3 (35% identity) than it is to ScBub1 (26% identity). These observations suggest that perhaps hBubR1 is a Mad3-related protein kinase. Whether hBubR1 and ScMad3 have indeed evolved from a common ancestor will remain uncertain until Mad3-related proteins from other organisms have been identified, or until we have a better understanding of the functions of these two proteins.</p>
      <p>The functional analysis presented here illustrates similarities between mBub1 and hBubR1, as well as a significant difference. Like mBub1, hBubR1 can bind hBub3 in mammalian cells, and this binding requires a domain that is conserved between the Bub1 and Mad3-related proteins. In addition, hBubR1 can localize to kinetochores during prometaphase and the ability to bind Bub3 is required for this localization. However, unlike mBub1, ectopically expressed hBubR1 only localizes to kinetochores when hBub3 is overexpressed. In contrast, ectopically expressed mBub1 localizes to the kinetochore without coexpression of hBub3 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>). One possible explanation for this observation is that hBubR1 cannot bind hamster Bub3, and hence kinetochore localization is not observed in transfected BHK cells unless exogenous human Bub3 is present. However, significant kinetochore staining was also not observed when hBubR1 was transfected into human cells (data not shown). Until the localization of endogenous hBubR1 has been determined, these observations have to be treated with caution. However, it does suggest that the amount of endogenous Bub3 is limiting with respect to ectopically expressed hBubR1. One possibility is that the endogenous Bub3 is complexed with Bub1 and hence there is no Bub3 available for binding to, and hence kinetochore localization of, transfected hBubR1. This suggests that perhaps the majority of BubR1 may not play a role at the kinetochore. Alternatively, perhaps hBubR1 does play a role at the kinetochore, but that overexpression of hBubR1 somehow prevents the formation of complexes capable of kinetochore localization. The generation of anti-hBubR1 antibodies will hopefully resolve this issue.</p>
      <p>The role of hBubR1 remains to be determined. It is possible that Bub1 and BubR1 have similar or partially overlapping roles. Although there is only a single Bub1 kinase encoded in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, functional redundancy may be beneficial in mammalian cells. Recently, mutant <italic>BUB1</italic> alleles have been identified in colorectal tumors displaying a chromosome instability phenotype (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cahill et al., 1998</xref>), suggesting that mitotic checkpoint defects may contribute to tumorigenesis. Therefore, overlapping or partially redundant roles for Bub1 and BubR1 may provide a selective advantage to multicellular organisms: increasing the fidelity of chromosome segregation may reduce the possibility of generating potentially tumorigenic aneuploid cells.</p>
      <p>Redundancy may allow multiple spindle events to be monitored by the mitotic checkpoint. At present, there is evidence implicating both tension and microtubule attachment as the events which regulate anaphase onset (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li and Nicklas, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rieder et al., 1995</xref>). Perhaps in the quest for enhanced genome stability, both tension and attachment are monitored by the checkpoint. Perhaps, therefore, Bub1 and BubR1 respond to different types of spindle events. Tension and microtubule attachment may also be differentially monitored in mitosis relative to meiosis (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nicklas, 1997</xref>). If Bub1 and BubR1 respond differentially to tension and microtubule attachment, perhaps they play differential roles in mitosis and meiosis.</p>

The percentage of cells with cytoplasmic GFPâhBub3 was scored and plotted against the amount of cotransfected mBub1. Only coexpression of full-length mBub1 and the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain resulted in a dose-dependent, cytoplasmic sequestration of GFPâhBub3. (<italic>C</italic>) BHK cells were transfected with GSTâhBub3 (lanes <italic>1</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, and <italic>5</italic>) and/or Myc-tagged NH<sub>2</sub>-mBub1(400) (lanes <italic>2</italic> and <italic>4</italic>) and/or Myc-tagged NH<sub>2</sub>-mBub1(400Î38) (lanes <italic>3</italic> and <italic>5</italic>). Proteins from cell lysates (<italic>top</italic>) and purified GSTâhBub3 complexes (<italic>bottom</italic>) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and then probed with anti-GST and anti-Myc antibodies. In the absence of GSTâhBub3, neither NH<sub>2</sub>-mBub1(400) nor NH<sub>2</sub>-mBub1(400Î38) purify with the glutathione beads (lanes <italic>2</italic> and <italic>3</italic>). In the presence of GSTâhBub3, NH<sub>2</sub>-mBub1(400) does purify with the glutathione beads (lane <italic>4</italic>) but NH<sub>2</sub>-mBub1(400Î38) does not (lane <italic>5</italic>). Note that GSTâhBub3 cannot be identified in the cell lysates due to several comigrating background bands.</p>

(<italic>A</italic>) A schematic representation of mBub1 and the Myc-tagged deletion mutants tested for kinetochore localization and GFPâhBub3 interaction after transient transfection of BHK cells. The <italic>lightly shaded box</italic> represents the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal homology domain defined previously (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>), whereas the <italic>darkly shaded box</italic> represents the COOH-terminal kinase domain. A + under <italic>KL</italic> indicates that kinetochore localization of the Myc epitope was observed during prometaphase. A + under <italic>hBub3</italic> indicates that cytoplasmic sequestration of GFPâhBub3 was observed in interphase cells. The numbers on the right correspond to the amino acids expressed by each construct. This analysis shows that amino acids 201â300 are required for both kinetochore localization and hBub3 binding.

        <p>In vitro phosphorylation of mBub1 and hBubR1. BHK cells were transiently transfected with GSTâmBub1, GSTâhBubR1, and GST alone or mock-transfected as indicated. After transfection, cell lysates were prepared and incubated with glutathione Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting to normalize the amounts of GST-fusion proteins used in the subsequent kinase assay. To assay for associated kinase activity, the beads were incubated with <sup>32</sup>[P] Î³-ATP. Bound proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Lanes <italic>5</italic> and <italic>6</italic> show that there are several phosphorylated proteins associated with the beads incubated in lysates from cells expressing either GSTâmBub1 or GSTâhBubR1. The Western blot shows that the major phosphorylated proteins correspond to GSTâmBub1 (lane <italic>1</italic>) and GSTâ hBubR1 (lane <italic>2</italic>), suggesting that the observed kinase activity is autophosphorylation. The major phosphorylated proteins observed in lanes <italic>5</italic> and <italic>6</italic> are not associated with beads incubated in cell lysates expressing GST alone (lane <italic>7</italic>) or from mock-transfected cells (lane <italic>8</italic>).</p>
