        <p>The biological role of human DNA polymerase Î¸ (POLQ) is not yet clearly defined, but it has been proposed to participate in several cellular processes based on its translesion synthesis capabilities. POLQ is a low-fidelity polymerase capable of efficient bypass of blocking lesions such as abasic sites and thymine glycols as well as extension of mismatched primer termini. Here, we show that POLQ possesses a DNA polymerase activity that appears to be template independent and allows efficient extension of single-stranded DNA as well as duplex DNA with either protruding or multiply mismatched 3â²-OH termini. We hypothesize that this DNA synthesis activity is related to the proposed role for POLQ in the repair or tolerance of double-strand breaks.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human DNA polymerase Î¸ (POLQ) has homologs throughout the higher eukaryotes but the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of POLQ is not clearly understood at this point (see âDiscussionâ section below). The enzyme has a domain arrangement similar to the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> mus308 gene product and consists of an N-terminal helicase-like domain, a central spacer domain and a C-terminal polymerase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B1">1</xref>). The N-terminus of the protein is assigned as a helicase domain based on sequence similarities to other known helicases although no helicase activity has yet been demonstrated for POLQ. The central domain has no known function and sequence predictions show no similarities to other proteins. The C-terminal portion of the enzyme is classified as an A-Family DNA polymerase based on its primary amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Unlike most other A-Family DNA polymerases, POLQ is a low-fidelity enzyme with an error rate on par with that of the Y-Family polymerases Îº and Î· (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B3">3</xref>) and is efficient at extending mismatched primer termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B4">4</xref>). POLQ is also very efficient at bypassing lesions such as abasic sites and thymine glycols, which are otherwise strong blocks to most other A-Family as well as B-Family replicative DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B6">6</xref>). In addition, a domain within the polymerase has been shown to confer deoxyribophosphodiesterase (dRPase) activity to POLQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B7">7</xref>) and the enzyme has also been shown to exhibit ATPase activity in the presence of single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B1">1</xref>). The unique lesion bypass capacity of the enzyme has been proposed to arise from three insertion loops that are not present in other A-family DNA polymerases. Experiments with mutant forms of the polymerase in which each of the three loops had been deleted suggested that one of these loops acts as a processivity factor and the other two increase the efficiency of polymerization on undamaged templates and are required for translesion synthesis past an abasic site or a thymine glycol lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B5">5</xref>). POLQ is highly efficient at incorporating nucleotides opposite abasic sites and then extending past the lesion. Under steady-state conditions, the efficiency of extension past an abasic site by the full-length enzyme was shown to be comparable with extension past a standard WatsonâCrick base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B6">6</xref>). The translesion synthesis capability of POLQ has been suggested to play a critical role in somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B8 gkr1102-B9 gkr1102-B10 gkr1102-B11 gkr1102-B12">8â12</xref>). However, there is conflicting evidence suggesting that such a function may be tissue specific or be only a minor part of POLQ's role in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B13">13</xref>). The dRP-lyase activity of POLQ and the observation that knockout of POLQ along with POLÎ² results in a deficiency in base excision repair in DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B14">14</xref>) suggest that POLQ may be involved in base excision repair in a manner similar to Pol Î», a polymerase that also possesses a dRPase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B15">15</xref>) and is able to extend past abasic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B16">16</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests a role for POLQ in the repair or tolerance of double-strand breaks. POLQ deficient mouse bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B17">17</xref>) and human tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B18">18</xref>) show increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and to low doses of bleomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B17">17</xref>), both of which are known to produce double-strand breaks. Knockdown of POLQ in CH12 mouse B lymphoma cells increases their sensitivity to the double-strand break inducer etoposide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B19">19</xref>) and <italic>chaos-1</italic> mice [these mice have a serine to proline mutation at position 1932 in POLQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B20">20</xref>)] show high levels of micronuclei, indicating increased levels of chromosome breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B21">21</xref>), both of which suggest a role for POLQ in the repair of double-strand breaks in mammalian cells. POLQ knockout mice also show a decreased viability when combined with a knockout in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B21">21</xref>). ATM is a crucial part of the double-strand break repair pathway in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B22">22</xref>) providing further evidence that POLQ is involved in double-strand break repair. POLQ orthologs have also been suggested to be involved in interstrand cross-link repair, presumably through double-strand break intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B23">23</xref>). However, even in the case of double-strand breaks, it has been the translesion synthesis capacity of POLQ that is invoked as playing a role in the repair pathways of these devastating DNA lesions.</p><p>We show here that POLQ has the capacity to extend single-stranded oligonucleotides. The extension appears to be, in some cases, template independent, and there is a possibility that POLQ can utilize base pairing of only one to two nucleotides as well as multiply mismatched 3â² primer termini in a template-dependent reaction. Interestingly, in certain sequence contexts, POLQ extends a single-stranded oligonucleotide more efficiently than duplex DNA or duplex DNA with an abasic site in the template. Control experiments show that this same single-stranded oligonucleotide cannot serve as a substrate for other A- or B-family DNA polymerases. We hypothesize that this promiscuous DNA synthesis by POLQ is beneficial during double-strand break repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Truncated versions of human POLQ enzymes (consisting of residues 1792â2590) were expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B5">5</xref>). A coomassie blue stained gel of the purified polymerases is available as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1102/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>. The DNA polymerase from bacteriophage RB69 was expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B24">24</xref>). Bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (both wild type and exonuclease deficient) was from GE Lifesciences while Vent DNA polymerase and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I were from New England Biolabs. All DNA substrates were from Midland Certified Reagents or MWG Biofins and were purified by electrophoresis through 16% polyacrylamide gels followed by desalting on Sep Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Inc.). Duplex oligonucleotides were annealed by heating to 80Â°C and slow cooling in a buffer of 50âmM NaCl and 25âmM TrisâHCl (pH 7.5). Duplex oligonucleotides were subsequently separated from unannealed single stranded oligonucleotides by electrophoresis through a 16% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by elution of the duplexes in 50âmM NaCl and 20âmM TrisâHCl (pH 7.5). The sequences of all oligonucleotides are given in the figures. All primers were labeled at the 5â² end with tetrachlorofluorescein for subsequent visualization and quantification on a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager (GE Lifesciences). Ultrapure deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were from GE Lifesciences.</p></sec><sec><title>Primer extension assays</title><p>100ânM polymerase was mixed with 250ânM DNA substrate in the reaction buffer [20âmM TrisâHCl (pH 8.8), 4% glycerol, 80âÂµgâml<sup>â1</sup> bovine serum albumin and 0.1âmM EDTA]. Individual deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (150âÂµM), or a mixture of all four at 150âÂµM each, were mixed with 10âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in the same reaction buffer. For reactions using ribonucleotides, each base was present at a concentration of 1âmM. Reactions were initiated by mixing 50âÂµl of the polymerase:DNA solution with 50âÂµl of the dNTP:MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution. At 0âs, 10âs, 30âs, 1âmin, 5âmin, 10âmin and 30âmin (unless otherwise noted), the reactions were quenched by mixing 5âÂµl aliquots in 15âÂµl of a stop solution consisting of 95% formamide, 20âmM EDTA and 0.1% xylene cyanol. Reaction products were electrophoresed on 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and then scanned on a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager at the Alexa 532 setting to excite the tetrachlorofluorescein tags at the 5â² end of the primer oligonucleotides.</p></sec><sec><title>Steady state kinetics</title><p>Reactions were performed as described for the primer extension assays except that 10ânM polymerase was used and individual deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were used at varying concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 3âmM. The band intensities of extended primers and unextended primers were quantified using the ImageQuant 5.2 software provided with the Typhoon 9400. Time points were chosen in which primer extension was &lt;20% and the ratio of extended primers to unextended primers was plotted against time to give a linear plot of product formation. The initial velocities of the reactions were calculated as the slopes of the lines for each concentration of dNTP and these were then plotted against dNTP concentrations and fit to a square hyperbola (<italic>V</italic>â=â(<italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>[dNTP])/(<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>â+â[dNTP])).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Extension of single-stranded oligonucleotides</title><p>Previous work has shown that the full-length POLQ and the isolated polymerase domain have comparable properties when replicating undamaged and damaged DNA templates. The truncated version of POLQ used in this study (residues 1792â2590) retains the intrinsic translesion properties of the full-length enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B5">5</xref>) as well as the template-dependent DNA polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>a). With primer/template DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>a), POLQ extends the primer to the end of the template and then adds a single nontemplated nucleotide to the end of the duplex as has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B6">6</xref>). By serendipity, we discovered that POLQ also was able to extend an end-labeled oligonucleotide with deoxyribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>b) and essentially not with ribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>d and e). Upon addition of all four dNTPs, a strong pause site was observed after addition of a single nucleotide followed by less intense bands at what appear to be the second and third positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>b). We also observed a smearing that became progressively longer at longer time points. We attribute this smearing to be the result of random incorporation of nucleotides at the end of the primer strand. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that all four individual nucleotides are incorporated onto the 3â² end of the single stranded primer; even dCTP is readily incorporated even though no appreciable amount of dCTP was incorporated when a DNA template was present (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>b with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>a). When only dTTP was added to the reaction mix, most of the primers were extended by two or three nucleotides but a small population of primers continued to be extended out to about 30ânt after 30âmin incubation. The extension profile of POLQ with single-stranded DNA appears to be dependent on the sequence at the 3â² end of the single stranded primer. When a primer strand ending with pyrimidines was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>c), we observed a different pattern of pause sites when all four dNTPs were added. With this primer, there was very little extension with dTTP, unlike when the primer ended with purines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>b), and we instead saw a subset of the primers being extended out to about 30ânt after 30âmin incubation with dATP.

Thus, we designed control experiments to validate our findings. The first was to confirm that the observed activity was a result of POLQ itself and not contaminating proteins. Two POLQ mutants in which protein loops have been deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B5">5</xref>), and that have been purified identically to the wild type enzyme, were tested for their ability to extend single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F2">Figure 2</xref>a). The POLQ mutant in which loop 1 (residues 2149â2170) had been deleted was able to extend duplex DNA as well as single-stranded DNA. The mutant in which loop 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B6">6</xref>4â2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B5">5</xref>) had been deleted was able to extend duplex DNA but was unable to efficiently extend single-stranded DNA beyond more than two nucleotides. This is in keeping with our previous work showing that loop 2 is required for translesion synthesis by POLQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B5">5</xref>) and demonstrates that the single-stranded DNA extension is intrinsic to POLQ. We next tested several other replicative DNA polymerases to see if the single-stranded substrate could be utilized by other polymerases that are known to be unable to synthesize DNA without a template strand. All of the polymerases tested were able to extend duplex DNA but showed no extension of the single-stranded primer and those with exonuclease activity rapidly degraded the single-stranded substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F2">Figure 2</xref>b). This result suggests that POLQ is extending single-stranded DNA and that the substrate is not forming stable hairpins or self-complimentary structures that would provide a substrate for template-dependent DNA synthesis. If self-complementary structures are being formed, our oligonucleotide sequences dictate that they would only consist of 1 or 2âbp and extension of such primer ends would still in itself be an interesting property of POLQ. The third test was to examine the efficiency of single-stranded DNA as a substrate by POLQ. We measured the steady-state kinetic parameters of incorporation with three substrates; incorporation of dA opposite a templating T (sequence as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>a), incorporation of dA opposite a templating abasic site (sequence as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>a but in which the templating T has been replaced by the abasic site analog tetrahydrofuran) and incorporation of dG onto single-stranded DNA (sequence as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>c). The results of these experiments show a clear preference for extension of single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkr1102-T1">Table 1</xref>). In the absence of a template strand, the maximum rate of product formation is â¼3-fold and 5-fold faster than for incorporation opposite a templating T and a templating abasic site, respectively. The apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for the incoming nucleotide is â¼7-fold lower for non-templated primer extension compared with extension opposite a templating T and â¼20-fold lower than for incorporation opposite a templating abasic site. Thus, under our experimental conditions and in certain sequence contexts, the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation (<italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) in the absence of a specific templating strand appears to be about 20-fold greater than for incorporation opposite undamaged DNA and â¼100-fold greater than for incorporation opposite an abasic site.

POLQ has been previously shown to extend singly mismatched primer termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B4">4</xref>), but our working hypothesis was that as mismatches became longer in length, POLQ may extend them in a nontemplated manner. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F3">Figure 3</xref>a shows the results of incubating POLQ with oligonucleotide substrates containing one, two or three mismatched nucleotides at the primer terminus. These substrates had previously been used with the B-family replicative DNA polymerase from bacteriophage RB69 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B25">25</xref>) and could not be extended in the absence of exonucleolytic proofreading activity that would remove the mismatches before template-dependent extension. However, POLQ shows no discrimination between the three lengths of mismatched primer termini as all three appear to be extended with equal efficiency. When all four dNTPs are present, POLQ rapidly extends the primer by what appears to be about 6 or 7ânt, which is the length one would expect if the polymerase were reading the template DNA, but at longer incubation times POLQ adds four more bases to the primer end. The same pattern of incorporation is seen for all three mismatch lengths used. Surprisingly, when dNTPs are provided individually, only dGTP is readily incorporated. Even dATP, which is the next correct nucleotide based on the sequence context, is not added to the primer end by POLQ in any appreciable amount. Thus, we observe a significant difference between POLQ incorporation when the primer terminus is correctly or incorrectly matched. With the matched primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>a), POLQ was able to incorporate the correct base dATP as well as form mismatches with dGTP and dTTP. When the primer terminus consisted of mismatched bases, only dGTP was readily incorporated. We note that the band pattern between adding all four dNTPs and just dGTP are not the same with the mismatched primers. This suggests that after incorporation of one or more guanines, POLQ is able to incorporate other nucleotides but this has not yet been directly tested.

The sequences are shown above each respective gel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkr1102f3"/></fig></p><p>When extending a primer in a template-dependent manner, POLQ reaches the end of the template and then adds a single non-templated nucleotide as has been observed for many other polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B26">26</xref>) and no further extension is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>a). However, when a mismatch is extended, products longer than a single insertion past the end of the template are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F3">Figure 3</xref>a). Extensions past these mismatches likely do not involve slippage events as such events have not previously been observed for translesion synthesis or mismatch extension by POLQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B6">6</xref>). While the predominant extension product of these mismatches appears to correspond with the length of single-stranded template, POLQ does not appear to be reading the sequence of nucleotides present in the template strand. With a single mismatch, incorporation of A opposite the next templating T is only barely detectable suggesting that POLQ is unable to recognize the sequence of the template strand when extending past a mismatched primer terminus. When full-length POLQ was previously tested against three different mismatches, extension appears to proceed to the end of the template but the band patterns are distinctly different depending on the nature of the mismatch [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>b in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B4">4</xref>)]. These results support our hypothesis that POLQ may not be directly reading the template strand when extending past a mismatch. Surprisingly, when only dGTP is supplied, POLQ readily incorporates up to 20ânt within the time frame of the experiment, which is well beyond the end of the template strand. Thus, POLQ appears to recognize the template strand when the possibility of making base pairs is present such as is the case when all four dNTPs are available but can switch to what appears to be nontemplated DNA synthesis when only one nucleotide, in this case dGTP, is available. Such an incorporation of runs of G was also observed with normal template-dependent synthesis in which dGTP appears to be incorporated without regard to the sequence of the template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>a).</p><p>We also tested each of the mismatch primers as single-stranded substrates in the absence of their complementary template strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F3">Figure 3</xref>b). When no template is provided, the same primer sequences that were used to form mismatched primer termini can now be extended by all four nucleotides. This suggests that the template strand in the previous experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F3">Figure 3</xref>a) still has an effect on POLQ DNA synthesis even if it is not being directly read. These results also suggest that very subtle changes in the starting sequence can yield significant differences as to which nucleotides are added to single-stranded oligonucleotides. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F3">Figure 3</xref>b, when the sequence of the primer terminated in 5â²-TAAC, the pattern of bands observed was similar to those seen when the primer terminated in 5â²-TAAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>b), including extension with dTTP out to a few dozen bases. When the number of terminal dC residues increased to two or three, the band pattern observed upon addition of all four dNTPs changed and long-range incorporation of dTTP was replaced by long-range extension with dGTP.</p></sec><sec><title>Extension of 3â² single-stranded overhangs</title><p>We next designed three sets of primer/template oligonucleotides with different lengths of 3â² single-stranded overhangs to mimic double-strand breaks and to determine if there was a minimum length of single-stranded DNA that could be extended by POLQ. All three sets of oligonucleotides had a 14-mer template annealed to a 28-mer primer (14 nucleotide 3â² overhang), a 23-mer primer (nine nucleotide 3â² overhang) or an 18-mer primer (four nucleotide 3â² overhang). All three overhung primers were extended with dNTPs and compared with the same reactions in which only the single-stranded primers were the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F4">Figure 4</xref>). These results show a clear preference for the length of the 3â²-single-stranded overhang. When the overhang was 14ânt, the overhang was readily extended by POLQ. However, for the 9ânt overhang, only a small fraction was extended when compared with the same primer without double-stranded DNA. The shortest 3â² overhang of only 4ânt showed no detectable amount of non-templated extension while the primer alone was readily extended. Thus, the minimum length of single-stranded 3â²-overhang DNA that is extendable by POLQ appears to be between 9 and 14ânt. We also note that the pattern of bands formed between the 14-mer 3â² overhang and the identical primer without a template are not the same. This suggests that even at 14ânt from the 3â²-end of the DNA POLQ is still able to detect the presence of a duplex DNA. Interestingly, the overall length of non-templated DNA polymerization appears to be greater when the template strand is present as opposed to when it is just the 28-mer primer. Thus, there may even be a slightly stimulatory effect of the template strand on POLQ's non-templated extension of 3â²-single stranded overhangs.

This created an overhang with a homonucleotide run of 12 Ts ending with two Cs. This 3â²-overhang was extended, albeit with lower efficiency when present in duplex DNA. The percentage of primers extended after 30âmin were 77, 15 and 81% for incorporation of dNTPs, dATP and dGTP, respectively, with the single-stranded oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F5">Figure 5</xref>a) compared with 14, 5 and 28% with the duplex oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F5">Figure 5</xref>b). The sequence of this oligonucleotide is such that there is no opportunity to form two or more consecutive base pairs if the oligonucleotide were to self-anneal or form hairpins. In both cases, dGTP was preferentially incorporated over dATP.

The reaction efficiency was greatly reduced with these substrates as observable levels of product did not accumulate until several minutes. Interestingly, the predominantly incorporated nucleotide was the complimentary nucleotide although detectable levels of dATP were incorporated onto the polyA substrate. With the polyTC substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F6">Figure 6</xref>b), primer extension with a single nucleotide was only observed with dGTP or dGTP paired with any of the other three dNTPs. No extension was observed when dATP was provided as the only complimentary nucleotide. Interestingly, for all four homopolymeric substrates tried, the addition of all four nucleotides at the same time resulted in extremely long extensions of at least a few hundred nucleotides. These extensions also appear as ladders, not the smears observed with single-stranded primers composed of all 4ânt, and are longer than when the complimentary nucleotide is provided on its own.

Based on the pause sites in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F5">5</xref>, there was a hypothetical chance that 2ânt of base pairing was sufficient to allow template-independent DNA synthesis by POLQ. To address whether there could be exclusive template-independent DNA synthesis in the presence of all four dNTPs, we designed an oligonucleotide that should not be able to form hairpins or allow more than 1 nucleotide to form a base pair. We found rapid and efficient extension at 25Â°C with incorporation of up to 6ânt within 10âs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F7">Figure 7</xref>). Our hypothesis was that increasing the temperature to 37Â°C should destabilize any weak base pairing and thus inhibit template-dependent DNA synthesis. Instead, we found that POLQ was stimulated at 37Â°C, incorporating up to 12ânt within 10âs. This experiment, together with previous observations, strongly suggests that POLQ has the capacity to perform both template-independent and template-dependent DNA synthesis depending on the substrate presented to the enzyme.

Most of the DNA polymerases are template-dependent DNA polymerases although many possess a transferase activity that allows the addition of one nontemplated nucleotide past the end of the DNA template. Other enzymes such as poly(A)polymerases and CCA-adding enzymes have the ability to extend RNA with multiple ribonucleotides in a template-independent reaction. However, these enzymes utilize specific amino acids in the active site to stabilize the incoming nucleotide by mimicking base pairing and thus selectively restrict which nucleotide can be added at the 3â²-end of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B27">27</xref>). Among the DNA polymerases, exceptions to template-dependent DNA synthesis are found in two X-family DNA polymerases, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which is completely template independent, and DNA polymeraseâÎ¼ (PolâÎ¼), which shows a mixture of template dependence and independence depending on the reaction conditions. TdT creates diversity during immunoglobulin V(D)J recombination by adding random sequences between the DNA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B28">28</xref>). PolâÎ¼ also adds one (or a few) random nucleotide(s) between the two protruding 3â²-ends at the junction during nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B29">29</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed that the X-Family polymerases perform distinct cellular roles based on a gradient of template dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B30">30</xref>). The single-stranded DNA extension property of POLQ complements TdT and PolâÎ¼, positioning POLQ among the X-Family polymerases in the proposed gradient of template dependence in NHEJ. The terminal transferase activity of TdT and PolâÂµ depends on the presence of a protein loop that is proposed to interact with the DNA substrate and allow the enzymes to catalyze DNA extension in the absence of a template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B31">31</xref>). Similarly, the translesion synthesis capability of POLQ has been shown to rely on protein loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B5">5</xref>) and we now show that non-templated DNA synthesis is also dependent on these same protein loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The ability of POLQ to extend DNA appears to have distinct properties from those observed for PolâÂµ and TdT. First, TdT is able to extend single-stranded DNA but is unable to perform template directed DNA synthesis and the terminal transferase activity of TdT can be stimulated by using cobalt as the catalytic metal ion in place of magnesium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B32">32</xref>).On the other hand, POLQ can catalyze both nontemplated as well as template-directed DNA synthesis and its catalytic activity is strongly inhibited by replacing magnesium ions with cobalt ions (data not shown). Second, both TdT and PolâÂµ are able to efficiently incorporate both deoxyribonucleotides as well as ribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B34">34</xref>), while ribonucleotide incorporation onto the end of the single-stranded primer by POLQ was very inefficient and barely detectable with duplex DNA even at high concentrations of ribonucleotide and at extended reaction times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>d and e). Third, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F4">Figure 4</xref>, 3â² overhangs from duplex DNA become less usable as a substrate for POLQ as they become shorter. This is the opposite of what has been observed for PolâÂµ, where 3â² overhangs longer than only one or two nucleotides become progressively worse substrates for PolâÂµ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B29">29</xref>). Interestingly, our results with the extension of mismatched primers in which POLQ appears to detect the template strand without reading its sequence are reminiscent of those made with PolâÂµ. In those experiments, it was demonstrated that abasic sites were bypassed in an apparently template-dependent manner but without regard for the actual sequence of the template beyond the abasic site lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B35">35</xref>). Thus, it is possible that PolâÎ¼ and POLQ may have non-overlapping functions during NHEJ. However, in mice lacking Pol Î», PolâÎ¼ or both Pol Î» and PolâÎ¼, POLQ might step in explaining why those three mice only have a limited radiosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B36">36</xref>).</p><p>POLQ is expressed in bone marrow where B cells undergo V(D)J recombination, and it was postulated that POLQ may play a role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B37">37</xref>). V(D)J recombination in immunoglobulin genes is carried out by a process that uses double-strand breaks as intermediates that are subsequently repaired by NHEJ pathways. Random nucleotide insertions provide variability in immunoglobulin genes and such insertions have been shown to be supplied by non-templated incorporation of nucleotides by TdT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B38">38</xref>). In TdT knockout mice, a reduction in random nucleotide incorporation during V(D)J recombination of about 90% is observed, suggesting that TdT is the primary polymerase involved in the insertion of random nucleotide sequences during antigen-receptor diversification in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B39">39</xref>). Although it is possible that POLQ plays some role in the creation of the remaining 10% of randomly incorporated nucleotides, our results suggest that it does not. Protein-mediated cleavage of hairpins during double-strand break repair at V(D)J recombination sites yields blunt ends or 3â² overhangs of only four nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B40">40</xref>). Our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F4">Figure 4</xref> show that 3â² overhangs of only four bases are very poor substrates for non-templated extension by POLQ and suggests that they are not likely to be an <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate for this enzyme directly, although further processing of these ends by exonucleolytic activity could conceivably provide the longer 3â² overhangs that we have shown to be efficient substrates for POLQ.</p><p>An alternative to playing a role in canonical NHEJ pathways is that POLQ may be involved in Ku independent microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B41">41</xref>). Recent work on the POLQ ortholog Mus308 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> supports our hypothesis that single-stranded DNA extension by POLQ may play a role in double-strand break repair and may do so via MMEJ pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B42">42</xref>). In that work, double-strand breaks were mimicked by the excision of transposable elements leaving behind 17-base 3â² single-stranded ends. These DNA ends are strikingly similar in length to the 14-base substrates that we have found to be highly extendable by POLQ. The authors of that study showed that random incorporation of nucleotides between the 3â² overhangs of the resulting double-strand breaks were significantly reduced in the absence of Mus308. Although Mus308 lacks the three protein insertion loops that are unique to POLQ and appear to be critical to POLQ's unique enzymatic activities, the organization of the enzyme in terms of an N-terminal helicase domain and C-terminal A-Family DNA polymerase suggests that the two enzymes may play a role in similar pathways in metazoan cells. In the model presented by McVey and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B42">42</xref>), the Mus308 polymerase is only considered as a template-dependent polymerase that creates regions of microhomology at which the 3â² overhangs can anneal for subsequent gap-filling polymerization and ligation reactions. Our data suggests that POLQ may be able to directly extend 3â² overhangs (as long as they are of sufficient length) by the incorporation of apparently random sequences, which may be a different method of inserting random nucleotide sequences between flies and higher organisms in which POLQ homologs are found. The current model for MMEJ calls for 3â² single-stranded flaps to occur after annealing of the microhomologous regions. These flaps are removed by an exonuclease activity, but we find it very interesting that in our experiments mismatched primer ends of at least three nucleotides are readily extended by POLQ. It may be possible then that POLQ may play an additional role in the repair of double-strand breaks by utilizing as a substrate DNA in which these 3â² flaps are not removed. The significance of this finding in terms of double-strand break repair warrants further investigation.</p><p>While we propose that POLQ is able to extend single-stranded DNA in a non-templated manner, such activity is difficult to differentiate from error-prone template-dependent synthesis. This is especially noteworthy in light of our results with homopolymeric substrates in which most incorporation is with nucleotides complimentary to the substrate. Very similar results have been observed for DNA polymerase I from <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (a B-family DNA polymerase), in which it was proposed that this polymerase is able to add nontemplated bases to the end of a single-stranded template as well as stabilize poorly annealed ends to stimulate template-dependent synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B43">43</xref>). Interestingly, the terminal transferase activity proposed for that polymerase was only observed on oligonucleotides that were a minimum of 10â15 nucleotides in length, which is the minimum required length for our activity with POLQ. We note that some of our oligonucleotides may promote self-annealing more than others, for example the single-stranded template in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>c could loop back onto itself to pair the two 3â² terminal C residues with two G residues. This would allow for the templated addition of dGTP, which happens to be the most efficiently incorporated nucleotide. However, we observe incorporation of several dozen A residues, which is difficult to explain by a simple realignment of a self-annealed oligonucleotide. For other oligonucleotides, such as those used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F7">7</xref>, no pairings of two or more continuous complimentary nucleotides are possible for any self-priming 3â²-termini to allow for efficient template-directed synthesis. We also observe absolutely no extension of more than a single nucleotide past the end of the template when using properly base-paired duplex DNA. However, in every instance with single-stranded DNA, we observe extensions to lengths beyond those that would be expected if the polymerase were utilizing a looping back mechanism to allow for template-directed DNA synthesis. Our observation that ribonucleotides can be incorporated when single-stranded DNA is the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>d) but not in duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F1">Figure 1</xref>e) provides further evidence that POLQ may be extending single-stranded DNA in a non-templated manner and not forming hairpins or otherwise self-annealing templates. If the single-stranded oligonucleotide were forming hairpins such that POLQ was utilizing a template strand, we would expect to see no incorporation of ribonucleotides as seen with duplex DNA. Finally, we have previously observed that the loop 2 deletion mutant is almost completely unable to add a single non-templated nucleotide at the end of duplex DNA [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F3">Figure 3</xref> in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B5">5</xref>)] and such incorporation is attributed to terminal transferase-like activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B26">26</xref>). The loop 2 deletion mutants subsequent difficulty in extending single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1102-F2">Figure 2</xref>a) provides further evidence that such extension by wild type POLQ may be based on nontemplated terminal transferase activity. However, there still exists the formal possibility that POLQ is able to anneal single base pairs at the 3â²-end of the primer, insert a single nucleotide, dissociate or melt the newly formed duplex DNA and reanneal a single base pair somewhere else in the sequence. Such an activity would yield a random sequence that would be indistinguishable from random non-templated nucleotide incorporation. The mechanism by which this would occur would necessarily be distinct from that in which primer/template DNA is the substrate and studies are underway to determine if such alternative processes exist with POLQ.</p><p>Based on our current findings, we propose that POLQ may be involved in double-strand break repair by extending the single-stranded 3â²-ends of broken DNA molecules. One of the hallmarks of cancer is the occurrence of high levels of chromosomal rearrangements as a result of inaccurate repair of double-strand breaks. Therefore, it is noteworthy that POLQ is highly overexpressed in breast and colon cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B44 gkr1102-B45 gkr1102-B46">44â46</xref>). POLQ overexpression in these cancers is also a negative prognostic marker, the higher the expression level of POLQ the more likely the patient is to die from the disease. Common thinking has been that high levels of POLQ increase the mutation rate in cancer cells due to its ability to bypass lesions such as abasic sites and thymine glycols as well as its inherent lack of fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1102-B47">47</xref>). But perhaps the opposite is the case. In light of our current results, it is tempting to speculate that perhaps high levels of POLQ in cancer cells increase the survival of cancer cells by increasing their ability to cope with high levels of double-strand breaks. The activity of POLQ in these cells may be such that cancer cells undergo further rearrangements to their genomes as a result of enhanced double-strand break repair but these rearrangements may preclude cell death due to what would otherwise be broken, and thus unreplicable, genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1102/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Figure S1.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>Kempestiftelserna</funding-source> (M.H., A.E.S.-E., and E.J.); the <funding-source>Swedish Research Council</funding-source> (E.J.); the <funding-source>Swedish Cancer Society</funding-source> (E.J.); <funding-source>SmÃ¤rtafonden</funding-source> (E.J.).
