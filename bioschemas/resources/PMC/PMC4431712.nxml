      <abstract>
        <p>The myeloid translocation gene 16 (MTG16) co-repressor down regulates expression of multiple glycolytic genes, which are targets of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) heterodimer transcription factor that is composed of oxygen-regulated labile HIF1Î± and stable HIF1Î² subunits. For this reason, we investigated whether MTG16 might regulate HIF1 negatively contributing to inhibition of glycolysis and stimulation of mitochondrial respiration. A doxycycline Tet-On system was used to control levels of MTG16 in B-lymphoblastic Raji cells. Results from co-association studies revealed MTG16 to interact with HIF1Î±. The co-association required intact N-terminal MTG16 residues including Nervy Homology Region 1 (NHR1). Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated an association of MTG16 with hypoxia response elements (HREs) in <italic>PFKFB3</italic>, <italic>PFKFB4</italic> and <italic>PDK1</italic> promoters <italic>in-vitro</italic>. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed co-occupancy of these and other glycolytic gene promoters by HIF1Î±, HIF1Î² and MTG16 in agreement with possible involvement of these proteins in regulation of glycolytic target genes. In addition, MTG16 interacted with prolyl hydroxylase D2 and promoted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF1Î±. Our findings broaden the area of MTG co-repressor functions and reveal MTG16 to be part of a protein complex that controls the levels of HIF1Î±.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Co-repressors modulate gene expression by controlling activities of transcription factor complexes. For example, restoration/elevation of the myeloid translocation gene 16 (<bold>MTG16</bold>) co-repressor inhibited expression of key genes of glucose metabolism, which diminished glycolysis, stimulated mitochondrial respiration and decreased cell cycle activity [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The conserved MTG co-repressor gene family with similarity to <italic>Nervy</italic> in Drosophila also accommodates <bold><italic>MTG8</italic></bold> (or eight-twenty one, <italic>ETO</italic>) and MTG-related protein-1 (<bold><italic>MTGR1</italic></bold>) [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. MTG16 is the most highly expressed isoform in hematopoietic stem/progenitor, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and B cells [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Notably, all MTG genes are targets of chromosomal translocations in leukemia as fusion partners to the gene encoding the transcription factor AML1 [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Apparently, MTG co-repressors bind only indirectly to DNA, by interactions with transcription factors. The Nervy Homology Regions (NHRs) of MTG proteins are responsible for additional interactions with co-repressor proteins such as Swi-independent 3A (SIN3A), nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (N-CoR) and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT) [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The multiâprotein complexes formed recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which catalyze gene repression by lysine deacetylation of histones [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] with an essential epigenetic role in gene transcription.</p>
      <p>Mature cells normally cover energy needs for homeostasis by ATP generated through mitochondrial respiration. In contrast, neoplastic cells characteristically show low mitochondrial respiration paralleled with increased glucose uptake, lactate export and extracellular acidification, even under good oxygen supply, termed the Warburg effect [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This glycolytic switch driven by activation of oncogenes and inactivation of suppressor genes [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] supports anabolic needs for metabolic intermediates required for neoplastic cell growth [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Highly proliferating normal cells also show stimulated glycolysis, which is driven by proliferative signals from growth factors [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We discovered that the MTG16 co-repressor inhibited the glycolytic switch and stimulated mitochondrial respiration [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In support of this, expression of hypoxiaâinducible transcription factor 1 (HIF1) glycolytic target genes such as 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and PFKFB4 [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] as well as the mitochondrial respiration inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 1 (PDK1) [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were inhibited. The inhibition may involve negative regulation of HIF1 by MTG16.</p>
      <p>HIF1 is a heterodimer composed of oxygenâregulated unstable HIF1Î± and ubiquitously expressed stable HIF1Î² subunits [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. At hypoxic conditions, the oxygenâdependent proteasomal degradation of HIF1Î± is inhibited [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] permitting dimerization with HIF1Î±, binding of dimer to hypoxia response elements (HREs) and transcriptional activation of target genes [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. HIF1 controls cellular adaptation to oxygen lack [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] by activating genes that coordinate stimulated glycolysis with repressed mitochondrial respiration [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, HIF1Î± may stay active in neoplastic cells even at nonâhypoxic oxygen concentrations being activated by molecules such as pyruvate, lactate, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oncogene gain of function or suppressor gene loss of function as reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
      <p>Given our findings of MTG16âmediated inhibition of glycolysis and stimulation of mitochondrial respiration, we asked whether the MTG16 co-repressor might regulate HIF1 negatively and contribute to the inhibited expression of glycolytic genes such as <italic>PFKFB3</italic>, <italic>PFKFB4</italic> and <italic>PDK1</italic> that are down regulated when MTG16 is elevated. For support, we first determined whether MTG16 is a HIF1Î±-interacting protein. Then, we investigated whether MTG16 is part of a HIF1âcontaining protein complex at target promoters. Furthermore, we investigated whether ectopically expressed MTG16 affected HIF1Î± stability. Controlled biosynthesis of ectopically expressed MTG16 was obtained by use of a doxycyclineâregulated Tet-On time and doseâdependent gene expression system in B-lymphoblastic Raji cells [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>

Recombinant bacterial cells expressing GST, GST-HIF1Î± and GST-MTG16 were lysed in NTN buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris and 0.1%NP-40) by sonication for 10 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation 10 min at 13000 rpm. GST-HIF1Î± and GST-MTG16 were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads during rotation 2 h at 4Â°C. The beads were washed five times in NTN buffer containing 1.0 mM EDTA. Then, whole cell lysate was mixed with beads and incubated during rotation overnight at 4Â°C. After washing five times with NTN buffer containing 1.0 mM EDTA, bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer during heating at 95Â°C for 5 min and examined by Western blotting.</p>

        <title>MTG16 is a HIF1Î±âinteracting protein</title>
        <p>In order to detect a direct interaction between HIF1Î± and MTG16 and to map possible interaction domains, we used bacterially produced fusions of HIF1Î± with glutathione-S-transferase (GST). GST-HIF1Î± was recovered on glutathioneâSepharose beads and examined by SDS-PAGE. The binding of MTG16 species to HIF1Î± in cell lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with MTG16 was investigated. Results showed full length MTG16 to be pulled down by GST-HIF1Î± (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). A number of MTG16 truncation constructs were used to map sites of interaction with HIF1Î±. MTG16 residues 1â290, 1â354, 1â405 bound to GST-HIF1Î± (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). However, a construct consisting of residues 290 to 653 (lacking the NHR1 domain) was not pulled down by GST-HIF1Î±. As follows, MTG16 residues 1â290 containing NHR1 (residues 171â268) are sufficient for binding to HIF1Î±. Binding specificity was confirmed by lack of interaction of MTG16 with GST (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Furthermore, in the reverse experiment, full length HIF1Î± was pulled down by GST-MTG16 (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<bold>A.</bold> Scheme of MTG16 protein with Nervy Homology Regions (NHRs) marked. Truncation constructs investigated are also shown. <bold>B</bold>. GST pulldown assays using GST-HIF1Î± were performed on whole cell lysates (WCL) of COS-7 cells expressing MTG16 or the MTG16 truncation constructs indicated in panel A. For detection of pulled down MTG16 constructs by Western blotting (WB) two antibodies were used; Î±-MTG was raised against amino acids 31â250 of MTG8 and recognizes wild type and truncation constructs of MTG16 with intact NHR1 [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Î±-MTG16 was raised against amino acids 452â466 of MTG16 [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The MTG16 constructs pulled down by GST-HIF1Î± and detected by Î±-MTG (upper panel) are marked with stars. No signal was detected for the 290â653 construct (lane 5) as it lacks the epitope for Î±-MTG antibody. Using the same blotting membrane as in upper panel, the middle panel shows detection by Î±-MTG16 of full length MTG16 (lane 1) but not MTG16 290â653 construct (lane 5) demonstrating lack of pulldown of the latter construct. Serving as a positive control, Î±-MTG16 detected the MTG16 290â653 construct in WCL (lane 6). The third panel shows input in whole cell lysate (WCL) of the MTG16 constructs detected by Î±-MTG and marked with stars. <bold>C</bold>. To rule out unspecific binding to GST, pull-down assays using GST were performed on WCL of COS-7 cells expressing MTG16 or the MTG16 truncation constructs indicated. No pull-down was observed indicating lack of unspecific binding to GST. The WCL input of GST is shown at bottom. <bold>D</bold>. GST pull-down assays using GST-MTG16 were performed on WCL of COS-7 cells transfected with HIF1Î±. Pull-down of HIF1Î± is shown (upper lane). The lower lane shows the WCL input of GST-MTG16.

Similar experiments as in A were carried out on Raji-MTG16 cells, which were induced for 12 h with 20 ng/ml doxycycline (dox) to express MTG16 and exposed to 4% O<sub>2</sub> to induce HIF1Î±. MTG16 (precipitated with Î±-MTG) co-precipitated HIF1Î± (top panel) and the reciprocal experiment showed HIF1Î± to co-precipitate MTG16 (lower panel). The input of HIF1Î± or MTG16 in 3% of whole cell lysate is shown in lanes 2.

</title>
        <p>As MTG16 does not bind directly to DNA, indirect association might be mediated via a protein complex containing HIF1Î±. Electrophoretic mobility shift/supershift assays (EMSA) were used to examine the capacity for association with HREs in <italic>PFKFB3</italic>, <italic>PFKFB4</italic> and <italic>PDK1</italic> promoters. Biotinylated oligonucleotide probes of HRE core consensus sites with flanking regions (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from Raji-MTG16 cells incubated at 4% O<sub>2</sub> to increase HIF1 and with doxycycline for 12 h to induce production of MTG16 in order to investigate interactions between probe and protein. As a result, nuclear extract proteins showed a shift indicating binding of protein to the probes (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Binding was specific as no shift was observed in the presence of excess unlabeled competitor probe. Furthermore, protein bound to the labeled probes was âsuperâshiftedâ by Î±-MTG antibody but not with a control antibody. Our results show that MTG16 becomes associated with HREs within <italic>PFKFB3</italic>, <italic>PFKFB4</italic> and <italic>PDK1</italic> promoters. In addition to the specific shift is an unspecific bandâshift for the PDK1 and PFKFB3 promoters, which is unaffected or only weakly affected by the competitor probe (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Nonetheless, the band contains MTG16 as it is lost by super-shifting with Î±-MTG antibody. In conclusion, EMSA demonstrated a capacity of MTG16 to associate with HREs in <italic>PFKFB3</italic>, <italic>PFKFB4</italic> and <italic>PDK1</italic> promoters <italic>in-vitro</italic>.</p>

            <p>Sequences for oligonucleotide probes used containing the HIF1Î± response elements (HRE) and flanking regions of PDK1, PFKFB3 or PFKFB4 promoters are depicted. Nuclear extract was from Raji-MTG16 cells incubated with 20 ng/ml of doxycycline for 12 h to induce expression of MTG16 under exposure to 4% O<sub>2</sub> to induce HIF1Î±. The primary DNA-nuclear protein interactions are depicted by arrows marked shift and the DNA-nuclear proteinâantibody interactions are depicted by arrows marked supershift. A shift is shown for all probes that is competed for by unlabeled probe indicating specific binding of nuclear extract protein to the biotinylated probe containing the HRE. Protein bound both to PDK1, PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 probes was "superâshifted" by antibody to MTG16 (Î±-MTG) but not with antibody to CD63 (Î±-CD63) indicating binding of MTG16 to the probe. The results suggest that MTG16 may bind to HIF1Î± at the PDK1, PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 promoters. One out of three experiments performed is shown.</p>

            <title>MTG16 interacts with PHD2 and induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF1Î±.</title>
            <p>
<bold>A.</bold> Raji-MTG16 cells were co-transfected with HA-HIF1Î± and FLAG-Ubiquitinin and incubated 48 h at 4% O<sub>2</sub> with 20 ng/ml of doxycycline inducing production of MTG16. Cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti Î±-HA antibody followed by Western blotting using Î±-FLAG antibody to detect ubiquitinated HIF1Î±, which was increased in doxycycline induced cells. Middle panel shows co-precipitation of MTG16 by Î±-HA but not by Î±-Î²-actin, serving as a negative control. The lower panel shows the input of HIF1Î± in whole cell lysate. <bold>B.</bold> The intensity of the HIF1Î±-ubiquitin bands in A (top) were quantified by densitometry and expressed as HIF1Î±-ubiquitin/Î²-actin ratio. The level of ubiquitinated HIF1Î± was increased in cells incubated with doxycycline; n = 3, ***P&lt;0.001. <bold>C</bold>. Cells were incubated 12 h at 4% O<sub>2</sub> with 20 ng/ml of doxycycline to induce production of MTG16. Both MTG16 and HIF1Î± co-precipitated with prolylhydroxylase D2 (PHD2) in whole cell lysates. <bold>D.</bold> By use of Western blotting with an anti-hydroxyproline antibody to hydroxyproline-564 in HIF1Î± (Hyp-564) hydroxylation of HIF1Î± was detected within 4 h of incubation with 20 ng/ml doxycycline at 20% O<sub>2</sub>. Hours on abscissa refer to beginning of incubation with doxycycline. The expected downregulation of HIF-1Î± with time after induction of MTG16 is seen. <bold>E.</bold> Experiments were performed to detect hydroxylation of HIF1Î± also at 4% O<sub>2</sub> during incubation with 20 ng/ml doxycycline. Hours on abscissa refer to beginning of hypoxic conditions. The results confirm hydroxylation of Pro-564 in HIF1Î± by MTG16 at 4% O<sub>2</sub>. <bold>F</bold>. Cells incubated at 20% O<sub>2</sub> with and without 20 ng/ml of doxycycline to induce production of MTG16 were co-incubated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 for 24 h. The inhibitor strongly protected against degradation of HIF1Î±. <bold>G</bold>. Similar experiments as in F were performed at 4% O<sub>2</sub>. The results confirmed strong protection against MTG16âinduced degradation by MG132. The exposure of photographic film was 20 sec for A, E and G and 90 sec for D and F.</p>

        <p>A decrease in HIF1Î± protein could result from either decreased biosynthesis or increased degradation. HIF1Î± is hydroxylated on one of two conserved prolyl residues predominantly by prolyl hydroxylase domainâcontaining protein 2 (PHD2) [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] as a requisite for its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Therefore, we investigated if HIF-1Î± was ubiquitinated in response to MTG16. Raji-MTG16 cells co-transfected with HA-HIF1Î± and FLAG-ubiquitinin were incubated during exposure to 4% O<sub>2</sub> with doxycycline to induce production of MTG16. Examination of immunoprecipitated HA-HIF1Î± by Î±-FLAG antibody showed that HA-HIF1Î± ubiquitination indeed was increased by MTG16 (Fig <xref rid="pone.0123725.g008" ref-type="fig">8A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0123725.g008" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Concomitant interactions of MTG16 with HIF1Î± and PHD2 may increase the rate of hydroxylation. We investigated binding of MTG16 to PHD2 by use of IP-Western analyses in Raji-MTG16 cells incubated during exposure to 4% O<sub>2</sub> for 12 h with doxycycline to induce MTG16 production. Both MTG16 (precipitated with Î±-MTG) and HIF1Î± (precipitated with Î±-HIF1Î±) co-precipitated PHD2 in whole cell lysate (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>). This result indicates that MTG16 interacted not only with HIF1Î± but also with PHD2. As these co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with ectopically synthesized proteins they are unlikely to reflect unspecific interactions. Further support for MTG16âmediated prolyl hydroxylation of HIF1Î± was achieved by immunoblotting with an antibody that specifically recognizes hydroxyproline at residue 564 of HIF1Î± (Hyp-564-HIF1Î±). Hydroxylation of Hyp-564 was detected in Raji-MTG16 cells within 4 h of incubation with doxycycline at both 20% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8D</xref>) and 4% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8E</xref>). The expected down regulation of HIF1Î± with time after induction of MTG16 is seen in both cases. The results indicate that MTG16âmediated hydroxylation may be followed by proteasomal degradation of HIF1Î±. In support of this, the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 strongly inhibited MTG16âmediated HIF1Î± decrease both during exposure to 20% (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8F</xref>) and 4% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8G</xref>).</p>
        <p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that MTG16 reduces HIF1Î± protein levels through the prolyl hydroxylationâdependent pathway for ubiquitination and following proteasomal degradation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Published results [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] showing that MTG16 can inhibit glycolysis and stimulate mitochondrial respiration by affecting expression of some HIF1 target genes (PFKFB3/4 and PDK1), suggested a possible negative regulation of HIF1, which controls expression of glycolytic genes in response to hypoxia / tumorigenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that the MTG16 co-repressor is an opposing regulator of HIF1 by serving as a HIF1Î±-interacting protein with an amplifying effect on HIF1Î± hydroxylation and proteasomal degradation.</p>
      <p>HIF1 is usually not activated at non-hypoxic conditions except in certain neoplastic cells such as those used for the experiments in this work. The relevance of MTG16-mediated reduction of HIF1Î± observed under the non-hypoxic conditions may be questioned, as HIF1Î± was much lower than in the cells exposed to hypoxia. However, the complete degradation of HIF1Î± at 20% O<sub>2</sub> concomitant with loss of MTG16 co-occupancy of glycolytic gene promoters strengthened the role of a HIF1Î± interaction. Total degradation of HIF1Î± at 20% O<sub>2</sub> by MTG16 might reflect a low HIF1Î± level, but degradation was observed at mild hypoxia too when the HIF1Î± level is vigorously increased. The significance of this finding is strengthened by the reduced expression of HIF1Î± target genes observed in the presence of MTG16 during mild hypoxia (<xref rid="pone.0123725.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
      <p>The MTG family of co-repressors is involved in transcriptional repression [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The MTG isoforms share the evolutionary highly conserved Nervy Homology Regions (NHRs) 1 to 4 [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The finding that the N-terminal MTG16 residues including NHR1 were sufficient for the binding of HIF1Î± is consistent with this domain being a structural scaffold for multiple transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. On the other hand, the MTG16-mediated inhibition of glycolytic gene expression required intact NHR2-3 [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] consistent with that the importance of the latter modules for oligomerization, proteinâprotein interaction with other co-repressors such as N-CoR and SMRT [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and interactions with HDACs [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] required for transcriptional repression. The finding by EMSA that MTG16 associated with HREs within glycolytic gene promoters and the findings by ChIP assays that HIF1Î±-MTG16 interaction also takes place at these promoters near HRE sites indicates that MTG16 may affect transcriptional activity of HRE-bound HIF1Î±. Furthermore, recruitment of MTG16 to HREs was suggested to be HIF1Î± dependent because it was lost at 24 h of incubation with doxycycline at 20% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0123725.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) when HIF1Î± was degraded. HIF1Î± is normally kept inactive during non-hypoxic conditions by post-translational hydroxylation at conserved critical prolyl residues catalysed in particular by the prolylâhydroxylaseâdomain (PHD)âcontaining enzyme prolyl hydroxylase PHD2 [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hydroxylation is followed by ubiquitination by the von-HippelâLindau tumour suppressor protein (VHL) and proteasomal degradation of HIF1Î± [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As PHD proteins require oxygen for catalytic activity, HIF1Î± is normally stabilized and active when PHD proteins become inactivated during hypoxia [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, in contrast to normal, certain neoplastic cells show O<sub>2</sub> independent constitutive expression of HIF1Î± [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. MTG16-mediated degradation was observed both at 20% O<sub>2</sub> and during hypoxia. That MTG16 in both cases augmented recruitment of PHD2 to HIF1Î± and amplified its degradation through a PHD/VHLâdependent pathway is consistent with the combined interaction that we discovered between HIF1Î± and PHD2. The hydroxylation of Proline-564 of HIF1Î± by MTG16 observed not only at 20% O<sub>2</sub> but also at mild hypoxia is consistent with the HIF1Î± degradation observed. Earlier studies have indicated hydroxylation of HIF1Î± at Proline-564 during conditions of mild hypoxia [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
      <p>Both O<sub>2</sub>/PHD/VHLâdependent andâindependent mechanisms regulate HIF1Î± protein levels. For example, the OS-9 protein is a negative O<sub>2</sub>-dependent regulator of HIF1 that increases prolyl hydroxylation by interacting with HIF1Î± and PHDs [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Hsp70 promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF1Î± by recruiting the ubiquitin ligase CHIP [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The tumour suppressor Sirtuin 6 acts as a HIF1Î± co-repressor at glycolytic target genes through deacetylation of Lys9 of Histone 3 [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Furthermore, the mitochondrial tumour suppressor Sirtuin 3 promotes destabilization of HIF1Î± [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Our results add MTG16 as a novel negative regulator of HIF1Î±â possibly acting by a PHD/VHLâdependent mechanism. MTG16 is known as a chromatin repressor, which can bind other co-repressors and recruit HDAC [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with an epigenetic role in gene transcription. Our results indicate an additional function for MTG16 on HIF1-mediated transcription merely by degrading HIF1Î±. It remains to be investigated whether the MTG isoforms MTGR1 and MTG8 also contribute to HIF1Î± hydroxylation and proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, it may be of interest to investigate whether the leukemia fusion protein AML1-MTG16 [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] retains the MTG16 ability for degradation of HIF1Î±.</p>
      <p>The present results suggest a mechanism through which MTG16 could contribute to prolonged downregulation of glycolytic genes. This is consonant with MTG16-mediated inhibition of the expression of the glycolytic genes and the PDK1 gene concomitant with a metabolic switch towards mitochondrial respiration [<xref rid="pone.0123725.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In summary, we identified the co-repressor MTG16 to be a novel binding partner of HIF1Î± and a negative regulator of its stability. Our results depict molecular mechanisms that have a potential to modulate functional interactions between key proteins regulating the metabolism of neoplastic cells.</p>
