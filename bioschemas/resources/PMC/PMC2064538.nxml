      <abstract>
        <p>Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are core components of the spliceosome. The U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNPs each contain a common set of seven Sm proteins. Three of these Sm proteins are posttranslationally modified to contain symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA) residues within their C-terminal tails. However, the precise function of this modification in the snRNP biogenesis pathway is unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest that the methyltransferase protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is responsible for sDMA modification of Sm proteins. We found that in human cells, PRMT5 and a newly discovered type II methyltransferase, PRMT7, are each required for Sm protein sDMA modification. Furthermore, we show that the two enzymes function nonredundantly in Sm protein methylation. Lastly, we provide in vivo evidence demonstrating that Sm protein sDMA modification is required for snRNP biogenesis in human cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs) are core components of spliceosomes and are required for the catalytic steps of splicing. Most spliceosomal snRNPs, with the exception of U6, contain a common set of Sm proteins that associate with the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA (snRNA; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Matera et al., 2007</xref>). The biogenesis of Sm-class snRNPs is a highly orchestrated process that takes place in multiple cellular compartments (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Matera and Shpargel, 2006</xref>). Subsequent to transcription and nuclear export of the snRNA, the survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex mediates the assembly of snRNPs by loading Sm proteins onto the snRNA (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Meister et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Paushkin et al., 2002</xref>). The core factor within this large oligomeric complex is the SMN protein (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Meister et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Paushkin et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, mutations that reduce the level of SMN protein result in the inherited human neuromuscular disorder spinal muscular atrophy (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lefebvre et al., 1995</xref>). The molecular etiology of spinal muscular atrophy is currently unknown. Recent work suggests that the perturbation of snRNP biogenesis may be a contributing factor (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Winkler et al., 2005</xref>). However, these findings do not rule out tissue-specific functions of SMN as factors contributing to the disease pathology (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Briese et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Eggert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Rajendra et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Three of the seven Sm proteins, B/Bâ², D1, and D3, contain symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA) modifications within their C-terminal tails (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brahms et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). This posttranslational modification is catalyzed by type II protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs; for review see <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bedford and Richard, 2005</xref>). Type I enzymes catalyze the more common asymmetric dimethylarginine (aDMA) modification. PRMT5 and PRMT7 have each been shown to possess type II methyltransferase activity and to symmetrically dimethylate Sm proteins in vitro (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Branscombe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Rho et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Reduction of PRMT5 levels using RNAi correlates with a decrease in the level of Sm protein sDMA modification (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Boisvert et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, in cytoplasmic lysates, PRMT5 is found in a complex with MEP50/WD45, iCln, and Sm proteins (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Friesen et al., 2001b</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Meister et al., 2001</xref>). PRMT7 was identified more recently as a type II methyltransferase (Lee et al., 2005). Consequently, very little is known about this enzyme.</p>
      <p>The precise role of Sm protein sDMA modification in snRNP biogenesis remains unclear. Recruitment of Sm proteins to the SMN complex is thought to be facilitated by sDMA modification. Consistent with this notion, SMN binds with a much higher affinity to sDMA-modified Sm proteins (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brahms et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Friesen et al., 2001a</xref>). However, a loss of function mutation in <italic>dart5</italic>, the fly orthologue of PRMT5, is homozygous viable (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gonsalvez et al., 2006</xref>). The mutants displayed no overt defect in snRNP levels despite expressing Sm proteins that were not recognized by two sDMA-specific antibodies, SYM10 and Y12 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gonsalvez et al., 2006</xref>). To gain a better understanding of the role of Sm protein sDMA modification in snRNP biogenesis in humans, we depleted HeLa cells of PRMT5 or PRMT7 using RNAi. Surprisingly, we found that both PRMT5 and PRMT7 were required for efficient Sm protein sDMA modification. Both enzymes independently associated with Sm proteins but not with each other. In addition, we demonstrate that PRMT5 and PRMT7 do not function in an additive or redundant manner, thus suggesting a unique requirement for each methyltransferase in the Sm protein methylation pathway. Finally, we show that the symmetric dimethylation of Sm proteins is required for cytoplasmic snRNP assembly in human cells.</p>

        <title>PRMT5 and PRMT7 are required for Sm protein symmetric dimethylation</title>
        <p>To understand the specific requirement for Sm protein sDMA modification in mammals, we examined the in vivo functions of PRMT5, MEP50, and PRMT7. HeLa cells were depleted of these proteins using RNAi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). siRNAs targeting SMN or GFP were used as controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). The siRNAs directed against PRMT5, PRMT7, and SMN were able to deplete &gt;80% of their respective target proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Treatment of cells with siRNAs targeting MEP50, a PRMT5 complex member, caused a slight codepletion of PRMT5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This finding is consistent with our previous results in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>: the mutation of <italic>valois</italic> resulted in a loss of Dart5 expression (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gonsalvez et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, only specific siRNA treatments reduced the level of PRMT7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p>

        <p>We next analyzed the methylation status of Sm proteins in the depleted lysates using the sDMA-specific antibodies SYM10, SYM11, and Y12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Unmodified and asymmetrically dimethylated Sm proteins are not recognized by these antibodies (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brahms et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Boisvert et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Consistent with previous findings (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Boisvert et al., 2002</xref>), the knockdown of PRMT5 resulted in a reduction in Sm protein sDMA modification (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lane 2). A similar effect was also observed when cells were treated with siRNAs targeting MEP50 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lane 4). However, because MEP50 RNAi treatment codepletes PRMT5, we cannot conclude whether this defect in methylation is direct. Curiously, we found that PRMT7 knockdown also caused a reduction in Sm protein sDMA modification (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lane 3). Because the depletion of PRMT7 does not codeplete PRMT5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), this effect is likely to be direct.</p>

<bold>PRMT5 and PRMT7 are required for sDMA modification of Sm proteins.</bold> (A) Lysates from mock-treated (lane 1) and PRMT5 (lane 2), PRMT7 (lane 3), MEP50 (lane 4), and SMN (lane 5) siRNAâtreated cells were probed with anti-sDMA antibodies SYM10 (top), Y12 (middle), and SYM11 (bottom right). The lysates were probed with tubulin to verify load (bottom left). The open circles represent proteins that require PRMT5, MEP50, and PRMT7 for their methylation. The closed circles represent proteins that require PRMT5 and MEP50 but not PRMT7 for their methylation. The star represents a protein whose methylation status appears unaffected upon the depletion of PRMT5, MEP50, or PRMT7. (B) HeLa cells were treated with siRNAs against PRMT5 (lane 2), PRMT7 (lane 3), or both (lane 4). GFP siRNAs were used as a control (lanes 1â3). Lysates were prepared and analyzed by blotting with the indicated antibodies. (C) HeLa cells were depleted of PRMT5 (lanes 2 and 3). GFP siRNAs were used as a control (lane 1). A FLAG-PRMT7 overexpression construct was transfected into PRMT5-depleted cells (lane 3). Empty vector was transfected as a control (lanes 1 and 2). Lysates were prepared and analyzed by blotting with the indicated antibodies. The asterisk represents a protein that cross reacts with the PRMT7 antibody. (D) 1 Î¼g GST (lanes 1 and 2) or GST-SmD3 C-terminal tail (GST-D3tail; lanes 3 and 4) immobilized on glutathioneâSepharose beads was incubated for 1 h with total HeLa lysates from untreated cells (lanes 1 and 3) or cells treated with MTA (750 Î¼M for 24 h; lanes 2 and 4). The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS buffer and analyzed by blotting using the indicated antibodies.</p>

        <p>In addition to Sm proteins, SYM10 and SYM11 also recognize several uncharacterized sDMA-modified proteins (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Boisvert et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The same SYM10- and SYM11-reactive proteins were hypomethylated in the PRMT5 and MEP50 siRNAâtreated lysates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This finding was expected because PRMT5 and MEP50 are part of the same complex and also because the depletion of MEP50 codepletes PRMT5. In contrast, PRMT7 siRNA treatment resulted in the hypomethylation of only a subset of these proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Thus, PRMT5 and PRMT7 do not always act on the same substrates in vivo. Consistently, we observed that the proteinâ protein interaction profile of PRMT5 and PRMT7 was largely nonoverlapping (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200702147/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200702147/DC1</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>We next determined whether Sm proteins were sDMA modified in an additive manner by depleting cells of both PRMT5 and PRMT7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Interestingly, double depletion did not disrupt Sm protein sDMA modification to a greater extent than either single depletion alone. Thus, the two enzymes do not function additively to produce the full complement of methylated Sm proteins. We also attempted to determine whether PRMT5 and PRMT7 could functionally compensate for each other with respect to Sm protein sDMA modification (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). We found that the overexpression of PRMT7 was not able to restore sDMA modification of the Sm protein in cells that were depleted of PRMT5. Thus, PRMT7 cannot functionally substitute for PRMT5. At this time, however, we cannot conclude whether the converse is also true. Although cells depleted of PRMT7 alone show relatively little cytotoxicity, they do not survive the subsequent DNA transfection procedure. Transfection of PRMT7 siRNAâtreated cells with empty vector or a PRMT5-expressing plasmid resulted in rapid and pronounced cell death.</p>
        <p>PRMT5 has been shown to associate with the C-terminal arginine-glycine (RG)ârich tail of SmD3 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Friesen et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Meister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Meister and Fischer, 2002</xref>). Therefore, we tested for a similar association between SmD3 and PRMT7. We found that the GST-tagged C terminus of SmD3 (GST-D3tail) was able to specifically purify both PRMT5 and PRMT7 from cell lysates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Interestingly, the association between PRMT7 and GST-D3tail was unaffected by prior treatment of the cells with the methyltransferase inhibitor 5â²-deoxy-5â²-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). In contrast, a similar treatment disrupted the association between PRMT5 and GST-D3tail (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). In addition to GST-D3tail, PRMT7 is able to bind to full-length GST-SmD3 and -SmB (unpublished data). Because PRMT7 is able to associate with Sm proteins but not with PRMT5 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), these observations suggest a direct role for PRMT7 in Sm protein methylation.</p>

        <title>Cytoplasmic snRNP assembly requires the activities of both PRMT5 and PRMT7</title>
        <p>During the cytoplasmic phase of snRNP biogenesis, the SMN complex loads Sm proteins onto the Sm sites of snRNAs (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Meister et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Paushkin et al., 2002</xref>). SMN has a much higher affinity for sDMA-modified Sm proteins in comparison with unmodified or aDMA-modified Sm proteins (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brahms et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Friesen et al., 2001a</xref>). Consistent with the finding that both enzymes are required for the sDMA modification of Sm proteins, both siRNA treatments interfered with the SMNâSm interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that the SMNâSm interaction was disrupted by treatment with general methyltransferase inhibitors (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brahms et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Friesen et al., 2001a</xref>). Our current results extend these findings and demonstrate that the specific depletion of either PRMT5 or PRMT7 is able to mimic the drug treatment.</p>

<bold>sDMA modification of Sm proteins is required for efficient snRNP biogenesis.</bold> (A) HeLa cells stably expressing CFP-SmB were depleted of PRMT5 (lane 3) or PRMT7 (lane 4) using RNAi. Mock-treated cells were used as a control (lanes 1 and 2). 72 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, cytoplasmic fractions were prepared, and CFP-SmB was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal GFP antibodies (lanes 2â4). To verify binding specificity, a control myc antibody was used (lane 1). The level of coprecipitating SMN was examined (top).

        <p>To determine whether the methylation of Sm proteins is a prerequisite for efficient snRNP assembly, we treated HeLa cells with MTA. Subsequently, a pulse-chase experiment using a mixture of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and [<sup>35</sup>S]cysteine was used to examine the in vivo kinetics of snRNP assembly. The newly assembled snRNPs were immunoprecipitated using anti-trimethylguanosine (TMG)âcoated beads. Anti-TMG antibodies recognize the cap structure present on mature Sm-class snRNPs. More precisely, this assay monitors the step in snRNP biogenesis that is immediately downstream of Sm core assembly (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Matera et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, we found that MTA treatment substantially disrupted snRNP assembly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), suggesting that methylation is required for efficient snRNP biogenesis. Because MTA treatment reduced but did not completely abolish Sm protein sDMA modification (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200702147/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200702147/DC1</ext-link>), we conclude that the residual snRNPs assembled under these conditions contain methylated Sm proteins. To specifically narrow down the snRNP assembly defect to sDMA modification of Sm proteins, HeLa cells depleted of PRMT5 or PRMT7 were used in the pulse-chase assay. HeLa cells treated with siRNAs targeting SMN served as a control. Consistent with previous results (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Shpargel and Matera, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Winkler et al., 2005</xref>), the depletion of SMN severely disrupted snRNP assembly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, C and D; and Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200702147/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200702147/DC1</ext-link>). A similar disruption of snRNP assembly was also observed in cells depleted of either PRMT5 or PRMT7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, C and D; and S3). It is worth noting that snRNP assembly was disrupted to a somewhat lesser extent upon the depletion of either PRMT5 or PRMT7 as compared with SMN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). These findings are consistent with the observation that PRMT5 and PRMT7 depletion reduces but does not eliminate the SMNâSm interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).</p>
        <p>The most likely function for PRMT5 and PRMT7 in the snRNP biogenesis pathway is to enable the efficient association of SMN with Sm proteins. Therefore, we directly examined the assembly of Sm cores in control or depleted lysates. For this experiment, a HeLa strain stably expressing CFP-SmB (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sleeman et al., 2001</xref>) was used. The cells were pulsed with [<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphate. Subsequently, tagged SmB was immunoprecipitated from the labeled lysates. The associated RNAs were examined by autoradiography. As expected, the depletion of SMN considerably inhibited Sm core assembly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Likewise, the depletion of either PRMT5 or PRMT7 also resulted in a similar Sm core assembly defect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Sm protein sDMA modification is primarily required for cytoplasmic snRNP assembly</title>
        <p>The depletion of core snRNP assembly factors results in the breakdown of Cajal bodies (CBs) and the redistribution of coilin to the nucleolus (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Shpargel and Matera, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Girard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lemm et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether the depletion of PRMT5 or PRMT7 also leads to CB breakdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Consistent with these earlier studies, CBs were undetected in â¼60% of SMN-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). In contrast, roughly 30% of cells depleted of PRMT5 or PRMT7 lacked visible CBs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Also consistent with these earlier studies, coilin localized within the nucleolus in a subset of SMN-depleted cells (unpublished data). This phenotype was not observed in cells depleted of PRMT5 or PRMT7. However, in a subset of cells depleted for PRMT5, PRMT7, or SMN, coilin localized at the nucleolar periphery (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and C</xref>). Interestingly, in cells depleted of PRMT5 or PRMT7, we found that these nucleolar caps also contained SMN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref> and not depicted). Thus, in contrast to SMN depletion, PRMT5 or PRMT7 depletion produced a milder CB phenotype. One explanation for this finding is that SMN depletion results in a more severe snRNP defect than either methyltransferase deletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Alternatively, in contrast to PRMT5 and PRMT7, SMN may play additional roles in targeting imported snRNPs to CBs (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ospina et al. 2005</xref>).</p>

        <p>Finally, we tested whether Sm protein methylation was required for snRNP import using the <sup>35</sup>S pulse-chase assay. Labeled cells were harvested, and nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared. Each fraction was then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-TMG antibodyâcoated beads. TMG-positive RNPs produced during the 1.5-h pulse-chase period were nearly all located in the nuclear fraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>), suggesting that in HeLa cells, snRNP biogenesis and nuclear import occur relatively rapidly. As observed previously (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), MTA treatment disrupted snRNP assembly. However, the residual snRNPs that were assembled were present almost exclusively in the nuclear fraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Similar to MTA treatment, RNAi-mediated depletion of SMN, PRMT5, or PRMT7 resulted in snRNP assembly defects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). As with MTA treatment, the residual snRNPs that were assembled were also imported into the nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Thus, sDMA modification of Sm proteins does not play a major role in the nuclear import of snRNPs.</p>

        <p>During the preparation of this manuscript, PRMT9 was shown to possess type II methyltransferase activity and to methylate a variety of targets in vitro, including SmB (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cook et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it will be interesting to determine whether PRMT9 plays a role in Sm protein methylation and snRNP biogenesis in vivo. In addition, CARM1/PRMT4, a type I methyltransferase, was recently shown to asymmetrically dimethylate SmB in vivo (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). Because aDMA residues are found exclusively on nuclear Sm proteins (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Miranda et al., 2004</xref>), this modification is not likely to be required for the cytoplasmic phase of snRNP assembly. The aDMA modification of Sm proteins may be important for subnuclear targeting of snRNPs or for the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we have shown that two distinct methyltransferases, PRMT5 and PRMT7, are required for Sm protein sDMA modification and snRNP assembly. We envision that both enzymes function in the snRNP pathway by sDMA modification of Sm proteins, thus increasing their affinity for the SMN complex. A previous study showed that the activity of the SMN complex in Sm core assembly is stimulated by phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Grimmler et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that sDMA modification of Sm proteins also serves an important regulatory function. Thus, mammalian snRNP biogenesis is controlled by multiple posttranslational events. <italic>Drosophila</italic> may differ from mammals in this regard. Whereas PRMT5 is required for snRNP biogenesis in human cells, the loss of Dart5 does not result in decreased snRNP levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, flies also express an orthologue of PRMT7 called Dart7. Therefore, it will be interesting to test whether snRNP assembly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is independent of Sm protein sDMA modification.</p>
