      <abstract>
        <p>Loss-of-function mutations in the KCNQ4 channel cause DFNA2, a subtype of autosomal dominant non-syndromic deafness that is characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss. Previous studies have demonstrated that the majority of the pathogenic KCNQ4 mutations lead to trafficking deficiency and loss of KCNQ4 currents. Over the last two decades, various strategies have been developed to rescue trafficking deficiency of pathogenic mutants; the most exciting advances have been made by manipulating activities of molecular chaperones involved in the biogenesis and quality control of the target protein. However, such strategies have not been established for KCNQ4 mutants and little is known about the molecular chaperones governing the KCNQ4 biogenesis. To identify KCNQ4-associated molecular chaperones, a proteomic approach was used in this study. As a result, two major molecular chaperones, HSP70 and HSP90, were identified and then confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting that the HSP90 chaperone pathway might be involved in the KCNQ4 biogenesis. Manipulating chaperone expression further revealed that two different isoforms of HSP90, the inducible HSP90Î± and the constitutive HSP90Î², had opposite effects on the cellular level of the KCNQ4 channel; that HSP40, HSP70, and HOP, three key components of the HSP90 chaperone pathway, were crucial in facilitating KCNQ4 biogenesis. In contrast, CHIP, a major E3 ubiquitin ligase, had an opposite effect. Collectively, our data suggest that HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² play key roles in controlling KCNQ4 homeostasis via the HSP40-HSP70-HOP-HSP90 chaperone pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Most importantly, we found that over-expression of HSP90Î² significantly improved cell surface expression of the trafficking-deficient, pathogenic KCNQ4 mutants L274H and W276S. KCNQ4 surface expression was restored by HSP90Î² in cells mimicking heterozygous conditions of the DFNA2 patients, even though it was not sufficient to rescue the function of KCNQ4 channels.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ4 plays a pivotal role in maintaining cochlear ion homeostasis and regulating hair cell membrane potential, both essential for normal auditory function <xref rid="pone.0057282-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0057282-Wangemann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Mutations in the KCNQ4 gene cause progressive sensorineural hearing loss in the DFNA2 patients <xref rid="pone.0057282-Kharkovets1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057282-Kubisch1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057282-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. To date, more than fifteen pathogenic KCNQ4 mutations have been identified and the majority of these mutations lead to decreased cell surface expression and loss of KCNQ4 currents <xref rid="pone.0057282-Kubisch1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057282-Talebizadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0057282-Namba1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Despite the significance of the KCNQ4 biogenesis, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control the process, which hinders the development of strategies to prevent and treat hearing loss of DFNA2 patients.</p>
      <p>KCNQ4 channels contain six transmembrane domains, a pore-forming region, and two intracellular termini <xref rid="pone.0057282-Robbins1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. To become functionally active, KCNQ4 subunits must fold and assemble to tetrameric channels and translocate to specific locations on the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0057282-Deutsch1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In human cells, these processes are controlled by a sophisticated molecular chaperone network <xref rid="pone.0057282-Hartl1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. To identify molecular chaperones that are involved in KCNQ4 biogenesis, a proteomic analysis was first conducted in this study. As a result, two major molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP90 were detected as KCNQ4-interacting proteins, suggesting that the biogenesis of the KCNQ4 channel may be controlled by the HSP90 chaperone pathway <xref rid="pone.0057282-Hartl1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057282-Pratt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>
</p>
      <p>Structural maturation of a HSP90 client requires the assistance of a specific set of chaperones and cochaperone. In most cases, HSP40, HSP70, and HOP are required in addition to HSP90 <xref rid="pone.0057282-Hartl1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0057282-Zuehlke1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The requirement for a specific chaperone or cochaperone is client specific. For steroid hormone receptors, the most studied client of HSP90, cochaperone p23 is also required <xref rid="pone.0057282-Pratt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057282-Taipale1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In a current model, a newly synthesized polypeptide first interacts with HSP40 and HSP70 to form the initial receptor-chaperone complex; transfer of a receptor protein from HSP70 to HSP90 is facilitated by the cochaperone HOP, which is able to simultaneously bind HSP70 and HSP90 through separate tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. Binding of P23 to the chaperone complex promotes receptor maturation and dissociation of the complex after ATP hydrolysis <xref rid="pone.0057282-Pratt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057282-Taipale1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>HSP90 is not required for de novo folding of most proteins, but it is essential for the structural maturation of a subset of proteins with multiple domains <xref rid="pone.0057282-Hartl1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, including protein kinases, steroid hormone receptors, transcriptional factors, telomerase reverse transcriptase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) etc. <xref rid="pone.0057282-Taipale1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The role of HSP90 in the biogenesis of membrane proteins, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the ClC-2 chloride channel <xref rid="pone.0057282-Hinzpeter1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, the voltage-gated potassium channel hERG, and the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K<sub>ATP</sub>) is also established <xref rid="pone.0057282-Hinzpeter1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0057282-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Most importantly, recent studies have demonstrated that manipulating HSP90 function can be used to treat human diseases caused by misfolding and trafficking deficiency of mutant proteins <xref rid="pone.0057282-Dennis1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0057282-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we first verified that the KCNQ4 channel is a client protein of the molecular chaperone HSP90. Then, we tested whether HSP40, HSP70 and HOP, three key components of the HSP90 chaperone pathway, are required for the KCNQ4 biogenesis. In addition, we explored the potential of HSP40, HSP70, and HSP90 in rescuing surface expression of two trafficking-deficient DFNA2 mutants, L274H and W276S. Finally, we examined the effects of these mutations on the conductance of the KCNQ4 channel in HEK293T cells in which KCNQ4 surface expression was restored.</p>

        <title>Identification of Molecular Chaperones Associated with KCNQ4 Channels</title>
        <p>HA-KCNQ4 was expressed in HEK293T cells. Proteins associated with KCNQ4 subunits were affinity purified and identified by LC-MS/MS. The experiment was conducted in triplicate and in parallel with three negative control experiments in which HEK293T cell were transfected by vector DNAs. HSP70 was identified in all three replicates, while HSP90 was detected in one of three individual experiments. Specifically, a total 31 unique spectrums were detected for HSP70, representing 48% sequence coverage. On the other hand, only two unique spectrums were identified for HSP90, corresponding to 5% of the amino acid sequence common to both the inducible HSP90Î± and the constitutive HSP90Î². Since interactions between molecular chaperones and their clients are highly dynamic <xref rid="pone.0057282-Taipale1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057282-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, we considered both HSP70 and HSP90 potential KCNQ4 interacting proteins. In addition, we previously identified HSP40 as a KCNQ4 interacting protein in a yeast-two-hybrid screen. These data suggested that the KCNQ4 biogenesis might be controlled by the HSP40-HSP70-HSP90 chaperone pathway.</p>

        <title>Roles of HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² in KCNQ4 Biogenesis</title>
        <p>To determine whether HSP90 is involved in KCNQ4 biogenesis, we first conducted reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays in transfected HEK293T cells to confirm the interaction between KCNQ4 and two HSP90 isoforms. Western blot showed that both HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² co-precipitated with KCNQ4 proteins; conversely, KCNQ4 proteins were detected in HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057282-g001">Figure 1</xref>, A. and B.), which confirmed that HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² physically interact with KCNQ4 proteins. Next, we examined the effects of HSP90Î± or HSP90Î² knockdown on the total amount of the KCNQ4 channel (<bold>total KCNQ4 level</bold>), using siRNAs specifically targeting HSP90Î± or HSP90Î². Surprisingly, we found that knockdown of two different HSP90 isoforms had opposite effects on total KCNQ4 level. Specifically, knockdown of HSP90Î² led to a dramatic decrease; while knockdown of HSP90Î± resulted in a marked increase in total KCNQ4 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057282-g001">Figure 1</xref>, E. and F.). Consistent with these results, over-expression of HSP90Î² increased; whereas up-regulation of HSP90Î± expression decreased total KCNQ4 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057282-g001">Figure 1</xref>, C. and D.).</p>

        <p>Three lines of experiments were conducted to test whether these key components of the HSP90 chaperone pathway were required for KCNQ4 biogenesis. Both the constitutive and inducible isoforms of HSP40 and HSP70 were tested. Co-immunoprecipitation data showed that DjA1 and HSC70, the constitutive isoforms of HSP40 and HSP70, were physically associated with KCNQ4 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057282-g002">Figures 2</xref>, A. and B.).

D. E. and F.). Similarly, manipulating expression of DjA2 and HSP70, the inducible isoforms of HSP40 and HSP70, had the same effects on total KCNQ4 level (data not shown), indicating that HSC70 and HSP70 are functionally interchangeable in promoting KCNQ4 biogenesis; so are the cofactors DjA1 and DjA2.

        <title>HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² - Key Players in Maintaining KCNQ4 Homeostasis</title>
        <p>Mechanisms that control the balance between biosynthesis and degradation of HSP90 client proteins are not yet well-understood. However, advances were made in a recent study <xref rid="pone.0057282-Kundrat1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Kundrat and Regan demonstrated that HSP90 client proteins have much higher probability for folding than degradation under normal growth conditions; when a client protein cannot be folded properly due to HSP90 inhibition, a genetic mutation, or a cellular stressor, it will have a greater chance to interact with HSP70-CHIP complexes and therefore to be selected for ubiquitin-dependent degradation <xref rid="pone.0057282-Theodoraki1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057282-Kundrat1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Based on these findings and our data in this study, we propose the following hypothesis. Under normal growth condition, when the constitutive HSP90Î² is the major HSP90 isoform, the folding and maturation of KCNQ4 channels are mainly via the HSP40-HSP70-HOP-<bold>HSP90Î²</bold> pathway. However, when HSP90Î± expression is elevated due to induction or heterologous expression, HSP90Î± replaces HSP90Î² in the HSP90 chaperone pathway and the structural maturation of KCNQ4 channels would proceed through the HSP40-HSP70-HOP-<bold>HSP90Î±</bold> pathway, in which KCNQ4 channels is more likely to associate with HSP70-CHIP complexes and to be targeted for degradation via ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Thus, the relative abundance of HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² is a key factor controlling KCNQ4 homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Rescue of KCNQ4 Mutants in Cells Mimicking Heterozygous Condition of DFNA2 Patients</title>
        <p>The WT KCNQ4 channel was co-expressed with a mutant channel at a ratio of 1 to 1 to mimic the heterozygous condition of the DFNA2 patients. Surface KCNQ4 channels were isolated by affinity purification from HEK293T cells expressing WT/L274H+HSP90Î² and those expressing WT/W276S+HSP90Î². In both cases, Western blot showed that KCNQ4 surface expression could be restored to the WT level by HSP90Î² over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057282-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, to assess the functional effects of HSP90 over-expression, whole-cell currents were recorded under similar conditions. No significant improvement in average current density was observed in HEK293T cells in which KCNQ4 surface expression was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057282-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Specifically, the average current density was 31.37 Â± 1.20 pA/pF (nâ=â30) for the WT alone and 42.07 pA/pF Â±5.13 (nâ=â6) for WT/HSP90Î², but 16.81 Â± 3.45 pA/pF (nâ=â6) for L274H, 16.46 pA/pF Â±3.06 (nâ=â6) for L274H/HSP90Î², 16.56 Â± 2.40 pA/pF (nâ=â10) for WT/L274H, and 19.46 Â± 2.0 pA/pF (nâ=â 10) for WT/L274H/HSP90Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057282-g006">Figure 6</xref>, AâF and L). Moreover, the average current density was 15.77 Â± 1.71 pA/pF (nâ=â5) for W276S, 16.13 pA/pF Â±4.20 (nâ=â6) for W276S/HSP90Î², 21.04 Â± 4.0 pA/pF (nâ=â6) for WT/W276S, and 21.21 Â± 3.12 pA/pF (nâ=â 6) for WT/W276S/HSP90Î², while it was 6.31 Â± 1. 01 pA/pF (nâ=â5) for non-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057282-g006">Figure 6</xref>, GâL). Therefore, our data demonstrated that the restoration of cell surface expression do not lead to the functional rescue of these two KCNQ4 mutants, indicating that both L274H and W276S disrupt not only surface expression but also the conductance of the KCNQ4 channel.</p>

        <p>In this study, we demonstrated that the biogenesis of the KCNQ4 channel is controlled by the HSP40-HSP70-HOP-HSP90 chaperone pathways. The cellular level of the KCNQ4 channel depends on the relative abundance of HSP90Î± and HSP90Î², which have opposite effects on KCNQ4 biosynthesis. HSP90 has recently emerged as a promising drug target for the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding <xref rid="pone.0057282-Taipale1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057282-Tsutsumi1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057282-Trepel1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0057282-Neckers1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>; comprehensive understanding of the isoform difference of HSP90 is fundamental for the rational design of specific and effective therapeutic interventions. We also showed that cell surface expression of the KCNQ4 channel can be restored to the normal level in the cells mimicking the heterozygous conditions of DFNA2 patients, even though the restoration of surface expression did not lead to functional rescue. L274H and W276S are located in the pore helix of the KCNQ4 channel; our data confirm that both L274 and W276 are critical in maintaining the integrity of the K+-permeable pore and KCNQ4 functions. The findings in this study therefore laid important groundwork for future research towards functional rescue of KCNQ4 mutants and hearing restoration of DFNA2 patients.</p>
