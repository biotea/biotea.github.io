      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Nine neurodegenerative diseases are caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in different proteins, like huntingtin in Huntingtonâs disease (HD) and ataxin-3 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Age-at-onset decreases with increasing polyglutamine length in these proteins and the normal length is also polymorphic<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. PolyQ expansions drive pathogenesis in these diseases, as isolated polyQ tracts are toxic, and an N-terminal huntingtin fragment comprising exon 1, which occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> due to alternative splicing<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, causes toxicity. While such mutant proteins are aggregate-prone<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, toxicity is also associated with soluble forms of the proteins<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. The function of the polyQ tracts in many normal/wild-type cytoplasmic proteins is unclear. One such protein is the deubiquitinating enzyme ataxin 3<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, which is widely expressed in the brain<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Here we show that the polyQ domain in wild-type ataxin-3 enables its interaction with beclin 1, a key autophagy initiator<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. This interaction allows the deubiquitinase activity of ataxin-3 to protect beclin 1 from proteasome-mediated degradation and thus enables autophagy. Starvation-induced autophagy, which is regulated by beclin 1, was particularly inhibited in ataxin-3-depleted human cell-lines, primary neurons and <italic>in-vivo</italic>. This activity of ataxin-3 and its interaction with beclin 1 mediated by its polyQ domain was competed by other soluble proteins with polyQ tracts in a length-dependent fashion. This resulted in impaired starvation-induced autophagy in cells expressing mutant huntingtin exon 1, which was also recapitulated in the brain of HD mouse model and in patient cells. A similar phenomenon was also seen with other polyQ disease proteins, including mutant ataxin-3 itself. Our data thus describe a specific function for a wild-type polyQ tract which is abrogated by a competing longer polyQ mutation in a disease protein. This also reveals a deleterious function of such mutations distinct from their aggregation propensity.</p>

    <p id="P2">Autophagy induction enhances the clearance of polyQ-expanded proteins, like mutant huntingtin and ataxin 3, thereby attenuating their toxicities<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. To understand the interplay between polyQ-containing proteins and autophagy, we investigated if wild-type ataxin-3 affects this process. Conjugation of the autophagy protein (Atg) Atg8/LC3-I to phosphatidylethanolamine on autophagosomal membranes forms LC3-II. Hence, LC3-II levels (relative to loading controls like actin) correlate with autophagosome load<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Ataxin-3 knockdown in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) lowered LC3-II levels in the presence of bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). As BafA1 inhibits LC3-II degradation, this suggests that ataxin-3 knockdown impaired autophagosome synthesis. Decreased LC3-II levels (but not LC3-I) were also observed in ataxin-3-depleted, BafA1-treated, neurons in starvation media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Moreover, ataxin-3 knockdown in HeLa cells lowered LC3-II levels and increased the levels of the autophagy substrate, p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1 b,c</xref>). Ataxin-3 knockdown decreased the number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes scored with mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3, consistent with impaired autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P3">The decreased autophagosome biogenesis following ataxin-3 knockdown was associated with lower beclin 1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) formed by the beclin 1/VPS34 complex is particularly important for autophagy induction (LC3-II formation in BafA1) after nutrient depletion and such defects are seen in cells with monoallelic <italic>beclin 1</italic> deletion<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Decreased PI3P-positive structures in starvation, characteristic of beclin 1-depletion<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> were seen in ataxin-3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). In both fed and starved conditions, loading back exogenous PI3P to ataxin-3-depleted cells increased LC3 vesicle numbers to levels comparable to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2 a,b</xref>). Ataxin-3 overexpression increased the numbers of puncta positive for the PI3P-binding autophagy effector, WIPI2, which binds to PI3P at autophagy initiation membranes<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. This effect was reversed when ataxin-3 overexpressing cells were treated with the PI3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). After fasting mice, livers depleted of ataxin-3 failed to upregulate beclin 1 and LC3-II levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>) and had increased p62 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2 e,f</xref>), compared to wild-types. Therefore, ataxin-3 knockdown decreases beclin 1 levels, which can explain reduced PI3P levels and consequent impaired autophagosome biogenesis.</p>
    <p id="P4">As ataxin-3 interacted with beclin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), we tested if ataxin-3 deubiquitinase activity protected beclin 1 from proteasomal degradation. Beclin 1 levels declined more in ataxin-3-depleted cells, compared to controls, after inhibition of protein synthesis, suggesting accelerated beclin 1 turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Beclin 1 levels were restored in ataxin-3 knockdown cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>) and when ataxin-3-depleted cells were transfected with wild-type ataxin-3 but not with ubiquitin protease dead mutant (C14A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). Under proteasome inhibition, endogenous beclin 1 ubiquitination was increased when ataxin-3 was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>), and recombinant ataxin-3 but not the protease dead mutant (C14A) deubiquitinated beclin 1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 3 e,f</xref> showing beclin 1 selectivity). The percentage of cells with mutant huntingtin exon 1 aggregates correlates with levels of this protein and decreases when autophagy is induced<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Consistent with autophagy induction, overexpression of wild-type (but not C14A) ataxin-3 decreased the percentage of such mutant huntingtin-expressing cells with aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3g</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">Our mass spectrometry analysis and others<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> suggested beclin 1 lysine 402 was modified with a lysine 48 (K48) ubiquitin chain, a signal for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4 a,b</xref>). Lysine 402 in the evolutionary conserved domain (ECD) is conserved in fish, mouse and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). K48-linked beclin 1 polyubiquitination was increased by ataxin-3 depletion and mutation of lysine 402 to arginine (K402R) decreased K48-linked beclin 1 polyubiquitination, confirming K402 as a site for K48 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Consequently, the levels of K402R beclin 1 were already more abundant than wild-type beclin 1 in cells and did not further increase after treatment with proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig 4c</xref>). Ataxin-3 expression in HeLa cells increased wild-type beclin 1 levels and did not increase levels of beclin 1 K402R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). This correlated with more autophagy with beclin 1 K402R compared to wild-type overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">Deletion of the polyQ domain from ataxin-3 dramatically reduced its binding to beclin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and an isolated polyQ stretch was sufficient to bind beclin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus, the polyQ domain is important for the ataxin-3-beclin 1 interaction, but is not the only binding domain. The beclin l ECD interacted with ataxin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and also bound the polyQ tract alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>), suggesting that beclin 1 ECD contained polyQ-binding domains, consistent with structural docking models revealing two highly scored polyQ-binding pockets in the beclin 1 ECD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5 b-e</xref>). As some binding was observed with beclin 1 lacking the ECD, other domains of beclin 1 may also interact with ataxin-3.</p>
    <p id="P7">GFP-tagged isolated polyQ tracts could bind to beclin 1, while longer stretches (Q81) bound beclin 1 more strongly than shorter tracts (Q35) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Remarkably, beclin 1 K48-polyubiquitination was increased in cells overexpressing GFP Q35 versus empty GFP, and was increased even further with GFP Q81 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), consistent with a model where these constructs compete with the ataxin-3 polyQ stretch for binding and deubiquitination of beclin 1. Indeed, overexpression of GFP-polyQ constructs decreased ataxin-3-beclin 1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). GFP Q35 (which does not aggregate in our conditions) decreased beclin 1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>), impaired starvation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a, d, e</xref>) and increased p62 levels in starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>). No change in the number of LC3-II vesicles was observed when the Q35 tract was expressed in beclin 1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6 c-e</xref>) and the inhibitory effect of Q35 on beclin 1 levels and autophagy in beclin 1-expressing cells was rescued by ataxin-3 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>), compatible with the model that the Q35 acts by impairing ataxin-3 control of beclin 1 levels.</p>
    <p id="P8">A wild-type (Q17) huntingtin fragment (N-terminal 350 residues) bound to beclin 1 and this interaction was largely lost when the polyQ stretch was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). Furthermore, mutant polyQ-expanded, full-length huntingtin competed with wild-type ataxin-3 for beclin 1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>). To test the general principle on autophagy, we used an N-terminal exon 1 fragment to exclude any confounding effects of the huntingtin C-terminus on autophagy<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. In stable-inducible HEK293 cells expressing wild-type (Q23) and mutant (Q74) huntingtin exon 1 at similar levels (where there is no overt toxicity or aggregation (&lt;1%) during the experiment), we observed lower beclin 1 levels and impaired starvation-induced autophagy, after switching on the huntingtin transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7 c-e</xref>). These effects were more pronounced in mutant cells. As these phenomena occur in both wild-type Q23-huntingtin cells and Q35-expressing cells, they cannot simply be explained by beclin 1 sequestration into aggregates<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P9">Next, we studied cell lines derived from the striatum, the brain region most sensitive to the HD mutation, from heterozygous mutant huntingtin (Q7/Q111) and matched wild-type huntingtin knock-in mice (Q7/Q7) both humanised for huntingtin exon 1<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Mutant huntingtin striatal-derived cells (Q7/Q111) had lower beclin 1 levels and defects in starvation-induction of WIPI2 dots and LC3-II levels, compared to wild-type cells (Q7/Q7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8 a-c</xref>). Likewise, brains from young mutant huntingtin exon 1 transgenic mice, when there is minimal overt aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8d</xref>), had decreased beclin 1 levels in fasting conditions, failed to upregulate LC3-II with fasting, and had increased p62 levels, compared to wild-type littermate brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8 e-g</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">We then tested if this mechanism applied to mutant ataxin-3, as decreased beclin 1 levels are seen in SCA3 rodent models<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Expansion of the polyQ domain in ataxin-3 decreased its deubiquitinase activity towards beclin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). Transfecting expanded ataxin-3 Q84 into ataxin-3 knockdown cells partially rescued LC3 dot numbers but was not as effective as wild-type ataxin-3 Q28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9 b-c</xref>), consistent with decreased deubiquitinase activity of the mutant protein. However, the ÎpolyQ ataxin-3 did not rescue the number of LC3 dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9 b-c</xref>). When overexpressed in cells, mutant ataxin-3 had a stronger interaction with beclin 1, associated with increased beclin 1 K48 polyubiquitination, while no obvious change was observed in beclin 1 K63 polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9d</xref>). Thus, the longer polyQ stretches in mutant ataxin-3 bind beclin 1 more strongly than wild-type ataxin-3 but the mutant protein also has decreased deubiquitinase activity. This likely results in a partial dominant-negative effect of mutant ataxin-3 towards beclin 1 levels, with similar consequences on this autophagy pathway as observed with mutant huntingtin fragments.</p>
    <p id="P11">Apart from mutant huntingtin and ataxin-3, beclin 1 also interacted with atrophin-1 and the androgen receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10 a,b</xref>) that are mutated in the polyQ diseases dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, respectively. PolyQ-expanded atrophin-1 and androgen receptor showed increased interactions with beclin 1 that elevated beclin 1 K48-polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10 a,b</xref>). Finally, we observed decreased beclin 1 levels and impaired starvation-induced autophagy in fibroblasts derived from DRPLA, SCA3 and HD patients, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 e-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10 c-g</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">Our data reveal novel roles for polyQ tracts in health and disease. The wild-type ataxin-3 polyQ stretch is required for binding to beclin 1 that enables deubiquitination of this key autophagy inducer<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and protects it from proteasome-mediated degradation. Importantly, this wild-type polyQ-mediated interaction was competed for by diverse disease proteins with polyQ expansion mutations. The observed defect in starvation-induced autophagy caused by mutant polyQ proteins may reflect a less obvious impairment of basal autophagy, which is magnified under starvation conditions. This may contribute to late-onset polyQ diseases, where a relatively subtle defect is tolerated for decades prior to disease onset, and where the toxic mutant protein itself is an autophagy substrate.</p>

HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 and HeLa cells stably expressing mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 reporter were cultured in basal media supplemented with 500 Î¼g/ml G418 (Sigma). For creation of mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 stable cell lines, mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 (construct from Jian Lin<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) was cloned into pIRESneo using EcoR1 and SacII sites. The construct was transfected into HeLa cells, and transfected cells were selected using G418. Single cell clones were generated be FACS sorting and cell lines showing moderate expression levels were selected. mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 monitors autophagic flux, since mWasabi (green) fluorescence is quenched when autophagosomes are acidified following fusion with lysosomes. Stable-inducible HEK293 cells expressing wild-type (Q23) or mutant (Q74) huntingtin (HTT) exon 1 were generated by cloning GFP-HTT (mutant or wild-type) from eGFP-C1 into pCDNA5/TO using Xba1 and ApaI restriction sites. These constructs were linearised with MfeI and transfected into T-Rex-293 cells (Thermo Fisher) which stably express the tetracycline repressor protein. Transfected cells were selected by addition of hygromycin. Single cells clones were generated which showed expression of GFP-HTT only in the presence of doxycycline, and to enable comparison, with similar levels of HTT expression. HeLa cells (source ATCC) and HEK293 cells (source ECACC) were authenticated by STR profiling and were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. In some experiments, cells were starved in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) media (Invitrogen) for 4 hr with or without 400 nM of bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) (Sigma).

C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were depleted of ataxin-3 in the liver using the ThermoFisher Invivofectamine 3.0 system. The siRNA duplex solution was prepared and diluted to 2.4 mg/ml according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Preparation of the final injection solution was also in accordance with the Thermofisher protocol. Briefly, siRNA (Control/scrambled siRNA #4457289; ataxin-3 siRNA #4457308) was mixed with the complexation buffer and then the Invivfectamine 3.0 reagent (#IVF3005, ThermoFisher). The ataxin-3 siRNA was an Ambion pre-designed sequence: Sense (5-3): GCAUCGACCAAAACUUAUUtt; Antisense (5-3): AAUAAGUUUUGGUCGAUGCat. The solution was vortexed, incubated at 50Â°C for 30 minutes and then diluted in PBS. The solution was stored at 4Â°C and later up to 200 Âµl was injected in the lateral caudal vein at a final concentration of 1 mg/kg. Mice were monitored for any adverse side effects briefly after injection with none observed. Mice used were female, weighing approximately 20 grams at the age of 6 weeks. Mice were randomly selected for injection with control or targeting siRNA and were matched by weight. The knockdown was left for 5 days. In the 4th day, the mice fasted and were deprived of food for a total period of 24 hr with free access to water throughout the procedure. Livers from these mice were dissected, homogenised and resuspended in tissue lysis buffer on ice (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail) and the supernatant was centrifuged twice. Proteins were resolved in SDS-page for further analysis. The same control was loaded on each gel and the samples were normalised to that same control on the same gel allowing the comparison between multiple samples. The animal experiments did not involve behavioural testing but focussed on biochemistry, thus the samples were not blinded at this stage as we wanted to be able to load the gels in a suitable order.</p>

Briefly, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 20 Î¼M digitonin in buffer A (20 mM Pipes pH 6.8, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl). Then cells were blocked with buffer A supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS and 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. Anti-PI3P antibodies from Echelon (for 1 h, 1:300) and secondary antibodies were applied in buffer A with 5% FBS.

For WIPI2 staining, cells were grown on coverslips at 60% confluency and were incubated in EBSS for 1h. Then cells in 1ml EBSS were fixed by the addition of 1 ml 4% paraformaldehyde to a final concentration of 2% and incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton. 1% BSA PBS solution was used for blocking before adding primary antibody (mouse anti-WIPI2, 1:100 Abcam #ab105459). A Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope was utilised for fluorescent confocal analysis. All confocal images were taken with a 63X oil-immersion lens. Microscopy assays (e.g. dot quantification) were performed by selecting fields based on nuclear and GFP staining (with the channel for the dots turned off) - thus the operator was blinded to the outcome of the experiment when selecting suitably similar fields to image for subsequent computerised analysis. ImageJ was used for the analysis (number of vesicles/dots). For the analysis of WIPI2 dots that involved different cell lines in different conditions, we used a custom-designed image-processing pipeline in ImageJ. First, an estimation of the cytoplasmic area was made by simultaneously expanding an area from each nuclear centroid, until a neighbouring expansion is detected. The resulting mask represents individual cells and was subsequently used to identify WIPI2 dots. Identification of the dots started by reducing cytoplasmic background signal through application of a Gaussian convolution filter. The resulting image is then binarized according to the Chow and Kaneko adaptive thresholding method. Subsequently, connected or clustered dots are separated using a classic watershed segmentation algorithm. Consecutive quantification and feature extraction is then performed on all dots that meet set size parameters.
