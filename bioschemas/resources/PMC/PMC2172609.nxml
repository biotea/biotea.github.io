      <abstract>
        <p>As observed previously, tetraspanin palmitoylation promotes tetraspanin microdomain assembly. Here, we show that palmitoylated integrins (Î±3, Î±6, and Î²4 subunits) and tetraspanins (CD9, CD81, and CD63) coexist in substantially overlapping complexes. Removal of Î²4 palmitoylation sites markedly impaired cell spreading and signaling through p130Cas on laminin substrate. Also in palmitoylation-deficient Î²4, secondary associations with tetraspanins (CD9, CD81, and CD63) were diminished and cell surface CD9 clustering was decreased, whereas core Î±6Î²4âCD151 complex formation was unaltered. There is also a functional connection between CD9 and Î²4 integrins, as evidenced by anti-CD9 antibody effects on Î²4-dependent cell spreading. Notably, Î²4 palmitoylation neither increased localization into âlight membraneâ fractions of sucrose gradients nor decreased solubility in nonionic detergentsâhence it does not promote lipid raft association. Instead, palmitoylation of Î²4 (and of the closely associated tetraspanin CD151) promotes CD151âÎ±6Î²4 incorporation into a network of secondary tetraspanin interactions (with CD9, CD81, CD63, etc.), which provides a novel framework for functional regulation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Î±6Î²4 integrin appears on epithelial and other types of cells, acts as a receptor for basement membrane laminin-5 and related laminin isoforms, and plays a key role during cell migration and tumorigenesis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Belkin and Stepp, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Mercurio et al., 2001</xref>). In response to EGF receptor (EGFR) stimulation, Î±6Î²4 disconnects from the intermediate filament cytoskeleton and becomes associated with the actin cytoskeleton in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Mercurio et al., 2001</xref>). During this process, EGFR signaling might activate the Src family kinase fyn, leading to phosphorylation of Î²4 on tyrosine (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mainiero et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mariotti et al., 2001</xref>), or might activate conventional PKC, leading to Î²4 phosphorylation on serine (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rabinovitz et al., 1999</xref>). Consistent with cooperative signaling between Î±6Î²4 and growth factor receptors, Î±6Î²4 has been suggested to physically associate with fyn (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mariotti et al., 2001</xref>), EGFR (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mariotti et al., 2001</xref>), ErbB2 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gambaletta et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hintermann et al., 2001</xref>), c-met (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Trusolino et al., 2001</xref>), and Ron (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Santoro et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The laminin-binding integrins (Î±6Î²4, Î±3Î²1, Î±6Î²1, and Î±7Î²1) not only form a distinct subgroup among integrins in terms of amino acid sequence similarity, but also show robust association with tetraspanin proteins (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hemler, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski, 2001</xref>). There are 32 mammalian tetraspanins, and at least a few of these are abundantly present on nearly all cell and tissue types. Tetraspanin proteins regulate cell motility, morphology, fusion, and signaling in the brain and immune system, on tumors, and elsewhere (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Levy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Boucheix and Rubinstein, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hemler, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Stipp et al., 2003b</xref>). Tetraspanins CD151, CD81, and CD9 can modulate Î±3Î²1 and Î±6Î²1 integrinâdependent neurite outgrowth, cell migration, and/or cell morphology (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">YÃ¡nez-MÃ³ et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yauch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Stipp and Hemler, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kazarov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Of particular relevance here, CD151 associates with Î±6Î²4 to regulate kidney epithelial cell morphology (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), whereas CD9âÎ±6Î²4 complexes may affect primary keratinocyte cell motility (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baudoux et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Associations of tetraspanins with each other are at least partly stabilized by palmitoylation. Mutation of CD9 palmitoylation sites impaired associations with tetraspanins CD81 and CD53 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Charrin et al., 2002</xref>), and loss of CD151 palmitoylation decreased association with other tetraspanins (CD81, CD63, and CD9), without affecting integrin Î±3Î²1 association (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Palmitoylation of CD151 contributes to cell signaling (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>). In some proteins (e.g., G proteins and Src family kinases), palmitoylation leads to the diminished detergent solubility and lower protein density characteristic of lipid raft association (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dunphy and Linder, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Resh, 1999</xref>). However, palmitoylation of tetraspanins CD9 and CD151 causes neither decreased protein density in sucrose gradients nor decreased detergent solubility (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Charrin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>The Î±6Î²4 integrin, like other laminin-binding integrins, associates strongly with CD151 (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sterk et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). CD151 association with laminin-binding integrins is direct, occurs early in biosynthesis, and is resistant to disruption by nonionic detergents (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Yauch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kazarov et al., 2002</xref>). Removal of CD151 palmitoylation sites did not disrupt the CD151âÎ±6Î²4 complex in epithelial cells, but did strongly influence Î±6Î²4 integrinâdependent cell morphology (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast to the primary (i.e., direct) associations of Î±3 and Î±6 integrins with CD151, there is an extended network of secondary (i.e., most likely indirect) associations with other tetraspanins (e.g., CD9, CD81, and CD63) that occur later in biosynthesis and are more sensitive to nonionic detergents (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kazarov et al., 2002</xref>). These secondary-type associations are impaired upon removal of CD151 or CD9 palmitoylation sites (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Charrin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>The integrin Î²4 subunit was recently shown also to be palmitoylated (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gagnoux-Palacios et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we provide evidence for palmitoylation of integrins Î±3, Î±6, and Î²4, and show striking parallels between Î²4 integrin and CD151 palmitoylations, in terms of effects on (1) core complex (CD151âÎ±6Î²4) formation, (2) secondary complex formation (involving CD9, CD81, and CD63), (3) integrin density, (4) integrin solubility, (5) integrin-dependent cell morphology, and (6) integrin signaling. Our results are in sharp contrast to previous suggestions that Î²4 palmitoylation promotes lipid raft and Src family kinase association (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mariotti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gagnoux-Palacios et al., 2003</xref>). We suggest that integrin palmitoylation promotes, instead of lipid rafts, assembly of a novel type of signaling platform enriched for palmitoylated tetraspanins.</p>

        <title>A network of palmitoylated integrins and palmitoylated tetraspanins</title>
        <p>While studying palmitoylated CD151 (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), we noticed that it associates with palmitoylated proteins resembling the Î²4, Î±3, and Î±6 integrin subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, lanes 3 and 4). [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate-labeled integrin subunits from [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate-labeled MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells were more abundant on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, lane 3) than intracellularly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, lane 4), and were not present in tetraspanin CD82 immunoprecipitations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, lanes 1 and 2). Integrin palmitoylation was confirmed by recovery of [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate-labeled Î±3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B, lane 5), Î±6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B, lanes 6 and 8), and Î²4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B, lane 6), but not Î±2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B, lanes 4 and 7), from stringent detergent (RIPA) lysates of A431 cells or B12 kidney epithelial cells. In A431 cells, Î±2, Î±3, and Î±6 integrin subunits were present at comparable levels, as indicated by cell surface labeling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B, lanes 1â3), and in B12 cells, Î±2 and Î±6 were again at comparable levels (not depicted).</p>

<bold>Integrin Î±3, Î±6, and Î²4 subunits undergo palmitoylation.</bold> (A) MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells were pulsed with [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate and incubated at 4Â°C with mAb anti-CD82 (mAb M104) or anti-CD151 (mAb 5C11). Unbound antibody was removed, cells were lysed in 1% Brij 96, and immune complexes were collected using protein Gâagarose. Remaining lysate was then used for further immunoprecipitation. In, intracellular fraction; Sur, surface fraction. (B) A431 cells were pulsed with [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate, surface labeled with biotin, and lysed in RIPA buffer, and then human Î±2, Î±3, and Î±6 integrins were immunoprecipitated using mAbs A2-IIE10, A3-X8, and GoH3, respectively. Proteins labeled with biotin (lanes 1â3) and [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate (lanes 4â6) are shown. Kidney epithelial B12 cells expressing human integrin Î±2 and Î±6 were also labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate, and then Î±2 and Î±6 were immunoprecipitated (lanes 7 and 8). Comparable cell surface Î±2 and Î±6 levels were seen by flow cytometry (not depicted). Note that, under RIPA conditions, human Î±6 remains associated with human (lane 6), but not mouse (lane 8) Î²4. White lines indicate that intervening lanes have been spliced out. (C) A431 cells were pulsed with [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate and then chased in the presence of 100 Î¼M unlabeled palmitic acid for up to 6 h, as indicated. Anti-Î±6 and anti-CD151 immunoprecipitates were analyzed for [<sup>3</sup>H] labeling of Î²4 and CD151 (top) or by immunoblotting (loading controls, bottom) using anti-Î±6 cyto tail antibody (to evaluate Î±6Î²4) and anti-Î±3 cyto tail antibody (to evaluate Î±3Î²1âCD151 complexes).

        </fig>
        <p>When A431 cells were pulse labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate, followed by a 6-h chase, the palmitate label was retained fully on the Î²4 subunit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C, top left), and almost completely on CD151 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C, top right). Blotting of Î±6 and Î±3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C, bottom) revealed similar levels of total Î±6Î²4 and Î±3Î²1âCD151 complexes throughout the experiment. Palmitoylations of Î²4 and CD151 were almost completely inhibited by a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide) and by a Golgi-disrupting agent (brefeldin A) (unpublished data). Hence, CD151 and Î²4 palmitoylations both occur early in biosynthesis and undergo little subsequent turnover.</p>
        <p>Results shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A suggested that additional palmitoylated proteins, including CD9, associate with palmitoylated CD151 and palmitoylated integrins. Indeed, the profiles of palmitoylated proteins associated with tetraspanins (CD9 and CD151) and integrins (Î±6Î²4 and Î±3Î²1) from MDA-MB-231 cells are strikingly similar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). No [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate-labeled proteins associated with Î±2 integrin, which itself is not palmitoylated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, lane 1). Palmitoylated protein profiles for CD9, CD151, Î±3Î²1, and Î±6Î²4 were similarly congruent in two additional cell lines (MCF-10A and A431; unpublished data). Immunoprecipitation of CD9, CD151, Î±3, and Î±6 from MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B) or MCF-10A cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D) yielded, in each case, Î²4, Î²1, and CD9, as indicated by blotting. Immunoprecipitation of Î±3, Î±6, and CD9 from A431 cells again yielded, in each case, both Î²4 and Î²1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). Immunoprecipitation of Î±2 yielded Î²1 (as expected), but not Î²4 or CD9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Likewise, immunoprecipitation of CD147 (a highly expressed control cell surface protein) did not yield Î²1, Î²4, or CD9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D). Results shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> indicate that complexes containing palmitoylated CD9, CD151, Î±6Î²4, and Î±3Î²1 are substantially overlapping in three different cell lines.</p>

        <title>Removal of integrin palmitoylation sites</title>
        <p>The membrane-proximal region of the Î²4 cytoplasmic tail contains seven potential cysteine palmitoylation sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Because palmitoylation often occurs on multiple clustered cysteines in the same molecule (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gundersen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Charrin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), we prepared a â7C/Sâ Î²4 mutant, replacing all seven cysteines with serines. When stably expressed in MDA-MB-435 cells, wild-type Î²4, but not the 7C/S mutant, incorporated [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B, left). Although Î²4 palmitoylation was lost, the 7C/S mutant retained association with palmitoylated Î±6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B, left). Wild-type and mutant Î²4 were present at similar levels, as detected by anti-Î²4 immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B, right; and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, middle), flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A), cell surface biotinylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, top), and by [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine labeling (not depicted). Mutant and wild-type Î²4 associated similarly with their core partner, CD151 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, bottom), and brought similarly elevated amounts of CD151 and Î±6 to the cell surface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). Levels of cell surface Î±3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A) and Î²1 (not depicted) also remained very similar when either wild-type or mutant Î²4 was expressed.</p>

        <p>The membrane-proximal regions of integrin Î±3, Î±6, and Î±7 cytoplasmic tails contain a single cysteine residue (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A) that is highly conserved in diverse animal species, but not in most other integrin Î± chains. Upon replacement of this key residue in Î±3 with serine (C1067S mutation), or upon replacement of the entire Î±3 cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane with the tail and transmembrane of Î±5 (X3TC5), palmitoylation was completely lost (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C, lanes 4 and 5). In the same experiment, palmitoylation of wild-type human Î±3A and Î±3B was readily observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C, lanes 2 and 3). Despite loss of palmitoylation in the C1067S and X3TC5 mutants, these integrins retained association with palmitoylated tetraspanin CD151 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C, lanes 4 and 5).</p>

        <title>Effects of integrin Î²4 palmitoylation on cell functions</title>
        <p>We observed comparable hemidesmosome-like staining for GFP-tagged wild-type and mutant Î²4 in A431 cells (unpublished data). Because a high level of endogenous Î²4 precluded further functional studies in A431 cells, we switched to MDA-MB-435 cells, with minimal endogenous Î²4, for studies of stably expressed wild-type and 7C/S Î²4. On laminin-5, spreading of 7C/S cells was markedly impaired compared with that of cells with control vector or wild-type Î²4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, top). All cells spread equally well on vitronectin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, bottom). Quantitation of multiple experiments confirmed deficient 7C/S Î²4 cell spreading on laminin-5 but not vitronectin substrate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). A marked defect in tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas was also observed for 7C/S Î²4 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, lanes 7 and 12) compared with wild-type Î²4 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, lanes 6 and 11), when plated on laminin-1 or laminin-5. No defect was seen on control ligand (vitronectin; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, lanes 3 and 4), and minimal p130Cas phosphorylation was seen for cells in suspension (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast to results with p130Cas, mutant and wild-type Î²4 showed little difference in phosphorylation of FAK (unpublished data). In concert with cell spreading, p130Cas is typically phosphorylated by a mechanism dependent on Src family kinases (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">O'Neill et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with this, the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hanke et al., 1996</xref>) abolished both p130Cas phosphorylation (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, lanes 8â10) and wild-type Î²4âMDA-MB-435 cell spreading on laminin-5 (not depicted). Similar spreading and signaling defects were also seen for 7C/S Î²4âtransfected SK-MEL-5 melanoma cells (unpublished data).</p>

<bold>Î²4 integrinâmediated cell spreading.</bold> (A) MDA-MB-435 cells stably expressing vector or wild-type (WT) or 7C/S Î²4 were held in suspension at 37Â°C for 30 min, and then were plated on wells coated in PBS at 4Â°C overnight with either laminin-5 (LN; subpanels AâC) or vitronectin (VN; subpanels DâE), and photographed after 45 min. Cell spreading was monitored using a microscope (Axiovert 135; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) as described previously (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Stipp and Hemler, 2000</xref>). Bar, 50 Î¼m. (B) Cell spreading was estimated by determining the percentage of cells that were no longer round and phase-bright. The accuracy of this method was validated by quantitation of cell area using Scion Image software, which confirmed that we could readily distinguish cells in which the area had increased by â¥1.2-fold. Results (mean Â± SD) are derived from at least two separate experiments, counting at least two representative fields in each experiment, with at least 50 cells/field. (C) MDA-MB-435 cells were suspended at 37Â°C for 30 min, and then either retained in suspension or plated on vitronectin (Vn), laminin-1, or laminin-5 for 45 min. Some samples (lanes 8â10) were preincubated with 1.0 Î¼g/ml PP2 in DMSO for 20 min before plating. Cells were collected and lysed in RIPA, and p130Cas was immunoprecipitated. After SDS-PAGE, samples were blotted with antiphosphotyrosine mAb 4G10. To assess protein loading, the blot was stripped and reblotted with p130Cas-specific antibody. Similar results were seen in multiple experiments.</p>

        <p>The spreading defect does not arise because of diminished cell adhesion. In a 30-min static cell adhesion assay, all cells adhered similarly to laminin-1, laminin-5, and vitronectin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). Adhesion to laminin-5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B) or laminin-1 (not depicted) was dependent on Î²1 rather than Î²4 integrins, as indicated by nearly complete blocking with an anti-Î²1 monoclonal antibody. On laminin-1, adhesion was almost entirely Î±6Î²1 dependent, whereas on laminin-5, Î±3Î²1 also contributed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). On vitronectin, antibodies to laminin receptors had minimal inhibitory effect. The use of Î±6Î²1, but not Î±6Î²4, for adhesion is in accord with a previous study of untransfected and Î²4-transfected MDA-MB-435 cells (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 1997</xref>). Expression levels for Î±3Î²1 and Î±6Î²1 were essentially unchanged, regardless of whether mutant or wild-type Î²4 was present, as seen by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A) and immunoblotting (not depicted).</p>

        <title>Lipid rafts, growth factor receptors, and Src kinases</title>
        <p>Palmitoylation diminishes the solubility of some lipid raftâtype proteins, leading to increased appearance in âlight membraneâ fractions of sucrose gradients and decreased extractability in nonionic detergents (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dunphy and Linder, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Resh, 1999</xref>). However, CD151 palmitoylation neither decreased density in sucrose gradients nor decreased detergent solubility (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, in A431 cells, palmitoylation of Î²4 (compared with 7C/S Î²4) did not yield decreased density in sucrose gradients in either stringent (Triton X-100) or mild (1% Brij 96) detergent conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A). Furthermore, neither endogenous [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate-labeled Î²4 nor endogenous Î²4 cell surfaceâlabeled with biotin appeared in the low density fractions of a sucrose gradient, even when mild Brij 96 detergent conditions were used (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). In control experiments, abundant endogenous caveolin-1 appeared in low density fractions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B, Fract 1â4) and transferrin receptor (CD71) marked the dense fractions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B, Fract 8â12). Furthermore, in MDA-MB-435 cells, palmitoylated Î²4 integrin (compared with the 7C/S mutant) showed increased solubility in nonionic detergent. Upon extraction of cells with 1% Brij 96 for 10 or 20 min, the solubility of wild-type Î²4 protein was 69% and 82%, respectively, relative to the total extractable Î²4 (in RIPA). In marked contrast, the 7C/S mutant remained at 40% solubility at the 10- and 20-min time points, although by 30 min, both mutant and wild-type Î²4 were completely extracted. In conclusion, palmitoylation did not endow Î²4 with lipid raftâlike properties in either A431 or MDA-MB-435 cells.</p>

        <p>As mentioned in the Introduction, integrin Î²4 can associate with activated EGFR-type growth factor receptors and Src family kinases. However, in EGF-stimulated A431 cells, we observed no difference in levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR associating with GFP-tagged 7C/S and wild-type Î²4 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A, top, lanes 2 and 4). In control experiments, deletion of portions of the Î²4 tail did diminish association with tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A, top, lanes 6 and 8) and EGFR protein (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A, middle, lanes 5â8). Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was not detected in the absence of EGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A, top, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or when Î²4 was not immunoprecipitated (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A, lane 9). Comparable amounts of Î²4 were recovered in each lane (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A, bottom, lanes 1â8). As expected (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mariotti et al., 2001</xref>), an abundance of tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was recovered in association with the Src family kinase fyn (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B), but no fyn was recovered in association with either mutant or wild-type Î²4 that had been immunoprecipitated with antibodies to either Î±6 or Î²4 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> C). In addition, there were no consistent differences in tyrosine phosphorylation of 7C/S and wild-type Î²4 (unpublished data). Integrin Î±6Î²4 also associates with ErbB2 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hintermann et al., 2001</xref>), which in MDA-MB-435 cells forms dimers with ErbB3 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adelsman et al., 1999</xref>). However, after heregulin treatment to induce ErbB phosphorylation, we observed no association of either wild-type or mutant Î²4 with tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB3 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> D) or ErbB2 (not depicted). Also, for mutant Î²4 in MDA-MB-435 cells, we saw no diminution in ErbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation or ErbB3 association with the p85 subunit of PI 3-K (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> E).</p>

Wild-type Î²4âGFP and 7C/S Î²4âGFP were expressed in another cell line (SK-MEL-5), and again there was similar staining of CD9 by mAb ALB6, but selectively diminished staining of the mutant cells by mAb C9BB, such that the C9BB/ALB6 ratio decreased by â¼40% (unpublished data). These results indicate that cell surface tetraspanin organization is affected by Î²4 palmitoylation.</p>

        <title>Functional link between CD9 and Î²4</title>
        <p>In cells where CD9 associates with Î±6Î²4, anti-CD9 antibodies can alter Î±6Î²4-dependent cell motility (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baudoux et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we confirm a functional connection between CD9 and laminin-binding integrins in MDA-MB-435 cells. Addition of an anti-CD9 antibody (ALB6) stimulated cell spreading in 7C/S cells, and to an even greater extent in cells expressing wild-type Î²4 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). Background spreading was observed in the presence of control anti-Î±2 and anti-CD81 antibodies. As expected from the results shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, spreading on laminin-5 was elevated for wild-type Î²4 cells. The anti-CD9 mAb ALB6 did not promote spreading of either wild-type (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>) or 7C/S (not depicted) cells on vitronectin, and had no effect on static cell adhesion to laminin-1 or laminin-5.</p>

        <title>CD151 and Î²4 palmitoylation similarities</title>
        <p>There are several striking similarities between Î²4 and tetraspanin CD151, with respect to palmitoylation. First, multiple membrane-proximal cysteines are used. Although six cysteines may contribute to CD151 palmitoylation (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), removal of seven cysteines eliminated all detectable [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate incorporation into Î²4. Removal of only one, two, three, or five membrane-proximal cysteines yielded incomplete results (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gagnoux-Palacios et al., 2003</xref>). The seven mutated cysteines are exactly conserved in Î²4 from multiple species (e.g., humans, rats, and mice), but do not appear in any other integrin Î² subunits. Second, palmitoylation of both CD151 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>) and Î²4 occurs on newly synthesized protein and remains stably attached, with minimal turnover on the mature proteins. Third, removal of palmitoylation sites from CD151 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>) or Î²4 increased neither protein density nor detergent solubility/extractability (see TEMs and lipid raft localization section). Fourth, removal of palmitoylation sites from CD151 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>) or Î²4 did not alter static cell adhesion, but did alter Î±6Î²4-dependent cell signaling and morphology. Fifth, immunoprecipitation of either CD151 or Î±6Î²4 yielded strikingly similar patterns of palmitoylated proteins. Sixth, loss of palmitoylation from either molecule did not disrupt the core CD151âÎ±6Î²4 complex. However, seventh, loss of palmitoylation from either CD151 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>) or Î²4 did markedly alter secondary associations with other tetraspanins. These observations reinforce the concept that the CD151âÎ±6Î²4 core complex is similarly affected by palmitoylation on either CD151 or Î²4.</p>

        <title>Tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs)</title>
        <p>It is well established that tetraspanin proteins (including CD151 and CD9) and their partners associate with each other in extended complexes known as the tetraspanin web (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Trusolino et al., 2001</xref>), or TEMs (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hemler, 2003</xref>). TEMs contain primary complexes (e.g., CD151âintegrin [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Serru et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Yauch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kazarov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sterk et al., 2002</xref>] and tetraspanin homodimers [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kovalenko et al., 2004</xref>]) occurring through direct, proteinâprotein interactions. These are then brought together into extended secondary complexes, with tetraspanin palmitoylation playing a key role (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Charrin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hemler, 2003</xref>). Given the abundance of evidence regarding CD151 palmitoylation, and the strong similarities between CD151 and Î²4 (see previous section), it is not surprising that Î²4 palmitoylation would also contribute to localization into TEMs. The evidence for this is as follows. First, in multiple cell lines, palmitoylated Î²4 associates with other palmitoylated proteins (CD9, CD81, CD63, and others) in a pattern that is strikingly similar whether immunoprecipitated with antibodies to CD151, to CD9, or to integrins (Î±6Î²4 or Î±3Î²1). The specificity of interaction among these particular components is emphasized by the exclusion of other abundant cell surface molecules (e.g., integrin Î±2Î²1 and tetraspanin CD82). Consistent with our results, others have also shown that CD9 can associate with Î±6Î²4 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baudoux et al., 2000</xref>). Second, loss of Î²4 palmitoylation diminished secondary associations with other tetraspanins (CD9, CD81, and CD63), just as seen previously upon removal of CD151 and CD9 palmitoylation sites (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Charrin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Third, not only was CD9 substantially dissociated from the palmitoylation-deficient Î±6Î²4âCD151 complex, it also showed reorganization on the cell surface, which is consistent with reduced clustering. Pairs of monoclonal antibodies, diagnostic for cell surface clustering, have been described for other molecules, including CD147 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Koch et al., 1999</xref>) and CDw78 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Drbal et al., 1999</xref>). In each case, a lower affinity antibody (such as anti-CD9 mAb C9BB) showed more dependence on bivalent binding, and hence more sensitivity to cell surface clustering, compared with a higher affinity antibody (such as anti-CD9 mAb ALB6).</p>
        <p>It is likely not a coincidence that the integrin Î± subunits (Î±3, Î±6, and Î±7) best able to interact with tetraspanins also contain palmitoylation sites. The integrin Î±3, Î±6, and Î±7 subunits contain single, membrane-proximal cysteine palmitoylation sites, conserved in orthologous subunits across a wide range of animal species. For Î±3 and Î±6, the key cysteine is present in both major (Î±3A and Î±6A) and minor (Î±3B and Î±6B) alternatively spliced forms. In contrast to the integrin Î±3, Î±6, and Î±7 subunits, the other 13 integrin Î± subunits (except for Î±E and Î±8) don't contain membrane-proximal cysteines.</p>

        <title>Functional consequences</title>
        <p>Removal of CD151 palmitoylation did not affect static cell adhesion but did alter Î±6Î²4-dependent kidney epithelial cell morphology (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>) and integrin-dependent signaling in fibroblasts (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, removal of Î²4 palmitoylation did not alter cell surface expression levels, association with Î±6 or CD151, or cell adhesion to laminins, but did alter Î±6Î²4-dependent spreading and associated signaling through p130Cas in MDA-MB-435 cells. Although Î²4 has not previously been linked to p130Cas signaling, p130Cas is preferentially activated when cells are plated on laminin, compared with fibronectin (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2001</xref>). Inhibition by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 is consistent with cell spreading depending on Src family kinase phosphorylation of p130Cas (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nojima et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Panetti, 2002</xref>). Presently, we cannot determine whether impaired cell spreading, due to the absence of Î²4 palmitoylation, is a consequence or a cause of diminished Src kinase â p130Cas signaling. Notably, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gagnoux-Palacios et al. (2003)</xref> have also reported altered Src family kinaseâdependent signaling upon removal of Î²4 palmitoylation sites. Upon removal of palmitoylation from CD151 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>) or Î²4, signaling through FAK was unaltered, consistent with cell adhesion being unaltered. Our results are in accord with previous evidence that FAK and p130Cas can sometimes be differentially regulated (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
        <p>For several reasons, we suggest that Î²4 palmitoylationâdependent recruitment of CD151âÎ±6Î²4 into TEMs plays a major role in determining cell spreading and signaling. First, diminished spreading and signaling occurred in parallel with reduced secondary associations of Î±6Î²4 with tetraspanins (CD9, CD81, and CD63) and reorganization of cell surface CD9. Second, CD9 is functionally connected to Î±6Î²4, consistent with its physical association. As seen elsewhere, anti-CD9 antibodies inhibited the motility of cultured keratinocytes under conditions where motility is at least partially Î±6Î²4-dependent (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baudoux et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with this, we used an anti-CD9 antibody to stimulate MDA-MB-435 cell spreading, which is partly Î±6Î²4 dependent, as evidenced by the negative effects of Î²4 mutation. It was a little surprising that anti-CD9 antibody also stimulated spreading of MDA-MB-435 cells bearing mutant Î²4. However, we note that removal of Î²4 palmitoylation does not completely dissociate CD151âÎ±6Î²4 from CD9 and other tetraspanins. There remain six palmitoylation sites in CD151, and one site in Î±6, that likely contribute to continued CD9 association. Third, an association with TEMs provides a mechanism to link CD151âÎ±6Î²4 with several other molecules known to regulate cell morphology and signaling. These include other CD9-associated proteins such as EWI-2 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Stipp et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kolesnikova et al., 2004</xref>), PKC (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>), and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yauch and Hemler, 2000</xref>). In this regard, CD9 has also been linked to signaling of c-kit and EGFR tyrosine kinases (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Higashiyama et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anzai et al., 2002</xref>). It was suggested previously that CD9 regulation of Î±6Î²4 might only be relevant when cells are migrating and/or when the Î±6Î²4 is associated with the actin cytoskeleton rather than stably interacting with intermediate filaments within hemidesmosome-like structures (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baudoux et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 are not associated with the CD151âÎ±6Î²4 complex in hemidesmosomes (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sterk et al., 2000</xref>), and mutation of Î²4 palmitoylation sites did not affect hemidesmosome localization, as observed here and by <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gagnoux-Palacios et al. (2003)</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our Î²4 mutation had minimal effect on cell adhesion to laminin-1 or laminin-5. This result is consistent with previous results in which Î²4 in MDA-MB-435 cells modulated downstream signaling but not initial cell adhesion to laminin-1 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, our Î²4 mutant was deficient in spreading and signaling on both laminin-5 and laminin-1, even though only the former is a very good ligand for Î±6Î²4. Hence, a mechanism is needed to explain how Î±6Î²4 can exert substrate-dependent effects on cell morphology, signaling, and/or motility, even when it is not primarily responsible for cell adhesion. In this regard, we have demonstrated that multiple laminin-binding integrins can be linked together within overlapping complexes. Not only were the profiles of palmitoylated proteins associated with Î±6Î²4 and Î±3Î²1 strikingly similar, but also we observed Î±6Î²4 and Î±3Î²1 coimmunoprecipitations from multiple cell lines. Hence, we propose that Î±6Î²4 can physically associate with Î±3Î²1 (and likely also Î±6Î²1), in the context of TEMs. This provides a mechanism for the close coordination of initial adhesion, mediated by Î±3Î²1 (or Î±6Î²1), with subsequent Î±6Î²4-dependent spreading, signaling, or migration. Though novel, these results are not unexpected. It was previously established that Î±6Î²4, Î±6Î²1, and Î±3Î²1 all can associate with CD151 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski, 2001</xref>), and that CD151 may appear predominantly as a homodimer (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kovalenko et al., 2004</xref>), thus having the potential to link distinct integrins. Furthermore, all of these integrins were known to associate with additional tetraspanins (CD9, CD81, CD63, etc.), which can associate with each other (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Boucheix and Rubinstein, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hemler, 2003</xref>).</p>

        <title>TEMs and lipid raft localization</title>
        <p>Protein palmitoylation can lead to localization into lipid rafts and decreased solubility in nonionic detergents (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dunphy and Linder, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Resh, 1999</xref>). Indeed, it was suggested elsewhere that Î²4 palmitoylation promotes lipid raft localization, thus providing a mechanism for bringing Î²4 into functionally important complexes with Src family kinases such as fyn and yes (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mariotti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gagnoux-Palacios et al., 2003</xref>). However, we found no evidence for palmitoylation promoting either integrin or tetraspanin association with lipid rafts. First, in Î²4-transfected A431 cells, the presence of Î²4 palmitoylation was not associated with decreased density in either Brij 96 or Triton X-100 lysates. Second, neither the palmitoylated subset nor the cell surfaceâlabeled subset of endogenous Î²4 in A431 cells appeared in low density sucrose gradient fractions, even in mild Brij 96 detergent. Third, Î²4 palmitoylation did not decrease detergent solubility in MDA-MB-435 cells. In fact, in a short-term detergent (Brij 96) solubility assay, Î²4 palmitoylation increased solubility. Fourth, our Î²4 results are in complete agreement with prior results regarding tetraspanin palmitoylation. Protein density was not affected by removal of palmitoylation from either CD151 or CD9 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berditchevski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Charrin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), and CD151 palmitoylation did not decrease detergent solubility (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Fifth, we did not see changes in association of mutant Î²4 with signaling proteins (EGFR, ErbB3/2, and fyn) that can be found in lipid rafts. Despite the potential of tetraspanins to associate with gangliosides and cholesterol, TEMs consistently remain distinct from lipid rafts. In contrast to lipid rafts, TEMs are resistant to cholesterol depletion, typically appear in the soluble phase upon extraction by nonionic detergents, and are not disrupted at 37Â°C (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hemler, 2003</xref>). An extensive proteomics analysis of lipid rafts did not reveal any tetraspanins or palmitoylated integrins (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Foster et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, we have identified, by mass spectrometry, numerous potential partners for tetraspanins and palmitoylated integrins, but this list does not contain typical raft-type proteins such as caveolins and GPI-linked proteins (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, palmitoylation of Î²4 integrin, as seen previously for CD151, plays a key role in integrin-dependent cell spreading and signaling, and in the maintenance of secondary interactions with additional tetraspanin proteins. We suggest that CD151âÎ±6Î²4, CD151âÎ±3Î²1, and CD151âÎ±6Î²1 assemble with other tetraspanins into novel signaling platforms (TEMs). These provide a framework for the regulation of integrin-dependent postadhesion functions (spreading, signaling, and motility) and coordination of the functions and distributions of laminin-binding integrins at the cellâsubstrate interface.</p>
