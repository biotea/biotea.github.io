      <abstract>
        <p>Hearing loss is a complex disorder caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Previously, mutations in <italic>CIB2</italic> have been identified as a common cause of genetic hearing loss in Pakistani and Turkish populations. Here we report a novel (c.556C&gt;T; p.(Arg186Trp)) transition mutation in the <italic>CIB2</italic> gene identified through whole exome sequencing (WES) in a Caribbean Hispanic family with non-syndromic hearing loss. CIB2 belongs to the family of calcium-and integrin-binding (CIB) proteins. The carboxy-termini of CIB proteins are associated with calcium binding and intracellular signaling. The p.(Arg186Trp) mutation is localized within predicted type II PDZ binding ligand at the carboxy terminus. Our <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies revealed that the mutation did not alter the interactions of CIB2 with Whirlin, nor its targeting to the tips of hair cell stereocilia. However, we found that the mutation disrupts inhibition of ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses by CIB2 in a heterologous expression system. Our findings support p.(Arg186Trp) mutation as a cause for hearing loss in this Hispanic family. In addition, it further highlights the necessity of the calcium binding property of CIB2 for normal hearing.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Congenital hearing loss is considered to be the most prevalent abnormality in newborns with an estimated incidence of 1/500 live births [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133082.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Both genetic and environmental factors are responsible for hearing loss [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Genetic factors account for 50% of hearing loss in developed countries and among them the majority is non-syndromic [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As of June 2015, a total of 96 genes have been identified for non-syndromic hearing loss in humans (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hereditaryhearingloss.org">http://hereditaryhearingloss.org</ext-link>). Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is the most common genetic form and accounts for ~80% of all genetic cases [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To date, over 60 genes have been identified for ARNSHL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hereditaryhearingloss.org">http://hereditaryhearingloss.org</ext-link>). Previously, many ARSNHL-associated genes have been identified through linkage analysis of large consanguineous families [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although this approach has been extremely successful, the requirement of large families with multiple affected and unaffected individuals has proved to be a limiting factor in linkage based gene discovery in the past.</p>
      <p>Through recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, many previously unknown, deafness-associated genes have been discovered by use of targeted gene capture or whole exome sequencing (WES) [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is particularly true for evaluation of smaller sized consanguineous families [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133082.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or non-consanguineous families [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Utilization of quartet families with one or more affected individual for WES has enabled discovery of underlying mutated genes [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The advantage of using families that are larger than trios is that the inheritance patterns can more easily aid in deciphering disease-associated mutations.</p>
      <p>One important question in the field is whether there are differences in the relative importance of known disease genes for ARSNHL in different populations. The <italic>GJB2</italic> (gap junction protein beta 2) gene, comprising a single exon, mapping to the <italic>DFNB1</italic> locus (MIM#220290) is the most common disease-associated gene in familial or isolated ARSNHL in many populations of different ethnicities [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133082.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We previously reported a paucity of mutations in <italic>GJB2</italic>, the most common cause of ARNSHL in the Bronx, NY, African-American and Caribbean Hispanic population [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our goal to use WES was to identify mutations in other genes in individual families that are being cared for in our hospital. Here, we report results from WES of genomic DNA purified from blood, from one quartet family termed, JS6. This family is of Hispanic ethnicity that was negative for mutations in <italic>GJB2</italic>, and we identified a mutation in <italic>CIB2</italic>. Mutations in <italic>CIB2</italic>, encoding a calcium and integrin binding protein 2 (OMIM# 605564), were previously reported in Pakistani and Turkish families with ARSNHL (<italic>DFNB48</italic>) as well as Usher syndrome type 1J [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Through functional studies, we show here that p.Arg186Trp (C&gt;T; chr15:78,397,660, February 2009; GRCh37/hg19 assembly) mutation specifically impaired the calcium binding ability of CIB2 in heterologous cell system.</p>

        <p>This research study was approved by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Committee on Clinical Investigation (CCI#2005â756). Blood samples were collected from the JS6 family affected with hearing loss cared for at the Childrenâs Hospital at Montefiore, Montefiore Medical Center, NY. Family JS6 consisted of two siblings, JS6.001 (Male) and JS6.002 (Female) affected with nonsyndromic hearing loss and healthy parents, JS6.100 (mother) and JS6.200 (father). Audiometry tests were conducted in a sound proof room to evaluate hearing impairment. Different sounds of varying intensities were delivered to each ear one at a time, requiring a response from the subject thereby indicating whether or not they heard the sound. The audiologist recorded each tone at the lowest possible volume that was heard by the subject. After the general audiometry test, Rinne and Weber tuning fork tests were used to distinguish between sensorineural and conductive hearing loss. A written informed consent was attained from each individual as part of subject enrollment and before sample collection. The Puregene Genomic DNA Purification kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN) was used to purify DNA in the Molecular Cytogenetics Core, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NY, according to standard protocols.</p>

        <p>The library preparation was performed with 1ug of genomic DNA using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Low-Throughput (LT) Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and Roche NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v3.0 according to the manufacturers instructions (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI). Briefly, genomic DNA was purified using the Gentra Puregene Kit (Qiagen). The quality and quantity of DNA was determined by NanoDrop spectrophotometry, Qubit fluorometery and agarose gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA was sheared using the Covaris S2 System into 300bp fragments for DNA library preparations. Illumina TruSeq adaptors were added using the TruSeq DNA (LT) Sample Preparation kit allowing multiple samples to be barcoded simultaneously, following the protocol for ligation of adaptors. The samples were then amplified by LM-PCR following the manufacturerâs protocol (eight cycles; NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Library SR Userâs Guide v3.0). The amplified libraries were analyzed for quality and quantity (Qubit).</p>
        <p>High quality amplified sample libraries were denatured, and then hybridized to the Roche NimbleGen EZ custom design biotin-labeled Library v3.0 following the manufacturerâs protocol (NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Library SR Userâs Guide v3.0). A magnetic pull down of DNA was performed with Streptavidin Dynabeads to enrich the target regions and the captured DNA was recovered. The libraries captured up to 64 Mb in a single reaction and a total of four samples were pooled per captured reaction. The captured libraries were evaluated for enrichment by real time PCR to ensure that on-target enrichment has occurred. Targeted captured enriched DNA libraries were sequenced on one lane of Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments for paired end reads of 100 bp, as per the manufacturerâs guidelines. Images generated by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument were automatically processed in real-time using control software (1.3.8) and CASAVA (1.7) software packages. Throughout this process, quality metrics were recorded to measure experimental efficacy and to facilitate rigorous filtering of sequences prior to genome alignment.</p>
        <p>Sequencing reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19, February 2009 assembly) using BWA software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/">http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>, version 0.6.2). The PCR duplicates, to be removed, were marked using Picard-tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net">http://picard.sourceforge.net</ext-link>, version 1.72). Local re-alignment, base quality recalibration and variant annotation were performed through GATK version 2.2â15 (Genome Analysis Toolkit, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/">https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/</ext-link>) in UnifiedGenotyper mode. SNPs and indels were filtered using the expressions âQD &lt; 2.0 || MQ &lt; 40.0 || FS &gt; 60.0 || HaplotypeScore &gt; 13.0 || MQRankSum &lt; -12.5 || ReadPosRankSum &lt; -8.0â and âQD &lt; 2.0 || ReadPosRankSum &lt; -20.0 || FS &gt; 200.0â, respectively. The variant call format file (VCF) for the whole exome sequence data is available at NCBI, dbGaP database, ID 16015, phs000969, title, âWhole exome sequence of hearing loss familyâ.</p>

        <title>Filtering Annotated variants</title>
        <p>For quality control and to reduce the number of false positive calls, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a genotype score &lt; 20 or a sequencing depth less &lt; 15X were filtered and removed prior to analysis. Additionally, SNPs exceeding 10bp from either exonic boundary were also removed. The following criteria were used to prioritize the remaining variants: (1) A minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; = 1%, based on dbSNP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/</ext-link>) and 1000 Genomes Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1000genomes.org/">http://www.1000genomes.org/</ext-link>); (2) A list was compiled of previously reported hearing loss genes published in the literature and listed in the Hereditary Hearing Loss database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/">http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/</ext-link>); (3) Mode of inheritance classification (using sequencing data from parents); (4) Prioritized non-synonymous variants.

        <p>To determine the frequency of the c.556C&gt;T (p.(Arg186Trp)) <italic>CIB2</italic> mutation in the healthy Caribbean Hispanic population, a PCR product based restriction enzyme digestion assay was developed. We selected 194 healthy controls and 94 of which were ethnically matched (Caribbean Hispanic). The HPAII enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) that recognizes the 5â CCGG 3â restriction site, was, abolished by the c.556C&gt;T mutation of <italic>CIB2</italic>. In our assay, any samples with c.556C&gt;T mutation will remain undigested (206 bp) whereas the digestion of a normal sample would result into two restriction fragments 124 bp and 82 bp size. Any heterozygous or homozygous samples identified through the restriction enzyme digest assay would be sequenced for confirmation.</p>

        <title>Affected individuals of Hispanic family have nonsyndromic hearing loss</title>
        <p>We identified a Caribbean Hispanic family in which both affected children have bilateral profound hearing loss diagnosed within the first year of life (<xref rid="pone.0133082.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Additional family history was obtained through a medical interview at the time of recruitment. The parents were found to have normal hearing and did not report any medical complication or drug exposure during pregnancy. No evidence for other syndromic features such as Usher syndrome was present. The proband had a normal ocular exam (Ocular exam: VA: 20/25 left, 20/20 right; EOM full. External: OK; Anterior segment: L/L flat on; FUNDUS: = 0.75â1.00 x 180; +2.50â1.50 x 180). There was no evidence for congenital heart disease, respiratory problems, urinary tract abnormalities, thereby ruling out the possibility of CHARGE syndrome. Assessment of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) at 7 months revealed profound impairment with a threshold greater than 90 dB at 250 Hz and greater than 110 dB for all other frequencies tested (<xref rid="pone.0133082.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). The acoustic reflexes were also absent in both ears. The probandâs brother had bilateral hearing loss (<xref rid="pone.0133082.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), but there is no other family history of hearing loss. Therefore, based on this information we tentatively concluded that hearing loss in both children is non-syndromic with a possible underlying genetic cause. Mutations in the <italic>GJB2</italic> gene had previously been excluded as part of routine clinical management.</p>

        <title>WES revealed a missense mutation in <italic>CIB2</italic> associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss</title>
        <p>WES analysis was performed on DNA from family JS6, including both affected children and parents. WES generated an average of 7.5 billion base pair sequence, with an average map ability rate of 95% across the 64Mb targeted region. The mean target depth for these samples was approximately 57X. This data resulted in a total of 36,752 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 21,721 indels after variant calling using GATK. The data was then compared to the dbSNP and 1000 Genomes Project databases to eliminate SNVs with a MAF &gt;1%. The SNVs were further categorized based on the mode of inheritance using the parental sequencing data. As a result, we obtained 619 recessively inherited variants of which 535 were SNVs and 84 were indels. This group also included compound heterozygous DNA variants and variants, which were homozygous in either affected child. A total of 53 SNVs were identified in both affected individuals and they were analyzed first. We prioritized our analysis using a custom list of 160 genes associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss. We included both types of hearing loss because mutations in genes for syndromic hearing loss have been found in non-syndromic individuals. The 160 genes were complied through literature search and presence in the Hereditary Hearing Loss database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/">http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>Through this initial search, we identified a homozygous mutation in <italic>CIB2</italic> (c.556C&gt;T; p.(Arg186Trp)) in both affected siblings, whereas the healthy parents are unaffected carriers (<xref rid="pone.0133082.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The c.556C&gt;T (p.Arg186Trp) mutation is located in exon 6 of <italic>CIB2</italic>, which encodes the carboxy-terminal end of the resulting polypeptide. The mutation in the female proband found by WES was validated by Sanger sequence analysis (<xref rid="pone.0133082.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). This nucleotide change was not observed in the normal population (1000 Genomes Project; NHLBI ESP6500). We performed a mutation specific restriction enzyme digest (<xref rid="pone.0133082.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) in 94 ethnically matched (Hispanic) and a 100 African American unrelated healthy individuals and did not identify the mutation in any of the subjects, suggesting this mutation is truly rare in both populations (data not shown). This nucleotide change has been observed as a rare heterozygous variant in an African American control samples and was absent in a further 8586 European controls samples studied, as part of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP; <xref rid="pone.0133082.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

Based upon the medical history, there was no evidence for clinical features of CHARGE syndrome, including congenital heart disease, respiratory problems or urinary tract abnormalities, thereby ruling out this variant as being responsible for deafness in this family.

        <title>The p.Arg186Trp mutation affects the calcium binding affinity of CIB2</title>
        <p>We analyzed the effect of the p.Arg186Trp mutation on the molecular structure of CIB2, using the human crystal structure of CIB1 (1XO5) as a template. The carboxy terminal helix of CIB1 is flexible and believed to participate in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. This helix is folded back against the hydrophobic integrin binding pocket of the CIB1, C-domain in the 1XO5.PDB crystal structure. The displacement of this helix is also part of the integrin binding mechanism suggesting that it might affect access to the hydrophobic pocket to integrins. Any unfolding or destabilization of the helix due to p.Arg186Trp allele could potentially affect the ability for CIB2 to bind to calcium or integrins (<xref rid="pone.0133082.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). To test if the pArg186Trp mutation affects the calcium binding affinity of CIB2, we measured the inositol triphosphate (IP3)-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses evoked by extracellular ATP in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with Dsred tagged constructs (<xref rid="pone.0133082.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).

HEK-293 cells overexpressing wild type CIB2 demonstrated significantly decreased ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses as compared to no Ca2+ buffering ability in mock transfected cells, as previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Intriguingly, HEK-293 cells overexpressing p.Arg186Trp mutant CIB2 had a significant increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, indicating that this CIB2<sup>R186W</sup> variant resulted in loss of Ca2+ sequestering ability (<xref rid="pone.0133082.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Using WES, we have identified a homozygous <italic>CIB2</italic> mutation in a family with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. The p.Arg186Trp mutation is located within the carboxy terminal end of the CIB2 protein and is predicted to be pathogenic by <italic>in silico</italic> prediction databases (<xref rid="pone.0133082.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). CIB2 belongs to the family of calcium-and integrin-binding proteins, consisting of three additional CIB family members (CIB 1, 3 and 4) [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These proteins are characterized by three to four EF hand motifs and are involved in mediating Ca2+ binding and intracellular signaling [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the sensory epithelium of the inner ear, CIB2 is targeted to the tip of the stereocilia of hair cells, a site of the tip-link mechanotransduction complex [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. There are several important proteins that comprise the complex, including Protocadherin 15 and Cadherin 23, which form the extracellular tip link structure and are mutated in patients with Usher type 1 syndrome. The tip link is connected inside the cell by Whirlin and Myosin VIIa, as well as other proteins, which are also mutated in patients with ARSNHL [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Biochemical studies demonstrated that CIB2 functionally and physically interacts with Whirlin and Myosin VIIa [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We found that the p.Arg186Trp mutation does not affect the tip localization as well as interaction between CIB2 and Whirlin. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that CIB2 harboring p.Arg186Trp mutation dimerizes with endogenous CIB2 and that this dimer is targeted to the tip of stereocilia. CIB2 belongs to the calcium integrin binding family and shares significant sequence homology with CIB1, which has been extensively studied and is known to regulate platelet aggregation by interacting with platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3). However, the Arg186 residue is not conserved between CIB1 and CIB2. CIB1 specifically binds to platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) through displacement of its C-terminal end [<xref rid="pone.0133082.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In contrast, our <italic>ex vivo</italic> functional studies revealed that the p.Arg186Trp mutation within the carboxy terminus of CIB2 affects the calcium binding ability. Our study indicates that the mutations of <italic>CIB2</italic> are not limited to Pakistanis or Turkish populations. Detection of p.Arg186Trp allele in Caribbean Hispanic family and in an African American control sample (<xref rid="pone.0133082.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) raises the probability that individuals of other populations may harbor mutations in <italic>CIB2</italic>.</p>
