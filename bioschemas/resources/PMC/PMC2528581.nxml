        <p>The low-density lipoprotein receptorârelated proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) are coreceptors for Frizzled and transmit signals from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. However, the mechanism for LRP5/6 signal transmission remains undefined. Here, we identify cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein 2 (Caprin-2) as a LRP5/6-binding protein. Our data show that Caprin-2 stabilizes cytosolic Î²-catenin and enhances lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1/T cell factorâdependent reporter gene activity as well as the expression of Wnt target genes in mammalian cells. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of Caprin-2 in zebrafish embryos inhibits Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and results in a dorsalized phenotype. Moreover, Caprin-2 facilitates LRP5/6 phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3, and thus enhances the interaction between Axin and LRP5/6. Therefore, Caprin-2 promotes activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by regulating LRP5/6 phosphorylation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Wnt signaling pathway plays pivotal roles during embryogenesis and is also linked to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Logan and Nusse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clevers, 2006</xref>). Two types of cell surface receptors, seven-transmembrane protein Frizzled (Fz), and single-pass membrane proteins low-density lipoprotein receptorârelated protein 5 and 6 (LRP5/6), are required for transducing the Wnt signal. LRP5/6 is homo-oligomerized and hetero-oligomerized with Fz through binding to Wnt proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tamai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cong et al., 2004</xref>). After that, LRP5/6 is phosphorylated and activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>). Activated LRP5/6 recruits Axin to the plasma membrane and promotes Axin degradation, which results in the activation of Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mao et al., 2001b</xref>). Recently, caveolin-dependent internalization of the LRP6âAxin complex was also reported to be important for activation of Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yamamoto et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Several mechanisms were raised to illustrate how the activity of LRP5/6 is regulated. For example, Dickkopf (DKK) binds LRP6, thus causing an inactivation of LRP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bafico et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mao et al., 2001a</xref>), and R-Spondin 1 activates Wnt signaling through releasing LRP6 from the inhibition of DKK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binnerts et al., 2007</xref>). Wise and SOST were also found to interact with LRP5/6 and compete with Wnt and Fz for binding to LRP5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Itasaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Semenov et al., 2005</xref>). ER-retained Wise also reduces LRP6 on the cell surface, and thereby inhibits Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guidato and Itasaki 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The activity of LRP5/6 is also regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation results in the activation of LRP5/6 and is important for the interaction between LRP5/6 and Axin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mao et al., 2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>). It has been previously shown that several PPP(S/T)P motifs within the intracellular domain of LRP5 are required for LRP5/6âAxin interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mao et al., 2001b</xref>). Casein kinase I Î³ and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) are responsible for the phosphorylation at the motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>). Recent work suggested that formation of the LRP6 signalosome in response to Wnt stimulation is required for initiating LRP phosphorylation, and the process is believed to be mediated by Dishevelled (Dvl; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>). Axin was also reported to be involved in the regulation of LRP5/6 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zeng et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which LRP5/6 phosphorylation is regulated remains elusive. In this work, we identified cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein 2 (Caprin-2) as a novel LRP5/6-binding protein. Our data show that Caprin-2 plays an important role in regulating GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of LRP5/6.</p>

        <title>Caprin-2 interacts with LRP5/6</title>
        <p>LRP5/6 acts as a coreceptor of Fz to transduce signal from membrane to cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tamai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cong et al., 2004</xref>). However, the precise mechanism by which LRP5/6 mediates Wnt signaling at the plasma membrane remains to be defined. To address this question, we sought to explore potential partners that interact with LRP5/6. HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with a Flag-tagged truncated form of LRP5, LRP5C2-Flag, which lacks the extracellular domain and constitutively activates WntâÎ²-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mao et al., 2001b</xref>). Immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-Flag antibody. Samples were then separated on SDS-PAGE and subsequently processed with mass spectrometry analysis followed by protein database searching. Among the proteins identified in the LRP5C2 complex, we found a novel LRP5-binding protein named Caprin-2, which was previously identified as a member of cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated proteins family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerbajinai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grill et al., 2004</xref>). The Caprin family contains two members, which share two homologous regions that are highly conserved. The first discovered family member, Caprin-1, is highly expressed in brain and tissues capable of proliferation. It has been shown that the function of Caprin-1 is related to cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Solomon et al., 2007</xref>). The function of Caprin-2 has remained unclear. A previous study showed that during blood cell differentiation, the expression level of Caprin-2 changes dramatically, which suggests that Caprin-2 may function in cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerbajinai et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm our mass spectrometry data, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assay in HEK-293T cells. LRP5 was cotransfected with either Caprin-1 or Caprin-2, and the result indicates that only Caprin-2 but not Caprin-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) interacts with LRP5. To substantiate this observation, we generated an antibody against Caprin-2. This antibody was shown to efficiently detect and immunoprecipitate both endogenously and exogenously expressed Caprin-2 protein. We then pulled down endogenous Caprin-2 with this antibody, and the result showed that endogenous LRP6 was coimmunoprecipitated with Caprin-2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We also found that Wnt-3a stimulation has little effect on the binding of Caprin-2 with LRP6.</p>

        <p>To determine whether Caprin-2 interacts with LRP5/6 directly, we performed an in vitro binding experiment using recombinant proteins produced from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Because full-length Caprin-2 was hardly expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>., we divided it into three fragments according to a previous study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grill et al., 2004</xref>). These fragments include an N-terminal homologous region-1 (HR-1) domain (Ca2-N), the middle HR-2 domain (Ca2-M), and a C1q region domain (CRD) in the C terminus (Ca2-C). All of these fragments were fused with a 6Ã His tag, and GST was fused to the intracellular domain of LRP5 (LRP5C3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mao et al., 2001b</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, both Ca2-M and Ca2-C interacted with LRP5C3, which suggests that there might be multiple LRP5/6-binding sites within Caprin-2. Together, our results establish that Caprin-2 is a binding partner of LRP5/6.</p>

        <title>Caprin-2 activates Wnt-induced lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1)/T cell factor (TCF) transcriptional activity</title>
        <p>To determine whether Caprin-2 is involved in the WntâÎ²-catenin pathway, we overexpressed Caprin-2 in HEK-293 cells and evaluated its effect using the LEF-1 reporter system. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, overexpression of Caprin-2 enhanced LEF-1/TCFsâdependent reporter activity. We also examined the potential role of Caprin-1, and our results showed that Caprin-1 did not affect Wnt-induced LEF-1/TCFs-dependent reporter activity. In Caprin-2 overexpressing cells, cytosolic Î²-catenin was stabilized, similar to what is seen in cells treated with Wnt-3a (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, bottom). These data indicate that overexpression of Caprin-2 facilitates the activation of Wnt signaling by increasing the accumulation of cytoplasmic Î²-catenin.</p>

        <p>To confirm the function of Caprin-2 in vivo, we performed knockdown experiments by using Caprin-2 siRNAs. The efficiency of RNAi was examined by Western blotting using the Caprin-2 antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). We then examined the effects of Caprin-2 knockdown on canonical Wnt signaling. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, knockdown of Caprin-2 significantly decreased Wnt-3aâstimulated LEF-1âdependent reporter activity and diminished Wnt-induced accumulation of cytoplasmic Î²-catenin.</p>
        <p>We then performed a rescue experiment. We cotransfected full-length Caprin-2 with its siRNA and found that the knockdown effect could be rescued by Caprin-2 itself. One major difference between Caprin-1 and Caprin-2 is that Caprin-2 has an extra C1q region. Thus, we asked whether the C1q region is critical for Caprin-2's activity. To test this, we analyzed a C-terminal truncated form of Caprin-2, and found that this truncated form failed to rescue the effect of Caprin-2 knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also investigated the effect of Caprin-2 knockdown on the expression of native Wnt target genes. We found that in cells transfected with Caprin-2 siRNA, the Wnt-3aâinduced expression of <italic>c-myc</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>) and <italic>axin-2</italic> (not depicted) were reduced. This observation further confirmed that Caprin-2 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway in mammalian cells. Our findings that Caprin-2 but not Caprin-1 interacts with LRP5/6 and activates Wnt signaling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) suggest that Caprin-2 and Caprin-1 have distinct functions.</p>

        <title>Caprin-2 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway in zebrafish development</title>
        <p>To further confirm the role of Caprin-2 as a component or modulator of canonical Wnt signaling, we extended our analyses to the organism level using the zebrafish model system. During zebrafish embryonic development WntâÎ²-catenin signaling is essential for the establishment of ventral and posterior fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lekven et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Thorpe et al., 2005</xref>). We first cloned the zebrafish <italic>Caprin-2</italic> homologue and performed in situ hybridization analysis, which showed that <italic>zCaprin-2</italic> was broadly expressed within 24 h postfertilization (hpf; unpublished data). Next, we used antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) targeting the translation initiation region of <italic>zCaprin-2</italic> to knock down its expression.</p>
        <p>Embryos injected with <italic>Caprin-2</italic> MO exhibited dorsalized phenotypes: an oval shape at early somite stage, with the tailbud premature protrusion from the yolk instead of tight attachment around the yolk (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), and enlargement of the telencephalon and reduction of the tail at 24 hpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), which are similar to <italic>Wnt8</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lekven et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Waxman et al., 2004</xref>), whereas embryos injected with control MO developed normally. The severity of <italic>Caprin-2</italic> morphant phenotypes could be enhanced by increasing the amount of MO injected, indicating a dose-dependent effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p>

        <p>To verify the specificity of morpholino knockdown, we performed rescue experiments with MO-resistant mRNA. The phenotypes induced by a suboptimal dose (0.5 mM) of <italic>Caprin-2</italic> MO were partially reversed by coinjection of 20 pg/nl <italic>zCaprin-2</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>), which suggests that <italic>Caprin-2</italic> MO in our experiments specifically targeted <italic>Caprin-2</italic>. These results were confirmed by using a second <italic>Caprin-2</italic> MO (<italic>Caprin-2</italic> MO2; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p>
        <p>If the phenotype of Caprin-2 morphants was indeed attributable to specific inhibition of the WntâÎ²-catenin pathway, activation of the Wnt pathway by ÎNâÎ²-catenin (the constitutively activated form of Î²-catenin) should suppress the phenotype. To test this, we injected the plasmid expressing zebrafish ÎNâÎ²-catenin1 into the animal cap of one-cell-stage embryos, and found that Caprin-2 MO-induced phenotypes could be rescued by coinjection of ÎNâÎ²-catenin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).</p>
        <p>In agreement with their phenotypes, <italic>Caprin-2</italic> morphants showed a decreased expression level of the ventral markers <italic>eve1</italic> and <italic>tbx6</italic> and expanded expression of the dorsal marker <italic>goosecoid</italic> (<italic>gsc</italic>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In contrast, the expression of <italic>no tail</italic> (<italic>ntl</italic>), the general marker of nascent mesoderm, was unaffected, which suggests that the function of Caprin-2 in zebrafish development is to promote the specification of ventral cell fates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). We also observed the posterior expansion of <italic>opl</italic> (telencephalon) and <italic>pax2.1</italic> (midbrain/hindbrain boundary), coupled with lateral extent of <italic>myoD</italic> at the early somite stage, which resembles the neuroectoderm posteriorization phenotypes of <italic>Wnt8</italic> morphants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To further support that the phenotypes of <italic>Caprin-2</italic> morphants indeed resulted from the disruption of Wnt signaling, we examined the expression of Wnt target genes, the ventrolateral mesoderm marker <italic>tbx6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Szeto and Kimelman, 2004</xref>) at the early gastrula stage, and <italic>cdx4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shimizu et al., 2005</xref>) at the 75% epiboly stage. The expression of both genes was reduced by <italic>Caprin-2</italic> MO, and the reduction could be reversed by zCaprin-2 mRNA injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), which suggests a specific effect of <italic>Caprin-2</italic> MO on Wnt target gene expression. Collectively, we conclude that endogenous Caprin-2 activates canonical Wnt signaling in zebrafish embryos.</p>

        <title>Caprin-2 enhances GSK3-mediated LRP5/6 phosphorylation</title>
        <p>We next asked how Caprin-2 functions in Wnt signaling. Because we have identified that Caprin-2 is an LRP5/6 binding partner, we investigated whether Caprin-2 modulates LRP5/6's activity. We first cotransfected Caprin-2 siRNA with LRP5C2. The result showed that Caprin-2 knockdown blocked the activity of LRP5C2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>), which indicates that Caprin-2 may regulate the activity of LRP5/6. Previously, we have demonstrated that LRP5/6âAxin interaction is critical for the activity of LRP5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mao et al., 2001b</xref>). We thus explored whether Caprin-2 affects LRP5/6âAxin interaction. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with LRP5 and Axin with or without Caprin-2. According to our previous finding that the interaction between LRP5 and Axin requires GSK3, we included GSK3Î² as a positive control in this experiment. Consistent with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mao et al., 2001b</xref>), the interaction between Axin and LRP5 was intensified in the presence of GSK3Î² (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Interestingly, Caprin-2 also enhanced the interaction between Axin and LRP5, and the interaction was notably elevated when Caprin-2 was cotransfected with GSK3Î² (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). The knockdown experiment using Caprin-2 siRNA confirmed the idea that Caprin-2 is required for optimum LRP5/6âAxin interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>).</p>

Cells were treated with control or Wnt-3a conditioned medium (CM) for 30 min, the membrane fraction was isolated, and phosphorylation of endogenous LRP6 was then detected using an anti-pLRP6 (p1490) antibody. The anti-LRP6 antibody was used as internal control. (E) Caprin-2 siRNA was transfected in HEK-293T cells for 72 h. Cells were treated with control or Wnt-3a CM for 30 min. The membrane fraction was isolated, and phosphorylation of LRP6 was then detected.</p>

        <p>Several previous studies have indicated that Wnt-3aâinduced LRP5/6 phosphorylation is required for the initiation of signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zeng et al., 2008</xref>). Upon canonical Wnt stimulation, LRP5/6 is phosphorylated at multiple sites, including Thr-1479, Ser-1490, and Thr-1493, which is mediated by kinases such as GSK3 and Cdk inhibitor; and the phosphorylation of LRP5/6 is required for its binding with Axin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mao et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we further asked whether overexpression or knockdown of Caprin-2 might affect Wnt-stimulated LRP5/6 phosphorylation. We overexpressed Caprin-2 in HEK-293T cells and examined the level of phosphorylated LRP6 using a phospho-LRP6 antibody, which specifically detects Ser-1490 phosphorylation caused by GSK3. Result showed that although Caprin-2 alone could increase LRP6 phosphorylation, Caprin-2 overexpression and the stimulation of Wnt-3a led to a synergistic increase of LRP6 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). The knockdown experiment using siRNAs confirmed that Caprin-2 is a bona fide regulator of LRP6 phosphorylation. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>, when endogenous Caprin-2 was knocked down, the level of phospho-LRP6 upon Wnt-3a stimulation was remarkably decreased. Putting these results together, we propose that Caprin-2 functions through regulating LRP5/6 phosphorylation.</p>
        <p>A recent study has discovered that LRP6 was clustered with Fz, Dvl, Axin, and GSK3 in an LRP6 signalosome in response to Wnt stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>). Formation of this signalosome not only requires oligomerization of LRP6 but also aggregation of Dvl. The C-terminal region of Caprin-2 contains a C1q domain, which also mediates protein oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tom Tang et al., 2005</xref>). We thus hypothesize that Caprin-2 might participate in the process of LRP signalosome formation. We suggest the following possibilities to interpret our observations in light of the current framework of canonical Wnt signaling. (1) Caprin-2 may directly regulate LRP5/6 aggregation. In normal naive cells, Caprin-2 is maintained in a monomer form and binds to LRP5/6. When cells are stimulated by Wnt ligand, Caprin-2 is oligomerized through its C1q domain and promotes LRP5/6 aggregation, which triggers the phosphorylation of LRP5/6. (2) Caprin-2 regulates the association of LRP5/6 and GSK3. In the absence of Wnt, Caprin-2 may separately associate with LRP5/6 and GSK3 (unpublished data), respectively. In the presence of Wnt, Caprin-2 undergoes oligomerization and thereby bridges the interaction between LRP5/6 and GSK3, thus promoting the phosphorylation of LRP5/6 and leading to the activation of Wnt signaling. (3) The fact that knockdown of Caprin-2 inhibited LRP5C2-induced LEF-1 reporter activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>) suggests that Caprin-2 may also function downstream of LRP5/6 activation. Actually, we found that Caprin-2 also interacts with Axin (unpublished data). It is reasonable to hypothesize that Caprin-2 may also play a role in modulating Axin binding to LRP5/6 directly via its interaction with both of LRP5/6 and Axin. Work is in progress to examine these hypotheses.</p>
