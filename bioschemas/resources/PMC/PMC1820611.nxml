      <abstract>
        <p>It was not known how xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein, the primary initiator of global nucleotide excision repair, achieves its outstanding substrate versatility. Here, we analyzed the molecular pathology of a unique Trp690Ser substitution, which is the only reported missense mutation in xeroderma patients mapping to the evolutionary conserved region of XPC protein. The function of this critical residue and neighboring conserved aromatics was tested by site-directed mutagenesis followed by screening for excision activity and DNA binding. This comparison demonstrated that Trp690 and Phe733 drive the preferential recruitment of XPC protein to repair substrates by mediating an exquisite affinity for single-stranded sites. Such a dual deployment of aromatic side chains is the distinctive feature of functional oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding folds and, indeed, sequence homologies with replication protein A and breast cancer susceptibility 2 protein indicate that XPC displays a monomeric variant of this recurrent interaction motif. An aversion to associate with damaged oligonucleotides implies that XPC protein avoids direct contacts with base adducts. These results reveal for the first time, to our knowledge, an entirely inverted mechanism of substrate recognition that relies on the detection of single-stranded configurations in the undamaged complementary sequence of the double helix.</p>

          <p>DNA is constantly exposed to damaging agents such as ultraviolet light, carcinogens, or reactive metabolic byproducts causing thousands of DNA lesions in a typical human cell every hour. To prevent irreversible mutations, many of these different lesions are eliminated by a DNA repair system known as ânucleotide excision repair.â Repair is initiated by the XPC protein, which recognizes damaged sites in the DNA double helix. Here, we describe how the XPC protein probes the way in which the two DNA strands are aligned, and how a recurrent protein motif, termed oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold, is used to detect dynamic fluctuations of DNA in the lesion containing regions. We show that XPC interacts preferentially with the undamaged strand opposite the lesion sites and conclude that XPC protein adopts an entirely indirect recognition mechanism to be able to detect a nearly infinite spectrum of DNA lesions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>One of the most formidable challenges in DNA metabolism is that faced by the initiator of the nucleotide excision repair reaction as it locates damaged sites in the context of a large excess of mostly undamaged residues. This challenge is further complicated by an astounding diversity of target lesions, including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidineâpyrimidone (6â4) photoproducts induced by UV (ultraviolet) light, bulky DNA adducts generated by electrophilic chemicals [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], a subset of oxidative products [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and certain protein-DNA crosslinks [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Molecular defects in this versatile nucleotide excision repair response cause autosomal recessive disorders in humans such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) or Cockayne syndrome [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The XP syndrome, in particular, is characterized by photosensitivity and an extreme predisposition to sunlight-induced skin cancer [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition to cutaneous abnormalities, some XP patients also develop internal tumors [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or neurologic complications leading to DeSanctisâCacchione syndrome [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Individuals affected by XP are classified into seven repair-deficient complementation groups designated XPâA through XPâG [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>The nucleotide excision repair response is separated in two pathways. Global genome repair (GGR) activity is responsible for the excision of DNA lesions across all nucleotide sequences, whereas transcription-coupled repair removes offending lesions only from the transcribed strand of active genes [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A principal difference between these pathways resides in the initial detection of DNA damage. During transcription-coupled repair, elongation of the RNA polymerase II complex is blocked by abnormal residues, thereby inducing the assembly of repair complexes [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast, the GGR machinery is dependent on the initial recognition of damaged sites by XPC protein, which constitutes a universal sensor of bulky lesions [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recent studies showed that XPC is also required for histone modifications in response to bulky lesion formation, presumably to facilitate chromatin remodeling [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It has been suggested that the recruitment of XPC protein is triggered by distortions of the DNA substrate [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but how this initial factor distinguishes between normal conformations of the double helix, induced by nucleosome assembly, transcription or other physiologic processes, and the DNA deformation at damaged sites remained elusive. This lack of mechanistic knowledge reflects the fact that no structure is available for any XPC homolog. Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify a nucleic acid interaction motif that is responsible for the unique recognition function of XPC protein.</p>
      <p>The human <italic>XPC</italic> gene encodes a polypeptide of 940 amino acids that exists as a complex with centrin 2, a centrosomal protein, and HR23B, one of two mammalian homologs of yeast RAD23. XPC protein itself possesses DNA-binding activity, whereas the centrin 2 and HR23B partners exert accessory functions [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Uchida et al. [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have been able to narrow down the DNA-binding domain of XPC to a region of 137 amino acids (codons 607â742) within its evolutionary conserved carboxy-terminal half. Because most mutated <italic>XPC</italic> alleles in xeroderma pigmentosum families lead to premature terminations as a result of frameshifts, nonsense mutations, deletions, insertions or aberrant splicing, only one single substitution, which causes a Trp690Ser change, has been identified in the evolutionary conserved region of XPC protein [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although the loss of this aromatic side chain maps to the presumed DNA-binding domain, its consequence with respect to substrate recognition in the GGR pathway is unknown, prompting a mutational screen to analyze the general role of conserved XPC residues in the detection of DNA lesions. This study disclosed an aromatic hot spot, consisting of Trp690 and Phe733, which mediates an affinity for the single-stranded character of target sites but with an astonishing aversion to associate with damaged DNA strands. A dual system of aromatics that stack with individual unpaired bases of single-stranded DNA has already been identified in RPA (replication protein A), breast cancer susceptibility 2 protein, and many other single-stranded DNA-binding factors [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, our results point to a counterintuitive mechanism of damage recognition by which XPC protein avoids direct contacts with bulky lesions but, instead, probes the local susceptibility of intact nucleotides, on the opposite side of the double helix, to adopt a single-stranded configuration. The spontaneous Trp690Ser point mutation associated with the XP syndrome interferes with this inverted mode of substrate discrimination.</p>

        <title>Identification of Evolutionary Conserved Aromatic Residues</title>
        <p>The human XPC sequence has been aligned [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with its homologs from mouse, rat, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trypanosoma cruzi</named-content>, yeast, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> to identify potential consensus motifs in a region that includes the presumed DNA-binding domain [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This sequence alignment demonstrates that Trp690, mutated in an XP family, is maintained from lower eukaryotes to plants and mammals. The only exception is provided by one of the two homologs in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</named-content>, where the regular Trp at this position is replaced by another aromatic residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The molecular function of an obligatory aromatic side chain at codon 690 was tested by a systematic comparison with all other evolutionary conserved aromatics that were identified in the same portion of human XPC protein, i.e., between codons 531 and 742. Also, the effects of these mutations were evaluated in relation to the substitution of other conserved residues with varying side chains. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the positions in the presumed DNA-binding domain that have been selected for site-directed mutagenesis and highlights their degree of conservation among eukaryotes.</p>

        <title>Conserved Aromatics Are Critical Determinants of XPC Function</title>
        <p>A host cell reactivation assay was used to monitor the DNA repair proficiency of XPC mutants in human cells [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. XPâC fibroblasts, which fail to express XPC protein, were transiently transfected with a dual luciferase reporter system accompanied by an expression vector coding for human XPC protein or the different mutants. The reporter construct, which carries a firefly luciferase gene, was damaged by exposure to UV light (254 nm; 1000 J/m<sup>2</sup>) and supplemented with an unirradiated control vector that expresses the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase. Following varying repair times, firefly luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates and normalized against the internal <italic>Renilla</italic> standard.</p>
        <p>Due to the repair defect of XPâC cells, transcription of the reporter gene was suppressed by persistent UV lesions, resulting in reduced firefly luciferase activity. However, DNA repair and, hence, firefly luciferase expression was restored following transfection with pcXPC, demonstrating that the genetic defect of XPâC fibroblasts is corrected by wild-type XPC protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). In contrast, expression of the reporter gene was not rescued when the same XPâC cells were transfected with the empty vector pcDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The residual background activity (â¼15% of wild-type control), observed in the presence of these empty vectors, is likely due to the transcription-coupled repair process, which operates independently of XPC. In part, this residual activity may also result from a minor fraction of plasmids remaining free of bulky UV lesions in the luciferase reporter sequence.</p>

Human XPâC fibroblasts were transfected with an expression vector coding for wild-type XPC (pcXPC) or the empty control vector (pcDNA). Repair complementation was assessed after the indicated times by monitoring luciferase expression from a UV-irradiated reporter construct.

Excision is reported as the percentage of wild-type activity (15-h incubations).</p>

        <p>The firefly luciferase production was not restored when, instead of XPC, XPA protein was expressed in XPâC fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), thus demonstrating the specificity of our host cell reactivation system. Also, the firefly luciferase production was inhibited when the XPC sequence was modified to carry the Trp690Ser mutation responsible for clinical manifestations of the XP syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Nearly identical results were obtained by transfecting the cells with vector pXPCâGFP, which drives the expression of wild type or mutated XPC sequences fused, on their carboxy-terminal side, to green fluorescent protein (GFP). As expected, no complementation of the repair defect was detected upon expression of GFP alone using the corresponding control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>The relative luciferase activity indicative of DNA repair was determined in the presence of each site-directed mutant, and the results were reported as the percentage of wild-type complementation after deduction of background luciferase expression. Initially, the aromatic side chains of conserved Phe, Trp, and Tyr residues were eliminated by Ala substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In most cases, the excision-repair proficiency of XPC protein was only marginally diminished by these PheâAla, TrpâAla, or TyrâAla changes. However, point mutations at the conserved codons 531, 542, 585, 690, and 733 resulted in a substantial (&gt;50%) reduction of excision activity, and the residual DNA repair observed with these mutants is similar to the low level of complementation promoted by the Trp690Ser allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). All these mutants displayed essentially the same repair deficiency when reexamined as GFP fusion products (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>The more sensitive codons 531, 542, 585, 690, and 733 were further tested by converting the respective aromatics to different amino acids with varying properties. In all cases, the luciferase activity reflecting DNA excision repair was strongly reduced regardless of whether the aromatics were replaced by the aliphatic side chain of Ala, the hydrogen moiety of Gly, or the hydrophilic side chain of Ser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). These results imply that the loss of activity conferred by these XPC mutations is primarily a consequence of the missing aromatic residue rather than being dependent on the properties of the newly introduced substituent.</p>
        <p>Basic amino acids frequently make contacts with the phosphate moieties of the DNA backbone. Thus, evolutionary conserved Lys and Arg residues, located between codons 595 and 708 of the human XPC protein, were targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. The positively charged side chains were eliminated by changing the respective residues to Gly, but none of the resulting LysâGly or ArgâGly substitutions were able to perturb the XPC function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). In addition, absolutely conserved amino acids in the center of the putative DNA-binding domain of human XPC protein were changed to Ala residues. The resulting Pro635Ala, His644Ala, and Ser686Ala substitutions reduced the luciferase activity to a moderate degree but, interestingly, none of these mutants reached the low residual repair level observed after removal of an aromatic side chain at position 690 or 733 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g002">Figure 2</xref>F).</p>

        <p>Conflicting results regarding the affinity of XPC protein for DNA substrates of different lengths and conformations have emerged. Oligonucleotides with fewer than 60 base pairs resulted in weakened binding and reduced damage selectivity [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As a consequence, we employed radiolabeled duplexes of 65 base pairs to monitor DNA binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The nucleotide sequence was designed to contain neighboring pyrimidines for the formation of UV-induced dimers. Thus, the double-stranded substrates were UV irradiated (254-nm wavelength) to test the DNA damage selectivity of purified XPC fusion products. As expected from previous reports [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], an increased affinity of XPC for UV-irradiated duplexes, over the unirradiated control, was detected when the binding reactions were supplemented with an excess of undamaged competitor DNA, i.e., under conditions of limiting protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p>
        <p>In addition to this known affinity for UV-irradiated duplexes, we observed that XPC protein exhibits an extraordinary preference for binding to single-stranded 65-mer oligonucleotides over undamaged double-stranded fragments of the same length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). These results obtained with relatively long oligomeric substrates imply that the XPC subunit fits the classic definition of a single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Because shorter duplexes are more prone to spontaneous denaturation, generating regions of single-stranded DNA, the preference of XPC protein for binding to single strands over double-stranded DNA is abrogated by reducing the oligonucleotide length to 40 residues or fewer (unpublished data). This effect of substrate length provides a possible explanation for the diverging results of previous studies where the damage selectivity of XPC protein had not been attributed to an affinity for single-stranded DNA conformations [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A striking bias for single-stranded DNA is further supported by competition assays showing that the binding of XPC protein to UV-irradiated 65-mer duplexes is sensitive to the addition of 65-mer single strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Conversely, when the competitor consisted of double-stranded plasmids, an excess of heavily UV-irradiated DNA was necessary to reduce the binding of XPC protein to single-stranded oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g004">Figure 4</xref>E).</p>
        <p>Subsequently, we observed that the high-affinity association of XPC protein with DNA single strands was progressively reduced upon UV irradiation of the oligonucleotide substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). Interestingly, the UV dose of 600 J/m<sup>2</sup> is expected to yield a damage frequency of &lt;1 photoproduct/oligonucleotide molecule (40), yet this low level of radiation was sufficient to reduce the single-stranded DNA-binding activity of XPC protein by â¼50%. Higher UV doses further suppressed the single-stranded DNA-binding activity to marginal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g004">Figure 4</xref>G), indicating that bulky lesions collide with the ability of XPC protein to form complexes with DNA oligonucleotides. Taken together, we conclude that XPC protein is recruited to target sites by virtue of its characteristic preference for deoxyribonucleotide sequences that adopt a single-stranded conformation. Surprisingly, this sensor protein associates preferentially with undamaged strands but rejects direct interactions with damaged strands.</p>

        <title>The Trp690Ser Substitution Confers Defective DNA Binding</title>
        <p>Two different strategies were used to test the ability of XPC mutants to interact with single-stranded DNA substrates. First, MBPâXPC fusion products were expressed in <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells, and the respective cell lysates were incubated with single-stranded DNA immobilized on agarose beads. After 2 h-incubations at 4 Â°C, the fraction of XPC protein in the pellet (bound to DNA) was separated by repeated washing from the free XPC molecules remaining in the supernatant. The extensively washed pellets and the accompanying supernatants were analyzed separately by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Side-by-side comparisons showed that, in the case of the wild-type control, a major proportion (&gt;70%) of XPC protein was recovered in the DNA-agarose pellet when the binding reactions were performed in buffer containing NaCl concentrations of 0.1â0.3 M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 1â6). If the NaCl concentration was raised to 0.4 M, only â¼50% of wild-type protein remained bound to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 7 and 8). When the ionic strength was further increased, the proportion of XPC protein retained in the DNA pellet was diminished, reflecting a gradual reduction of nucleic acid binding. In the case of the Trp690Ser mutant, the fraction of protein recovered in association with the DNA beads was markedly reduced already in buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2).

        <p>All repair-deficient substitutions were expressed as MBP fusion products and tested for their ability to interact with single-stranded DNA immobilized on agarose beads. This systematic comparison was performed in buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl, which corresponds to the ionic strength under which the most pronounced difference was detected between wild-type XPC protein and the Trp690Ser reference.

This control experiment, again carried out in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl, confirmed that the removal of an aromatic side chain at positions 690 and 733 disrupts the DNA-binding function of XPC protein.

        <title>Probing of XPC Mutants with Single-Stranded Oligonucleotides</title>
        <p>A second experimental strategy, based on defined oligonucleotide probes, was established to confirm that the mutations at codons 690 and 733 confer defective binding to single-stranded DNA. For that purpose, MBPâXPC products were first purified from <italic>Sf</italic>9 cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with anti-MBP antibodies linked to paramagnetic beads. This one-step procedure generated nearly homogenous preparations of MBPâXPC fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Subsequently, the amount of paramagnetic beads was adjusted to include 100 ng of purified protein, translating to a final XPC concentration of 3 nM in each binding reaction. Such purified fractions of wild-type protein or Trp690Ser mutant were incubated with radiolabeled 65-mer single strands and, following 2 h at 4 Â°C, the oligonucleotides captured by XPC protein were separated from free DNA. After extensive washing, the radioactivity associated with XPC protein on the paramagnetic beads was quantified by scintillation counting. We found substantial binding of wild-type XPC protein to single-stranded oligonucleotides but this interaction was markedly reduced when the Trp690Ser mutant was tested under exactly the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Next, the reaction mixtures were adjusted to contain different amounts of protein, thus demonstrating a dose-dependent increase of DNA-binding activity in the presence of wild-type XPC. These dose-dependence experiments confirmed that XPC protein interacts more efficiently with 65-mer heteroduplexes containing a 3-nucleotide bubble than to perfectly homoduplex controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). The DNA-binding activity was further enhanced by replacing duplex substrates with single-stranded oligonucleotides of the same length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). Finally, these dose-dependent binding assays were used to compare the relative affinity of wild-type and mutant proteins for single-stranded DNA. In contrast to the efficient association of wild-type XPC with 65-mer oligonucleotides, the ability to interact with single-stranded DNA was essentially lost when we tested the mutants carrying an Ala substitution at codon 690 or 733 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). However, in agreement with the different assay of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g006">Figure 6</xref>, the DNA-binding activity was more moderately affected by a Trp531Ala substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g007">Figure 7</xref>D).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The most astounding feature of the GGR machinery is its ability to eliminate a wide diversity of DNA lesions, but how this repair system discriminates anomalous residues against the vast background of normal deoxyribonucleotides is still a focus of intense research, mainly because there is no common chemical motif among the different DNA adducts that would account for a classic âlock and keyâ recognition scheme [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our mutagenesis screen designed to probe the mode of action of human XPC protein indicates that this primary initiator of the GGR reaction donates a pair of aromatic side chains (Trp690 and Phe733) to monitor the double helical integrity of DNA and to recognize the local single-stranded character imposed on the undamaged side of the DNA duplex. These novel findings have several important implications with regard to damage recognition and the versatile GGR pathway.</p>
      <p>First, the preference of XPC protein for substrates containing a short single-stranded segment, over fully complementary duplexes, provides a truly universal mechanism for the detection of lesion sites. Normally, the native DNA duplex is stabilized by complementary base pairing as well as by stacking interactions between adjacent bases such that, in the absence of damage, the bases are positioned to the interior of the double helix. In contrast, DNA at damaged sites deviates considerably from this canonical WatsonâCrick geometry. Bulky adducts often disrupt normal pairing and stacking interactions, thereby lowering the thermal and thermodynamic stability of the duplex, which results in local separation of the complementary strands and exposure of unpaired and unstacked bases on the surface of the double helix, thus generating an abnormal configuration with features that resemble single-stranded DNA [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The present equilibrium binding studies as well as kinetic measurements [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], both demonstrating an extraordinary affinity for single-stranded oligonucleotides relative to double-stranded counterparts, imply that only base adducts that destabilize the double helix generate the key molecular signal for recognition by the single-stranded DNA-binding motif of XPC protein.</p>
      <p>Second, our results point to an inverted mode of recruitment mediated by an affinity for the undamaged strand of the DNA duplex. In fact, we observed an unfavorable binding of XPC protein to UV-irradiated DNA oligonucleotides compared to undamaged single-stranded counterparts. A similar reduction of oligonucleotide binding has been detected following the introduction of a site-specific cisplatin adduct [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], implying that the interaction of XPC protein with single-stranded DNA is generally disturbed by the presence of adducted, crosslinked, or otherwise aberrant base residues. Thus, the exquisite affinity of XPC protein for single-stranded oligonucleotides, in combination with its aversion to interact with damaged strands, indicates that the recognition step in the GGR pathway is guided by an initial association with the native strand of damaged duplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g008">Figure 8</xref>A), without ruling out the possibility that XPC protein may ultimately interact with both strands. Such an inverted mode of damage recognition, which is completely independent of the variable chemistry of the lesion sites, accommodates the ability of the GGR machinery to detect a very wide array of DNA adducts. Recently, it has been reported that RPA is equally refractory to interactions with damaged oligonucleotides [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], suggesting a functional analogy between XPC protein and representatives of the large family of single-stranded DNA-binding factors.</p>

      <p>Third, the dependence on a dual system of aromatic amino acids indicates a structural basis for the observed similarity between the XPC subunit and known single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. We found that two distinct aromatics in the presumed nucleic acid-binding domain of XPC protein, i.e., Trp690 and Phe733, are more critically involved in the high-affinity interaction with single-stranded configurations than all other conserved residues in the same XPC region. Even mutations affecting the absolutely conserved Pro635, Lys642, His644, Tyr676, Arg678, Ser686, or Lys708, located in the DNA-binding domain, cause less incisive repair deficiencies than the removal of the aromatic side chains at positions 690 and 733. Other aromatic side chains at codons 531, 542, and 585 are similarly required for excision repair activity, but their removal confers more moderate DNA-binding defects. This observation is consistent with a previous report indicating that residues 531â585 are located outside the core DNA-binding domain [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The distinctive requirement for a pair of aromatics (Trp690 and Phe733 in the case of XPC) is reminiscent of the OB-fold of many single-stranded DNA-binding proteins [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In RPA, for example, four different DNA-binding subdomains with the characteristic OB-fold are responsible for the association with single-stranded substrates [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Each of these domains forms a small Î²-barrel consisting of several short elements of secondary structure connected by loops of variable length [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The single-stranded DNA-binding activity of these RPA subdomains correlates with the presence of two structurally conserved aromatics that mediate stacking interactions with closely spaced DNA bases. Other OB-folds in the RPA complex that lack these aromatic side chains fail to contribute to nucleic acid binding [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The reiteration of a pattern of two separate aromatics in the DNA-binding domain of XPC protein lends support to the hypothesis that this repair factor may display an analogous structural fold to recognize DNA bases extruded from the double helix, and forced into a single-stranded conformation, as a consequence of bulky lesion formation. The different OB-fold subdomains of RPA range between 110 and 180 amino acids in length. As a minimal DNA-binding fragment of XPC protein has been mapped to a region of 136 amino acids [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we predict that XPC displays a monomeric variant of this motif to detect the single-stranded character resulting from separation of just one or, depending on the extent of DNA distortion, no more than a few base pairs at lesion sites.</p>
      <p>To summarize, XPC protein displays a range of properties that are typical of the OB-fold of single-stranded DNA-binding factors, i.e., an affinity for single-stranded oligonucleotides, an exquisite preference for undamaged strands relative to damaged strands, the pairwise deployment of aromatics for nucleic acid binding, and the ability to interact with single-stranded DNA under conditions of elevated ionic strength. This combination of functional and structural analogies raises the question of whether a common sequence motif may be shared by XPC and known single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. A systematic analysis of the XPC full-length sequence did not reveal any signature that may have predicted its DNA-binding properties [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, a homology search focused on the comparison with the growing family of OB-fold proteins showed that the nucleic acid-binding region of XPC protein displays a remarkable similarity to one of the oligonucleotide-binding subdomains of human RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050079-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). This comparison yielded 27% identity and 73% similarity between the DNA-binding domain of XPC protein and the RPA-B motif situated in the large subunit of the human RPA complex. The sequence homology extends over most of the conserved elements of secondary structure of the RPA-B subdomain and exceeds the 12% identity detected when known OB-folds were aligned according to their high-resolution structure [<xref rid="pbio-0050079-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The same DNA-binding region of XPC also displays a 66% similarity with the OB1 and a 64% similarity with the OB2 motif of breast cancer susceptibility 2 (unpublished data). Thus, the aromatic sensor domain of XPC protein, responsible for the recognition of DNA damage in the GGR pathway, is related to the OB-folds of known single-stranded DNA-binding proteins.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, this article shows that a versatile sensor of DNA damage achieves its wide recognition function by avoiding direct contacts with injured residues. Instead, XPC protein exploits the inherent redundancy of the genetic code in the DNA double helix to detect DNA damage in an indirect but highly versatile manner. If one strand contains a bulky lesion, normal base pairing and stacking interactions are compromised, and the intact complementary strand converts to a local single-stranded configuration, thus generating the universal molecular signal for XPC recruitment.</p>
