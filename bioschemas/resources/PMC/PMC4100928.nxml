      <abstract>
        <p>Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptors (ROR) 1 and 2 are atypical members of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family and have been associated with several human diseases. The vertebrate RORs contain an ATP binding domain that deviates from the consensus amino acid sequence, although the impact of this deviation on catalytic activity is not known and the kinase function of these receptors remains controversial. Recently, ROR2 was shown to signal through a Wnt responsive, Î²-catenin independent pathway and suppress a canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin signal. In this work we demonstrate that both ROR1 and ROR2 kinase domains are catalytically deficient while CAM-1, the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> homolog of ROR, has an active tyrosine kinase domain, suggesting a divergence in the signaling processes of the ROR family during evolution. In addition, we show that substitution of the non-consensus residues from ROR1 or ROR2 into CAM-1 and MuSK markedly reduce kinase activity, while restoration of the consensus residues in ROR does not restore robust kinase function. We further demonstrate that the membrane-bound extracellular domain alone of either ROR1 or ROR2 is sufficient for suppression of canonical Wnt3a signaling, and that this domain can also enhance Wnt5a suppression of Wnt3a signaling. Based on these data, we conclude that human ROR1 and ROR2 are RTK-like pseudokinases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptors (ROR) 1 and 2 are among the most widely studied non-canonical Wnt receptors of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family and ROR genes are conserved in animals from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to humans <xref rid="pone.0102695-Masiakowski1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Mutations that affect localization and activity of ROR2 cause the developmental defects Robinow syndrome and brachydactyly type B <xref rid="pone.0102695-Afzal1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. ROR2 has been linked to a number of human cancers and is thought to increase cellular migration though increased expression <xref rid="pone.0102695-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102695-Enomoto1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Further, expression of ROR1 is highly upregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) <xref rid="pone.0102695-Daneshmanesh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0102695-Baskar1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) <xref rid="pone.0102695-Shabani1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) <xref rid="pone.0102695-Hudecek1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Deletion of either ROR1 or ROR2 in mice is lethal, resulting in skeletal, pulmonary and cardiac developmental defects <xref rid="pone.0102695-Nomi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The RORs share significant domain similarity to Muscle Specific Kinase (MuSK) receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g001">Figure 1a</xref>), which is activated by the extracellular matrix protein Agrin and the co-receptor LRP4, causing cytoskeleton rearrangement and formation of myotubes <xref rid="pone.0102695-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. MuSK activity plays a role in neuromuscular junction formation and neural crest cell migration through processes thought to be regulated by Wnt signaling <xref rid="pone.0102695-Henriquez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Wnt signaling is mediated through several pathways: a canonical Î²-catenin dependent pathway, and multiple non-canonical Î²-catenin independent pathways which remain poorly understood <xref rid="pone.0102695-vanAmerongen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102695-Angers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The canonical signaling pathway is initiated by binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled (FZD) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) co-receptors and results in Î²-catenin stabilization, nuclear translocation of Î²-catenin and promotion of transcription through the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor/T cell factor (Lef/Tcf) coactivators. Canonical Wnt signaling plays an essential role in embryonic development and the maintenance of adult stem cells in regenerative tissue compartments. Activated canonical Wnt signaling resulting from mutations in genes encoding Î²-catenin or adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) that disrupt Î²-catenin degradation has been observed in many types of cancer <xref rid="pone.0102695-Peifer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Non-canonical Wnt pathways can be stimulated by the ligand Wnt5a, however, signaling proceeds independently of Î²-catenin, through several alternate downstream effectors, many of which have been linked to the generation and maintenance of planar cell polarity (PCP) (7). ROR1 and ROR2, which share approximately 50% sequence identity <xref rid="pone.0102695-Masiakowski1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, have a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) similar to that in FZD receptors <xref rid="pone.0102695-Masiakowski2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102695-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and bind Wnt5a ligand <xref rid="pone.0102695-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Wnt5a has been shown to establish PCP by stimulating Vangl2 phosphorylation through ROR2 <xref rid="pone.0102695-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Wnt5a has also been shown to stimulate association and internalization of FZD2 or FZD7 with ROR2 and activate the small G-protein RAC1 following receptor endocytosis <xref rid="pone.0102695-Enomoto1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102695-Tice1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Additionally, Wnt5a and ROR2 can regulate phosphorylation of transcription factors by effectors such as JNK <xref rid="pone.0102695-Nomachi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In most of these examples, non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways oppose the canonical Î²-catenin Wnt signaling pathway, although the mechanisms remain controversial.</p>
      <p>The kinase domains of the vertebrate ROR proteins contain non-consensus cysteine, aspartic or glutamic acid residues in the glycine rich P-loop that may hinder ATP binding and disrupt enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0102695-Hanks1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Likewise, the ROR homolog from at least one other species, <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (sea anemone), is predicted to be inactive based on substitution of a valine residue for the catalytic lysine in the VAIK ATP binding motif. In contrast, the closely related human receptor, MuSK, or ROR proteins in lower organisms, like the <italic>C. elegans</italic> CAM-1 <xref rid="pone.0102695-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ROR retain consensus kinase motifs. The kinase domains of these receptors share 40 to 45% sequence identity with ROR.</p>
      <p>The catalytic effects of substitutions of larger amino acids in the second glycine of the kinase P-loop are incompletely explained by the available structural data. Structural alignments of the C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain of ROR2 and the ATP-free, apo form of MuSK <xref rid="pone.0102695-Till1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, are closely related with an RMSD of less than 1 Ã for all atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). In both structures, the catalytic lysine (Lys507 in ROR2) and the magnesium-coordinating aspartic acid from the DFG region (Asp633 in ROR2) are in the inactive conformation, as is often observed in kinase structures solved in the apo state. The ROR2 Tyr555 side-chain in the hinge region also partially occludes the adenine-binding site. In contrast, the equivalent tyrosine residue in MuSK is oriented away from the active site and would not block adenine/ATP binding. In addition, segments of the N-terminal lobe including the P-loop and sheet Î²1 of ROR2 are in a relatively open conformation creating a larger ATP binding site with fewer stabilizing interactions relative to those available in MuSK <xref rid="pone.0102695-Till1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and other kinases; this open conformation of ROR2 may result from the aspartic acid substitution in the P-loop. A comparison of ROR2 kinase domain to the related kinase domain of insulin-like growth factor receptor <xref rid="pone.0102695-Till1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> (IGF-R) in the apo <xref rid="pone.0102695-Munshi1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and phosphorylated, ATP-bound state <xref rid="pone.0102695-Favelyukis1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g001">Figure 1d</xref>. In these structures, the P-loop and sheet Î²1 of the IGF-R N-terminal lobe are in almost identical locations in both the ATP-bound and ATP-free structures and thus are positioned to pre-form part of the ATP binding site, demonstrating that a conformational rearmament of the P-loop is not required for ATP binding. However, kinase domains are highly flexible and there is no obvious structural rationale that would prevent ROR1 or ROR2 from undergoing a structural rearrangement to accommodate the non-consensus P-loop residues.</p>
      <p>An accurate understanding of the function and enzymatic activity of the ROR kinase domain is essential to defining its role in disease. We therefore evaluated the enzymatic activity of isolated ROR1 and ROR2 kinase domains which have been overexpressed in insect cells and purified to greater then 95% homogeneity. Previous studies with crudely purified, immunoprecipitated ROR1 that may contain co-factors or associated kinases have produced conflicting results, with one study demonstrating the presence of ROR1 kinase activity <xref rid="pone.0102695-Masiakowski1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and another refuting this result <xref rid="pone.0102695-Gentile1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. With respect to ROR2, studies have shown the presence of phosphorylation in response to Wnt5a stimulation <xref rid="pone.0102695-Akbarzadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0102695-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, but these studies did not demonstrate ROR2 autophosphorylation, nor were any tyrosine phosphorylation sites mapped within the activation loop.</p>
      <p>In the current work, <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical activity of the highly purified cytoplasmic domains of ROR1 and ROR2, or the positive control CAM-1 and MuSK indicate extremely weak activity for either human ROR kinase domain; comparable to that of classic kinase-inactivating mutants of MuSK and CAM-1. In fact, this lack of robust kinase activity of human ROR is characteristic of a pseudokinase, as suggested from the analysis of the protein sequence, unlike CAM-1 and MuSK. Further, we demonstrate using quantitative mass spectrometry that Wnt5a activation of ROR1 is not associated with kinase activation of the receptors in mammalian cells. Full-length and truncation constructs of ROR1 and ROR2 were evaluated in a cell-based assay for Wnt reporter activity under identical conditions to the quantitative mass spectrometry experiments, demonstrating that enhanced inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling by either ROR does not require the presence of the kinase domain. These biochemical data, combined with the phylogenetic data, suggest a divergence of selection pressure on mammalian ROR during evolution to retain the robust phosphotransferase activity of CAM-1 and MuSK, and point to the dominant function of the ROR kinase domain as a pseudokinase scaffold for recruiting other proteins active in cell polarity processes.</p>

</title>
        <p>To gain greater biochemical insight into the functions of the ROR kinase domains and resolve the controversy around the kinase activity, we expressed and isolated wild type and mutant forms of the full intracellular domains (ICDs) from human ROR1, ROR2, MuSK and <italic>C. elegans</italic> CAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Further, we generated single point mutations in ROR kinase domains to restore the canonical GxGxxG, P-loop, and mutations in MuSK and CAM-1 to substitute the non-consensus P-loop residues of ROR1 and ROR2. Finally, common kinase-inactivating mutations of MuSK and CAM-1 were generated as negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). All purified proteins are greater than 95% pure as characterized by Coomassie stained gel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102695.s001">Figure S1</xref>). MuSK has been previously shown to be an active tyrosine kinase <xref rid="pone.0102695-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> while the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase activity of CAM-1 has not previously been reported.</p>
        <p>After overnight incubation with magnesium and ATP, the wild type kinase domains of ROR1 and ROR2 show 100 and 1000 fold less tyrosine phosphorylation than CAM-1 and MuSK, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g002">Figures 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102695.s002">S2</xref>). Restoration of the consensus P-loop glycine in the ROR1/2 C/D482G mutants causes a reproducible 1.5 to 3-fold improvement in the catalytic activity of ROR2 but no consistent effect of the activity of ROR1. However, CAM-1 and MuSK mutants harboring the non-consensus ROR P-loop residues lose more than 85% autophosphorylation kinase activity with respect to wild type. The negative controls, a catalytic lysine mutant of MuSK (K609R) and the magnesium-binding mutants (CAM-1 D744N &amp; MuSK D743N) were less active than the P-loop mutants, but retained a detectable level of tyrosine phosphorylation comparable to wild type and mutant ROR. Interestingly, the catalytic lysine mutant in CAM-1 (K624R) had little to no average change in activity. However, CAM-1 contains two adjacent, potentially catalytic lysine residues in Subdomain II and it is likely that K625 is compensating for the mutation K624.</p>

        <title>ROR kinase activity is not required for inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling</title>
        <p>ROR1 and ROR2 are known to act as Wnt5a receptors <xref rid="pone.0102695-Mikels1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102695-Mikels2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, however, the function of the kinase domains of these receptors in intracellular signaling is unclear. Both ROR1 and ROR2 alone inhibit Wnt3a stimulation of TOPbrite Wnt reporter activity in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g004">Figure 4</xref>), consistent with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0102695-Mikels2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Addition of Wnt5a modestly inhibits Wnt3a stimulated TOPbrite activity in control cells, and this effect is greatly enhanced by expression of either ROR1 or ROR2, as compared to the related MuSK receptor used as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and other unrelated control receptors (data not shown), suggesting that this repressive effect is specific to ROR. To identify the domains of ROR that are involved in inhibiting Wnt3a activity, we generated truncated receptor constructs containing the extra-cellular domain (ECD) or the ICD, tethered to the plasma membrane by the native transmembrane domain (TM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Cell surface expression of these constructs was confirmed by FACS analysis, using an anti-FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102695.s003">Figure S3a</xref>), while receptor protein expression in luciferase assay samples was determined by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102695.s003">Figure S3b</xref>). Expression of the ECD-TM constructs of ROR1 and ROR2 results in inhibition of the canonical Wnt3a signal in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g004">Figure 4</xref>) in the absence of Wnt5a. Antagonism of canonical Wnt3a signaling by the ROR ECD-TM, but not the TM-ICD, is further enhanced by the addition of Wnt5a ligand. In fact, both full length ROR and ROR ECD-TM completely block Wnt3a signaling when stimulated with Wnt5a; an effect not seen in our controls.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A number of molecular events have been proposed to explain ROR signaling mechanisms, including tyrosine phosphorylation by the ROR kinase domain <xref rid="pone.0102695-Mikels1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, complex formation and phosphorylation of Vangl2 <xref rid="pone.0102695-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, complex formation and internalization with FZD receptors <xref rid="pone.0102695-Grumolato1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102695-Nishita1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and Dsh oligomerization <xref rid="pone.0102695-Nishita1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Given the overall sequence identity between ROR and the conventional RTKs CAM-1 and MuSK, which are also involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements, and the observation that ROR2 and Wnt5a stimulate Dsh phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0102695-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, it might be assumed that Wnt5a and ROR should launch a phosphorylation cascade. Our data demonstrate that if such a cascade exists in vertebrates, it is unlikely to require enzymatic tyrosine phosphorylation by the ROR kinase domains, consistent with one earlier report <xref rid="pone.0102695-Nishita1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In fact, CAM-1 kinase activity is not necessary to maintain cell polarity, cell migration and asymmetric cell division in <italic>C. elegans</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0102695-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102695-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Additionally, in mammalian cells, ROR Kinase activity is not required for stimulation of filopodia formation, cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration in response to Wnt5a <xref rid="pone.0102695-Nishita2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Further, it is clear from our Wnt reporter assay data that the kinase domain of ROR is not essential for its role in suppression of canonical Wnt activity. <italic>In vitro,</italic> the efficiency of ROR1 and ROR2 tyrosine phosphorylation catalysis, as determined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot is 100 to 1000 fold less than that observed for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ROR homolog CAM-1 or human MuSK. In addition, enzyme kinetics experiments for peptide tyrosine phosphorylation by the kinase domains ROR1 and ROR2 demonstrated no activity within the quantification limits of the assay (K<sub>M(ATP)</sub>&gt;15 mM), in contrast to CAM-1 and MuSK (33). While these data alone are not conclusive evidence of a complete lack of catalytic potential, the biological significance of such a high K<sub>M(ATP)</sub> at typical cellular ATP concentrations is dubious, at least on common receptor tyrosine kinase substrates. Previous reports have associated kinase activity with ROR that has been immunoprecipitated from crude cell extracts, a condition where cofactors or associated kinases might also co-precipitate <xref rid="pone.0102695-Masiakowski1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102695-Mikels1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, using highly purified material prepared in a manner similar to ours, a recent study has shown the ROR1 kinase domain to have no detectable Mg<sup>++</sup>-binding nor ATP-binding activity in a thermal-shift assay <xref rid="pone.0102695-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, consistent with our data. Wnt5a-dependent <italic>trans</italic>-phosphorylation of ROR by kinases has been noted by researchers <xref rid="pone.0102695-Akbarzadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and may explain the previously observed ROR cellular tyrosine phosphorylation.</p>
      <p>The kinetics and autophosphorylation experiments in the current report were performed with isolated protein of greater than 95% purity. It is possible that, in contrast to CAM-1, human ROR kinase activity may require a trans-activating cellular cofactor or that an autoregulatory domain inhibits activity of the constructs used in our biochemical analysis, as has been shown for other RTKs <xref rid="pone.0102695-Hubbard1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. However, Wnt5a-induced activation of ROR1 tyrosine kinase activity can be ruled out by our quantitative mass spectrometry experiments using full length ROR1 expressed in HEK293 cells and activated with Wnt5a. Under these conditions less than 1%, if any, ROR1 is phosphorylated on any tyrosine residues in the activation loop, confirming the <italic>in vitro</italic> data that ROR1 lacks robust kinase activity. These cellular phosphorylation experiments were performed under identical conditions to the TOPbrite reporter assays, providing a positive control of ROR1 functionality. While we did not observe autophosphorylation of ROR1 in response to Wnt5a stimulation, it is possible that another ligand for ROR1 exists which could activate the receptor in a different context.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that while we observed some residual tyrosine phosphorylation of ROR <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is possible that the protein preparations contained a small amount of active tyrosine kinase contaminant from the host cell lysate and we cannot rule out the possibility that wild type ROR1 and ROR2 completely lack catalytic activity. We were unable to isolate soluble cytoplasmic ROR protein containing classic catalytic inactivating mutations, as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g001">Figure 1b</xref>, Mutations 1â4), however, our <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical data indicate that the residual tyrosine phosphorylation of ROR is less than or approximately equal to that of the kinase-inactivating mutants of CAM-1 and MuSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102695-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Structures are available for several pseudokinase domains that, like ROR, contain non-consensus residues in the glycine rich loop, including Integrin-linked Kinase (ILK) <xref rid="pone.0102695-Fukuda2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, Vaccinia related kinase (VRK3) <xref rid="pone.0102695-Scheeff1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and Rhotropy family members ROP2 <xref rid="pone.0102695-Labesse1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and ROP8 <xref rid="pone.0102695-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Of these pseudokinases, only ILK has been shown to bind ATP and none of these kinases has been shown to be enzymatically competent to phosphorylate any substrate or hydrolyze ATP. The greater than 10-fold average loss in activity of the P-loop mutants of CAM-1 and MuSK highlights the importance of the consensus P-loop in canonical kinase ATP binding and catalytic activity. However, restoration of the consensus P-loop in ROR does not result in an increase in enzymatic activity beyond that of the CAM-1 and MuSK mutant negative controls. This paradoxical phenomenon is not unique to ROR and has been reported for other pseudokinases, such as HER3 and STRADÎ± <xref rid="pone.0102695-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102695-Boudeau1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. If these pseudokinases have evolved a predominantly non-catalytic role in signaling pathways, then this result is likely explained by an absence of selection pressure to retain other structural features, outside of the defined consensus motifs, that are essential for robust enzymatic activity.</p>
      <p>As a pseudokinase, it is possible and perhaps likely that ROR may allosterically activate a functional kinase, as has been demonstrated with the pseudokinase STRADÎ± and LKB1 <xref rid="pone.0102695-Rajakulendran1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. As a kinase substrate, the C-terminus of ROR contains a proline-rich consensus sequence potentially capable of SH3 domain binding, as well as numerous tyrosines, which when phosphorylated, may be sites of SH2 domain-binding. Alternatively, the extracellular domain of ROR may serve as a node for protein-protein interactions; in which case, the kinase domain might participate through a substrate trapping mechanism.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> CAM-1 is an active kinase <italic>in vitro</italic> while human ROR1 and ROR2 lack comparable catalytic activity in similar assays, suggesting an evolutionary divergence in at least some gene functions. Our data support the hypothesis that human ROR functions principally as an RTK-like pseudokinase. A more detailed study of these events will be essential to understand the physiological functions of ROR and may lead to the identification of the interaction targets of the kinase domain.</p>
