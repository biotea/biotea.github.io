      <abstract>
        <p>Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA) comprises a large and heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. For many affected patients, the genetic cause remains undetermined. Through whole-exome sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous mutations in ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 5 gene (<italic>UBA5</italic>) in two Chinese siblings presenting with ARCA. Moreover, copy number variations in <italic>UBA5</italic> or ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 gene (<italic>UFM1</italic>) were documented with the phenotypes of global developmental delays and gait disturbances in the ClinVar database. <italic>UBA5</italic> encodes UBA5, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme of UFM1. However, a crucial role for UBA5 in human neurological disease remains to be reported. Our molecular study of UBA5-R246X revealed a dramatically decreased half-life and loss of UFM1 activation due to the absence of the catalytic cysteine Cys250. UBA5-K310E maintained its interaction with UFM1, although with less stability, which may affect the ability of this UBA5 mutant to activate UFM1. Drosophila modeling revealed that UBA5 knockdown induced locomotive defects and a shortened lifespan accompanied by aberrant neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Strikingly, we found that UFM1 and E2 cofactor knockdown induced markedly similar phenotypes. Wild-type UBA5, but not mutant UBA5, significantly restored neural lesions caused by the absence of UBA5. The finding of a <italic>UBA5</italic> mutation in cerebellar ataxia suggests that impairment of the UFM1 pathway may contribute to the neurological phenotypes of ARCA.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs) are a large group of neurodegenerative disorders that manifest mainly in children and young adults. Most ARCAs are heterogeneous with respect to the age at onset, severity of the disease progression, and frequency of extracerebellar and systemic signs. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Five main pathogenic mechanisms are distinguishable: defective DNA repair, abnormal protein folding and degradation, channelopathies, and mitochondrial and metabolic defects. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Although a growing list of rare molecular defects associated with ARCAs have been identified, as yet many affected families and individuals have an unknown etiology. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p>
      <p>We applied whole-exome sequencing to DNA from two siblings with progressive cerebellar ataxia who had non-consanguineous parents. Consequently, compound heterozygous variants were found in <italic>UBA5</italic>. UBA5, also known as ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 5, is an ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) of the ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) pathway. UFM1 is an ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) that, upon activation by a dedicated E1 (UBA5), forms a thioester bond with an E2 cofactor (UFC1), resulting in the tagging of reactive ubiquityl units to substrates by an E3 ligase (UFL1).[<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In ischemic myocardial cells and pancreatic islet beta cells, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can specifically induce the expression of UFM1 cascade members, thus suggesting the protection of the UFM1 cascade during cellular homeostasis.[<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In UBA5, the catalytic cysteine (Cys250) is part of the adenylation domain within the helical motif through which the ubiquityl-enzyme thioester is formed.[<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Our cellular studies revealed that both of the two mutants (p.R246X and p.K310E) became less stable which caused reduced enzymatic activity of UBA5. A role for UBA5 in human neurological disease has yet to be identified. Here we studied a cohort of patients with ARCA and identified <italic>UBA5</italic> mutations in these patients.</p>
      <p><italic>Drosophila</italic> is a powerful model organism with which to study neural development and neuronal maintenance. A <italic>Drosophila</italic> model containing a loss-of-function of the UBA5 homologue confirmed the role of this in disease pathogenesis. In particular, we found that UBA5 knockdown resulted in remarkably reduced locomotor activity, a shortened lifespan, and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) defects. Furthermore, similar phenotypes were observed with UFM1 and UFC1 knockdown, although UFM1 knockdown resulted in a more severe phenotype. <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs provide a simpler and genetically more amenable system with which to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying synapse development and maturation.[<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human wild type UBA5, but not UBA5 mutations, significantly rescue the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) defects. Our data therefore establish a novel ARCA syndrome by a mutation in <italic>UBA5</italic> and thus shed light on the biological function of the corresponding protein.</p>

        <title>Clinical description of the UBA5 family</title>
        <p>The affected family originated from the Shanxi province in China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The parents (I:1 and I:2) were non-consanguineous. The father of the affected siblings (II:2 and II:3) reported no gait difficulties at the age of 80, and the mother presented with an essential tremor of the head but no gait difficulties. Neurologic examinations of the parents (I:1 and I:2) yielded normal findings. The two affected siblings, one female and one male, reported gait instability since childhood. Both siblings exhibited markedly delayed growth during childhood but had achieved a normal body size in adulthood. Both developed cataracts while young and had undergone cataract-removal surgeries in 2010. Neither sibling exhibited signs of cognitive involvement. The disease progressed insidiously in the proband (II:2), who presented with marked cerebellar atrophy as determined by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), leading to a loss of the ability to walk and caregiver dependency at 39 years of age. The disease course was apparently stable in the younger brother (II:3), who was 36 years old, worked full-time, and displayed a mildly spastic gait that did not interfere with his daily activities, and also exhibited mild cerebellar atrophy on MRI. Neurophysiologic studies indicated no other central or peripheral system impairments in the proband. The brother (II:3) exhibited partial peripheral nerve impairment with a demyelinating sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy.

        <p>The non-consanguineous pedigree of the index family includes two siblings (patient II:2 and II:3) with ataxia. DNA from both affected individuals was subjected to whole-exome sequencing. Variants were prioritized according to the presence of compound heterozygosity and homozygosity, based on recessive inheritance. Only two variants in the <italic>UBA5</italic> (NM_198329.2) cosegregated completely in the conserved domain of the UBA5 protein: c.568C &gt; T; p. R246X and c.760A &gt; G; p.

        <title>Characterization of UBA5 and its mutant protein</title>
        <p>Immunofluorescence was used to visualize exogenously expressed WT and mutant UBA5 in HEK293A cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, wild-type and K310E UBA5 were localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the truncated R246X protein was mainly localized in the nucleus. We also found that endogenous UBA5 co-localized with GM130 (Golgi marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We next aimed to investigate the degradation of UBA5. After overexpressing UBA5 in HEK293A cells, MG132 or bafilomycin A1 (BafAl) was added to the cells, followed by a 12-h incubation. The results demonstrated a marked increase in UBA5 protein levels after the addition of BafA1 (autophagy inhibitor), but not MG132 (proteasome inhibitor), indicating that UBA5 was degraded through autophagy. K310E protein was degraded in the same manner as wild-type UBA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). However, levels of the truncated R246X protein increased significantly in the presence of MG132 but not BafA1, suggesting that the R246X protein was degraded through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). To examine whether <italic>UBA5</italic> mutations impaired the stability of the protein product, a CHX-chase analysis was performed. The results indicated that wild-type UBA5 protein was quite stable with a half-life of more than 36 h, whereas K310E was less stable and R246X protein had a half-life of less than 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Activity of UBA5 mutants with regard to UFM1</title>
        <p>UBA5 is among the least characterized of all human E1 enzymes. In a previous report, UBA5 was shown to activate UFM1 and SUMO2. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, we and others demonstrated a lack of interaction between UBA5 and SUMO2 (data not shown). Next, we focused on UFM1. A co-immunoprecipitation study demonstrated that R246X protein failed to interact with endogenous UFM1, indicating that this mutation impaired the ability of UBA5 to activate UFM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). K310E remained able to interact with UFM1, similar to wild-type UBA5; thus, the pathogenesis associated with this mutation will require further investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Impairment of the UFM1 pathway causes an abnormal <italic>Drosophila</italic> phenotype</title>
        <p><italic>Drosophila</italic> UBA5 (dUBA5, CG1749) is highly homologous to human UBA5 and shares 67% identity with human UBA5 at the amino acid level. Similarly, the respective UFM1 and E2 homologues, ubiquitin-like protein and UFC1, share 88% and 79% identity, respectively. Therefore, we used a fly model to determine whether the identified mutations in our patients would impair the function of the UFM1 pathway in the nervous system. As a loss-of-function of UBA5 is associated with ARCA, <italic>FRT UBA5</italic>, and <italic>hs-flp</italic> were crossed to generate <italic>UBA5</italic> null mutant fly lines. Unfortunately, <italic>UBA5</italic> null mutant flies of both sexes died during embryonic development. <italic>UBA5 RNAi</italic> flies were found to exhibit an 80% reduction in <italic>dUBA5</italic> mRNA expression. Here, dUBA5 knockdown was applied to model UBA5-associated ARCA and explore the in vivo functions of the UFM1 system. The resulting flies were analyzed at 3 days of age.</p>
        <p>UBA5 knockdown flies (both male and female) exhibited abnormal vertical-turned wings that failed to fold under resting conditions at 25Â°C. The wing postures indicated unilateral or bilateral wing abnormalities, and the percentages of abnormal wing phenotypes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>. Similar phenotypes were observed in <italic>dUFM1 RNAi</italic> and <italic>dUFC1 RNAi</italic> lines, whereas UFL1 knockdown was found to be lethal. In contrast, the control flies always held their wings parallel to the body axis. The penetrance of this phenotype increased when flies were raised at 29Â°C; specifically, 56.9% of the <italic>dUBA5 RNAi</italic> lines were found to exhibit wing defects. The climbing and flight abilities and lifespans of <italic>dUFM1 RNAi</italic>, <italic>dUBA5 RNAi</italic>, and <italic>dUFC1 RNAi</italic> lines were greatly reduced, compared with control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). In an evaluation of the climbing abilities of these flies after removing the wings to exclude wing involvement in climbing movements, a similar tendency was observed (data not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>ARCAs are genetically heterogeneous. At present, a large proportion of ARCA cases remain unexplained by mutations in known genes. Here we uncovered the genetic basis for a new subtype of ARCA. This report demonstrates that ataxia can be caused by mutations in <italic>UBA5</italic> (NM_198329.2). Both affected individuals carried a mixture of two mutant alleles (c. 568 C &gt; T; p. R246X and c. 760A &gt; G; p. K310E), whereas their parents were heterozygous mutation carriers [the mother (I:2) carried c. 568 C &gt; T (p. R246X) and the father (I:1) carried c.760A &gt; G (p. K310E)]. Both variants were located in the conserved region and cosegregated completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Cases with copy number variations in the <italic>UBA5</italic> and <italic>UFM1</italic> region have been documented in the ClinVar database. A 0.4-Mb heterozygous loss in 3q22.1, which includes <italic>UBA5</italic> and <italic>NPHP3</italic>, was previously detected in a patient with global developmental delays, impaired hearing, muscular hyptonia, and seizures. Because <italic>NPHP3</italic> functions in the renal tubular development process, the loss of UBA5 may have resulted in these phenotypes. A 1-Mb duplication in 13q13.3, including <italic>UFM1</italic>, was also identified in a case with global developmental delays, gait disturbance, and other abnormalities. Our molecular characterization of UBA5-R246X revealed a loss in UFM1 activation in the absence of the catalytic cysteine Cys250 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The activity of UBA5-K310E was not clear; the interaction between this mutant protein and UFM1 was maintained but less stable, which may affect its ability to activate UFM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149039.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>UBA5 is a member of the ubiquitin-activating protein family and the only known E1 enzyme in the UFM1 cascade. In humans, <italic>UBA5</italic> is transcribed as two distinct isoforms (1â404 and 57â404).The role of the additional N-terminal residues encoded by the longer splice transcript is not clear; however, these residues are not strongly conserved and are not required for ubiquitin-like modifier (UBL) activation. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] UBA5 knockout mice were found to die in utero because of severe anemia associated with the defective differentiation of both megakaryocytes and erythrocytes. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, there are no previous reports of a relationship between UBA5 and neurological disorders. The form of ARCA described herein is the new phenotype to be associated with impairment in the ubiquitin-like system. Emerging evidence of mutations in the ubiqutin system have been found in cerebellar ataxia patients, as was described in our report as well as others. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p>
      <p>UFM1 belongs to the UBL family, the members of which are present in nearly all eukaryotic organisms, with the exception of fungi. As described in detail previously, the UFM1 cascade, which includes the ligase UFL1, UFM1-specific protease UfSP2, and known target proteins (Ufbp1 and Cdk5rap3), has been implicated in ER functioning and cell cycle control. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] A loss-of-function of the UFM1 cascade in mice leads to apoptosis in fetal liver cells and pancreatic beta cells. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In particular, the ligase UFL1 was shown to be involved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a polyglutamine disease. Furthermore, UFL1 deficiency contributes to SCA1 pathology through a functional deficiency in Bergmann glia, which regulate cell proliferation through the regulation of CDK5RAP3. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p>
      <p><italic>Drosophila</italic> was selected as a model with which to study the involvement of <italic>UBA5</italic> in the disease phenotype. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJ is a well-established synaptic model system that shares major features with central excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain and has been successfully used to investigate human neural disorders, as described in detail previously. [<xref rid="pone.0149039.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Our <italic>UBA5</italic> knockdown <italic>Drosophila</italic> models exhibited abnormal wing phenotypes, a shortened life span and climbing disabilities. Neuron-specific <italic>UBA5</italic> knockdown resulted in reduced NMJ growth and a consistent decrease in synaptic size, which presented as a reduced number of type Ib boutons and increased bouton size in the larval muscles, suggesting that the UFM1 cascade might play a role in the development of NMJs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our data thus shed light on a role for the UFM1 cascade in neurological diseases.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we identified mutations in <italic>UBA5</italic>, an E1 enzyme, in patients with ARCA. A <italic>Drosophila</italic> model provided lines of evidence suggesting that a UFM1 pathway impairment might contribute to the neurological phenotypes of ARCA. Rescue experiments involving wild-type and mutated human <italic>UBA5</italic> definitively demonstrated the deleterious nature of these mutations and shed light on the underlying molecular pathogenesis of this disease. An analysis of the UFM1 pathway should be performed in patients presenting with both sporadic and familial ARCA.</p>
