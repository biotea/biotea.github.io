      <abstract>
        <p>Angiogenesisâthe growth of new blood vessels from preexisting vesselsâis an important physiological process and is considered to play a key role in tumor growth and metastasis. We identified the immunoglobulin-containing and proline-rich receptor-1 (IGPR-1, also called TMIGD2) gene as a novel cell adhesion receptor that is expressed in various human organs and tissues, mainly in cells with epithelium and endothelium origins. IGPR-1 regulates cellular morphology, homophilic cell aggregation, and cellâcell interaction. IGPR-1 activity also modulates actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion and reduces cell migration. Silencing of expression of IGPR-1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and by ectopic overexpression in endothelial cells showed that IGPR-1 regulates capillary tube formation in vitro, and B16F melanoma cells engineered to express IGPR-1 displayed extensive angiogenesis in the mouse Matrigel angiogenesis model. Moreover, IGPR-1, through its proline-rich cytoplasmic domain, associates with multiple Src homology 3 (SH3)âcontaining signaling proteins, including SH3 protein interacting with Nck (SPIN90/WISH), bullous pemphigoid antigen-1, and calcium channel Î²2. Silencing of expression of SPIN90/WISH by siRNA in endothelial cells showed that SPIN90/WISH is required for capillary tube formation. These features of IGPR-1 suggest that IGPR-1 is a novel receptor that plays an important role in cellâcell interaction, cell migration, and angiogenesis.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Angiogenesis is a coordinated cascade of numerous complex cellular processes, which include endothelial cell migration, proliferation, sprouting, and lumen formation, which ultimately leads to the formation of new vessels. These coordinated cellular events are regulated by the function of various cell surface receptors and soluble ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Rahimi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011a</xref>). The ability of endothelial cells to form capillary tubes is prerequisite for the establishment of a continuous vessel lumen that routes the blood flow. Several key receptor tyrosine kinases such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-2, and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including cadherins, integrins, selectins, and immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily proteins, all are involved in angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bach <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Barreiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bazzoni, 2003</xref>). The roles of proangiogenic molecules, such as VEGF and VEGFRs (i.e., VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3), are well known in regulation of differentiation, survival, proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Gory-Faure <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Rahimi, 2006</xref>). Studies using knockouts or blocking antibodies also demonstrated a key role for integrins in angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), an endothelium-specific member of the cadherin family of adhesion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bach <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>), and other CAM proteins, such as PECAM-1, ICAM-1, and JAM-A, are also linked to angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bach <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Barclay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bazzoni, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The Ig-containing adhesion molecules are known for their vital role in embryonic development and pathological conditions such as cancer and inflammation by modulating cellâcell adhesion and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Takai <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">DeLisser <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The Ig domains engage in proteinâprotein interactions, such as the homophilic (i.e., trans-dimerization) interaction of cell adhesion receptors, and proteinâligand interactions, such growth factor receptors and soluble growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Barclay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Rahimi, 2006</xref>). The Ig-containing cell adhesion molecules, through homophilic and/or heterophilic interactions, selectively contribute to the specificity of cellâcell recognition and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Barclay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Rahimi, 2006</xref>). At the intracellular compartment, they interact with various cytoplasmic signaling proteins, which are often linked to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Takai <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this study we identified a previously uncharacterized receptorâimmunoglobulin-containing and proline-rich receptor-1 (IGPR-1)âas a novel adhesion molecule with a broad expression in epithelial and endothelial cells. IGPR-1 regulates cellular morphology, cellâcell interaction, and cell migration. More importantly, IGPR-1 associates with several SH3-containing proteins and regulates angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro.</p>

        <title>Identification of IGPR-1 as a novel cell surface receptor</title>
        <p>Searching the human genome sequence database for Ig-containing proteins, we identified an uncharacterized proteinâtransmembrane and immunoglobulin domainâcontaining protein 2 (TMIGD2)âthat has a single Ig domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a stretch of 110âamino acid cytoplasmic region highly rich in proline residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The extracellular region of this protein also contains two possible glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Because of the presence of an immunoglobulin domain in its extracellular region and a proline-rich motif in its cytoplasmic region, we named this protein immunoglobulin and proline-rich receptor-1, or IGPR-1, and refer to it as such throughout this article. The orthologue of human IGPR-1 is found only in eukaryotes, including primates, the guinea pig, canines, felines, dolphins, bovines, the llama, bats, the common shrew, and horses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of interest, the IGPR-1 gene is absent in mouse and rat genomes. The immunoglobulin domain of IGPR-1 was predicted to be Ig V (variable) fold and was found to be highly similar to the Ig domain of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Breithaupt <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Using the Ig domain of MAG as a template, we constructed a structural model of IGPR-1. IGPR-1 seems to adapt a typical Ig V-like fold consisting of a sandwich of two antiparallel Î²-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>To examine its cellular and biochemical properties, IGPR-1 was cloned into a retroviral expression vector and expressed in porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells. Moreover, to detect expression of IGPR-1, we developed a polyclonal antiâIGPR-1 antibody against its cytoplasmic domain, which specifically recognizes IGPR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The predicted molecular weight of IGPR-1 protein is 31 kDa; however, the apparent molecular weight of IGPR-1 ectopically expressed in PAE cells as detected by Western blot analysis was â¼55 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). We reasoned that the higher molecular weight of IGPR-1 could be associated with its potential glycosylation at its extracellular region. Treatment of cell lysates derived from PAE cells with N-glycosidase F (PNGase), which is known to hydrolyze nearly all types of N-glycan chains from glycoproteins, generated a 31-kDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that IGPR-1 is highly glycosylated in vivo and that glycosylation is responsible for its apparent high molecular weight. Of interest, treatment of cells with tunicamycin, a commonly used inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation in vivo, which is known to cause ER stress, also caused a rapid degradation of IGPR-1, suggesting that perhaps glycosylation of IGPR-1 is important for its stability and agents that induce ER stress promote degradation of IGPR-1 (unpublished data). Because IGPR-1 is predicted to be a plasma membrane protein, we also analyzed its membrane localization in PAE cells. The immunofluorescence microscopy assessment of cells expressing IGPR-1 showed that IGPR-1 is localized in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Additional analysis, including cell surface biotinylation, further demonstrated cell surface localization of IGPR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, the data establish IGPR-1 as a novel immunoglobulin containing membranous glycoprotein.</p>

        <title>IGPR-1 is expressed in various human organs and cells</title>
        <p>To gain insight into the tissue distribution of IGPR-1, we initially examined its expression in normal human tissues by analyzing the transcript of IGPR-1 by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The qPCR analysis using primers designed for exons 2 and 3 of IGPR-1 showed that IGPR-1 transcript was highly present in artery, vein, and brain. IGPR-1 transcript was also moderately detected in bone marrow, liver, and lung. IGPR-1 transcript, however, was relatively low in kidney, ovary, pancreas, and skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additional analysis using qPCR primers designed for exons 3 and 4 yielded similar results (unpublished data), confirming that IGPR-1 transcript is broadly present in these tissues. To examine the expression of IGPR-1 in human tissues at the protein level, we analyzed cell lysates derived from various human organs/tissues for expression of IGPR-1. IGPR-1 protein was detected in thymus, placenta, heart, small intestine, skin, and kidney with an apparent molecular weight of 55 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Of interest, cell lysates derived from skeletal muscle, brain, colon, lung, and ovary IGPR-1 were detected with an apparent molecular weight of 35 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that perhaps IGPR-1 in these cell lysates is not fully glycosylated, although one could not discount possible proteolytic degradation due to sample preparation and handling.</p>

        <p>To further determine the cellular distribution of IGPR-1, we used a normal human tissue microarray consisting of major human organs/tissues and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using antiâIGPR-1 antibody. Immunohistochemical staining showed that IGPR-1 is mainly expressed by cells of epithelial origin, including bronchial epithelial cells of lung, breast glandular and lobular epithelia cells, urothelium of the bladder, skin epidermis, epithelium of gastrointestinal, and rectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, endometrial glands of the uterus, the ureter, fallopian tube epithelium, colonic epithelium, small bowl epithelium, stomach epithelium, including both chief and parietal cells, trophoblastic epithelium of placenta, and pancreatic acinar cells were all positive for IGPR-1 (unpublished data). Of note, thyroid, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and thymus were negative for IGPR-1 (unpublished data). Beyond epithelial cells that were positive for IGPR-1 across the tissue microarray staining, endothelial cells present in vein and arteries also consistently were positive for IGPR-1, as shown in tissue sections derived from ureter, esophagus, skin, skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal, and cervix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). As noted, IGPR-1 transcript was also highest in vein and artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Taken together, the data demonstrate that IGPR1 is expressed in various organs; however; its expression is mainly in epithelial and endothelial cell types.</p>

        <title>IGPR-1 activity regulates angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro</title>
        <p>Adhesion molecules are known to regulate capillary tube formation of endothelial cells and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Gory-Faure <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">DeLisser <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). IGPR-1 is expressed by endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting a possible role for IGPR-1 in angiogenesis. To examine the role of IGPR-1 in angiogenesis, we subjected PAE cells overexpressing IGPR-1 to an in vitro Matrigel-based angiogenesis assay. Our analysis showed that PAE cells that are engineered to express IGPR-1 undergo increased capillary tube formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Quantification of capillary tube formation of PAE cells and expression of IGPR-1 in PAE cells also are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">D</xref>).</p>

        <p>To examine the role of IGPR-1 in angiogenesis, in particular the role of endogenous IGPR-1 in capillary tube formation of endothelial cells, we silenced expression of IGPR-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Our analysis showed that IGPR-1 siRNA significantly reduced expression of IGPR-1 in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Knockdown of IGPR-1 by siRNA also resulted in a significant reduction in the capillary tube formation of HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). To address in vivo potential of IGPR-1 in angiogenesis, we engineered B16F melanoma cells to express IGPR-1 and subjected to in vivo Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay. Expression of IGPR-1 in B16F cells significantly increased the potential of B16F cells to stimulate angiogenesis, as blood vessels surrounding tumor mass are visibly notable in B16F cells expressing IGPR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). Angiogenesis associated with tumor cells was further quantified by measuring the hemoglobin amount in the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>). Expression of IGPR-1 in B16F cells is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref>). Taken together, the data demonstrate that expression of IGPR-1 in endothelial cells regulates angiogenesis.</p>

        <title>IGPR-1 regulates cellular morphology and focal adhesion</title>
        <p>We noted that PAE cells ectopically expressing IGPR-1 display a distinct morphological change. PAE cells expressing IGPR-1 displayed rectangular shape morphology and appeared to be in tight contact, whereas the typical morphology of PAE cells is more elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To demonstrate morphological changes associated with IGPR-1 in PAE cells, we stained these cells for actin filament formation using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)âlabeled phalloidin. Expression of IGPR-1 in PAE cells significantly increased actin filament formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that IGPR-1 activity induces morphological changes in PAE cells. In general, the adhesive properties of a given cell type determine trypsinization time in cell culture. PAE cells expressing IGPR-1 were also resistant to trypsinization. Within 2â5 min of treatment with tissue culture trypsin/EDTA medium, PAE cells become fully dislodged from the cell culture plate, as they all showed a rounded morphology. However, most PAE cells expressing IGPR-1 after 5 min of treatment with trypsin/EDTA medium were still attached to the plate and mostly retained their adherent morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). After 8â10 min, eventually all were detached from the plate. The observation suggests that IGPR-1 is involved in regulation of cell morphology and adhesion.</p>

        <p>Because overexpression of IGPR-1 increases the adhesive phenotype of PAE cells, we examined the possible role of IGPR-1 in cellâcell interaction. To this end, we generated PAE cell lines expressing IGPR-1 and ÎN-IGPR-1 (where the extracellular domain of IGPR-1 was deleted) and subjected them to an aggregation assay. Expression of IGPR-1 and ÎN-IGPR-1 in PAE cells is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>.

To examine role of IGPR-1 in cell adhesion and the role of its Ig-containing extracellular domain in this process, we generated a recombinant glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)âIg containing the extracellular domain of IGPR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). PAE cells expressing IGPR-1 and PAE cells expressing empty vector were preincubated with GST protein and both adhered to the plate in a similar manner. However, incubation of PAE cells expressing IGPR-1 with the soluble extracellular domain of IGPR-1 totally inhibited adhesion/spreading of these cells to the plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>). As noted, preincubated cells with soluble IGPR-1 only loosely adhered, with no spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>), and they come off the tissue plate (unpublished data). Quantification of adherent cells also is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>).

        <title>IGPR-1 activity regulates focal adhesion and cell migration</title>
        <p>To further investigate biological responses associated with IGPR-1 activity in PAE cells, we analyzed focal adhesion formation in PAE cells. Immunofluorescence staining of PAE cells with vinculin demonstrated that expression of IGPR-1 in PAE cells markedly increases focal adhesion as measured by vinculin localization with respect to focal contact in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Of note, IGPR-1 expression in PAE cells increased both number and size of focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Of interest, adhesions in PAE cells expressing IGPR-1 were higher at the cell periphery, and consistent with their observed morphology, they were aligned along each other with a tight contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Quantitative analysis based on the number of focal adhesions showed that IGPR-1 expression in PAE cells resulted in an increased number of focal adhesions by 62% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). Staining of cells for actin with FITC-labeled phalloidin also demonstrated that expression of IGPR-1 in PAE cells alters actin stress fibers and cytoskeleton remodeling. PAE cells expressing empty vector form stress fibers primarily at the periphery of cells, with membrane ruffling, which is reflective of actin filament assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). PAE cells expressing IGPR-1, however, displayed a distinct actin stress fiber formation mainly in central regions of the cells, with a significantly reduced level of membrane ruffles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).

The blotting of the SH3 array membrane with purified recombinant GSTâproline-rich motif of IGPR-1 identified four distinct SH3 domains, including SH3 protein interacting with Nck (SPIN90/WISH; 90 kDa), calcium channel Î²2 (CACNB2), bullous pemphigoid antigen-1 (BPAG1), and melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

The Î² subunit is a member of membrane-associated guanylate kinaseâlike proteins with a guanylate kinase domain and an SH3 domain. BPAG1 is a member of plakin family proteins, comprising cytoskeleton-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Fuchs and Yang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Fuchs and Karakesisoglou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Fuchs <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).

MIA is a small, secreted protein that interacts with extracellular matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bosserhoff <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). To further validate the array data, we created a GST recombinant SH3 domain of SPIN90, BPAG1, and CANCB2 and tested their binding to IGPR-1 in a GST pull-down assay. The MIA binding to IGPR-1 was not considered for further analysis due the fact that it is a secreted protein. The data showed that IGPR-1 strongly binds to SH3 domains of SPIN90, BPAG1, and CANB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). The binding of SPIN90 and BPAG1 was stronger than that of CANCB2, suggesting that perhaps these SH3-containing proteins interact with IGPR-1 more readily than with CANCB2. We further validated the in vivo binding of SPIN90 with IGPR-1 by coimmunoprecipitation in PAE cells expressing IGPR-1. Cell lysates derived from PAE cells expressing IGPR-1 immunoprecipitated with antiâIGPR-1 selectively coprecipitated with endogenous SPIN90, as detected with anti-SPIN90 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>

        <title>SPIN90 activity is required for angiogenesis</title>
        <p>Identification of SPIN90 as an IGPR-1âinteracting protein suggests that SPIN90 might play a role in IGPR-1âmediated angiogenesis. To further determine the biological importance of SPIN90 in angiogenesis, we initially overexpressed SPIN90 in PAE cells and examined its potential to stimulate capillary tube formation of PAE cells. Expression of SPIN90 in PAE cells increased capillary tube formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), indicating that SPIN90 activity is linked to angiogenic events in endothelial cells. Quantification of capillary tube formation and expression of IGPR-1 and SPIN90 in PAE were also found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">C</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this study we identified IGPR-1 as a novel cell surface protein expressed in various human organs and tissues, predominantly in cells of epithelial and endothelial origins. On the basis of the observed characteristics of IGPR-1, such as promoting cellular aggregation, cellâcell interaction, morphological change of cells, and increase in focal adhesion, we propose IGPR-1 as a novel CAM. Various classes of CAMs have been described, including, cadherins, mucins, integrins, selectins, and the Ig superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Takai <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). CAMs mediate homophilic (like-binds-like) adhesion between cells of a single type and heterophilic adhesion between cells of different types, and the cytoplasmic regions of these proteins are usually connected to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Takai <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Consistent with its observed effect on cell adhesion, transfer of IGPR-1 into PAE cells significantly increases the expression of vinculin. Vinculin is a major constitutive component of focal adhesion and adherens junctions, where it binds to several cytoskeletal proteins, linking microfilaments to CAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Pawlak and Helfman, 2001</xref>). Consistent with CAM-mediated phenotypic characteristics such as focal adhesion and cellular morphology, introducing IGPR-1 to PAE cells resulted in the acquisition of cubical morphology and elevated focal adhesion. These cells also were resistant to trypsin/EDTA-mediated detachment from cell culture plates and acquired increased cell adhesion properties. The function of IGPR-1 is highly correlated with those of other well-known CAMs. Cadherins are known to stabilize cellâcell contacts to form adherent junctions in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Matsumura <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bach <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Gory-Faure <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>In agreement with a possible role of IGPR-1 in cell adhesion and cellâcell interaction, expression of IGPR-1 in PAE cells and B16F cells inhibits cell migration. Of interest, the reduced migration of these cells by IGPR-1 also correlates with the inhibition of phosphorylation of paxillin at tyrosine 118 (Y118). Phosphorylation of Y118 of paxillin is linked to inhibition of cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Abou Zeid <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Zaidel-Bar <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), suggesting that IGPR-1 inhibits cellular migration, in part by stimulating dephosphorylation of paxillin either by increasing protein phosphatase activity or preventing its phosphorylation by inhibiting tyrosine kinases such as Src family kinases and focal adhesion kinases, which are involved in the phosphorylation of paxillin. The cytoplasmic domain of IGPR-1 contains a proline-rich motif that recognizes SH3-containing signaling proteins. The data presented in this article demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of IGPR-1 interacts with several SH3-containing signaling proteins, including SPIN90. SPIN90 activity is known to regulate cell adhesion through actin cytoskeleton reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Lim <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Takenawa and Miki, 2001</xref>), suggesting that the proline-rich cytoplasmic domain of IGPR-1, through recruitment of SPIN90, modulates cell adhesion and cellular morphology. Our observation indicates that SPIN90 regulates capillary tube formation of endothelial cells, demonstrating a significant role for SPIN90 in IGPR-1âmediated biological responses, particularly in angiogenesis.</p>
      <p>In general, CAMs interact with distinct signaling proteins whose activities are linked to the cytoskeleton. For example, cadherins are known to interact with Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Harris and Tepass, 2010</xref>), nectins interact with the filamentous (F)-actinâbinding protein afadin and PAR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Takai <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), ICAM-1 associates with Î±-actinin and ERM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Barreiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and JAMs (junctional adhesion molecules) bind to ZO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bazzoni, 2003</xref>). Unlike the known CAMs, IGPR-1 distinctively interacts with SH3-containing proteins, including SPIN90, BPAG1, and CANCB2, which might differentiate IGPR-1 from the already known CAMs.</p>
      <p>Another interesting and important aspect of this work is that IGPR-1 is mainly expressed in cells of epithelial and endothelial cell origin. For example, epithelium and endothelium of various organs/tissues were positive for IGPR-1, suggesting that IGPR-1 as a novel adhesion molecule could play a significant role in the pathobiology of endothelial and epithelial cells. Angiogenesisâthe growth of new blood vessels from preexisting blood vesselsâis an important physiological process in the body and is required for normal wound healing and female reproductive activity. Pathological angiogenesis, either excessive or insufficient, is now recognized as a common denominator underlying a number of deadly and debilitating human diseases such as cancer, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011b</xref>). Acquisition of angiogenesis by tumor cells is considered the most critical step in tumor growth and metastasis. To grow beyond 2 mm in diameter, a tumor needs to undergo angiogenesis, which is often established by hypoxia-induced expression of VEGF and other hypoxia-induced growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011b</xref>). The present study suggests an important role for IGPR-1 in angiogenesis. Modulation of expression of IGPR-1 by ectopic expression or silencing in endothelial cells significantly altered the angiogenic phenotype of endothelial cells in culture, and introducing IGPR-1 to tumor cells increased tumor angiogenesis.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we identified IGPR-1 as a novel adhesion molecule involved in cellâcell interaction and regulation of cell migration. IGPR-1 associates with several SH3-containing signaling proteins, including SPIN90, and regulates angiogenesis, suggesting a significant role for IGPR-1 in angiogenesis-associated diseases such as cancer. Further studies should illuminate the mechanisms by which IGPR-1 regulates cellâcell interaction and its biological importance in human diseases, in particular in angiogenesis-associated diseases such as cancer.</p>

        <p>Endothelial cells were seeded on Matrigel with endothelial cell growth medium (Clonetics, San Diego, CA), and capillary tube formation was viewed under microscope and photographed after 24 h as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Meyer <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Quantification of capillary tube formation was established by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Migration assay was performed basically by creating a âwoundâ in a cell monolayer by scratch using the tip of the tissue culture pipette. After 10 h, images were captured under microscope and documented.</p>

        <title>Site-directed mutagenesis</title>
        <p>All the site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Meyer <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The identities of deletions were confirmed by sequencing the plasmids. All the cDNAs were either cloned into pcDNA3.1His.Myc vector or into the retroviral vector pMSCV.puro (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). In some cases the PCR products were cloned into pGEX2T vector (Pharmacia, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and used to make GST-fusion protein in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.</p>

        <title>Virus production and transient transfection</title>
        <p>For virus production pMSCV.puro vector containing IGPR-1 or other cDNA of interest was transfected into 293-GPG cells, and viral supernatants were collected for 5 d as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Rahimi <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>).</p>

        <title>Immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and cell surface biotinylation</title>
        <p>Cells were prepared, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation, or whole-cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Meyer <italic>et al</italic>., 2011b</xref>). Normalized whole-cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using IGPR-1 antibody or with appropriate antibody as indicated in the figure legends. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as follows. Equal numbers of PAE cells expressing IGPR-1 were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Surface proteins were biotinylated by incubating cells with 0.5 mg/ml of the membrane-impermeable biotin analogue EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4Â°C. Unreacted biotin was quenched and removed by three washes with ice-cold H/S buffer (25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>) at 4Â°C. Biotinylated cells were lysed, equal amounts of protein from each lysate were immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal antiâIGPR-1 antibody, and immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and detected by an ECL System (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ).</p>

        <title>Immunohistochemical analysis/immunofluorescence microscopy</title>
        <p>Normal human tissue microarray (MC0961) was purchased from US BioMax (Rockville, MD). Immunohistochemical staining was performed using rabbit antiâIGPR-1 antibody. After standard formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE), all FFPE slides were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval through the BioCare Medical Decloaking chamber, with citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Antibody detection was preformed with the antiâRabbit-HRP Envision+ Kit (Dako) with extra blocking with serum-free protein block (Dako) for 1 h. For immunofluorescence microscopy PAE cells expressing IPR-1 were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and, after washing with PBS (3Ã), permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 1 min. Cells were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin for 45 min with rocking and then incubated with antiâIPR-1 antibody. After extensive washing and incubation with secondary antibody they were mounted with anti-fade/4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vectastain; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).</p>
