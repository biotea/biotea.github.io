      <abstract>
        <p>We previously reported that the expression of <italic>KIAA1199</italic> in human colorectal tumors (benign and malignant) is markedly higher than that in the normal colonic mucosa. In this study, we investigated the functions of the protein encoded by this gene, which are thus far unknown. Immunostaining studies were used to reveal its subcellular localization, and proteomic and gene expression experiments were conducted to identify proteins that might interact with KIAA1199 and molecular pathways in which it might play roles. Using colon cancer cell lines, we showed that both endogenous and ectopically expressed KIAA1199 is secreted into the extracellular environment. In the cells, it was found mainly in the perinuclear space (probably the ER) and cell membrane. Both cellular compartments were also over-represented in lists of proteins identified by mass spectrometry as putative KIAA1199 interactors and/or proteins encoded by genes whose transcription was significantly changed by KIAA1199 expression. These proteomic and transcriptomic datasets concordantly link KIAA1199 to several genes/proteins and molecular pathways, including ER processes like protein binding, transport, and folding; and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, G-protein, ephrin, and Wnt signaling. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed KIAA1199âs interaction with the cell-membrane receptor <italic>e</italic>phrin A2 and with the ER receptor ITPR3, a key player in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. By modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, KIAA1199 could affect different branches of the Wnt network. Our findings suggest it may negatively regulate the Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling, and its expression is associated with decreased cell proliferation and invasiveness.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The function of the protein encoded by <italic>KIAA1199</italic> is currently unknown, but our previous studies have documented marked overexpression of this geneâat both the mRNA and protein levelsâin almost all colorectal tumors (benign and malignant) <xref rid="pone.0069473-SabatesBellver1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069473-diPietro1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. More recently, similar upregulation has also been reported in a large series of colorectal cancers <xref rid="pone.0069473-BirkenkampDemtroder1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and in gastric cancers <xref rid="pone.0069473-Matsuzaki1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. On the basis of our findings (gene expression data, protein expression patterns in colorectal tissues, the results of <italic>in silico</italic> analysis), we have suggested that <italic>KIAA1199</italic> might be a Wnt target gene. It appears to encode a secreted membrane/cytoplasmic protein that is structurally similar to several other eukaryotic proteins, including transmembrane protein 2, polyductin, and fibrocystin L, all of which are large receptor proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide or a single transmembrane helix and short cytoplasmic tail <xref rid="pone.0069473-SabatesBellver1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>These findings raise interesting possibilities for the development of a new molecular marker for detecting gastrointestinal neoplasms. <italic>KIAA1199</italic> mRNA has been detected in the plasma of almost 80% of individuals with colorectal adenomas or cancers <xref rid="pone.0069473-LaPointe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Unfortunately, it was also identified in 30% of tumor-free controls, so its ultimate diagnostic value remains to be seen. Attempts have also been made to explore the prognostic significance of <italic>KIAA1199</italic> mRNA or protein expression levels in colorectal <xref rid="pone.0069473-BirkenkampDemtroder1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and gastric <xref rid="pone.0069473-Matsuzaki1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> cancers and in mesotheliomas <xref rid="pone.0069473-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, but in most cases the study cohorts were too small to allow any meaningful conclusions to be drawn. In the meantime, little or no progress has been made toward identifying KIAA1199âs role(s) in normal and neoplastic cells. The present study represents a first step toward the filling of this gap.</p>

        <title>Cell Lines</title>
        <p>Human SW480 colon cancer cells from the Cancer Network Zurich cell line repository were used for most of the experiments conducted in this study. Their authenticity was verified by microsatellite analysis performed in January 2012 at Microsynth AG, Switzerland. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco), 100 IU penicillin, and 100 Âµg/ml streptomycin.</p>
        <p>Clones that constitutively express KIAA1199 were obtained by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)-mediated transfection of SW480 cells with the pcDNA3.2V5DEST vector containing <italic>KIAA1199</italic> ORF (described below). The clones were selected and maintained in medium containing G418 (0.4 mg/ml) (Gibco).</p>
        <p>Inducible KIAA1199 expression was achieved with a two-step procedure. First, SW480 cells were transfected with the pcDNA6TR vector (Invitrogen) and the tetracycline repressor-expressing cells selected with 7 Âµg/ml blasticidin S (InvivoGen). The blasticidin-resistant cells were then transfected with the pT-Rex-DEST30-KIAA1199 construct (described below) and selected with 0.4 mg/ml G418. The growth medium used for these cells was supplemented with 10% Tet-system-approved fetal calf serum (Biochrom). For induction of KIAA1199 expression, doxycycline (Clontech) was used at concentrations of 50â200 ng/ml, which have been shown to have no effects on transcript levels measured with microarrays <xref rid="pone.0069473-diPietro2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Cloning of Full-length KIAA1199</title>
        <p>Full-length <italic>KIAA1199</italic> was PCR-amplified from LS180 cell cDNA with Phusion Hot-Start High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzyme) and the following primers: forward <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-GGA TAT GGT ACC ACA CTG CCA GGA TGG GAG CTG-3â²</named-content>, reverse <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-GAT ATC TCG AGC TAC AAC TTC TTC TTC TTC ACC ACA GGG ATG-3â²</named-content>. The amplified <italic>KIAA1199</italic> open reading frame was then inserted into the pENTR11 vector (Invitrogen) with the aid of <italic>Kpn</italic>I<italic>/Xho</italic>I restriction enzymes, and an LR recombination reaction (Gateway, Invitrogen) was carried out to clone it into the constitutive expression vector pcDNA3.2V5DEST (with or without a C-terminus V5 tag) and into the Tet-on inducible vector pT-Rex-DEST30 (untagged and C-terminus GFP-tagged proteins). The C-terminus was chosen for tagging since KIAA1199 contains a signal peptide at its N-terminus.</p>

        <p>Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and placed in cold single-detergent lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 350 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, 1X Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail [Roche], and 1 mM PMSF) for 60 minutes. After 45 min of centrifugation (20,800 <italic>g</italic> at 4Â°C), the clarified lysates were aliquoted and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p>
        <p>When cells reached â¼80% confluence, complete medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS and cultured in serum-free medium for 8 hours. The medium was then collected and supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and 1X Complete EDTA-free.

        <title>Subcellular Fractionation</title>
        <p>Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and centrifuged. The pellets were resuspended (â¼10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml) in cold hypotonic buffer (200 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM PMSF and 1X Complete EDTA-free, 1 mM DTT). Cells were then transferred to a Dounce homogenizer, left to swell on ice for 5 minutes, and lysed with a B type pestle until microscopic examination revealed that most nuclei were trypan blue-positive but still intact. The nuclei were then spun down (2000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes), and the supernatant (i.e., the cytoplasmic extract) was clarified (12,000 <italic>g</italic>), aliquoted, and frozen. The nuclei were then resuspended in half the packed nuclear volume of low-salt buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 m M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 0.5 mM DTT) and stirred. Half the packed nuclear volume of high-salt buffer was then added (0.6 M KCl in low-salt buffer) drop-wise. The suspension was stirred for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> to extract nuclear proteins. The pellet was resuspended in single-detergent lysis buffer (described above), incubated for 30 minutes, and centrifuged at 20,800 <italic>g</italic>. The supernatant (referred to hereafter as the ER-nuclear membrane-chromatin fraction) was aliquoted and snap-frozen. All steps were carried out on ice in the cold room.</p>

The lysate was passed through a 25G needle 10 times, incubated on ice for 1 hour, and cleared by 45 min of centrifugation at 20,800 <italic>g</italic>. A 10-microgram extract was pre-cleared by incubation for 2 hours with Protein G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for mouse monoclonal antibodies or Protein A/G Agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The extract was then incubated with 5 Âµg of primary antibody (overnight, 4Â°C) and subsequently with Protein-G or A/G beads (1 h). The beads were then washed 3 times with IP lysis buffer and boiled with 1X SDS-bromophenol blue dye at 95Â°C. After 2 minutes of centrifugation at 2700 <italic>g</italic>, the supernatant was collected in a new tube.

        <p>Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated according to molecular mass on NuPAGE Novex 4â12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and stained with RotiÂ®-Blue Colloidal Coomassie (Carl Roth GmbH). The gel lane was cut into 35 slices, and each was destained. After in-gel digestion with trypsin (Promega), the peptide-containing supernatants were purified via C18âZipTip pipette tips (Millipore). The tryptic peptides were separated on a reverse-phase tip column (75 Âµm Ã80 mm) packed with silica-based, reverse-phase C<sub>18</sub> material (3 Âµm, 200 Ã, AQ, Bischoff GmbH) using a linear gradient of 1% to 35% acetonitrile in 60 min. The eluted peptides were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer or an LTQ-ICR-FT-Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the data-dependent acquisition mode. Mass spectrometry (MS) data were searched against the Swissprot database (release 2011) using the Mascot search algorithm (Matrix Science) and loaded into Scaffold (Proteome Software) for further analysis.

        <p>CTNNB1 (beta-catenin)-dependent transcriptional activity was studied in HEK293 cells transfected with the TOPflash or FOPflash reporter vectors (Upstate Biotechnology), which contain a multimeric consensus TCF/LEF binding site and an inactive mutated homologue of this site, respectively. Briefly, cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2Ã10<sup>4</sup> cells/well), cultured for 16 hours, and transfected in triplicate (via Lipofectamine LTX, Invitrogen) with a mixture of 75 ng reporter vector, 20 ng pCMVbeta-Gal co-reporter, and 50 ng pcDNA3-CTNNB1 (wild-type or constitutively active CTNNB1<sup>T41A</sup> kindly provided by M.A. Buendia of the Institut Pasteur in Paris), plus 120 ng of either mock, KIAA1199, or TCF4-DN plasmid (this latter from Hans Clevers, Hubrecht Institute, Utrecht, NL). Medium was replaced 8 hours post-transfection, and luciferase activity was assayed 48 h later with the Promega Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Results for each sample were normalized to beta-galactosidase activity (High-sensitivity beta-galactosidase assay kit, Stratagene). For each construct combination, the TCF/LEF-specific transactivation was quantified by dividing the TOPflash luciferase activation by the average FOPflash activity.

      <p>Restoration of KIAA1199 expression was investigated in SW480 cells, where KIAA1199 expression is minimal-absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We established SW480 clones that expressed tagged (C-terminal V5 or GFP) or untagged forms of KIAA1199, constitutively (KIAA1199-V5 and KIAA1199-Cl.18) or upon doxycycline induction (KIAA1199-Cl.13 and KIAA1199-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The subcellular KIAA1199 distribution patterns in all these clones were virtually identical to that of endogenous KIAA1199 in LS174T cells (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g001">Figures 1D and 1E</xref>), and all secreted the exogenously expressed protein <bold>(</bold>tagged and untagged forms) into the conditioned media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
      <p>The KIAA1199-V5 and KIAA1199-Cl.18 clones, which displayed relatively high constitutive expression of KIAA1199 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), were used in IP/MS experiments designed to identify proteins that might interact with KIAA1199. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g002">Figure 2A to 2C</xref> show the cells and antibodies used in each of the 3 independent IP experiments and an example of the silver staining band pattern of the KIAA1199 immunoprecipitate. Eighty-nine proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s006">Table S1</xref>) were identified as putative KIAA1199 interactors on the basis of MS analysis of co-immunoprecipitates. All met the following criteria in at least 2 of the 3 experiments: 1) their peptides were present in the KIAA1199 immunoprecipitates and absent in control immunoprecipitates described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; or 2) their presence in the KIAA1199 immunoprecipitates was observed at least 4 times more frequently than in the control immunoprecipitates. Validation IP experiments were performed for several of these proteins (CANX, CUL1, EPHA2, ITPR3, LGALS3, NME2, and UBR5; see antibodies used in <italic>Material and Methods</italic>). ITPR3 and EPHA2 emerged as <italic>bona fide</italic> KIAA1199 interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s003">Figure S3</xref>). IP is often performed with extracts from cells in which the proteins of interest are overexpressed. The extracts used in our experiments contain only endogenously expressed ITPR3 and EPHA2, and this may partly account for the relatively weak interaction between these proteins and KIAA1199.</p>

      <p>We also investigated gene expression changes 48 h after doxycycline-mediated induction of KIAA1199 expression in KIAA1199-Cl.13 cells. Use of this isogenic cellular system allowed prompt detection of changes that occurred shortly after KIAA1199 expression was switched on. (The assay time point was chosen on the basis of the Western blot data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In principal component analysis, KIAA1199-expressing cells were clearly distinguished from the uninduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, three independent experiments), and expression of the protein was associated with significant changes in the transcript-level expression of 490 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s007">Table S2</xref>). Fold changes were generally low, pointing to a moderate effect of KIAA1199 expression on the transcriptome of these cells. However, as reported in <italic>Material and Methods</italic>, the genes listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s007">Table S2</xref> were selected using a low level of stringency. This approach was associated with a high false discovery rate, but it increased our chance of selecting genes that were also among the putative KIAA1199 interactors identified in our MS experiments. In fact, EPHA2 and ITPR3 were included in both lists although their mRNA and protein levels were only modestly changed upon KIAA1199 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

      <p>We previously showed that <italic>KIAA1199</italic> expression is reduced by induction of a truncated, dominant-negative form of TCF4 in LS174T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), suggesting that it might be a novel Wnt signaling target <xref rid="pone.0069473-SabatesBellver1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We now have evidence suggesting that KIAA1199 expression exerts negative feedback on this signaling. TOP/FOPflash reporter assays were used to assess the impact of KIAA1199 expression on transcriptional activity elicited by wild-type CTNNB1 or by CTNNB1<sup>-T41A</sup>, a constitutively active form of the protein with a threonine-for-alanine substitution resulting in a non-phosphorylatable protein at residue 41. In HEK293 cells, which are KIAA1199-nonexpressors (data not shown), ectopic KIAA1199 expression clearly inhibited the transcription evoked by both forms of CTNNB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and significantly reduced the expression of wild-type and constitutively active CTNNB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). These effects were less evident in SW480, which are characterized by particularly strong TCF transactivation <xref rid="pone.0069473-Korinek1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Owing in all probability to insufficiently high transfection efficiency, CTNNB1-driven transactivation of the TCF-responsive promoter in SW480 KIAA1199 Cl.18 cells was only modestly (but nonetheless significantly) decreased relative to that observed in SW480 Dest controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Consistently, ectopic KIAA1199 expression produced only limited decreases in active CTNNB1 protein levels (i.e., those detected by antibodies recognizing the protein dephosphorylated at residues S37 and T41) and had even fewer effects on total CTNNB1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This downregulationâin both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartmentsâwas more evident in immunocytochemical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) studies performed on KIAA1199-V5 and KIAA1199-GFP clones, respectively. It appears to be a post-transcriptional effect since our microarray experiments revealed no decrease in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mRNA levels. (Correlation between KIAA1199 and CTNNB1 protein expression patterns in neoplastic tissues could not be assessed since all tumors invariably showed overexpression of KIAA1199 <xref rid="pone.0069473-SabatesBellver1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Using colon cancer cell lines with endogenously or ectopically expressed KIAA1199, we carried out subcellular localization, gene expression, and proteomic studies aimed at delineating the functions of this currently uncharacterized protein. Our findings show that KIAA1199 is a glycosylated protein located predominantly in the perinuclear space (probably the ER, including both the outer nuclear membrane and ER tubules) and plasma membrane. It is also secreted into the extracellular environment (and additional studies are being planned to explore its functions in that milieu). Collectively, these features are suggestive of a protein with functions in distinct membranous cell compartments and they are completely in line with the results of our 2-pronged high-throughput analysis. The lists we compiled of genes encoding putative KIAA1199 interactors and genes whose transcription is significantly up- or downregulated by KIAA1199 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s006">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s007">S2</xref>) both point to <italic>organelles</italic> and/or <italic>cytoplasm</italic> as KIAA1199âs probable location within the cell (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069473-t001">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, the 11 genes on both lists all encode proteins known to be localized in these compartments (ACADVL, CANX, EIF3E, EPHA2, FASN, HPRT1, ITPR3, MFGE8, PSMB2, TAGLN2, and TKTâ12.4% of the putative interactor proteins).</p>
      <p>Both lists also exhibit strong enrichment for components of <italic>cell membrane-</italic>associated pathways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069473-t001">Table 1</xref>). The cell-membrane receptor <italic>e</italic>phrin A2 (EPHA2), for example, interacts with KIAA1199, and EPHA2 transcript and protein levels increased slightly upon expression of KIAA1199. The EPHA2 receptor plays key roles in cell adhesion and migration, cytoskeletal organization, mitogenic and survival signaling (e.g., MAP/ERK and PI3K pathways), angiogenesis, and tumor neovascularization <xref rid="pone.0069473-Beauchamp1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and it has been extensively investigated as a therapeutic target in pre-clinical cancer models <xref rid="pone.0069473-Tandon1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. EPHA2 and ephrins can produce opposite effects via bidirectional and unconventional signaling modalities, whichâto further complicate mattersâvary considerably from one cell type to another <xref rid="pone.0069473-Pasquale1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This makes it very difficult at this stage of our research to speculate on the outcome of the KIAA1199/EPHA2 interaction in our SW480 clones, in particular, whether it is in any way responsible for the phenotype of KIAA1199-expressing cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g005">Figure 5</xref>. Another membrane receptor, the <italic>ITGA6/ITGB4 (alpha-6/beta-4) integrin complex,</italic> also appeared in both our lists. Its abnormal function has been implicated in the progression of carcinomas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069473-t001">Table 1</xref>), including those of the colon <xref rid="pone.0069473-Beaulieu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. When bound by extracellular matrix molecules like laminin, ITGA6/ITGB4 functions with growth factor receptors to bring about hemidesmosomal and cytoskeletal rearrangements and trigger various forms of intracellular signaling (e.g., MAP/ERK and PI3K) that lead to gene expression changes <xref rid="pone.0069473-Beaulieu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0069473-Giancotti1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A very recent study indicates that KIAA1199 is involved in hyaluronan catabolism in the dermis of the skin and arthritic synovium <xref rid="pone.0069473-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Its effects, which are upregulated by histamine and down-regulated by TGFÎ²1, are mediated by the cell membrane-associated, clathrin-coated pit pathway. Interestingly, combined analysis of our microarray and proteomic data also pointed to the <italic>clathrin-coated vesicle cycle</italic>, <italic>Histamine H1 receptor signaling</italic>, and <italic>TGFÎ² dependent</italic> mechanisms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069473-t001">Table 1</xref>). Finally, PLXNA2, a membrane receptor involved in cell adhesion and motility <xref rid="pone.0069473-Tamagnone1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, was found to interact with KIAA1199 in a study based on yeast two-hybrid screens <xref rid="pone.0069473-Nakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We cannot confirm or exclude such interaction because on the basis of our microarray screen, PLXNA2 does not appear to be expressed in SW480 cells.</p>
      <p>Links between KIAA1199 and branches of the <italic>G-protein signaling</italic> pathway also emerged from our transcriptional and proteomic data sets. The list of putative KIAA1199 interactors was enriched for G proteins that mediate the effects of the S1P (sphingosine-1-phosphate)/S1P receptor (S1PR1, 2 and 3) axes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069473-t001">Table 1</xref>). In concert with growth factor receptors, S1PRs regulate tumor cell growth, survival, motility and metastasis, as well as vascular permeability and angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0069473-Maceyka1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069473-Pyne1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Interestingly, signaling through S1PR2 also modulates vascularization of the cochlea, where murine <italic>KIAA1199</italic> mRNA is highly expressed <xref rid="pone.0069473-Abe1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In fact, <italic>S1pr2</italic>â/â mice are deaf <xref rid="pone.0069473-Kono1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069473-MacLennan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and missense variants in the <italic>KIAA1199</italic> gene are associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss in humans <xref rid="pone.0069473-Abe1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The lists of GO pathway maps, processes, and molecular functions point strongly toward the ER and functions linked to this organelle, like protein binding, folding, transport, and localization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069473-t001">Table 1</xref>). As the major reservoir of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in epithelial cells, the ER also plays an essential role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling that regulates many cell functions <xref rid="pone.0069473-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (ITPRs), ligand-gated ion channels that are activated by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and IP3, are localized in intracellular membranes, where they mediate the mobilization of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. ITPR3 was among the putative KIAA1199 interactors we identified and validated, and expression of <italic>ITPR3</italic> mRNA was moderately upregulated upon KIAA1199 expression in microarray experiments. These channels are found on ER membranes of most animal cells, and they are key players in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling <xref rid="pone.0069473-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069473-Shibao1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The strong representation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in our data sets also points to a potential role of KIAA1199 in the Wnt network (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069473-t001">Table 1</xref>). For example, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release upon ligand binding is mediated by <italic>trimeric G-proteins</italic>, which are involved in all three components of the Wnt network, i.e., the canonical Wnt/CTNNB1(beta-catenin) pathway, the Wnt/calcium pathway, and the Wnt/Jun N-terminal kinase pathway <xref rid="pone.0069473-Katanaev1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0069473-Kestler1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. A<italic>ctivation of PKCs via G-protein-coupled receptors</italic> requires diacylglycerol and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and it plays roles in different Wnt pathways <xref rid="pone.0069473-Kestler1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0069473-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Canonical Wnt signaling is inhibited by G protein/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated nuclear export and calpain-mediated degradation of CTNNB1 <xref rid="pone.0069473-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and by Wnt/CTNNB1-antagonizing NKD proteins <xref rid="pone.0069473-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0069473-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Accordingly, we found that KIAA1199 expression increased <italic>NKD1</italic> (p â=â0.04) and <italic>CAPN1</italic> (calpain large subunit; p â=â0.03) transcription, and the calpain small subunit (CAPNS1) appears to interact with KIAA1199 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s006">Table S1</xref>). These findings are consistent with the results of our GO analysis, which revealed enrichment of <italic>MYC-associated transcription regulation</italic>, although KIAA1199 expression had no significant effect on the expression of MYC mRNA or protein (data not shown). Both lists (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069473-t001">Table 1</xref>) also displayed enrichment for <italic>Wnt effects on cytoskeletal remodeling</italic> and for <italic>transcriptional regulation by HNF4A</italic>, another key regulator of intestinal epithelium homeostasis that modulates Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling <xref rid="pone.0069473-Cattin1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is premature to speculate on how KIAA1199âs possible functions in the complex Wnt network might affect canonical Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling in colorectal tissues. However, our data suggest that KIAA1199 is a Wnt signaling target (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s002">Figure S2B</xref>; see also Ref. <xref rid="pone.0069473-SabatesBellver1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>) and that its expression can downregulate Wnt signaling via a negative feedback mechanism. CTNNB1-dependent transcriptional activity was significantly (albeit incompletely) inhibited by ectopic expression of KIAA1199 in HEK293 cells, and in SW480 clones nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of CTNNB1 dropped considerably when KIAA1199 expression (untagged as well as V5- or GFP-tagged forms) was restored. These findings are fully consistent with one another despite the markedly different subcellular localizations of CTNNB1 in these two cell lines. In HEK293 cells, CTNNB1 immunostaining typically exhibits a cell-border, CDH1-associated pattern, whereas SW480 cells, which harbor a truncated APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein, generally have inordinately high CTNNB1 levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus <xref rid="pone.0069473-Munemitsu1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Restoration of APC expression in SW480 cells is followed by translocation of CTNNB1 and CDH1 to the cell membrane and diminished Wnt signaling <xref rid="pone.0069473-Faux1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The drop in cytoplasmic and nuclear CTNNB1 levels we observed in SW480 cells following KIAA1199 expression was not associated with this type of translocation. Furthermore, the restored expression had no detectable impact on MYC mRNA or protein levels in these cells. It remains to be seen whether KIAA1199 modulates CTNNB1 expression patterns in SW480 cells via non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>Regardless of its underlying mechanisms, this modulation could have important effects on gene transcription and phenotypic features like cell proliferation and adhesion. Upregulated KIAA1199 expression during colorectal transformation <xref rid="pone.0069473-SabatesBellver1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> could restrain cell growth by negatively regulating Wnt signaling. Indeed, upregulated <italic>KIAA1199</italic> transcription in human renal cell carcinoma cells <xref rid="pone.0069473-Michishita1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and cultured myotubes <xref rid="pone.0069473-Raymond1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> is associated with cellular or gene-expression features of cell mortality/senescence or apoptosis, and these findings are consistent with the diminished proliferation, cloning efficiency, and invasiveness we observed in SW480 clones that constitutively express KIAA1199. Additional work is needed, however, to clarify the link between the proteinâs effects on cell behavior and its impact on Wnt signaling.</p>
      <p>Our findings contradict recent findings by Birkenkamp-Demtroder et al. that shRNA-mediated repression of KIAA1199 expression attenuates Wnt signaling in parental SW480 cells <xref rid="pone.0069473-BirkenkampDemtroder1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Endogeneous KIAA1199 expression is negligible or absent in molecularly authenticated SW480 cells, as clearly shown by our own data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069473.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and also those of Birkenkamp-Demtroder et al. (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069473-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). It is therefore difficult to see how significant knock-down of KIAA1199 expression can be achieved in this cell line. Unfortunately, the authors have not documented their shRNA-mediated repression by Western blotting. (We used stable shRNA transfection in an attempt to knock down endogenous KIAA1199 expression in LS174T cells, which express high endogenous levels of KIAA1199, but the clones produced were not viable.) When Birkenkamp-Demtroder et al. transfected SW480 cells with V5-His-tagged-KIAA1199, their findings seem much more consistent with our own: their microarray analysis showed that this exogenous expression was associated with significant changes in the expression of genes involved in the ephrin and Wnt signaling pathways. More in-depth comparative analysis of microarray findings from our study and theirs is not currently possible since the raw data from the latter study do not appear to have been deposited in a publicly available database (or there is no information to this effect in their article).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, although further work is obviously needed, our data on the restoration of KIAA1199 expression provide useful guidance for future work on this membranous and secreted protein, which appears to be involved in the modulation of ER processes and in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, G-protein, ephrin, and Wnt signaling. Future studies based on other cell models are already being planned to clarify the impact of KIAA1199 on Wnt signaling. Later, the tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of KIAA1199-expressing SW480 cells might be compared with those of non- KIAA1199-expressing control cells in murine xenograft models. Furthermore, because KIAA1199 is a secreted protein, it will be interesting to see if full-length or cleaved forms of the protein can be detected in the blood of the tumor-bearing mice. These experiments could furnish proof of principle for developing KIAA1199 as a secreted biomarker for colorectal neoplasia.</p>
