        <p>Thomas et al. show that a novel protein, Eros, controls the abundance of components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, making it essential for the phagocyte respiratory burst and defense against common infections.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The phagocyte respiratory burst is crucial for innate immunity. The transfer of electrons to oxygen is mediated by a membrane-bound heterodimer, comprising gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> subunits. Deficiency of either subunit leads to severe immunodeficiency. We describe Eros (essential for reactive oxygen species), a protein encoded by the previously undefined mouse gene <italic>bc017643</italic>, and show that it is essential for host defense via the phagocyte NAPDH oxidase. Eros is required for expression of the NADPH oxidase components, gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic>. Consequently, <italic>Eros</italic>-deficient mice quickly succumb to infection. <italic>Eros</italic> also contributes to the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS) and impacts on the immune response to melanoma metastases. <italic>Eros</italic> is an ortholog of the plant protein Ycf4, which is necessary for expression of proteins of the photosynthetic photosystem 1 complex, itself also an NADPH oxio-reductase. We thus describe the key role of the previously uncharacterized protein Eros in host defense.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Infectious diseases cause major morbidity and mortality worldwide. For example, specific serovars of <italic>Salmonella</italic> such as typhi and paratyphi cause typhoid fever (enteric fever), whereas nontyphi <italic>Salmonella</italic> can also cause invasive systemic infection (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dougan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gilchrist et al., 2015</xref>). Both can be fatal, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Our understanding of the immune response to such common and serious pathogens remains incomplete, though infection of mice with <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium provides a useful model of immunity to this bacterium and others that colonize macrophages (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chatfield et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Conlan, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Richter-Dahlfors et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mastroeni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Torres et al., 2000a</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Burton et al., 2014</xref>). Specific elements of both innate and adaptive immunity are needed to control <italic>Salmonella</italic> and other intracellular pathogens. Mononuclear phagocytes, particularly those in the liver and spleen, restrict bacterial replication in the initial phase of a primary invasive infection. Control of the pathogen requires (i) the effective initiation of an inflammatory response via TLR (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Torres et al., 2004</xref>) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Broz et al., 2012</xref>), (ii) the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-Î³ and TNF (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 1990</xref>), and (iii) the activation of an arsenal of antibacterial strategies within the phagosome, including the generation of the phagocyte respiratory burst, the generation of reactive nitrogen species (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Burton et al., 2014</xref>) and the use of efflux pumps to deprive the bacteria of divalent cations (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Vidal et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mastroeni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Torres et al., 2000a</xref>).</p>
      <p>The importance of these strategies is well documented, but the phagocyte respiratory burst is of particular interest because it has a nonredundant role in preventing overwhelming infection that is highly conserved between mouse (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mastroeni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Torres et al., 2000a</xref>,<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) and man (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">van den Berg et al., 2009</xref>). The respiratory burst is a process by which superoxide and hydrogen peroxide ions are generated within the phagosome and at the cell surface. The ions are likely to be both directly and indirectly cytotoxic to the bacteria (and fungi), as the production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide anions also activates other anti-bacterial mechanisms (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Segal, 2005</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide reacts with halide ions (such as chloride or iodide) to produce the anti-bacterial compound, hypochlorite (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Klebanoff et al., 1966</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Klebanoff, 1967</xref>). Crucially, this process is catalyzed by myeloperoxidase, which is abundant in neutrophil granules. Hypochlorite, the product of this reaction, is itself a potent microbiocidal agent. It is also a precursor of the chloramines, which are oxidized halogens that also exhibit antimicrobial activity and are formed by the reaction of oxidized halogens with ammonia or amines (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Babior, 1984</xref>).</p>
      <p>The reactive oxygen species are generated by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, a multiprotein complex that comprises both membrane bound and cytosolic components. The membrane-associated heterodimer, cytochrome b558, consists of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> subunits (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Segal, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Teahan et al., 1987</xref>) and is essential for electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen. The cytosolic components p47<italic>phox</italic> (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Dinauer, 2006</xref>), p67<italic>phox</italic>, p40<italic>phox</italic>, and the small G proteins Rac1 and Rac2 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yamauchi et al., 2004</xref>) are required for full activation. Deficiencies in individual subunits of the complex cause chronic granulomatous disease (CGD; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Berendes et al., 1957</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rae et al., 2000</xref>, a severe immunodeficiency characterized not only by life threatening infections but also by autoimmune manifestations, such as inflammatory bowel disease (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Singel and Segal, 2016</xref>). The most common cause of CGD, X-linked gp91<italic>phox</italic> deficiency (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Segal, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Teahan et al., 1987</xref>), is associated with a significantly reduced life expectancy. Of note, the most frequent causes of septicemia in patients with CGD are <italic>Salmonella</italic> species (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">van den Berg et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The genome-wide set of targeted mutations in mouse ES cells established by the KOMP, EUCOMM, and MirKO programs provides an opportunity to conduct systematic, large-scale gene function analysis in a mammalian system (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ayadi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, to uncover new pathways involved in host defense, we screened hundreds of knockout mouse lines for susceptibility to infection by inoculating mice generated through KOMP with an attenuated form of the intracellular pathogen, <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium () In this study, we show that mice deficient in a previously uncharacterized gene, <italic>bc017643</italic>, are highly susceptible to <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Listeria</italic> infection and are impaired in their ability to control replication of either pathogen. We show that this is because <italic>bc017643</italic> encodes a gene, which we name <italic>Eros</italic> (<italic>essential for reactive oxygen species</italic>), that is necessary for the phagocyte respiratory burst. <italic>Eros</italic> is necessary for stable expression of the gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> subunits of the cytochrome b558 heterodimer. Intriguingly, a plant ortholog of Eros, Ycf4, is necessary for expression of the subunits of photosystem I in chloroplasts, also an NADPH oxio-reductase. Collectively, our work identifies a novel and essential regulator of the phagocyte respiratory burst and points to an ancient and conserved function for a hitherto undescribed family of proteins.</p>

        <title>Mice deficient in the uncharacterized gene, <italic>bc017643,</italic> are highly susceptible to <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium but not <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection</title>
        <p>Infections by facultative intracellular pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> cause major morbidity and mortality globally, but our understanding of host defense to such pathogens remains incomplete. To address this in a systematic fashion and to explore host susceptibility to infection more generally, we screened mice generated through the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Knockout Mouse Project for immunity to <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium) challenge (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2013</xref>). Mice harboring a targeted mutation in <italic>bc017643</italic>, a previously uncharacterized protein-coding gene located on chromosome 11 (Fig. S1 A), were highly susceptible to <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, dying 4â5 d after intravenous inoculation with the attenuated <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium M525 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). As we demonstrate that <italic>bc017643</italic> is crucial for the generation of a phagocyte respiratory burst in the innate immune system, we have renamed the gene <italic>Eros</italic>. <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice were also susceptible to the highly attenuated <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium vaccine strain SL261 Î<italic>aroA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), underlining the severity of the phenotype. The susceptibility of <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection was caused by a failure to control bacterial replication as they harbored 10<sup>3</sup>â10<sup>4</sup> log-fold more CFU of <italic>Salmonella</italic> per gram of spleen or liver than control mice at day 4 after challenge. In addition, there was evidence of infection in the kidney and colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, CâF</xref>), sites which are less heavily colonized by <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. <italic>Eros<sup>+/â</sup></italic> heterozygous mice were not more susceptible to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (Fig. S1 B). In contrast to the early lethality with <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection, <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice were not more susceptible to the extracellular mucosal pathogen <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref> and not depicted). Confirmation of the causative role of the previously uncharacterized <italic>Eros</italic> gene in driving susceptibility to <italic>Salmonella</italic> was provided by repairing the knockout allele and reintroducing <italic>Eros</italic> expression. This was accomplished by crossing the <italic>Eros</italic>-deficient mice with flippase-expressing mice to remove the FRT-flanked stop codon that generates the original null allele. This restoration of <italic>Eros</italic> abolished the susceptibility to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>).</p>

        <title>Eros is a transmembrane protein with homology to Ycf 4</title>
        <p>There is no published literature on murine <italic>Eros</italic>. The protein shares â¼89% sequence identity with human <italic>C17ORF62</italic> and is predicted to be a single domain protein and shares sequence homology with domain of unknown function (DUF) 4564. Sequence similarity searching using jackhmmer (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al., 2011</xref>) identified orthologs of <italic>Eros</italic> in all vertebrates, as well as in some lower order animals such as poriferan sponges and sea urchins. This suggests that <italic>Eros</italic> has an ancient evolutionary origin. <italic>Eros</italic> also shares significant sequence similarity with the conserved plant protein Ycf4 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Boudreau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Krech et al., 2012</xref>), which participates in the assembly of the photosystem I complex (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Boudreau et al., 1997</xref>). Phobius software (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">KÃ¤ll et al., 2004</xref>) predicted an N-terminal transmembrane region comprising two transmembrane helices (residues 21â39 and 45â63) with the N- and C-terminal regions present within the cytoplasm and the two transmembrane helices separated by a short linker sequence of five residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The protein is also likely to contain a disordered C-terminal (residues 168â187) that is rich in serine residues (7 out of 20 residues). Databases of RNA and protein expression (European Bioinformatics Institute Expression Atlas and Immgen) show that <italic>Eros</italic> is highly expressed in cells of the innate immune system, particularly in neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. The protein has been detected in the phagosome of macrophages (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Trost et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dill et al., 2015</xref>) and in dendritic cell endosomes (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 2014</xref>). The human ortholog of <italic>Eros</italic>, <italic>C17ORF62</italic>, is also highly expressed in the immune system. Microarray analysis of separated blood subsets from healthy volunteers detected the highest expression in neutrophils and monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This is consistent with a proteomic analysis of separated human tissues that showed high expression of C17ORF62 in monocytes and CD4 T cells and B cells, although neutrophils were not evaluated in this study (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Mass spectrometry data from human induced pluripotent stemcellâderived macrophages in our own laboratory showed that C17ORF62 protein expression was up-regulated after treatment with IFN-Î³ or a combination of IFN-Î³ and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium (Fig. S1, C and D). Consistent with high expression of the protein in monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, the severe phenotype associated with <italic>Eros</italic> deficiency was still evident when the mice were crossed to the <italic>Rag</italic>-knockout background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), confirming that abnormalities in the innate immune system alone could account for the susceptibility to <italic>S</italic>.

        <p>Flow cytometric analysis of cells from uninfected <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice demonstrated no abnormality in the number or frequency of any of the major immune cell subsets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Accordingly, we tested the functional capabilities of peritoneal macrophages from <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice in vitro. <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> peritoneal macrophages were able to phagocytose bacteria apparently normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>) and electron microscopy showed that <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> macrophages could internalize bacteria into a <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (unpublished data). However, peritoneal macrophages from <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice showed a marked defect in the ability to control intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication 1â2 h after ex vivo infection, as measured by gentamicin protection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), complementing our observations in vivo. Although IL-12, IFN-Î³, and TNF are all important for the control of <italic>Salmonella,</italic> there were no obvious defects in cytokine secretion by <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> BM-derived macrophages in response to live opsonized <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium M525 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

We confirmed this in our model by using the anti-Ly6G antibody, 1A8, to deplete neutrophils. We then infected mice with <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium M525 and measured bacterial burden in liver and spleen 72 h later. Control mice treated with 1A8 had higher counts (of the order of 1-log fold) than controls (Fig. S1, E and F), indicating that neutrophils do contribute to the control of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium. We also found that <italic>Eros</italic>-deficient neutrophils were unable to control <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium replication. Using an RFP-expressing <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium SL1344 strain, we showed that uptake of bacteria was equivalent as at 1 h after infection; the percentage of infected neutrophils was not different between control and <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> neutrophils.

        <title>The phagocyte respiratory burst is highly impaired in <italic>Eros</italic>-deficient neutrophils and macrophages</title>
        <p>We noted that <italic>Eros</italic>-deficient mice had a very similar phenotype to that of mice deficient in components of the NADPH oxidase complex, including gp91<italic>phox</italic> (Nox2) and p22<italic>phox</italic> (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mastroeni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">van den Berg et al., 2009</xref>; and Fig. S1, I and J). These mice, like <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, are highly susceptible to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium but survive <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fattouh et al., 2013</xref>; and unpublished data). Testing this phenotype, we found that neutrophils from <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice had a highly impaired superoxide burst in vitro. This was most marked in response to the N-formylated peptide <italic>N</italic>-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), to which the response was almost absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). There was a 5â10-fold impairment of the response to the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>), but a variable and slightly less marked defect in the response to zymosan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The defect in the phagocyte respiratory burst was equally apparent using alternative luminescent indicators, such as lucigenin and DIOGENES (unpublished data). The phenomenon extended to other <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> phagocytes. BM-derived macrophages from <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice exhibited a severely impaired generation of superoxide in response to PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>) and zymosan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>), as did peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). To put the impaired phagocyte respiratory burst in context, we compared <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> neutrophils with mice lacking gp91<italic>phox</italic> or p22<italic>phox</italic>, the two essential membrane-bound components of flavocytochrome b558. These experiments confirmed that, in neutrophils, the phagocyte respiratory burst is highly impaired rather than totally absent in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (Fig. S2, A and B). The deficits observed in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> BM-derived macrophages were even more severe than those in neutrophils, and their ROS generation was as impaired as that of gp91<italic>phox</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, including the ex vivo response to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium itself (Fig. S2, CâE). Consistent with some residual oxidase activity in neutrophils, comparison of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice with those deficient in either gp91<italic>phox</italic> or p22<italic>phox</italic> showed that they had a slightly less severe defect in controlling bacterial replication than gp91<italic>phox</italic> or p22<italic>phox</italic>-deficient mice, which have no oxidase activity at all (Fig. S3 A).</p>

        <title><italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice exhibit other sequelae of a defective phagocyte respiratory burst</title>
        <p>We reasoned that the consequences of Eros deficiency should extend to other processes that are dependent on an intact phagocyte respiratory burst, such as clearance of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dinauer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Noubade et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice were highly susceptible to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and died within 5 d of infection, with high bacterial loads in liver and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Under certain specific circumstances, the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS) is also dependent on an intact phagocyte respiratory burst (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Remijsen et al., 2011</xref>). NET production in response to PMA was markedly impaired in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>). We then asked whether <italic>Eros</italic> deficiency could ever be advantageous. The phagocyte respiratory burst can, for example, hinder tumor immunity. gp91<italic>phox</italic>, <italic>Ncf1</italic> (p47<italic>phox</italic>), and Rac2-deficient mice all exhibit fewer lung metastases than control mice in experimental melanoma models (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Okada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kelkka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2014</xref>). We challenged mice with B16 melanoma cells and demonstrated that <italic>Eros</italic>-deficient mice had significantly fewer lung metastases 10 d later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). This demonstrates that the influence of <italic>Eros</italic> extends to other biological processes in which the phagocyte respiratory burst is known to be important.</p>

        <title><italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> neutrophils and macrophages express very low levels of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> proteins</title>
        <p>The phenotypes we observed led us to examine whether <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice had abnormal expression of components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. <italic>Eros</italic> deficiency had no measurable effect on basal RNA expression in freshly isolated BM neutrophils or in whole spleen; the only differentially expressed gene identified by microarray analysis in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice was <italic>Eros</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> and Fig. S4 A). In particular, there was no difference in the mRNA level of the genes encoding the subunits of the NADPH oxidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Expression of both the gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> proteins was, however, markedly reduced but not entirely absent in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> neutrophils. This was demonstrated by comparison of <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> neutrophils with those from gp91<italic>phox</italic>-deficient (<italic>Cybb</italic> knockout) mice where the protein was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). gp91<italic>phox</italic> and its membrane-bound partner, p22<italic>phox</italic>, are only stable as a heterodimer. Therefore, if one member of the heterodimer is weakly expressed, abundance of the partner protein is reduced (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Segal, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pollock et al., 1995</xref>). Peritoneal lavage cells, IFN-Î³âprimed BM-derived macrophages and splenic B and T cells also exhibited very low levels of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, DâF</xref>). In contrast, the cytoplasmic components of the NADPH oxidase complex, p47<italic>phox</italic>, p67<italic>phox</italic>, and p40<italic>phox</italic> were not significantly differentially expressed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>) or by mass spectrometry (unpublished data). gp91<italic>phox</italic> has several homologues which are highly expressed in other tissues. In particular Nox1 is highly expressed in the colon and endothelium, Nox3 is specifically expressed in the inner ear, and Nox4 is predominantly expressed in the kidney. Nox1-4 all use p22<italic>phox</italic> to form a stable heterodimer. Among members of the Nox family, the role of Eros protein seems to be specifically restricted to regulating the abundance of gp91<italic>phox</italic> (Nox2). We measured expression of Nox1 and Nox4 by Western blot. As expected, we saw the highest levels of Nox1 in the colon and high expression of Nox4 in the kidney. Both proteins were equivalently expressed between control and <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (Figs. S3, B and C). Nox3 is highly expressed in the inner ear and Nox3-deficient mice exhibit a vestibular/balance defect characterized by head tilt, and therefore we could assess Nox3 using functional assays that were used to phenotype mice as part of the Knockout Mouse Project (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2013</xref>). p22<italic>phox</italic> is essential for the stabilization of Nox3 in the inner ear, and thus nmf333 mice, which carry a homozygous mutation in p22<italic>phox</italic>, exhibit similar balance defects (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with this data, p22<italic>phox</italic>-deficient mice show spontaneous trunk curl and head bobbing, and fail to exhibit a contact-righting reflex, whereas <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice do not show any of these vestibular defects (Fig. S3, DâF).</p>

        <title><italic>Eros</italic> deficiency has very specific effects on gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> expression</title>
        <p>Given that the components of the cytochrome b558 heterodimer were almost absent in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, we next asked whether the expression of other proteins was dysregulated in the innate immune system of <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice in the same profound manner as gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic>. We used label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to compare the whole macrophage proteome of control and <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> BM macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). As expected, Eros protein was detectable in all samples from control cells but not those from <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells. In addition, gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> were much less abundant in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells, with many fewer unique peptides for both proteins detected in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> neutrophils. Furthermore, <italic>Eros</italic> deficiency changed the abundance of a remarkably small subset of proteins, with the effects on gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> the most profound. The log-fold change for gp91<italic>phox</italic> was 4.7. This was greater than for any other protein, except Eros, whereas the log-fold change for p22<italic>phox</italic> was 3.17.

        <p>We examined the mechanism underlying the low expression of the gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> proteins in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells. Defects in transcription, biosynthesis via glycosylation, and protein degradation of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> have all been shown to affect levels of the b558 flavocytochrome. An impact on translation is improbable given that mass spectrometry shows that <italic>Eros</italic> deficiency has an extremely specific effect on the macrophage and neutrophil proteome. An effect on biosynthesis is also unlikely, as there is no defect in glycosylation of the small amount of gp91<italic>phox</italic> protein present in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells, which showed the same shift as control cells after treatment with PNGase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Thus, Eros is likely to impact gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> degradation, particularly as the abundance of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> protein is known to be controlled by endoplasmic reticulumâassociated (ERAD) and proteasomal degradation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">DeLeo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). To test this, we incubated IFN-Î³âprimed BM macrophages with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and the p97 inhibitor NMS873, which blocks ERAD. We also treated such cells with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine and the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin to determine if these pathways were driving accelerated degradation of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic>. Chloroquine could not significantly rescue expression of either p22<italic>phox</italic> or gp91<italic>phox</italic> (unpublished data) in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells. Bafilomycin could rescue p22<italic>phox</italic> expression to some extent, alone or in combination with MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref> and Fig. S5 A). Both the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and the calpain inhibitor ALLN were able to significantly rescue p22<italic>phox</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref> and Fig. S5 B). Potent restoration of p22<italic>phox</italic> expression was observed with NMS873, consistent with data showing that this subunit is degraded by ERAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref> and Fig. S5 C) and again consistent with increased degradation of p22<italic>phox</italic> in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice. We were able to rescue gp91<italic>phox</italic> to a modest, though statistically significant, degree with ALLN and lactacystin, but not with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or the ERAD inhibitor NMS873 (Fig. S5, DâF). In view of the fact that the rescue of gp91<italic>phox</italic> was minimal, the rescue of p22<italic>phox</italic> by ALLN, lactacystin, and NMS873 was probably the maximum that could be expected given that gp91<italic>phox</italic> is required to stabilize p22<italic>phox</italic> protein expression.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Eros is a highly conserved, novel protein that is necessary for expression of the cytochrome b558 heterodimer and is therefore essential for the phagocyte respiratory burst and for host defense. Sequence analysis of Eros offered few clues to its function, though it does contain a domain of unknown function, DUF4564. Intriguingly, Ycf4, an ancient plant ortholog of Eros, also contains DUF4564 and also regulates the activity of an NADPH oxio-reductase, namely the ferredoxin oxio-reductase, photosystem I (PSI), which is essential for photosynthesis. The available data on Ycf4 offers some fascinating parallels with our observations on the behavior of Eros. Ycf4 was first identified in the unicellular green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Boudreau et al., 1997</xref>) and has also been studied in tobacco plants. (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Krech et al., 2012</xref>). In Ycf4-deficient organisms, the components of PSI are not detectable at the protein level, despite normal mRNA expression (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Boudreau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Krech et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, association of PSI transcripts with ribosomes was unaffected, implying that translation of PSI components was normal in Ycf4 mutant plants. Parallel with the ability of Eros to co-immunoprecipitate with gp91<italic>phox</italic>, Ycf4 interacts physically with PSI components. (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Krech et al., 2012</xref>). We believe, then, that Eros is likely to play a similar role in the assembly of cytochrome b558 to that demonstrated for Ycf4 in algae and plants. Furthermore, our work implies an ancient conservation of function for the DUF4564 family of proteins in stabilizing the protein levels of oxio-reductase complexes. Eros is necessary for the stable expression of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic>, most likely by acting as a chaperone. There is already strong evidence that the expression of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> is controlled at the level of protein degradation and that ER-resident chaperone proteins play a key role in this process. Studies on the mechanism of how gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> assemble to form cytochrome b558 show that the unglycosylated gp91<italic>phox</italic> precursor and p22<italic>phox</italic> are synthesized in the ER and that gp91<italic>phox</italic> associates with p22<italic>phox</italic> before glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus. However, formation of the gp91<italic>phox</italic>-p22<italic>phox</italic> heterodimer is relatively inefficient and monomers that do not find a partner are rapidly degraded via the proteasome (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">DeLeo et al., 2000</xref>). There is precedence for the regulation of this interaction by chaperones. For instance, hsp70 and hsp90 play reciprocal roles in cytochrome b558 stability (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Hsp90 stabilizes gp91<italic>phox</italic> expression whereas hsp70 facilitates its degradation via the hsp70-regulated ubiquitin ligase, CHIP (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Nrros (negative regulator of reactive oxygen species) is also involved in cytochrome b558 stability, associating with gp91<italic>phox</italic> to facilitate its degradation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Noubade et al., 2014</xref>). Deficiency of Nrros in mice causes increased expression of the gp91<italic>phox</italic>-p22<italic>phox</italic> heterodimer with a concomitant increase in the magnitude of the phagocyte respiratory burst that has beneficial effects for clearance of bacterial infection but detrimental in that it leads to a more severe disease course of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Noubade et al., 2014</xref>). Eros is necessary for the stability of gp91<italic>phox</italic>-p22<italic>phox</italic> heterodimer and its deficiency has very specific effects on the abundance of these proteins, without affecting expression of their mRNA. Furthermore, gp91<italic>phox</italic> and Eros co-localize in the ER, and we have shown that these two proteins interact, as they can co-immunoprecipitate with each other. In addition, partial rescue of the expression of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and particularly p22<italic>phox</italic> can be achieved with inhibitors of the proteasome. Collectively, these data indicate that Eros plays a central role as a chaperone critical for expression of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> and hence for the cytochrome b558 heterodimer.</p>
      <p>A fuller understanding of the phagocyte respiratory burst is not only necessary for the study of immunity to infection. CGD patients are more prone to a variety of autoimmune manifestations including inflammatory bowel disease and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Singel and Segal, 2016</xref>), whereas polymorphic variation in components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase machinery can play a role in the pathogenesis of polygenic autoinflammatory disease. Coding variants in the cytosolic p67<italic>phox</italic> subunit (<italic>NCF2</italic>) are associated with increased SLE (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Jacob et al., 2012</xref>), and this is consistent with data suggesting that gp91<italic>phox</italic> deficiency predisposes to lupus in both mouse and man (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cale et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2012</xref>). Aside from SLE and inflammatory bowel disease, genetic variation in p40<italic>phox</italic> (<italic>NCF4</italic>) has also been implicated in atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis. The lack of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and p22<italic>phox</italic> seen in <italic>Eros</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice is certainly sufficient to cause abnormalities that extend beyond immunity to infection. We found that Eros deficiency influenced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and the host response to metastasis. The latter result is particularly intriguing as mice deficient in other components of the respiratory burst apparatus are also resistant to metastasis in mouse models (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Okada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kelkka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>Hence, <italic>Eros</italic> is a novel and essential component of the phagocyte respiratory burst and is necessary for effective in vivo responses to common pathogens and the host response to tumor metastasis.</p>
