      <abstract>
        <p>The regulation of the ubiquitously expressed protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is essential for various cellular functions such as cell proliferation, transformation, and fate determination. In this study, we demonstrate that the highly conserved protein in mammals, designated FAM122A, directly interacts with PP2A-AÎ± and B55Î± rather than B56Î± subunits, and inhibits the phosphatase activity of PP2A-AÎ±/B55Î±/CÎ± complex. Further, FAM122A potentiates the degradation of catalytic subunit PP2A-CÎ± with the increased poly-ubiquitination. In agreement, FAM122A silencing inhibits while its overexpression enhances cell growth and colony-forming ability. Collectively, we identify FAM122A as a new endogenous PP2A inhibitor and its physiological and pathophysiological significances warrant to be further investigated.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Complex processes in cell signaling require a set of molecular tools to modulate the activity and localization of specific proteins. Many of these responsibilities are regulated by protein phosphorylation. As the major regulatory mechanism employed by eukaryotic cells at the protein level, protein phosphorylation is dynamically controlled by kinases and phosphatases, whose opposite actions reversibly phosphorylate proteins [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Type 2A protein phosphatases (PP2A), which constitutes ~1% of total cellular protein, belongs to the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) enzymes, which also comprise the serine(Ser)/threonine (Thr) phosphatases PP1, PP2B (calcineurin), PP4, PP5, PP6, and PP7 [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Together with PP1, the ubiquitously expressed PP2A phosphatases constitute the bulk of Ser/Thr phosphatase activity in a given tissue [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It dephosphorylates a plethora of cellular proteins involved in signal transduction besides regulating metabolic enzymes, including cell surface receptor molecules, cytosolic protein kinases, and transcription factors. The modification of these proteins important for different facets of cellular functions such as cell-cycle regulation, cell transformation, and cell fate determination affects essential processes of every cell [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Accordingly, dysregulations including overexpression or inactivation of PP2A result in developmental abnormality, embryonic lethality and neonatal death [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Also, mutation of PP2A subunits or decreased phosphatase activity of PP2A has been found in a variety of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, solid tumors and hematological malignancies [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the enhanced PP2A activity has also been found to be correlated with type II diabetes, inflammatory lung diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, PP2A can be as a favorable drugable target in the treatment of various cancers and relevant diseases [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Structurally, PP2A phosphatases are holoenzymes, constituting of at least two subunits [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The PP2A core enzyme consists of a scaffolding subunit PP2A-A and a catalytic subunit PP2A-C. The A and C subunits each exist with an Î± and a Î² isoform in mammalian cells, which are encoded by two different genes each, giving rise to two highly related AÎ± and AÎ² isoforms that share almost 87% sequence identity, and two nearly identical CÎ± and CÎ² isoforms with 97% identity [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The PP2A-A subunit is composed of 15 tandem HEAT (named for the set of four cytoplasmic proteins Huntingtin, EF3, PP2A-A subunit and TOR1 which were first recognized to contain them) repeats and is expressed in excess of the other subunits in mammalian cells [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The C subunit binds to HEAT repeats 11â15 of the A subunit to form the PP2A core enzyme [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The core PP2A dimer can associate differently with each class of regulatory B-type subunits to form different PP2A heterotrimers. In mammals, there are four classes of B subunits including B (B55/PR55), Bâ (B56/PR61), Bââ (PR48/PR72/PR130) and Bâââ(PR93/PR110)/striatin, which are encoded by 15 different genes that result in 23 different isoforms through alternative gene promoters, alternative splicing or alternative translation [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, it is predicted that the PP2A holoenzyme has over 80 distinct combinations. Although the stoichiometry of PP2A within cells is poorly understood [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], there is evidence that approximately one-third of PP2A occurs as PP2A dimer, while the majority of PP2A-complexes are heterotrimers [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
      <p>Like most protein phosphatases, PP2A are not all passive regulators for cell signaling. As reviewed [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], specific extracellular stimuli or stresses can either directly, or indirectly through activation of protein kinases, regulate PP2A activity by the generation of second messengers, such as cAMP, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ceramides. Several protein kinases such as the double stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), DNA damage triggers ATM, DNA damage-induced Chk1 and protein kinase C (PKC) affect PP2A activity through phosphorylation of some B-type subunits. On the other hand, PP2A catalytic activity can be directly inhibited by an emerging set of specific cellular PP2A inhibitory proteins, including ANP32A (also called PP2A Inhibitor 1) [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], SET (also called PP2A Inhibitor 2) [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], CIP2A (Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A) [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and cAMP-regulated phosphoproteins, ARPP16 and ARPP19, and the closely related Î±-endosulfine [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and TIP(type 2A interacting protein) [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Herein, we identify that FAM122A (family with sequence similarity 122A) or C9orf42 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 42) is a new endogenous PP2A inhibitor.</p>

        <title>Physical interaction of FAM122A with PP2A-AÎ±/B55Î±/CÎ± complex</title>
        <p>The <italic>FAM122A</italic> gene is localized on chromosome 9q21.1 within the intron 1 of <italic>PIP5K1B</italic> (phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase) gene, and has 287 amino acids with highly sequence identity in a series of mammary animals including <italic>bostaurus, canis lupus familiaris, macacamulatta, rattusnorvegicus</italic> and <italic>musmusculus</italic>. However, the function of FAM122A is not clear, although its single nucleotide polymorphisms were found in chronic kidney disease [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Also, genome-wide linkage scan showed that chromosomal region 9q21.1 had a suggestive linkage to the metabolic syndrome including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, we attempted to identify the potential FAM122A-interacting proteins. For this purpose, 293T cells were stably transfected with the empty or Flag-tagged FAM122A expressing plasmids, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel, followed by the competitive elution of 3Ã Flag peptide. The eluted immunoprecipitates were run on SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Differential protein bands between Flag-tagged FAM122A and empty vector-expressing cells were individually excised, digested and analyzed by HPLC/mass spectrometry. Of great significance, PP2A-AÎ± and PP2A-B55Î± proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) were found in immunoprecipitates from Flag-tagged FAM122A but not empty vector-expressing cells, although there also seems to be increased proteins in the input for the Flag-FAM122A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). An early report showed that FAM122A was also in a total of 197 protein interactions with the human PP2A system, which were identified by an integrated systems biology method [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. On the other hand, PP2A participates in a variety of biological processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, in this work we focused on the potential interaction of FAM122A with PP2A complex and their functional significance.</p>

        <p>To confirm the interaction of FAM122A with PP2A subunits, 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with GFP-tagged FAM122A or empty vector and Flag-tagged PP2A subunit Aa, B55Î±, B56Î± or CÎ±. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, co-IP with anti-GFP antibody was performed. The results showed that the anti-GFP antibody, which efficiently precipitated GFP-tagged FAM122A protein, could effectively pulled down Flag-tagged PP2A-AÎ±, B55Î± and CÎ±, but not B56Î± (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Aâ2D</xref>). Reciprocally, we also transiently co-transfected these four Flag-tagged PP2A subunits or empty vector together with GFP-tagged FAM122A into 293T cells, followed by co-IP assay with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel. In agreement, GFP-tagged FAM122A could also be significantly co-precipitated by Flag-tagged PP2A-AÎ±, B55Î± and CÎ± but not B56Î± (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Eâ2H</xref>). Next, we detected whether GFP-tagged FAM122A interacts with endogenous PP2A subunits in GFP-tagged FAM122A or empty vector-transfected 293T cells. As depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>, anti-GFP antibody could pull down endogenous PP2A-AÎ±, B55Î± and CÎ± but not B56Î± proteins together with GFP-tagged FAM122A.</p>

        <p>To further test whether endogenously expressed FAM122A interacts with these PP2A subunits, we prepared anti-FAM122A antibody by using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 expressed GST-tagged FAM122A protein to immunize New Zealand white rabbit. The antibody was affinity purified by ImmunoPure IgG Purification Kit. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>, the antibody effectively identified the recombinant FAM122A protein, in spite of multiple GST-tagged FAM122A proteins with differents length, which could also be seen in anti-GST-based blot (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), possibly due to incomplete translation in E. coli. The specificity of the anti-FAM122A antibody was also confirmed in Flag-tagged FAM122A expressing and silencing 293T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref>). Furthermore, the anti-FAM122A antibody-based IP assay also confirmed the interaction of endogenous FAM122A and PP2A-AÎ±, B55Î±, and CÎ± but not B56Î± proteins in 293T (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L</xref>) and Jurkat cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M</xref>), a human acute T cell leukemia cell line.</p>

        <title>Direct binding of FAM122A with PP2A-AÎ± and B55Î± but not CÎ±</title>
        <p>Because PP2A-A, B and C subunits forms a complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), we attempted to determine which PP2A subunit(s) FAM122A interacts with. To this end, the recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) alone or GST-tagged FAM122A was incubated with the <italic>in vitro</italic> translated His-tagged PP2A subunits in <italic>E. coli</italic>, followed by GST pull down assay. In the GST pulled-down complex or input, anti-GST antibody-based immunoblot showed multiple GST-tagged FAM122A proteins with different length (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), like that seen in anti-FAM122A antibody-based blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>).

        <title>FAM122A is an inhibitor of PP2A-AÎ±/B55Î±/CÎ± heterotrimer</title>
        <p>The interaction of FAM122A with PP2A complex promoted us to detect whether FAM122A modulates the phosphatase activity of PP2A. For this purpose, an <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphatase assay was applied to the anti-PP2A-CÎ± antibody-pulled down precipitates from equal amounts of 293T cells respectively with ectopic expression of Flag-tagged FAM122A and CIP2A (a known PP2A inhibitor) or with the treatment of 50 nM of okadaic acid (OA, a chemical PP2A inhibitor) [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The anti-PP2A-CÎ± antibody precipitated PP2A-CÎ± protein with similar effects in these treated or transfected cells (top panels, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), although FAM122A overexpression reduced PP2A-CÎ± protein in whole lysates (input panels, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Like OA treatment and CIP2A overexpression, FAM122A overexpression also significantly decreased PP2A activity (bottom panel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Of note, OA appeared to induce modification of FAM122A, while CIP2A had no impact on FAM122A expression (top panel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The same assay was also used in 293T cells which were transfected by two pairs of siRNAs specifically targeting FAM122A (designated siFAM#9 and siFAM#5) together with a non-specific siRNA (NC). Like that seen in ectopic expression of FAM122A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), FAM122A silencing increased PP2A-CÎ± protein in whole lysates (input panels, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), but similar amounts of PP2A-CÎ± proteins were precipitated in these treated or transfected cells (top panel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). And FAM122A silencing (top panels, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) remarkably enhanced phosphatase activity of PP2A (bottom panel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), which could be rescued by re-expression of Flag-tagged and siFAM#5-resistant FAM122A (bottom panel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Notably, FAM122A transfection overwhelmingly enhanced its expression level far above the basal level, but only restored the phosphatase activity to the basal level in siRNA treated cells (bottom panel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). We also applied the <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphatase assay to the anti-Flag antibody-pulled down precipitates from equal amounts of 293T cells with ectopic expression of Flag-tagged PP2A-AÎ± in the presence and absence of FAM122A overexpression. The results showed that FAM122A overexpression failed to impact the PP2A-AÎ±/B56Î± interaction, and it still inhibited PP2A activity in the PP2A-AÎ± pulled down precipitates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p>

        <p>It has been well known that the specific substrates of PP2A are dependent on its different B subunits [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The fact that FAM122A interacts with PP2A-B55Î± but not B56Î± suggests that FAM122A may modulate the phosphorylation state of PP2A substrates specifically targeted by PP2A-B55 subunit. Akt has been identified as an important PP2A-B55-specific substrate [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and S6K1 as a downstream substrate of AKT/mTOR signaling regulated by PP2A [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], while c-myc is specifically targeted by PP2A-B56 [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For this purpose, three cell lines with detectable FAM122A protein, including human embryonic kidney 293T cells, human lung carcinoma epithelial cells A549 and large cell lung cancer epithelial cells H460, were stably transfected by these two specific siRNAs. The effective knock down effect of FAM122A has been confirmed by western blot in three cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) and 293T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref>). Then, we detected the phosphorylated states of AKT, S6K1 and c-myc in 293T, A549 and H460 cells with or without FAM122A silencing. The results revealed that FAM122A silencing could significantly inhibit the phosphorylated AKT at Thr308 and Ser473 and S6K1 but not c-myc in all three cell lines, and the inhibited AKT and S6K1 phosphorylations could be restored by re-expression of FAM122A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Collectively, all these data support that FAM122A is a specific inhibitor of PP2A-AÎ±/B55Î±/CÎ± heterotrimer.</p>

        <title>FAM122A enhances degradation of PP2A-CÎ± protein by the ubiquitination</title>
        <p>The previous investigations showed that PP2A activity can be regulated by the alteration of protein expression of its subunits, post-translational modifications of PP2A-C subunit including phosphorylation and methylation, and the association of B subunits with the corresponding substrates [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To investigate how FAM122A modulates the phosphatase activity of PP2A, we asked whether FAM122A expression affects the interaction of PP2A-B55 with its substrate Akt. For this purpose, Flag-tagged PP2A-B55Î± was ectopically expressed in siFAM#5, siFAM#9 or NC-infected 293T cells, followed by co-IP with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel. The results showed that the silence of FAM122A failed to alter PP2A-B55Î±/Akt interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). On the other hand, FAM122A overexpression neither changed PP2A-AÎ± and PP2A-B55Î± protein level nor induced the shift in the gel of PP2A-CÎ± (input, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). However, our further investigation showed that Flag-tagged FAM122A dose-dependently decreased the PP2A-CÎ± with no changes for Aa and B55Î± or B56Î± subunits, which was not found in CIP2A overexpressing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In agreement, FAM122A silencing did significantly increase PP2A-CÎ± protein, which could be antagonized by re-expression of FAM122A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). We also demonstrated that FAM122A silence did not affect the PP2A-CÎ± mRNA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Moreover, GFP-tagged FAM122A overexpression also reduced ectopically expressed Flag-tagged PP2A-C protein level to a degree (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p>

        <p>The above results suggest that FAM122A promotes the degradation of PP2A-CÎ± protein and/or causes post-translational modifications of PP2A-CÎ± protein which alters its sensitivity to monoclonal anti-PP2A-CÎ± antibody. Accumulating lines of evidence show that PP2A-C can be regulated by the ubiquitin system [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To test whether PP2A-CÎ± ubiquitination was affected by FAM122A, Flag-tagged PP2A-CÎ±, HA-ubiquitin and/or GFP-tagged FAM122A were transiently transfected into 293T cells in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor MG132. The results demonstrated that FAM122A overexpression significantly reduced Flag-tagged PP2A-CÎ± protein, which could be effectively rescued by MG132 treatment (input channel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>), suggesting that FAM122A induced PP2A-CÎ± degradation by proteasome. Further, co-IP assay showed that FAM122A remarkably increased the poly-ubiquitin- PP2A-CÎ± protein in the presence of MG132 (IP channel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>), as determined by anti-HA antibody. These data propose that FAM122A induces degradation of PP2A-CÎ± protein by the poly-ubiquitin/proteasome system, which could also be confirmed in FAM122A-silencing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>).</p>

        <title>Suppression of cell growth and colony formation in FAM122A silencing cells</title>
        <p>Although it was reported that different PP2A trimers can negatively regulate activity of all mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) such as ERKs, here we showed that FAM122A silencing did not significantly regulate the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), which is consistent to the notion that PP2A-B56 but not PP2A-B55 increases ERK dephosphorylation [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As well known, PP2A dephosphorylates over 300 substrates involved in the cell cycle and regulates almost all major pathways and cell cycle checkpoints, thus playing a critical multi-faceted role in the regulation of the cell proliferation [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, we addressed whether FAM122A could affect cell growth. Thus, the cell growth of FAM122A silencing cells was monitored by CCK-8 assay. The results showed that FAM122A knockdown remarkably inhibited the growth of all these three cell lines, particularly on the culturing days 2 and 3 (top panels, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Moreover, FAM122A silencing also abrogated the cell colony formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) and significantly decreased the numbers and sizes of colony growth in soft agar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). To confirm that these effects are FAM122A silencing-specific, we re-expressed Flag-tagged and siFAM#5-resistant FAM122A into these three cell lines and the results demonstrated that FAM122A re-expression could rescue the reduced growth and colony formation in siFAM#5 expressing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Aâ6C</xref>). Additionally, ectopic expression of FAM122A promoted the growth and colony formation in H460 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Dâ6E</xref>). Cumulatively, our results suggest that FAM122A promotes cell growth, which is consistent with the effect of suppressed PP2A activity.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>PP2A protein complexes are involved in many cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, cell motility, DNA damage response and cell cycle progression [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this study, with co-IP-based proteomic strategy, we demonstrated that FAM122A protein interacted with PP2A complex, which could be confirmed in cells with over-expressions of FAM122A and/or PP2A subunits. Especially, endogenous FAM122A and PP2A could also interact with each other, proposing their physiological interaction. Considering that the PP2A-AÎ± isoform subunit constitutes about 90% of PP2A holoenzymes while AÎ² isoform forms 10% of PP2A enzyme [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and the CÎ± isoform is also expressed in higher abundance than Î²isoform [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], here we mainly focused on their Î± subunits. Our GST pulldown assay showed that FAM122A directly interact with PP2A-AÎ± and PP2A-B55Î± rather than B56Î± and PP2A-CÎ±. Based on these findings, we demonstrated that FAM122A protein could effectively inhibit phosphatase activity of PP2A-AÎ±/CÎ±/B55Î± but not PP2A-AÎ±/CÎ±/B56Î± complex. It has well been known that within PP2A complex, the B subunits, usually expressing in a cell- or tissue-specific way with distinct subcellular localizations, determine the substrate specificity of PP2A holoenzyme, thus directly modulating PP2A activity [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our results showed that FAM122A enhanced the phosphorylation of B55-specific substrates Akt and not B56-specific substrates c-myc and ERK1/2, further supporting the specific inhibiting activity of FAM122A on B55-forming PP2A activity. Further, three human cell lines with FAM122A silencing presented significantly reduced growth and colony formation, which is consistent with the notion that the enhanced PP2A activity can suppress cell growth [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
      <p>To understand how FAM122A protein inhibits phosphatase activity of PP2A-AÎ±/CÎ±/B55Î± complex, we showed that FAM122A dose-dependently decreased the PP2A-CÎ±, and FAM122A silencing did significantly increase PP2A-CÎ± protein. These results suggest that FAM122A promotes the degradation of PP2A-CÎ± protein and/or causes post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PP2A-CÎ± protein, the latter leading to the alteration of its binding capacity with anti-PP2A-C monoclonal antibody, since this antibody is specifically against the C-terminal amino acid residues 295â309 that are the main PTM sites of PP2A-C subunit. Here we demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 effectively antagonized FAM122A overexpression-induced decrease of PP2A-CÎ± protein, suggesting that FAM122A can degrades PP2A-CÎ± protein by proteasome system, although its exact mechanisms remain to be explored. Regardless of this, our <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphatase assay demonstrated that FAM122A effectively inhibited the PP2A activity in the PP2A-CÎ±-pulled down precipitates with the same amounts of the PP2A-CÎ± complex, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of FAM122A involves its interaction with PP2A complex besides decreased PP2A-CÎ±. Additionally, it is also possible that FAM122A competes with PP2A-CÎ± to bind with PP2A-AÎ± complex to regulate PP2A activity, because FAM122A interacts with PP2A-AÎ± and B55Î± rather than PP2A-CÎ± subunits.</p>
      <p>It is well known that the monomeric C subunit is unstable and requires binding to the A subunit or other non-canonical B subunits to preserve its activity [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Amounting evidence shows that PP2A phosphatase activation is regulated by PTMs of PP2A-C subunit protein, B subunit diversity, the association of regulatory subunits with substrate proteins or binding with Î±4 [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], an important regulator of PP2A activity. The current investigations have shown that the C-terminus of PP2A-CÎ± undergoes methylation at L309 by the regulation of two enzymes, methyltransferase LCMT-1 that is expressed in the cytoplasm and a lipase-like methylesterase PME-1 that is expressed in the nucleus [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of multiple residues on the C terminus of PP2A-C is also critical for modulating PP2A activity via B subunit interactions. A recent report showed that ubiquitin E3 ligase NOSIP induces the ubiquitination of PP2A-C subunit and the loss of <italic>NOSIP</italic> enhances PP2A activity, resulting in perinatal lethality [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Also, progestin-inducible EDD E3 ubiquitin ligase could polyubiquitinate PP2A-C by binding to the C-terminal of Î±4 [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Here we also demonstrated that FAM122A potentiates poly-ubiquitination of anti-PP2A-CÎ± precipitates, which suggests that FAM122A enhances ubiquitination of PP2A-CÎ± and/or its partner(s) such as CIP2A, SET and TIPRL. To address this, <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay by using recombinant PP2A-C protein deserves to be performed. Also, it remains to be further investigations how FAM122A induces the polyubiquitination of PP2A-CÎ± or its partners. On one hand, amino acid sequence analysis revealed that FAM122A is ~31% homologous to NEDD4 (data not shown), a founding member of a family of ubiquitin-protein ligases [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, FAM122A itself has ubiquitin-E3 ligase activity deserved to be explored, although FAM122A has no direct interaction with PP2A-CÎ±. On the other hand, several PP2A-C-targeting ubiquitin-E3 ligases such as Mid1 and EDD [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>â<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] have been reported. Whether FAM122A indirectly impacts activities of these specific E3 ligase and/or their regulators such as Î±4 and PME-1 [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] to induce polyubiquitination also needs to be further investigated.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study shows that FAM122A directly interacts with AÎ± and B55Î± subunits of PP2A and inhibits its phosphatase activity, and its biological and pathological significances warrant to be further explored.</p>
