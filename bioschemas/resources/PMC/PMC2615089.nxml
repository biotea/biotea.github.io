      <abstract>
        <p>In this study, we show that NANOG, a master transcription factor, regulates S-phase entry in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) via transcriptional regulation of cell cycle regulatory components. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with reporter-based transfection assays show that the C-terminal region of NANOG binds to the regulatory regions of <italic>CDK6</italic> and <italic>CDC25A</italic> genes under normal physiological conditions. Decreased CDK6 and CDC25A expression in hESCs suggest that both CDK6 and CDC25A are involved in S-phase regulation. The effects of NANOG overexpression on S-phase regulation are mitigated by the down-regulation of CDK6 or CDC25A alone. Overexpression of CDK6 or CDC25A alone can rescue the impact of NANOG down-regulation on S-phase entry, suggesting that CDK6 and CDC25A are downstream cell cycle effectors of NANOG during the G1 to S transition.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Nanog is a divergent homeodomain transcription factor that functions to maintain self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mitsui et al., 2003</xref>). Nanog expression is largely confined to the inner cell mass of human blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hyslop et al., 2005</xref>) and is high in undifferentiated ESCs and embryonic carcinoma cells but down-regulated during ESC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong et al., 2006</xref>). This has been attributed to the sequential methylation of CpG residues in the promoter region of <italic>NANOG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deb-Rinker et al., 2005</xref>) as well as suppression by p53 and Tcf3, both of which were shown to bind to the <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pereira et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Overexpression of Nanog in mouse ESCs confers pluripotency independently of the leukemia inhibitory factorâSTAT3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mitsui et al., 2003</xref>), whereas its down-regulation in mouse and human ESCs (hESCs) results in loss of pluripotency, reduction in cell growth, and differentiation toward extraembryonic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mitsui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hyslop et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zaehres et al., 2005</xref>). Elevated expression of Nanog has also been reported to result in clonal expansion of murine ESCs, the maintenance of Oct4 expression, and resistance to differentiation induced in monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Large-scale studies have suggested that Nanog acts as a component of multiple protein complexes that are individually required for controlling the survival and differentiation of the inner cell mass in the embryo; some of the protein complexes are also putative Nanog and Oct4 targets as well as being their effectors in the pluripotency network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Not surprisingly, transfection of <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>NANOG</italic>, and <italic>LIN28</italic> in human fibroblasts induces pluripotency, suggesting an important role for each of these factors in reprogramming the genome of somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite these advances, very little is known about the role of NANOG in regulating ESC proliferation and survival. ESCs are characterized by rapid cell divisions, and their cell cycles have a rather large S phase and a truncated G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burdon et al., 2002</xref>). They can proliferate without apparent limit and can be readily propagated, but very little is known about these unusual proliferative properties, their cell cycle structure, and how this affects the pluripotent phenotype. In this study, we sought to identify possible interactions between NANOG, one of the master pluripotency factors in ESCs, and cell cycle regulation.</p><p>To address how NANOG interacts with the cell cycle machinery, we constitutively overexpressed NANOG in hESCs. In this manuscript, we show that NANOG is able to enhance hESC proliferation while still maintaining the pluripotent phenotype. The results described in this work provide, for the first time, several lines of evidence that NANOG accelerates S-phase entry in hESCs by directly regulating at the transcriptional level two important cell cycle regulators: CDK6 and CDC25A.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation and characterization of NANOG-overexpressing hESC clones</title><p>Three hESC lines, H1, hES-NCL1, and H9, were stably transfected with the empty pTP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pratt et al., 2000</xref>) or pTP6-NANOG construct to generate three control sublines (H1 control, H9 control, and hES-NCL1 control) and three overexpressing sublines (H1 NANOG, H9 NANOG, and hES-NCL1 NANOG), respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR for the endogenous expression of <italic>NANOG</italic> showed no significant differences between clones generated from the same hESC line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Total expression of <italic>NANOG</italic> analyzed by both quantitative RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and Western blotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) revealed higher NANOG expression in NANOG-overexpressing sublines compared with the control, thus confirming gene overexpression. Each of the six sublines was subjected to karyotype analysis at 20 and 40 passages after transfection, and, in all cases, no chromosomal anomalies were detected (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801009/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801009/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of NANOG-overexpressing hESC sublines.</bold> (A) Quantitative RT-PCR for endogenous (right bars) and total (left bars) expression of <italic>NANOG</italic> in H1, H9, and hES-NCL1 sublines.

This could be caused by a decrease in apoptosis, an increase in hESC proliferation, or both. To distinguish these two possibilities, we performed annexin V staining to detect early (7-AAD<sup>â</sup> annexin V<sup>+</sup>) and late apoptotic (7-AAD<sup>+</sup> annexin V<sup>+</sup>) cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) and BrdU incorporation to detect DNA synthesizing/proliferating cells under the aforementioned culture conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). The results showed that overexpression of NANOG did not significantly affect the rate of apoptosis because percentages of apoptotic cells were similar to control sublines under normal culture conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). However, overexpression of NANOG increased the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>) compared with the control sublines. It is of interest to note the variability between different hESC sublines with respect to the percentage of proliferating cells, with H9 being the most proliferative, which fits well with the shorter population doubling time compared with H1 and hES-NCL1 (unpublished data). Direct immunoblotting also indicated increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, suggesting increased cell proliferation as a result of NANOG overexpression (unpublished data). Cell counting experiments over different periods of time showed a higher proliferation in the NANOG sublines compared with controls, which correlated to a shorter population doubling time observed across all of the NANOG sublines (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801009/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801009/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>The NANOG-overexpressing sublines maintained typical hESC morphology in culture, whereas signs of spontaneous and typical differentiation were observed in the control sublines after 4â5 d in culture (unpublished data). AP staining analysis showed a small but significant increase in the number of AP-positive colonies in NANOG-overexpressing sublines compared with the controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This suggests that overexpression of NANOG results in the suppression of spontaneous differentiation that occurs during hESC culture. No changes in OCT4 expression were found by quantitative RT-PCR (not depicted) or direct immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), corroborating data reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darr et al.

The EBs obtained from NANOG sublines were indistinguishable from the controls at a morphological level (unpublished data). Recent studies in hESCs and primate ESCs have indicated that NANOG overexpression results in the enhancement of primitive ectoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darr et al., 2006</xref>) and repression of primitive endoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). The study performed in hESCs has used the H9 and H13 cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darr et al., 2006</xref>). To avoid duplicating findings, we focused our investigation on the impacts of NANOG overexpression on differentiation on the other two different cells lines, H1 and hES-NCL1. Our morphological observation and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed no significant difference between each NANOG-overexpressing subline and controls in expression of the neuroepithelial marker (<italic>PAX6</italic>; Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801009/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801009/DC1</ext-link>), mesodermal marker (<italic>BRACHYURY</italic>), endodermal marker (<italic>IHH</italic>), and trophoectoderm (<italic>CDX2</italic>) during the 21-d differentiation time course (not depicted). This notwithstanding, NANOG-overexpressing sublines showed an enhanced <italic>FGF5</italic> peak expression (P &lt; 0.05) compared with control sublines in which little or no expression of this gene was observed (Fig. S3 B), corroborating other published data reporting the enhancement of primitive ectoderm expression by NANOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darr et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, <italic>GATA4</italic> expression was significantly repressed in NANOG sublines (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the controls, suggesting that NANOG is likely to repress primitive endoderm differentiation (Fig. S3 C). The injection of NANOG and control hESCs into the testis of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice resulted in the formation of teratomas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>) comprised of cells from all three germ layers, indicating the pluripotent nature of the cells. The identity of endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm tissues within the tumors was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining with Î±-fetoprotein (AFP), NESTIN, and smooth muscle actin (SMA), respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>NANOG accelerates S-phase entry</title><p>The increase in the number of cells incorporating BrdU in NANOG-overexpressing clones compared with controls is open to many explanations, and these include increased cell proliferation, slower progression through S phase, or transient stalling. To address some these issues, we synchronized human NANOG and control sublines by incubation with 200 ng/ml of the mitotic inhibitor nocodazole for 18 h. Flow cytometry analysis with cell surface markers associated with hESCs such as SSEA-4 and TRA-1-60 at 6 h upon release from nocodazole showed 10% and 8% more positive cells, respectively, in the NANOG sublines compared with controls, which fits well with the AP analysis shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>. In both cases, there were no significant changes in SSEA-4 or TRA-1-60 expression as a result of nocodazole treatment, thus indicating that nocodazole did not cause cell differentiation in either NANOG or control clones (unpublished data).</p><p>Upon release from inhibition, the hESC cell cycle distribution was investigated by flow cytometry every 1â2 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Analysis at the time of inhibitor release (0 h; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) revealed that NANOG sublines showed a quicker cell cycle progression compared with controls because very few cells existed in G1 (1.86%) compared with control clones that showed 13.97% of cells still remaining in G1. Most importantly, 76% of the cells were in S phase within 6 h of release from the inhibitor in NANOG-overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Control sublines showed a more gradual and slow entry into S phase, as only 48% and 70% were in S phase 6 h and 8 h after release from the inhibitor, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Although this analysis suggests that NANOG overexpression accelerates G1 to S transition, it is difficult to separate this event from S-phase progression. In view of this, we performed pulse-labeled BrdU experiments at different time points after nocodazole synchronization as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al. (2006</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). This analysis showed that in NANOG-overexpressing clones, most cells enter S phase 5 h after release from nocodazole treatment. In contrast, a more gradual and slower progression from G1 to S is observed in control clones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that overexpression of NANOG shortens the time needed for S-phase entry.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Changes in hESC cell cycle distribution as a result of NANOG overexpression.</bold> (A) Flow cytometry images showing movement of cells through the cell cycle after synchronization by nocodazole for 18 h assessed by propidium iodide staining.

Upon removal of the inhibitor, hESCs were analyzed by flow cytometry every 2 h. These experiments showed that down-regulation of CDK6 in NANOG-overexpressing sublines lengthen the time needed for S-phase completion by 2 h compared with the control siRNAâtransfected sample as well as reducing the numbers of hESCs entering S phase. Collectively, these data suggest that NANOG-accelerated S-phase entry and progression is in part mediated by CDK6, for its down-regulation alone reverses this effect, making NANOG cells comparable with controls.</p><p>Flow cytometry analysis of NANOG-overexpressing sublines that were transfected with CDC25A siRNA at the time of release from the inhibitor (0 h) showed a significant retention of cells in G1 (19%) compared with control (2%; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). Similar results were obtained upon transfection of NANOG siRNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). Repeated analysis at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after release from the inhibitor showed similar results to those shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref> for both NANOG and CDC25A knockdown experiments, suggesting likely additional blocks at S and G2 to M. Notwithstanding this, down-regulation of CDC25A in NANOG sublines results in a significant retention of cells in G1, supporting our hypothesis that NANOG regulation of S-phase entry is mediated by CDC25A.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent publications suggest that combined overexpression of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28 is able to reprogram somatic cells to a pluripotent phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yu et al., 2007</xref>). One of the key features that distinguish somatic cells from ESCs is the length of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is much shorter in the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2006</xref>). This means that during the transcription factorâmediated reprogramming, changes in expression or posttranslational modifications of cell cycle regulatory genes have to occur.</p><p>In this study, we sought to unravel the impacts of NANOG expression on hESCs and identify target genes that mediate its effects. We show that overexpression of NANOG in hESCs causes a significant increase in ESC proliferation while enhancing their pluripotent phenotype. Most importantly, overexpression of NANOG causes an increase in the numbers of cells entering S phase and shortens the time needed for S-phase entry. A combination of molecular assays indicated that the C-terminal region of NANOG binds to the regulatory regions of <italic>CDK6</italic> and <italic>CDC25A</italic>. Overexpression of NANOG in hESCs results in a significant increase in the expression of CDK6 and CDC25A. Because NANOG overexpression results in the increased proportion of more pluripotent hESCs as suggested by our AP staining, it could be envisaged that an increase in CDK6 and CDC25A is achieved indirectly via increased homogeneity of hESC cultures on the proviso that CDK6 and CDC25A expression would be high in hESCs and down-regulated upon differentiation. However, this is not the case because CDK6 expression increases during hESC differentiation, whereas CDC25A shows a slight decrease in the first 3 d of differentiation followed by an increase at day 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Neganova et al., 2008</xref>). Together, these data suggest that NANOG has direct transcriptional effects on CDK6 and CDC25A.</p><p>Cdc25A phosphatase has been shown to control entry into and progression through S phase by removing inhibitory phosphates from cyclin Eâ and cyclin Aâbound Cdk2 complexes. Published data have highlighted an important role for CDC25A in both mitotic entry in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mailand et al., 2002</xref>) and S-phase progression in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lehmann and McCabe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yao et al., 2007</xref>); however, very little is known about CDC25A function in ESCs. Our own data in hESCs have shown that CDC25A is present in hESCs and its expression peaks at G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Neganova et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, immunoprecipitation assays have shown that CDC25A is associated with active complexes formed between three G1 Cdks (CDK4, CDK6, and CDK2) and the respective cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Neganova et al., 2008</xref>). Work described in this manuscript shows that one of the impacts of CDC25A down-regulation is the retention of cells at the G1-phase cycle in both NANOG and control sublines, which is indicative of its involvement in S-phase entry. In addition, its overexpression enhances the numbers of cells entering S phase and shortens the time interval needed for S-phase completion. Our current work has also indicated that down-regulation of CDK2 causes cell stalling at G1 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Neganova et al., 2008</xref>), whereas down-regulation of CDK6 delays S-phase entry. The similarity in the phenotype and the results of the immunoprecipitation assays are suggestive of CDC25A acting through one or more G1-specific Cdkâcyclin complexes during S-phase entry. It now remains to be investigated how CDC25A is able to coordinate different functions during cell cycle progression and identify the target Cdkâcyclin complexes that are being regulated by CDC25A at different phases of the cell cycle. In particular, we are keen to investigate further the role of CDC25A and NANOG in S and G2 to M progression because the stalling of hESCs at S and G2 to M was also observed upon down-regulation of these two components. It is likely that more than one Cdkâcyclin complex is involved in this process, and, currently, our experiments are focused on the role of CDC2âCDK1 in hESC cell cycle regulation and likely association with CDC25A. It is interesting to point out that CDC2âCDK1 has also been identified as a transcriptional target of NANOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>); however, we were unable to identify any significant differences in CDK1 expression between NANOG and control clones (unpublished data).</p><p>Having established a role for CDK6 and CDC25A in cell cycle progression in hESCs, we sought to determine whether they were the downstream effectors of NANOG-mediated S entry and S progression effects. We were able to address this question by knockdown experiments in NANOG-overexpressing sublines and overexpression experiments. Data generated by an RNA interference approach clearly indicated that both CDK6 and CDC25A are involved in S-phase completion, for down-regulation of each component alone caused the lengthening of time needed for S phase and/or reduction in the numbers of cells able to enter S phase, thus reversing the effects of NANOG on S-phase entry. Most importantly, overexpression of either of these two genes alone rescued cell retention in G1 caused by NANOG down-regulation, suggesting that NANOG's effects on the S-phase entry of hESCs are mediated by these two cell cycle regulatory components. In this manuscript, we elucidated that NANOG has an effect on S-phase and G2 to M progression because NANOG down-regulation alone causes cell stalling in S and G2 to M in addition to G1. Our work on CDC25A also indicated that CDC25A itself has a function in S progression and G2 to M transition in hESCs. It is likely that other cell cycle regulatory components in addition to CDC25A mediate NANOG's effects on S-phase progression and G2 to M transition in hESCs. Large-scale ChIPâChIP experiments have suggested that OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG regulate the expression of <italic>CDC7</italic>, which has been shown to be important for S-phase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is important that the role of CDC7 is investigated in connection with NANOG in the S-phase progression in hESCs.</p><p>It is interesting to note that forced expression of Nanog in 3T3 cells and in a subset of T cells causes enhancement in cell growth as well as resulting in a transformed phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Piestun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>). Murine ESCs with high Nanog expression also show an increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, whereas cells with low Nanog expression have increased expression of cell cycle inhibitory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Singh et al. 2007</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Nanog possesses an oncogenic potential that might be related to the role it plays in germ cell tumors and to its function in self-renewal of ESCs. It remains to be investigated whether these oncogenic functions are related to its role in cell cycle regulation and in particular to the direct transactivation of <italic>CDK6</italic> and <italic>CDC25A</italic> genes. This, of course, should be extended to the other two coregulators, OCT4 and SOX2, that occupy a substantial portion of the Nanog target genes and have been described to be involved in oncogenic transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Jong and Looijenga, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rodriguez-Pinilla et al., 2007</xref>). Large-scale ChIPâChIP experiments have suggested that all three factors regulate the expression of <italic>CDC7</italic> shown to be important for S phase, whereas SOX2 and NANOG regulate the expression of <italic>CDC2âCDK1</italic>, which is crucial for G1 to S and G2 to M progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, <italic>CYCLIN D1</italic> and <italic>CDK4</italic> have been shown to be transcriptional targets of SOX2 and OCT4, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greco et al., 2007</xref>). A schematic summary of the published literature and the data generated from this manuscript is presented in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. Collectively, our findings and those of others suggest that the regulation of cell cycle components is likely to be regulated by the important transcriptional network that controls pluripotency and self-renewal, and studies focused on these specific interactions will help us to understand the unusual cell cycle regulation in ESCs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic presentation of G1 to S transition in hESCs showing the role of NANOG, CDK6, and CDC25A.</bold> A question mark is used to indicate lack of information of upstream regulators for CDK2.

The PKLight Assay exploits the kinases' intrinsic ATPase activity, resulting in the cleavage of the Î³-phosphate moiety of ATP and its subsequent insertion into the target substrate. This results in the phosphorylation of the substrate and the conversion of ATP to ADP. The PKLight Assay measures the consumption of ATP and is based on the bioluminescent measurement of the remaining ATP present in the wells after the kinase reaction. The bioluminescent signal of PKLight Assay is inversely proportional to kinase activity. Phosphorylation of Retinoblastoma or H1 was measured by incubating for 10 min at room temperature 20 Î¼l of immunoprecipitation product for the kinase of interest (see previous section) with 1 mM ATP, kinase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and 5 mg/ml Retinoblastoma or H1 as substrate. 10 Î¼l of kinase stop solution was added to each sample at room temperature for 10 min. Finally, 20 Î¼l of ATP detection reagent was added to each sample at room temperature for 10 min, and the readings were taken using a luminometer. The difference in luminometer reading between the no antibody control and immunoprecipitation product containing the antibody was calculated. This figure, which is indicative of remaining ATP in the solution, was inversely correlated to the kinase activity.

The reaction was incubated at 30Â°C for 30 min, and 50 Î¼l of stop solution was added to stop the reaction. Fluorescence signal was measured using excitation/emission = 485 nm/538 nm. As a negative control, samples without phosphatase activity (distilled water) were used. The difference in fluorescence readings between the immunoprecipitation product and no antibody control was calculated to deduct background phosphatase activity.

Approximately 10<sup>6</sup> hESCs were injected into the testis of adult male SCID mice. After 70â90 d, mice were killed, and tissues were dissected, fixed in Bouins overnight, processed, and sectioned according to standard procedures and stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or Weiger's stain. Material for immunohistochemical analysis was fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland, Inc.) overnight, processed, and sectioned to 6 Î¼m according to standard procedures. Sections were cleared using Histoclear (RA Lamb) and rehydrated, and endogenous hydrogen peroxide activity was blocked. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving (800 W) tissues in 10 mM of citrate buffer, pH 6 (citric acid [Sigma-Aldrich] and distilled H<sub>2</sub>O). Endogenous avidin/biotin activity was blocked using a blocking kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections were permeabilized (1% Triton X-100 [Thermo Fisher Scientific] and PBS solution) and blocked (5% normal goat serum [Invitrogen], 0.1% Triton X-100, and PBS), and sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies: AFP (1:100; Sigma-Aldrich), nestin (1:200; Millipore), and SMA (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich). Negative controls were performed with the omission of the primary antibody. A universal ABC detection kit (Vector Laboratories) with a purple-colored Vector VIP substrate (Vector Laboratories) was used to detect the primary antibodies. Sections were briefly counterstained using Mayer's hemalum and briefly blued using 4% alkaline alcohol (4% ammonia [Thermo Fisher Scientific] in 70% alcohol). Sections were dehydrated through a series of alcohols, cleared using Histoclear, and mounted using distyrene/plasticizer/xylene (RA Lamb).</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy</title><p>Teratoma sections were visualized using a microscope (Diaphot 300; Nikon) with the following objectives: 4Ã NA 0.13, 10Ã NA 0.25, 20Ã NA 0.40, and 40Ã NA 1.3.
