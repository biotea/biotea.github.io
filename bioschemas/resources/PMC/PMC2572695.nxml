      <abstract>
        <p>The protein product of the ocular albinism type 1 gene, named OA1, is a pigment cell-specific G protein-coupled receptor exclusively localized to intracellular organelles, namely lysosomes and melanosomes. Loss of OA1 function leads to the formation of macromelanosomes, suggesting that this receptor is implicated in organelle biogenesis, however the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of the disease remains obscure. We report here the identification of an unexpected abnormality in melanosome distribution both in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and skin melanocytes of <italic>Oa1</italic>-knock-out (KO) mice, consisting in a displacement of the organelles from the central cytoplasm towards the cell periphery. Despite their depletion from the microtubule (MT)-enriched perinuclear region, <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO melanosomes were able to aggregate at the centrosome upon disruption of the actin cytoskeleton or expression of a dominant-negative construct of myosin Va. Consistently, quantification of organelle transport in living cells revealed that <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO melanosomes displayed a severe reduction in MT-based motility; however, this defect was rescued to normal following inhibition of actin-dependent capture at the cell periphery. Together, these data point to a defective regulation of organelle transport in the absence of OA1 and imply that the cytoskeleton might represent a downstream effector of this receptor. Furthermore, our results enlighten a novel function for OA1 in pigment cells and suggest that ocular albinism type 1 might result from a different pathogenetic mechanism than previously thought, based on an organelle-autonomous signalling pathway implicated in the regulation of both membrane traffic and transport.</p>

  <body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In mammals, pigmentation of the skin, hair and eyes results from the presence and distribution of melanins. These black-brown and yellow-red pigments are synthesized by specialized pigment cells, including skin melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), within dedicated intracellular organelles, named melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C1">1</xref>). Melanosomes are commonly classified as lysosome-related organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C3">3</xref>); however, they differ from lysosomes and are distinct from the canonical endocytic pathway, displaying unique structural and functional features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C4">4</xref>). Melanosomes are thought to originate from endosomal precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C5">5</xref>) and subsequently undergo a series of maturation stages, each characterized by typical ultrastructural morphology and melanin content: stage II and III correspond to non-pigmented and partially pigmented immature melanosomes, respectively, and stage IV to fully melanized mature organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C7">7</xref>).</p><p>Pigmented melanosomes move from the perinuclear region towards the cell periphery, from where they are eventually transferred to surrounding keratinocytes in the skin. The transport process is dependent both on microtubules (MTs), by means of kinesin and dynein motors, and on actin filaments (AFs), by means of a tripartite complex comprising the monomeric GTPase Rab27a, its effector melanophilin, and the actin-based motor myosin Va in melanocytes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C8">8</xref>), or Rab27a, MyRIP and myosin VIIa in RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C10">10</xref>). Studies in mammalian melanocytes and in the related fish and frog melanophores have revealed that these two cytoskeletal systems regulate the distribution of melanosomes by generating opposite and competitive forces, as in a âtug of warâ, in which MTs promote perinuclear accumulation and AFs support peripheral dispersal of the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C11">11</xref>). Accordingly, MT depolymerization or dynein down-regulation result in centrifugal AF-dependent displacement of melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C13">13</xref>), while disruption of actin-based motility by drugs or inactivation of the Rab27a/melanophilin/myosin Va complex causes centripetal MT-dependent redistribution of the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C14">14</xref>). Similarly, in the absence of a functional Rab27a/MyRIP/myosin VIIa complex, melanosomes redistribute from the actin-rich apical region of RPE cells to the MT-filled cell body, indicating that melanosome movement and distribution in the retina and skin melanocytes are regulated by a conserved mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C16">16</xref>).</p><p>Inherited defects of melanogenesis in humans comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases, collectively defined as albinism, and characterized by variable hypopigmentation of the skin and severe developmental defects of the eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C17">17</xref>). Ocular albinism type 1 (OA1; MIM 300500) represents the most common form of ocular albinism and is transmitted as an X-linked trait, with affected males exhibiting severe reduction of visual acuity, nystagmus, strabismus, photophobia, iris translucency, hypopigmentation of the retina, foveal hypoplasia and misrouting of the optic tracts, resulting in loss of stereoscopic vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C17">17</xref>). Cutaneus changes are usually mild or absent in ocular albinism. Nevertheless, the histopathological examination of the skin may be useful in the diagnosis of the disease, due to the typical occurrence of giant melanosomes (macromelanosomes) both in RPE and skin melanocytes of affected patients, suggesting that ocular albinism is in fact an oculocutaneus disorder of melanosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C18">18</xref>).</p><p>The protein product of the human <italic>OA1</italic> and mouse <italic>Oa1</italic> genes, named OA1 (also known as GPR143), is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is exclusively expressed by melanocytes and RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C20">20</xref>) and shares structural and functional similarities with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In fact, OA1 shows seven transmembrane domains and homologies with members of the GPCR superfamily, including residues highly conserved in most GPCRs, some of which are the site of albinism-causing mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C23">23</xref>). Furthermore, OA1 binds heterotrimeric Gi, Go and Gq proteins, as revealed by coimmunoprecipitation and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays, and co-localizes with Gi proteins in normal human melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C21">21</xref>). Finally, OA1 was found to interact with a yeast/mammalian G protein chimera in a yeast-based signalling assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C24">24</xref>), and to efficiently activate heterotrimeric G proteins and bind the GPCR-adaptors arrestins in a mammalian expression system, thus behaving as a bona fide GPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C25">25</xref>).</p><p>However, unlike canonical GPCRs, OA1 is not localized to the cell surface, but is exclusively detectable on the membrane of intracellular organelles, namely late-endosomes/lysosomes and melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C21">21</xref>). In addition, we recently identified two separate sorting signals that are both necessary and sufficient for the intracellular localization of OA1 in melanocytic and non-melanocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C26">26</xref>). These findings support the idea that OA1 is a resident GPCR of lysosomes and melanosomes, and that, according with its established topological orientation with the C-terminus towards the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C23">23</xref>), a putative ligand should exist within the organelle lumen. The downstream pathway triggered by OA1 remains mysterious and can only be hypothesized based on the presence of macromelanosomes resulting from loss-of-function of the receptor in human patients, as well as in a mouse model of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C27">27</xref>), suggesting a defect in organelle biogenesis.</p><p>Although the eyes appear more severely affected than the skin in ocular albinism, the RPE represents a difficult system to study melanosome biogenesis, due to the short prenatal time window of melanogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, and to the poor melanogenic ability of cultured cells from post-natal eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C28">28</xref>). In contrast, skin melanocytes are highly and continuously active in melanosome production both <italic>in vivo</italic> and in culture, and melanocyte cell lines have been extensively used to uncover pathways leading to organelle morphogenesis in pigment cells. Therefore, in order to unravel the role of OA1 in melanosome biogenesis, we coupled the examination of <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO RPE at early developmental stages <italic>in vivo</italic> with the generation and analysis of <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO melanocyte cultures. Our results indicate that OA1 regulates not only the biogenesis, but also the motility of melanosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Oa1</italic>-KO RPE displays abnormal distribution of melanosomes towards the apical surface</title><p>Our previous studies of RPE from <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO mice have shown that the cytological abnormalities typically observed in ocular albinism, namely reduced number and increased size of mature melanosomes, are first observed at or after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C29">29</xref>). However, the anomalies of the visual system leading to optic misrouting manifest at earlier developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C30">30</xref>). We reasoned that embryonic <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO RPE might display subtle melanosomal abnormalities that remained undetected, since extensive quantitative analyses at prenatal stages have never been carried out. Therefore, we performed an ultrastructural evaluation of mouse retinas collected from wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO mice at embryonic (E) days 15.5, 18.5 and at birth (post-natal day 0, P0). At these stages, which precede the formation of macromelanosomes, mature melanosomes are sufficiently abundant in both wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO RPE, allowing a statistically relevant comparison of organelle size, density and distribution. The results of this analysis are shown in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="DDN241F1" position="float"><label>FigureÂ 1.</label><caption><p>Melanosomes are more concentrated towards the apical surface in <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO RPE.

This distinction presumably depends on the different distribution of MTs, concentrated in the central cytoplasm and responsible for fast long-range bidirectional movements, relative to AFs, predominant at the cell periphery and responsible for local short-range movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C33">33</xref>). However, in wild-type melanocytes the organelles showed a definitively higher motility compared with <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO cells, particularly in the perinuclear region, but also towards the periphery (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F7">7</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn241/DC1">Supplementary Material, Movies 1â4</ext-link>). Nocodazole treatment lead to a general paralysis of melanosome movements in all cell lines (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F7">7</xref>), suggesting that most appreciable movements are in fact MT-dependent. Conversely, pEGFP-MC-LT transfection or cytochalasin D treatment resulted into a similarly intense organelle motility throughout the cytoplasm in both wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F7">7</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn241/DC1">Supplementary Material, Movies 5 and 6</ext-link>, and not shown). Similar results were obtained in transduced cell lines (not shown).</p><p>To quantify these observations, we performed organelle tracking studies. Given the gradient of motility from the central region to the periphery of cells in untreated conditions, we made a distinction between the organelles localized close to the nucleus and those at some distance (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F7">7</xref>; see Materials and Methods for further details). In addition, since <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>LOA1Î18SN melanocytes often display a considerable heterogeneity in melanosome dimensions, and this physical variable could influence organelle motility, we compared melanosomes of equivalent size in wild-type versus <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient lines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn241/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4 and Table S1</ext-link>; see Materials and Methods for further details). FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F8">8</xref> shows the quantification of results obtained in various conditions. To define the characteristics of MT and AF-dependent movements in our system, we first pooled all melanosome steps obtained from <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> melanocytes, either untreated or following various treatments, and binned them in three increasing speed intervals: 0.0â0.2, 0.2â0.4 and â¥0.4 Î¼m/s (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F8">8</xref>A, white, light grey and dark grey bars, respectively).</p><fig id="DDN241F8" position="float"><label>FigureÂ 8.</label><caption><p>Quantification of melanosome motility in wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO melanocytes.

Compared with their wild-type counterpart, <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient melanocytes show a significantly reduced average displacement in untreated conditions, while they completely recover upon pEGFP-MC-LT transfection, or cytochalasin D treatment. Transduced lines showed poor motility at the cell periphery (possibly due to the drug treatment necessary for maintenance of the transgenes), so differences were only appreciable in the perinuclear area. *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.004, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.00001 (unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test assuming equal variances).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddn24108"/></fig><p>In untreated <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> melanocytes, organelle tracking within the perinuclear area (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F8">8</xref>A, NT in) resulted in 55% of steps corresponding to pauses or slow movements under 0.2 Î¼m/s, 38% of steps corresponding to movements between 0.2 and 0.4 Î¼m/s, and the remaining 7% of steps corresponding to faster movements. Consistent with a progressive depletion of MTs towards the cell periphery, organelle tracking outside the perinuclear area (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F8">8</xref>A, NT out) resulted in a reduction of melanosome motility, which was further decreased upon nocodazole treatment (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F8">8</xref>A, Nocodazole). In the latter condition, we observed an almost complete disappearance of steps corresponding to fast speeds â¥0.4 Î¼m/s, suggesting that they actually reflect true MT-dependent motility. In contrast, in pEGFP-MC-LT-transfected or cytochalasin D-treated <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> cells, melanosome motility was recovered to values similar to that displayed by perinuclear organelles in untreated melanocytes (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F8">8</xref>A, EGFP-MC-LT and Cyto D). When <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> melanocytes were subjected to similar analysis, an overall lower motility of melanosomes was observed in untreated conditions. In fact, the values obtained within (NT in) and outside (NT out) the perinuclear area in <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells were closely resembling those found outside the perinuclear area (NT out) and upon nocodazole treatment in <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> cells, respectively. However, when AF-based transport was disrupted by pEGFP-MC-LT transfection or cytochalasin D treatment, melanosomes in <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> melanocytes completely recovered their motility to levels comparable to organelles in wild-type cells. Similar results were obtained in <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>LOA1SN versus <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>LOA1Î18SN cells and in untreated <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> versus <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> melanocytes (not shown; analysis of <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> melanocytes upon transfection or drug treatment was not possible due to cell suffering).</p><p>To determine the significance of these findings, we calculated the total paths covered by single melanosomes. Melanosome values for each wild-type line were averaged and compared with those obtained from the respective <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient counterpart (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F8">8</xref>B). In untreated conditions, <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>LOA1Î18SN melanocytes showed a profound and significant reduction of melanosome motility compared with their wild-type counterparts. These differences could mainly be attributed to MT-based transport, since (i) the higher motility of wild-type melanosomes was easier to appreciate in the MT-enriched perinuclear region (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F8">8</xref>B, compare melanosome paths in untreated conditions in <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> versus <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells and in transduced lines); (ii) fastest movements â¥0.4 Î¼m/s, reflecting MT-dependent motility, were more represented in wild-type than <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient melanocytes (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F8">8</xref>A) and (iii) the contribution of AFs to melanosome paths appeared negligible, since the average displacement calculated upon nocodazole treatment was 1.5â3.0 Âµm/90 s in all cell lines (not shown).</p><p>When the same analysis was conducted considering only melanosomes showing fast movements (â¥0.4 Î¼m/s), which represent a greater fraction in wild-type (54â91%, depending on cell line and distance from nucleus) than <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient melanocytes (16â61%), differences were partially levelled (data not shown). These findings suggest that the main defect in <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient melanocytes consists in a lower frequency (rather than velocity) of MT-based movements. However, in the absence of actin-based transport, <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient melanosomes not only redistributed at the cell centre as in wild-type cells, but also showed equivalent motility on MTs. In fact, upon pEGFP-MC-LT transfection or cytochalasin D treatment differences were basically abolished, with melanosomes in <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient cells showing a recovery of motility equivalent to that observed in the perinuclear area of wild-type cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F8">8</xref>B). Finally, we evaluated whether <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient melanosomes move towards the cell centre or the periphery at different rates compared with wild-type organelles. The ratio between centrifugal and centripetal displacement was determined for single melanosomes and values for each wild-type line were averaged and compared with those obtained from the respective <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient counterpart. No significant differences were found between wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient cells, either at steady-state or following AF disruption (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn241/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S5</ext-link>), suggesting that OA1 might not affect the balance between kinesin and dynein motors. From these data we conclude that in the absence of OA1 function melanosomes move less efficiently and especially less frequently on the tubulin cytoskeleton, however, this deficiency is not intrinsic of the MT-based transport system and manifests exclusively in the presence of intact actin-based transport.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The histological hallmark of ocular albinism is the presence of macromelanosomes in pigment cells of the skin and eyes, suggesting a defect in melanosome biogenesis. However, the process leading to macromelanosome formation and the actual role of the giant organelles in the pathogenesis of the disease remain unclear. In fact, the macromelanosomal phenotype displays variable expressivity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C35">35</xref>) and, at least in the mouse, manifests during development subsequent to optic misrouting, implying that it might represent only an epiphenomenon of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C27">27</xref>). In the search for the primary role of OA1 in ocular albinism, we identified an abnormally skewed distribution of melanosomes towards the apical pole of the RPE in <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO mice at embryonic stages preceding the formation of macromelanosomes and the reduction of organelle number. An equivalent abnormality was replicated in melanocyte cultures obtained from the skin of <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO mice. In fact, <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO melanocytes showed not only abnormal size, but also abnormal distribution melanosomes, with depletion of the organelles from the perinuclear area and accumulation towards the cell periphery. Despite their exclusion from the central cytoplasm at steady-state, <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO melanosomes were able to aggregate at the centrosome upon disruption of the actin cytoskeleton or expression of a dominant-negative construct for myosin Va. Finally, melanosome tracking analyses revealed a significant reduction of MT-based motility exclusively in the presence of intact AF-mediated transport, consistent with the idea that OA1 might regulate the dynamic equilibrium between the two cytoskeletal systems. These results were independent on the physical size of melanosomes, thus revealing a novel function for OA1 in organelle transport that might be of relevance for the disease pathogenesis.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>OA1 regulates melanosome transport on MTs</title><p>Both in melanophores and mammalian melanocytes, the distribution of melanosomes results from the dynamic balance between AF-based and MT-based transport. In fish or frog melanophores, the switch between these two transport systems is believed to depend on signalling events, including cAMP and protein kinases, that direct the coordinated dispersion or aggregation of melanosomes in response to extracellular stimuli and result in colour adaptation (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C36">36</xref>). In contrast, in mammalian melanocytes, melanosome transport is associated with melanogenesis and is thought to proceed mostly in a perinuclear to centrifugal route, adapted to ensure the peripheral accumulation of mature melanosomes prior to keratinocyte transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C7">7</xref>). In this context, locally operating signalling mechanisms would allow the organelles to move independently of one another, perhaps depending on their maturation stage. The observation that not all melanosomes are redistributed in <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells upon transient expression of OA1 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F4">4</xref>A) suggests that OA1 does not function through diffuse cytosolic signalling, but rather in an organelle autonomous fashion.</p><p>In the competition between the actin and tubulin cytoskeletal systems, OA1 seems to facilitate the functional interaction of pigmented melanosomes with MTs, which could determine by itself the accumulation of organelles in the perinuclear area. In fact, when actin-mediated capture at the cell periphery is down-regulated, melanosomes typically redistribute according to MT density and therefore in the central cytoplasm where the bulk of tubulin filaments reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C31">31</xref>). Based on our data and because of the âtug of warâ between the two transport systems involved, we cannot distinguish if stimulation of MT-based transport is a direct effect of OA1 activity, or the indirect result of inhibition of actin-based transport. OA1 might act by tethering melanosomes to tubulin filaments, thereby stabilizing the productive association between cargo and cytoskeletal route, as hypothesized for the dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C37">37</xref>). Alternatively, OA1 could counteract the capture of melanosomes by the AF system and as a consequence enhance the frequency by which the organelles move along MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C31">31</xref>), while in the absence of OA1 melanosome entrapment by the actin network at the cell periphery would prevail.</p><p>The exact molecular mechanism by which OA1 accomplishes its effects on transport remains unclear. Our analyses indicate a normal ability of <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO melanosomes not only to move on MTs, but apparently also to recruit the Rab27a/melanophilin/myosin Va tripartite complex responsible for actin-mediated capture, suggesting that the receptor might play a regulatoryârather than structuralârole in the concerted effort of MT and AF-based motors required for proper organelle distribution. Switching between MT and AF-based systems is regulated by cytoplasmic cAMP levels in fish and frog melanophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C39">39</xref>). Furthermore, in the same animal models, melanosome-associated MAP kinase has been shown to regulate organelle transport on MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C40">40</xref>). Since OA1 appears to couple with GÎ±i in melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C21">21</xref>), it is possible that it regulates the local concentration of the second messenger, thereby using an equivalent signalling mechanism at the single organelle level. Alternatively, OA1 might contribute to the recruitment of signalling complexes on the melanosomal membrane, including specific adaptors or kinases involved in transport. Consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> motility studies, we found that OA1 interacts efficiently with tubulin in co-immunoprecipitation assays (M.V.S. and P.B., unpublished observations), suggesting that MTs represent a downstream effector of the receptor. However, the same immunoprecipitates did not contain any molecular motors or regulators known to direct the movement of melanosomes along MTs, such as dynectin, dynein and conventional kinesin (M.V.S. and P.B., unpublished data). Therefore, the role of this interaction in melanosome motility remains to be established, and further studies will be necessary to define the signal transduction pathway triggered by OA1 and its downstream effectors at the melanosomal membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>OA1 plays a role in both melanosome biogenesis and transport</title><p>Organelle biogenesis and transport are tightly interconnected processes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C42">42</xref>) and the same protein regulators, as the Rab GTPases, can control both pathways through the assembly of multiprotein complexes on specific subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C44">44</xref>). Our findings with the intracellular GPCR OA1 now add another class of GTPases to the list of regulators of organelle biogenesis and transport, namely heterotrimeric G proteins, which are best known as plasma membrane transducers, but have also been implicated in various membrane trafficking events in the endomembrane system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C45">45</xref>). Does OA1 regulate melanosome biogenesis and transport independently, or one as consequence of the other? The abnormal melanosome distribution in <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO RPE at stages preceding the appearance of giant organelles and the defective motility of normal size melanosomes in <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO melanocytes, as well as the apparently normal ability of <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient melanosomes to recruit the myosin Va tail domainâsuggesting proper enrolment of the overall tripartite complex on fully mature organellesâimply that regulation of melanosome transport might represent an independent role played by OA1 in pigment cells. Nevertheless, given the lack of morphogenetic defects at immature melanosomal stages and the variability of the macromelanosomal phenotype, it is also possible that the primary defect in ocular albinism lies in organelle motility, which secondarily leads to aberrant biogenesis. For instance, as a melanosomal GPCR, OA1 might be sensitive to the maturation stage of the organelles and transduce this information to the cytosol by triggering a signalling cascade to retain pigmented, yet incompletely developed, organelles on MTs for full maturation. In the absence of OA1, melanosomes might be prematurely transported to the cell periphery and become susceptible to abnormal fusion events, giving rise to macromelanosomes, especially in cells highly active in membrane remodelling and disposal such as the RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C46">46</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title><italic>OA1</italic> shares genomic localization and functional features with <italic>SHROOM2/APXL</italic></title><p>A combined defect in melanosome distribution and maturation, somewhat reminiscent of OA1 loss-of-function, has been recently reported in the RPE of <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos lacking <italic>SHROOM2/APXL</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C47">47</xref>), supporting the idea that melanosome biogenesis and transport are tightly bound processes.

Seabra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C55">55</xref>). For transient transfections, melanocytes were plated on 13-mm glass coverslips, transfected using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche) and analysed 24â72 h post-transfection. For stable transduction, retroviruses were produced in Phoenix Eco packaging cells, following the Nolan Lab protocol (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/protocols/pro_helper_dep.html">http://www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/protocols/pro_helper_dep.html</uri>). Phoenix cells were transfected at 70% of confluence with LOA1SN and LOA1Î18SN retroviral vectors using FuGENE 6 in a 10-cm plate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was changed and the retroviral supernatant collected after additional 24 h. After centrifugation and filtration to eliminate cell debris, the retroviral supernatant was either frozen at â80Â°C or supplemented with polybrene (Sigma) at 8 Î¼g/ml and used for melanocyte infection. The day before infection, melanocytes were seeded in 6-cm plates at 30â40% of confluence and the following day incubated with 4 ml of retroviral supernatant/polybrene mix for 4 h. Seventy-two hours post-infection, cells were selected as a polyclonal population with 700 Âµg/ml of G418 (Sigma), which was maintained thereafter in order to avoid loss of retroviral integration.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Immunofluorescence analysis</title><p>Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C26">26</xref>), using the following primary antibodies: W7 anti-OA1, rabbit anti-human OA1 polyclonal antiserum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C19">19</xref>); anti-Î²-tubulin, mouse anti-Î²-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Boheringer); anti-giantin, rabbit anti-giantin polyclonal antiserum (a gift of Dr A. De Matteis). Secondary antibodies were Cy3/Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackons ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For staining of AFs, rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was used. For nuclear staining, Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) at 100 ng/ml was used for 5 min prior to mounting. Coverslips were mounted using Mowiol 4â88 reagent (Calbiochem) and viewed with a PlanApochromat 63Ã n.a. 1.4 oil objective on an epifluorescence Axiophot microscope (Zeiss). Images were acquired with a C4742-95 CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) using HiPic32 software (Hamamatsu Photonics) and processed with Photoshop (Adobe). pEGFP-MC-LT-transfected cells typically showed a punctuated and ring-like staining superimposed to a diffuse signal. At short expression times (24 h), the ring-like staining was often spread all over the cell and was clearly surrounding black melanosomes, whereas at longer expression times most of the staining was concentrated in the perinuclear region together with black melanosomes. Conversely, pEGFP-BR-LT-transfected cells displayed at any time a punctuated staining superimposed to a diffuse signal, with an evident accumulation of fluorescence at the MT organizing centre and only occasional co-localization with black melanosomes, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C32">32</xref>). Quantification of melanosome redistribution following pEGFP-MC-LT transfection was performed by calculating in each experiment the percent of transfected cells (visualized by means of the EGFP fluorescence), showing a <italic>dilute</italic>-like phenotype (pronounced accumulation of melanosomes in the central cytoplasm). A small percent of cells with an abnormally round or dendritic morphology, indicating cell suffering, was excluded from the counts. Since melanosome aggregation can sometimes result from transfection-dependent cell suffering (â¼5% of <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> cells transfected with pEGFP-BR-LT or pEGFP alone showed a <italic>dilute</italic>-like phenotype), normalization for pEGFP-MC-LT-specific effects was obtained by subtracting in each experiment the percent of aggregation observed in twin coverslips transfected with the brain-specific pEGFP-BR-LT construct. Quantitative immunofluorescence analysis of the co-localization between the EGFP-MC-LT fusion protein and pigment granules was performed on digital micrographs of cells displaying a bright ring-like pattern of the fusion protein, before the appearance of a full <italic>dilute</italic>-like phenotype (typically 24 h of expression). Distinct black melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C30">30</xref>) were randomly marked throughout the cytoplasm of individual cells, with the exception of areas overcrowded with organelles (perinuclear areas, tips of dendrites, areas under the plasma membrane), and their co-localization with EGFP-MC-LT was assessed. EGFP-MC-LT staining was considered as co-localizing with melanosomes when (i) forming a complete or partial ring surrounding single melanosomes, and (ii) appearing as a clear and distinct spot superimposed to isolated melanosomes. More selective co-localization criteria, i.e. considering only the ring-like pattern of EGFP-MC-LT staining, led to a reduction in the co-localization percentage (45â50%), however, no differences were found between wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient cells. In addition, although in these counts both giant and normal size melanosomes were considered, exclusion of the giant organelles did not lead to differences between wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient cells. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel software.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Live cell imaging</title><p>Mouse melanocytes grown on 24-mm glass coverslips were transferred to round adaptors (OKO-lab) with 2 ml of medium supplemented with 25 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, pH 7.4, and placed on a heated stage at 37Â°C, to be observed in bright field either with a PlanApochromat 63Ã n.a. 1.4 oil objective (Zeiss) on an Axiovert S100 TV2 microscope (Zeiss), or with a 60Ã n.a. 1.4 oil objective (Olympus) on a Olympus IX70 microscope (DeltaVision System, Applied Precision). Each coverslip was analysed for a total time not exceeding 1 h to ensure properly buffered conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C33">33</xref>). Cells treated with cytochalasin D and nocodazole were incubated with the drugs 30 min prior to observations and recorded up to 1 h from the beginning of the treatment. Cells expressing pEGFP-MC-LT were analyzed 24 h post-transfection by choosing among the EGFP-positive cells those showing an already evident <italic>dilute</italic>-like phenotype. Images were recorded with a ORCA II CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics), using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics), or with a CoolSNAP CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Photometrics), using softWoRx 3.5 software (Applied Precision). Each wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient line to be compared were acquired in the same conditions on the same day. ImageJ (plugin âManual trackingâ) from NIH Image (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</uri>) was used to track the melanosome paths. All data collected were transferred and elaborated in an Excel worksheet (Microsoft). A number of 50â100 distinct melanosomes were chosen randomly in comparable areas of the cytoplasm of 5â12 different <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> or <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells from two independent experiments, and individual movements (or steps) were calculated as the displacement between successive frames (resulting in 179 steps per organelle). Similarly, 40â50 distinct melanosomes were analyzed from five different <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells, or <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>LOA1SN or <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>LOA1Î18SN cells. In untreated conditions, melanosomes were selected based on their position in the first frame within or outside of the perinuclear area, defined as the cytoplasm within a 15-Âµm-radius circle around the nucleus and corresponding to the MT-enriched region in most cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F5">5</xref>A, white circles). In other conditions, melanosome motility was quite uniform throughout the cytoplasm and organelles were chosen mostly out of the perinuclear area, which is inconveniently thick and crowded, particularly upon cytochalasin D treatment or pEGFP-MC-LT expression. Movement direction was calculated relative to the centroid position of the nucleus, or of the melanosome aggregate in pEGFP-MC-LT-transfected cells. Some heterogeneity in melanosome size was present both in wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient lines, however, this variability was definitively more pronounced in the latter, with melanosomes showing various dimensions from normal (â¼1 Âµm or less) to clearly giant (2â3 Âµm). In initial trials, despite the tracking of giant melanosomes was always avoided, random sampling of organelles of normal and apparently similar size resulted in the selection of melanosomes with slightly, yet significantly, bigger average diameters in <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient lines compared with their wild-type counterparts (wild-type organelles were in average 1.5â2 pixels smaller, corresponding to â¼0.15â0.2 Âµm). Since this physical variable had an effect on the frequency of fast movements (data not shown), we established a size range for melanosomes to be analysed, corresponding to 7â9 Â± 1 pixels in the digital movie acquisitions (corresponding to â¼0.7â0.9 Â± 0.1 Âµm), for both major and minor diameters. The sizes of all tracked melanosomes, chosen within the allowed range, were precisely determined by two independent investigators by considering as the melanosome margins the more external series of pixels clearly distinct from the surrounding background and extending for at least half of the organelle shape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn241/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>). The dimensions of organelles obtained from each wild-type cell line and its <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient counterpart were compared to exclude statistically significant differences. The average major and minor diameters and Student's <italic>t</italic>-test values of melanosomes analysed for each wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-deficient line in the different conditions are reported in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn241/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Cell culture monolayers were fixed for 15 min at 4Â°C with 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 125 m<sc>m</sc> phosphate buffer. The monolayers were detached by rubber and centrifuged at high speed. The pellet was post-fixed for 1 h with OsO<sub>4</sub> in 125 m<sc>M</sc> phosphate buffer, washed, and embedded in Epon. Conventional thin sections were collected on uncoated grids, stained with uranyl and lead citrate, and acquired by a CCD camera-equipped Leo912ab electron microscope and AnalySIS software (Soft Imaging System). Electron microscopy analysis of mouse retinas was performed on comparable regions of the eyes from wild-type and <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO mice belonging to the same litter and sacrificed at the same time, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN241C29">29</xref>). For quantification of melanosome distribution, rectangular areas of RPE, corresponding to few cells and delimited by the apical and basal membranes, were divided transversely into apical zone (corresponding to one-third of the total area) and cell body (corresponding to the remaining two thirds), and the organelles contained within were counted. In case of slight irregularities of the apical membrane, as in the <italic>Oa1</italic>-KO section shown in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN241F1">1</xref>A, the external limit of the apical region was placed at an intermediate position and the RPE cytoplasm that remained excluded was calculated to compensate gaps in the area of the apical zone under consideration. All quantitative analyses on organelle size, density and distribution were performed considering mature melanosomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn241/DC1">Supplementary Material is available at <italic>HMG</italic> Online</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>FUNDING</title><p>The financial support of the <grant-sponsor>Vision of Children Foundation, San Diego-CA</grant-sponsor> (to M.V.S.), the <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor><!-- oupReleaseDelayRemoved from OA Article (12|0) -->/<grant-sponsor>National Eye Institute</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>EY014540</grant-num> to M.V.S.); <grant-sponsor>Telethon-Italy</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>F.3</grant-num> to M.V.S.) and <grant-sponsor>Wellcome Trust</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>078327/Z/05</grant-num> to DCB) is gratefully acknowledged.</p></sec>
