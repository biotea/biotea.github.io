      <abstract>
        <p>Diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase activity is required for axonal growth during development and for retrograde synaptic signaling at mature synapses. This enzyme synthesizes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), and the CB1 cannabinoid receptor is also required for the above responses. We now report on the cloning and enzymatic characterization of the first specific <italic>sn</italic>-1 DAG lipases. Two closely related genes have been identified and their expression in cells correlated with 2-AG biosynthesis and release. The expression of both enzymes changes from axonal tracts in the embryo to dendritic fields in the adult, and this correlates with the developmental change in requirement for 2-AG synthesis from the pre- to the postsynaptic compartment. This switch provides a possible explanation for a fundamental change in endocannabinoid function during brain development. Identification of these enzymes may offer new therapeutic opportunities for a wide range of disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The identification of the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, activated by the principal psychoactive component of <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic>, suggests that one or more enzymes synthesize endogenous ligands for these receptors (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Pertwee, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Di Marzo et al., 1998</xref>). An as yet unidentified <italic>sn</italic>-1âspecific DAG lipase (DAGL) can catalyze the hydrolysis of DAG to 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), the most abundant endocannabinoid in tissues (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Mechoulam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Sugiura et al., 1995</xref>). In the developing brain, pharmacological studies suggest that DAGL activity is required for axonal growth and guidance (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brittis et al., 1996</xref>), with the 2-AG being synthesized and activating CB1 receptors in the same âpresynapticâ axonal growth cone (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). However, in the adult brain there is a specific postsynaptic requirement for the synthesis of one or more endocannabinoids that act as retrograde messengers on presynaptic CB1 receptors to suppress further transmitter release at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Nicoll, 2002</xref>). A full elucidation of endocannabinoid signaling in the developing and adult brain clearly requires the identification and characterization of the brain DAGLs.</p>

        <p>When the sequence of a <italic>Penicillium</italic> DAGL (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi et al., 1991</xref>) is âblastedâ against the human genome, two related genes (designated Î± and Î²) are identified as the only homologues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). The encoded gene products are 1,042 (Î±) and 672 (Î²) amino acids in length and show extensive homology throughout, but differ in the length of the sequence that follows the catalytic domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). Both proteins contain a lipase-3 motif and a serine lipase motif, and they are predicted to have four transmembrane-spanning domains with the catalytic domain and amino terminus inside of the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). The genes are found in a wide range of species (e.g., chickens, zebrafish, and mice) with a high degree of conservation between man and mouse (97% identity for Î± and 79% for Î²; unpublished data).</p>

        <title>Enzymatic characterization of the novel genes</title>
        <p>Transfection of the two novel genes in COS cells led to the expression of products with appropriate molecular mass (â¼70 kD for the Î² gene and â¼120 kD for the Î± gene) with protein expression localized to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, b and c</xref>). COS cells expressing the highest levels of the gene products (clones 12Î± and 15Î²) were selected for enzymatic characterization with a clone that expressed no detectable transgene taken as a control (clone 7Î²; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> b). When using <italic>sn</italic>-1-stearoyl-2-[<sup>14</sup>C]arachidonoyl-glycerol as a substrate, and measuring the 2-[<sup>14</sup>C]AG released, we confirmed that both enzymes are mostly expressed in the 10,000 <italic>g</italic> membrane fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> a), exhibit optimal activity at pH 7 (not depicted), and follow MichaelisâMenten kinetics, with K<sub>m</sub> values in the range of the possible concentrations of DAGs in animal tissues (154.7 Â± 19.1 and 74.1 Â± 4.9 Î¼M for the Î± and Î² form, respectively; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> b). Both enzymes exhibit very little, if any, monoacylglycerol lipase, phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>2</sub>, triacylglycerol lipase, and anandamide amidase activity (unpublished data). To investigate their substrate selectivity, three types of radiolabeled DAG substrates were synthesized. A three- to eightfold selectivity for the <italic>sn</italic>-1 over the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position of DAGs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> c) was demonstrated by comparing the rate of the formation of [<sup>14</sup>C]oleic acid and <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-glycerol from <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol; or by comparing the rate of the formation of mono[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-glycerol from either <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol or <italic>sn</italic>-1-oleoyl-2-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-glycerol. The similar activities of the enzymes observed when using as substrates either <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether, which cannot be hydrolyzed on the 2 position, or <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-2-arachidonoyl glycerol, further demonstrates that the two lipases are selective for the <italic>sn</italic>-1 position of DAGs. Of the two enzymes, the Î² form appears to prefer <italic>sn</italic>-1-oleoyl-2 acyl-glycerols with linoleic â¥ oleic &gt; arachidonic &gt; stearic acid on the 2 position, whereas the Î± form appears to work equally well with all fatty acids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> d and not depicted). Both enzymes are equally sensitive to Ser/Cys-hydrolase inhibitors such as <italic>p</italic>-hydroxy-mercuri-benzoate and HgCl<sub>2</sub>, but not to PMSF. Importantly, both enzymes are inhibited by RHC80267, a drug that blocks 2-AG formation from intact cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bisogno et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Stella et al., 1997</xref>). Glutathione and Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulate both enzymes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> e). Based on homology with other serine lipases, two of the three amino acids that likely constitute the âcatalytic triadâ can readily be identified as serine 443 and aspartic acid 495 in the Î² form of the enzyme (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). Accordingly, substitution of the serine (clone 11-11Î²) or aspartic acid (clone 3-9Î²) with alanines abolished enzymatic activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> a). Based on these results, we can conclude that the products of the genes are specific <italic>sn</italic>-1-DAGLs; therefore, we designate them as DAGLÎ± and DAGLÎ².</p>

<bold>Enzymatic characterization of the new lipase gene products expressed in COS cells (clones 12Î± and 15Î²).</bold> (a) Subcellular fractionation of the enzymes using <italic>sn</italic>-1-stearoyl-2-[<sup>14</sup>C]arachidonoyl-glycerol as a substrate. Controls included two clones expressing the highest levels of the Î² gene product with single point mutations in Asp 494 to Ala (clone 3-9Î²) and Ser 443 to Ala (clone 11-11Î²). Activity is expressed as fold over the activity in fractions from a clone transfected with the Î² construct that expressed no detectable transgene (clone 7Î², control cells). (b) LineweaverâBurk profiles of the activities in the 10,000 <italic>g</italic> pellets from clones 12Î± and 15Î². Data points were subtracted from the activity found in control cells (clone 7Î²). V<sub>max</sub> values were 33.3 Â± 4.5 and 3.45 Â± 0.16 nmol min<sup>â1</sup> mg protein<sup>â1</sup> for the Î± and Î² form, respectively. (c) Selectivity of the two DAGLs for the <italic>sn</italic>-1 position of DAGs. The rate of formation is shown for: (1) [<sup>14</sup>C]oleic acid (<italic>sn</italic>-1 bars) and <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-glycerol (<italic>sn</italic>-2 bars) from <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol, this indicates <italic>sn</italic>-1 and <italic>sn</italic>-2 selectivity, respectively; (2) mono[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-glycerol from either <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol (<italic>sn</italic>-2 bars) or <italic>sn</italic>-1-oleoyl-2-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-glycerol (<italic>sn</italic>-1 bars), this indicates <italic>sn</italic>-2 and <italic>sn</italic>-1 selectivity, respectively; and (3) [<sup>14</sup>C]oleic acid from either <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether (ether bars), or <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-2-arachidonoyl glycerol (ester bars), this indicates <italic>sn</italic>-1 selectivity, without and with possible interference from <italic>sn</italic>-2 selectivity, respectively. (d) Rate of formation of [<sup>14</sup>C]oleic acid using DAG substrates with different fatty acids on the 2-position. (e) Effect of inhibitors, glutathione (GSH), and calcium on enzyme activity assessed using <italic>sn</italic>-1-[<sup>14</sup>C]oleoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerol as substrate. 1 mM PMSF; 1 mM <italic>p</italic>-hydroxy-mercuri-benzoate (p-HMB); 5 mM HgCl<sub>2</sub>; and 100 Î¼M RHC80267. The concentrations of CaCl<sub>2</sub> in the assay buffer were 1, 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 Î¼M. (f) Formation of 2-AG from intact COS cells (nontransfected or clones 12Î± and 15Î²), stimulated for 20 min with vehicle (DMSO, 0.1%), 4 Î¼M ionomycin, or ionomycin + 1 Î¼M THL after a 5-min preincubation with THL. 2-AG levels were measured in cells plus medium (total) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results are expressed as a percentage of 2-AG formation from vehicle-stimulated cells (12.1 Â± 4.3 pmol/mg extracted lipids). In one set of experiments, the amounts of 2-AG produced after ionomycin stimulation were measured separately in cells and medium, and the percentage of the amount of 2-AG found in the medium (extracellular) is shown. Data are means Â± SEM of <italic>n</italic> â¥ 4. *, P &lt; 0.05, control cells; <sup>#</sup>, P &lt; 0.05, iono only (total), <italic>t</italic> test.</p>

        <p>In agreement with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirement of the novel enzymes, and with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of 2-AG biosynthesis in neurons (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bisogno et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Stella et al., 1997</xref>), ionomycin stimulation of clone 12Î± or 15Î² cells led to the production, and release into the media, of significantly higher amounts of 2-AG than control COS cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> f). A strong correlation between the expression of the novel genes and endogenous DAGL activity was found in a wide range of cell types (e.g., N18TG2 neuroblastoma, C6 glioma, RBL-2H3 basophilic leukemia, human Caco-2, and embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells; unpublished data). More importantly, tetrahydrolipstatin (THL), a second DAGL inhibitor (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1995</xref>), potently inhibited both DAGLÎ± and DAGLÎ² from clone 12Î± and 15Î² cell homogenates (IC<sub>50</sub> = 60 and 100 nM, respectively). THL (5-min preincubation at 1 Î¼M) also decreased the ionomycin-induced release of 2-AG from intact N18TG2, C6, and RBL-2H3 cells (66.7 Â± 5.9, 93.5 Â± 7.3, and 99.2 Â± 10.1% inhibition, respectively; means Â± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 3, P &lt; 0.01), as well as in clone 12Î± (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> f). FGF2 stimulates neurite outgrowth from cerebellar neurons via a pathway that requires DAGL activity to generate 2-AG and the consequent activation of the CB1 receptor (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). THL inhibited the neurite outgrowth stimulated by FGF2 with no effect on the response stimulated by a CB1 agonist or brain-derived neuronotrophic factor (BDNF; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), demonstrating that it is acting specifically, and upstream of the CB1 receptor, in the FGF signaling pathway. Thus, the novel enzymes make and release 2-AG as endocannabinoid, and THL is a useful tool to investigate the cellular function of the two enzymes.</p>

        <title>A switch in enzyme expression from axons to dendrites during development</title>
        <p>The expression of the novel <italic>sn</italic>-1-DAGLs will determine when and where they can make and release 2-AG in the developing and adult brain. In general, antibodies to DAGLÎ± and Î² showed the same qualitative staining pattern, demonstrating that they are normally coexpressed; and similar staining patterns were seen with three independent antisera to DAGLÎ± (unpublished data). We found that all developing axonal tracts examined coexpress the enzymes. For example, in the mouse at embryonic day 10, DAGLÎ± and DAGLÎ² are expressed in axons crossing the floor plate of the spinal cord (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, aâc). At day 14, DAGLÎ² can be seen to specifically label the retinal ganglion fiber tract and also the optic nerve (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> d). A similar, but less pronounced, staining was seen for DAGLÎ± (unpublished data). Remarkably, both enzymes are absent from axonal tracts in the adult mouse brain, with this shown for DAGLÎ± in the optic and anterior commissures in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, e and f</xref>. This contrasted with the very strong staining of both regions with antibodies to the CB1 receptor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, g and h</xref>). In the cerebellum, the highest levels of DAGLÎ± and DAGLÎ² are seen in the dendritic field with staining also apparent in the deep cerebellar nuclei (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, i and j</xref>); however, both enzymes are again absent in the axonal tracts. A high power image of DAGLÎ± expression within the Purkinje cell dendritic field of the cerebellum clearly shows that the enzyme is specifically expressed in the tubular-like structures that characterize the dendritic tree of the Purkinje cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> k). The staining for DAGLÎ² was qualitatively similar but considerably less pronounced than that for DAGLÎ± (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, i and j</xref>), suggesting a substantial down-regulation of the Î² form of the enzyme during development. Given the maintained expression of high levels of DAGLÎ± in the adult nervous system, we assessed the relative level of transcripts for the gene in various adult tissues in the mouse and human by TaqMan RT-PCR. In the mouse, the highest levels of transcripts were found in the nervous system, with barely detectable levels found in the skin, heart, lung, and various other tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), which is in agreement with the highest relative abundance of 2-AG and other 2-acylglycerols in the rodent brain (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Kondo et al., 1998</xref>). In the human, high levels of expression were again found in the brain, relative to most tissues, with high levels also noted in the pancreas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The pancreatic expression is of interest given the established role for DAGL activity in amylase secretion in this tissue (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 1997</xref>).</p>

        <p>In summary, this study is the first to report the identification of specific <italic>sn</italic>-1 DAGLs playing a major role in biosynthesizing the endocannabinoid 2-AG. Expression studies have revealed that although both enzymes are expressed in axonal tracts during development, expression in the adult becomes restricted to synaptic fields. It is also clear that in the adult cerebellum, expression within a synaptic field can be restricted to the dendritic compartment. Therefore, the ability of these enzymes to make and release 2-AG is temporally and spatially regulated in the brain in a manner that correlates well with two of the key functions of the endocannabinoid signaling system. In fact, in the developing embryo, the enzymes are available within a growth cone to make 2-AG able to act in an autocrine way on CB1 receptors to promote axonal growth and guidance (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, in the adult, the enzymes are lost from axonal tracts but remain expressed in synaptic fields. In the case of the cerebellar Purkinje cell, this expression is localized to the postsynaptic dendrite, and this correlates with the postsynaptic requirement for the synthesis of an endocannabinoid as a retrograde messenger for depolarization-induced suppression of excitatory neurotransmission at this synapse (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Diana et al., 2002</xref>). With the identification of the first DAGLs, it will now be possible to test their importance in physiologically relevant endocannabinoid signaling pathways and to evaluate their potential as therapeutic targets. In the latter context, there is a growing interest in 2-AG/CB1 signaling in terms of therapies for a range of conditions including neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Di Marzo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Panikashvili et al., 2001</xref>), obesity (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Di Marzo et al., 2001</xref>), and the extinction of aversive memories (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Marsicano et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

        <p>A full-length clone of the human Î± gene (gi|20521122) was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (KIAA0659), and the mouse Î² gene (gi|16359288) was obtained from I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (4921222). The coding sequence for the Î± gene was amplified by PCR and inserted into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate an expression construct with an in-frame 3â² V5 epitope tag. The coding sequence for the Î² gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pCMV-Tag4A (Stratagene) using the NotI and XhoI restriction sites, in-frame with a 3â² FLAG epitope tag. Single point mutations in the Î² gene were generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells using lipofectamine plus (Invitrogen), and stable transfected clones were selected using G418. For Western blotting, equal amounts of protein lysate were separated on SDSâpolyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose Hybond ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen) at 1:5,000 and mouse anti-Flag (Stratagene) at 1:1,000. The secondary antibody was antiâmouse HRP (Vector Laboratories) used at 1:3,000.</p>

After the incubation, lipids were extracted three times with 2 vol chloroform/methanol 2:1 (by vol), and the extracts were lyophilized under vacuum. Extracts were fractionated by TLC on silica on polypropylene plates using chloroform/methanol/NH<sub>4</sub>OH (85:15:0.1, by vol) as the eluting system. Under these conditions, the migration index of free fatty acids, monoacylglycerols, and diacylglycerols was 0.25, 0.65, and 0.9, respectively; the migration index of phospholipids and triacylglycerols was 0.05 and 1.0, respectively. Bands corresponding to each class of lipids were cut, and their radioactivity was counted with a Î²-counter. Using <italic>sn</italic>-1-stearoyl-2-[<sup>14</sup>C]arachidonoyl-glycerol as the substrate, the DAGL reaction rate was linear up to 20 min and reached a plateau after 30 min, with both DAGLÎ± and Î².

An affinity-purified antibody against the CB1 receptor (PA1-745; Affinity BioReagents, Inc.) was used at 20 Î¼g/ml IgG. An antineurofilament monoclonal antibody (N5264; Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. 6-Î¼m sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin waxâembedded tissues were subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval to disclose antigenic sites before being incubated in primary antibody solutions overnight at 4Â°C. After washing, the sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (E0432 and E0433; Dakopatts) followed by detection with an HRP-streptavidin-biotin kit (model K377; Dakopatts). To visualize the V5 epitope tag, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS and stained with mouse anti-V5 primary antibody at 1:200, followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat antiâmouse IgG secondary (Molecular Probes) at 1:2,000.
