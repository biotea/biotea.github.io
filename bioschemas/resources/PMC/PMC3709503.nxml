      <abstract>
        <p>Parkin is a RING-between-RING E3 ligase that functions in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to specific substrates, and mutations in Parkin are linked to Parkinsonâs disease, cancer and mycobacterial infection. The RING-between-RING family of E3 ligases are suggested to function with a canonical RING domain and a catalytic cysteine residue usually restricted to HECT E3 ligases, thus termed âRING/HECT hybridâ enzymes. Here we present the 1.58âÃ structure of Parkin-R0RBR, revealing the fold architecture for the four RING domains, and several unpredicted interfaces. Examination of the Parkin active site suggests a catalytic network consisting of C431 and H433. In cells, mutation of C431 eliminates Parkin-catalysed degradation of mitochondria, and capture of an ubiquitin oxyester confirms C431 as Parkinâs cellular active site. Our data confirm that Parkin is a RING/HECT hybrid, and provide the first crystal structure of an RING-between-RING E3 ligase at atomic resolution, providing insight into this disease-related protein.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Posttranslational modification of proteins by ubiquitin is a fundamental cellular mechanism that regulates protein stability and activity and underlies a multitude of functions, from almost every aspect of biology. The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to specific protein substrates is achieved through the action of E3 ubiquitin ligases. These ligases comprise over 500 different proteins and are categorized into multiple classes defined by the structural element of their E3 functional activity. Specifically, both HECT and RING ligases transfer an activated ubiquitin from a thioester to the Îµ-amino acid group of a lysine residue on a substrate; however, HECT ligases have an active site cysteine that forms an intermediate thioester bond with ubiquitin, while RING ligases function as a scaffold to allow direct ubiquitin transfer from the E2 to substrate. Recent evidence suggests that a subfamily of RING ligases, the RING-between-RING (RBR) family, may contain a catalytic cysteine residue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> in addition to a canonical RING domain.</p>
    <p>Parkin has been proposed to function as a RBR ligase such that it encompasses both of the major classes of E3 ligase in one protein. Specifically, it may function with both a catalytic cysteine and a classical RING motif for binding E2. Although recent work has established that Parkin has four RING domains, coordinating eight zinc (Zn) molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, the exact residues coordinating these Zn atoms, and the organization of each of the RING domains with respect to each other are not known. Parkin has been described to have latent activity that can be activated with carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) in cells, although it is not completely known how the latent state becomes activated at the molecular level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, and whether or not purified Parkin protein contains a similar latent state. Regulation of Parkin activity by phosphorylation has been described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, but the subsequent molecular events post-phosphorylation are not understood. Finally, although catalytic networks have been investigated for E3 ligases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, it is not yet clear whether they function with a classic triad/dyad-based mechanism, or whether catalysis occurs through a hydrogen-bonding network. For deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), it has been demonstrated that the cleavage of ubiquitin from a substrate occurs through a classic triad/dyad mechanism, utilizing a critical catalytic cysteine residue, and a histidine residue in close proximity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
    <p>To gain insight into the domain organization of Parkin, and regulation of Parkin ligase activity, we sought to obtain the crystal structure of Parkin at high resolution. Our 1.58âÃ structure reveals that Parkin forms a relatively compact overall structure with multiple unpredicted domain interfaces. These interfaces form the basis for understanding a latent and activated state for Parkin, as well as provide insight into the role of the active site cysteine, C431, and the network of residues in proximity to C431 that facilitate catalysis. Our data support the suggestion that RBR ligases function with both RING and HECT-like mechanisms, and provides a blueprint for future mechanistic and functional studies.</p>

        <title>Overall structure and individual domains</title>
        <p>To gain insight into the RBR class of E3 ligase, we grew crystals of Parkin-R0RBR (residues 141â465) that includes RING 0 (R0) and the RBR domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The structure was determined by analysis of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data using the signal from Zn ions bound by the individual RING domains and was refined against high resolution data to 1.58âÃ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1âS2</xref>). Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB protein data bank under accession codes <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="4I1F">4I1F</ext-link> (Parkin-R0RBR-P223) and 4I1H (Parkin-R0RBR-S223). We solved two structures of Parkin to determine if there were any notable structural differences between the sequence of Parkin originally reported (containing P223) and the updated sequence (S223). Overall the two structures were extremely similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>); however, the loop containing S223 was visible in Parkin-R0RBR but not in the P223 structure. This residue has had considerable discussion (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mutview.dmb.med.keio.ac.jp/Parkin-seq/message.html">http://mutview.dmb.med.keio.ac.jp/Parkin-seq/message.html</ext-link>) although there has been no mitochondria targeting sequence identified in that region (Narenda and Youle, personal communication). Aspects discussed in this paper were indistinguishable for Parkin with S or P at position 223; The structure discussion focuses on the S223 protein. Each RING domain binds two Zn ions and resolves discrepancies in the literature regarding Zn coordination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). The R0 domain (residues 141â216) is a previously unobserved domain fold (based on Dali)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, while R1 (residues 228â328) shows the classical cross-brace arrangement and Zn coordination of canonical RING domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref>). The IBR domain is similar to the published NMR structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3c</xref>). The R2 domain of Parkin most closely resembles IBR domains, and is very similar to HOIP IBR domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3c</xref>). Conversely, R2 differs significantly from the closely related HHARI R2 NMR structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, and it will be interesting to compare additional RBR protein structures as they become available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>
        <p>The overall R0RBR structure reveals two compact domain groups separated by two linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). One domain is comprised of an association between RING1 (R1) and IBR formed by a small hydrophobic patch at their interface boundary. As R1 has a canonical RING structure, it can be visualized as the binding site for E2 based on the structure of other RING ligases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). The other domain is formed by close association of R0 and R2, involving a total of ~1,330âÃ (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) surface area between the C-terminal region of R2 and the hydrophobic core of R0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2c</xref>). R2 contains the proposed catalytic cysteine (C431) that is near the hydrophobic interface with R0. The R0:R2 interface is unique to Parkin as it involves sequences within R0 as well as the C-terminus of R2 that are distinct from other RBR ligases. The R0âR1 linker region between the two major domains has a coil conformation and resides in a relatively hydrophilic interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting that this may be an area of potential structural flexibility. The IBR-R2 linker region (which we refer to as the tether: residues 378â414) is 37 residues long. Most of the beginning of the tether (14 residues) is disordered, while the latter part runs across the surface of R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4c</xref>). The tether forms significant interactions with R1, but is also an area of potential flexibility. A two turn helix (residues 394â401) packs against R1 and the nearby residue W403 may serve as a âpinâ to anchor the tether to R1 and associate it with R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The side chain of W403 sits in a hydrophobic pocket formed by several R1 residues and forms a hydrogen bond with the terminal carboxylate of V465 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4c</xref>) a residue only found in mammals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7b</xref>). As described above, R1 is a likely E2-binding site on Parkin and the position of the tether has the potential to regulate this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Investigation of a catalytic mechanism for Parkin</title>
        <p>To interrogate the accessibility of Parkinâs catalytic machinery without the confounding factors that result from the interactions of E2 in a transthiolation reaction, we used the activity-probe ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone (Ub-VS). Ub-VS is a specific probe that will covalently modify the active site cysteine of DUBs and HECT ligases through specific recognition of ubiquitin and the oriented positioning of the VS moiety<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The R0RBR domain of Parkin weakly reacted with Ub-VS, while the RBR domain of Parkin produced a ~8-kDa shift in molecular weight indicating that the RBR domain of Parkin is more reactive to probe than the R0RBR. N-terminally SUMO-tagged R0RBR was also active in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). These results suggest that removal or modification of R0, which is closely aligned with R2, may allow conformational changes near the active site to facilitate probe reactivity. The intensity of Ub-VS probe labelling has been suggested to correlate with the functional state of the active site of the enzyme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and in support of this idea we found that autoubiquitination activity was consistent with probe binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5b</xref>). Furthermore, these results are consistent with recent published work demonstrating greater levels of activity for RBR compared to R0RBR Parkin constructs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Using mass spectrometry we confirmed the Ub-VS was attached only to Parkinâs C431 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5a</xref>), and confirmed labelling of Parkin was specific for Ub-VS as other ubiquitin-like VS moieties did not robustly label Parkin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6a</xref>). Although there is an example of a ligase (A20) that also has DUB activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, this is not the case for Parkin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6b</xref>) and is not likely to be the reason that Parkin can be labelled with Ub-VS probe.</p>
        <p>In transthiolation reactions, the active site cysteine needs to be activated for nucleophilic attack of the E2~ubiquitin thioester carbonyl bond<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Activation of the cysteine and stabilization of the resulting tetrahedral intermediate require the presence of characteristic elements found in cysteine proteases or DUBs: an activating catalytic dyad<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> or triad<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and an oxyanion hole framed by backbone or side chain hydrogen bond donors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Examination of the residues surrounding Parkinâs active site C431 revealed putative active site triad residues consisting of C431, H433 and E444 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These residues are conserved across all species of Parkin examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7b</xref>), and mutation of H433 and E444 significantly disrupted Ub-VS probe reactivity at neutral pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), and reactivity was completely eliminated by mutation of C431 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The role of histidine within a catalytic dyad or triad is to function as a base that deprotonates the cysteine for activationâa role that can potentially be obviated by elevated pH. Consistent with this mechanism, we found that although H433A or H433N demonstrated little probe reactivity at neutral pH, probe labelling was restored with pH titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). As is common for DUBs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> in our structure C431 and H433 are not well aligned for catalysis and implies that a conformational rearrangement must occur for catalysis to take place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Latent activity and catalytic residues in cells</title>
        <p>In cells, Parkin has been shown to have an important role in Parkin-catalysed degradation of mitochondrial protein, following treatment with mitochondrial toxins, such as CCCP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. To assay functional activity of C431 in cells, we examined Tom20 loss as a measure of Parkin-catalysed degradation of mitochondrial protein, following CCCP treatment.

The active site cysteine mutants, C431S and C431A, while soluble and well-behaved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8a</xref>), were unable to function in this cellular assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), consistent with the utilization of Parkinâs active site C431 during mitochondrial stress. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate that the C431S mutant formed an ubiquitin oxyester only in the presence of CCCP, directly supporting C431 as an active site residue in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8b</xref>) and that Parkin has latent activity that can be activated by CCCP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Although, there is the formal possibility that C431 is also involved in translocation of Parkin to mitochondria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.

Why E444 is dispensable in cells is not clear, although Parkin may have a binding partner in cells that provides the role of the Glu in positioning the His, or the pH at the mitochondria membrane may be such that the E444 is dispensable for deprotonation of C431. Although the Cys, His and Glu residues are completely conserved across all species of Parkin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7b</xref>), the motif is not conserved across all RBR ligases, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7a</xref>) and other RBR ligases may use a different catalytic mechanism.</p>

        <title>Critical phenylalanine differs from HECT ligases</title>
        <p>Inspection of the extreme C-terminus of Parkin revealed a conserved phenylalanine (F) at the â3 position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7b</xref>), F463, and Phe at the â5 to â3 position has been described as a critical determinant for positioning of the incoming substrate lysine in HECT ligases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Mutation of F463 to tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>) enhanced the activity of Parkin in cells for Tom20 loss as well as dramatic increases in autoubiquitination activity and Ub-VS probe binding of R0RBR <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). This suggests that the conserved F463 at the extreme C-terminus of Parkin is likely to serve in a distinct capacity from the extreme C-termini of HECT ligases structurally described thus far. In our structure, F463 is involved in critical hydrophobic interactions predicted to contribute to integrity of R0:R2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Coupled with the data above, this result suggests that the R0:R2 interface defined in the Parkin structure is important in regulation of Parkinâs active site. In fact, mutation of any of the hydrophobic residues that comprise the R0:R2 interface results in increased autoubiquitination activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8c</xref>). Thus, the â3 Phe in Parkin functions distinctly from similarly spaced residues in other HECT ligases, and suggests that it is possible to increase Parkin activity through changes in the integrity of the R0:R2 interface.</p>

The other mutations are present in each of the four domains and the tether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), and can be roughly grouped into two functional regions; E2 binding and the area surrounding the catalytic cysteine. There are three PD mutations (R396G, A398T, R402C/H) that occur in the linker closely associated with R1 in the region of the short Î±-helix of the tether, and A398T would be predicted to directly perturb the interaction with R1 and have implications for E2 binding. Furthermore, the R1 mutation T240R may interrupt E2 binding as was reported experimentally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Mutations in the IBR domain and at the R1:IBR interface could disrupt structural integrity and E2 binding.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have solved the structure of Parkin-R0RBR at high resolution. Overall, our structure demonstrates characteristics of RING and HECT ligases, as has been suggested by previous biochemical analysis of HHARI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Analysis of this structure reveals several new aspects of the Parkin protein including: novel RING structures for R0 and R2, insight into the catalytic activity at the molecular level, unpredicted interfaces between domains and a clustering of human PD mutations that were not indicated from linear mapping studies.</p>
      <p>The individual RING domains for Parkin have been the subject of much debate, in regards to the specific residues that coordinate Zn ions, as well as their relationship to canonical RING cross-brace structures defining classical E2-binding domains. R1 is the only RING domain of Parkin that demonstrates a typical E2 binding motif, with a cross-brace structure that defines this domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. R0 is a novel domain structure, but is more similar to Zn-finger domains than to E3 RING domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The IBR domain is largely as predicted from high-quality NMR studies of the isolated IBR domain from Parkin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. RING2 is similar to the IBR domain of Parkin and HOIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3c</xref>). However, neither resembles canonical RING domain motifs, as they do not have a cross-brace structure. These findings call into question whether the RING nomenclature is actually appropriate for the R0, IBR and R2 domains.</p>
      <p>Previous work defining RBR ligases as RING/HECT hybrids predicted a HECT-like catalytic cysteine residue in the R2 domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Although the R2 domain does not resemble a typical HECT structure, our analysis confirmed that there is a catalytic cysteine at C431. As discussed above for RING nomenclature, it may be useful to reassess the use of the âHECTâ term for ligases with catalytic cysteines. Similar to what we have found with Parkin, a series of bacterial ligases have recently been described that function through a catalytic cysteine residue, but bear no sequence or structural similarity to HECT domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Thus, bacterial ligases, RBR ligases and HECT ligases function through a catalytic cysteine, but are structurally and sequence-wise distinct.</p>
      <p>Mechanistically, we identified residues in the catalytic core that may function with C431 to promote catalysis. Mutational studies of H433 and E444 demonstrated that H433 is required to promote catalytic activity through C431 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells. Whether this finding is representative of a catalytic triad/dyad mechanism as has been demonstrated for DUBs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> or whether it represents a mechanism that functions through an hydrogen-bonding network with other residues remains to be determined through more extensive mutational analysis. However, our use of the Ub-VS probe clearly demonstrates that H433 is involved in the transthiolation step from E2 to E3 at C431. Importantly, the access to C431 may be restricted, and serve as a means to regulate Parkin activity (see below).</p>
      <p>The R0RBR structure reveals that the molecule is folded in half with the N- and C-termini forming an extensive interface that comprise two compact domain groups separated by two linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). One domain group is comprised of an association between R1 and IBR, the other domain group is formed by a close association of R0 and R2. The R1:IBR domain group contains the putative E2-binding site, which appears to be obstructed by a portion of the IBR, that we have designated the âtetherâ. Mutational analysis of this tether region, including W403, is likely to yield important insight into activation of Parkin in regards to E2 access. A key feature of the R0:R2 domain group is the positioning of the C-terminus of Parkin R2 into a hydrophobic region on R0. The R0:R2 interface may contribute to regulation of Parkin activation in two ways: By restricting access of the incoming ubiquitin C-terminal Gly-Gly to Parkin C431, and by misalignment of Parkinâs catalytic machinery, namely H433 and C431. Our functional analysis of the R0:R2 interface demonstrated that mutation of individual hydrophobic residues resulted in activation of Parkin autoubiquitination and probe label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8d</xref>). As probe label depends upon access to the active site, and appropriate alignment of catalytic residues, this result suggests that R0:R2 interface mutations likely function in one or both of the two ways suggested above. We did not observe increased ubiquitin binding in these mutants by Biacore, suggesting they do not function to increase affinity for Ub. In our structure, H433 is involved in water-mediated hydrogen bonding with W462 and is not available to deprotonate C431 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), representing an inactive state of the enz<bold>y</bold>me through misalignment of the catalytic residues.</p>
      <p>Notably, mutation of F463 does not result in loss of Parkin activity. In other HECT ligases, a similarly spaced phenylalanine is thought to position the E3 ligase thioester-bound ubiquitin for transfer to substrate, and is critical for activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Thus, although Parkin exhibits catalytic cysteine activity similar to HECT ligases, it is also functionally distinct, as the â3 Phe appears to function in a different capacity. Finally, the movement within the interface between the two large domains formed by R1:IBR and R0:R2 may provide a way in which to juxtapose the catalytic cysteine of UbcH7 (bound to R1) with the active site C431 in the R2 of Parkin. In our current model, E2 (UbcH7) bound to Parkin is too distant for transthiolation of C431 to occur (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). The structure suggests the potential for a conformational change to facilitate transthiolation from UbcH7 to Parkin. We envision this movement to be that of a butterfly motion whereby R1:IBR and R0:R2 move with respect to each other via the flexible linker and tether regions shown in beige (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1b,c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>). However, a full mutational analysis of these interfaces, and a structural determination of Parkin bound to UbcH7 during transthiolation, will be necessary to address this issue. Such studies have been done for other ligases, and have demonstrated linkers that promote and allow for considerable conformational flexibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our structural analysis and mapping of PD mutations of Parkin demonstrates that there are key functional areas on Parkin that are affected by mutations. Largely, the mutations cluster into three groups: (1) Zn coordination residues, likely to affect overall structural stability; (2) predicted E2 binding region, with mutations in the direct binding site for the E2, as well as in regions proximal to the predicted E2 binding site that may affect movement of the tether residues or aspects that are still not yet understood about E2âE3 binding interactions; and (3) the catalytic region around residue C431. This map will be highly useful in future investigational studies of the functional role for these mutations in catalysis, E2 binding, conformational flexibility, activation of a latent state, as well as potential regions for critical binding partners. Functional studies have also defined key features of isolated Parkin mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, and some of these mutations may help identify regions of Parkin that are important for localization to mitochondria. The fact that the mutations mapped in this study largely occur on one face of the molecule is suggestive of a specific functionality for a directed orientation relative to other molecules. Before this study, it was very difficult to understand Parkin mutations in an overall picture, but this structural snapshot will provide a map for testing new hypotheses, such as those suggested in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our structural, biochemical and cellular data indicate that Parkin functions as a RING/HECT hybrid. Parkin likely binds E2 through a conserved structural motif on a canonical RING domain, and also functions through a HECT-like active site cysteine whose activity can be regulated through interaction between the R0 and R2 domains. Our structure of Parkin-R0RBR will be useful for drug discovery efforts aimed to increase ligase activity, as well as to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination in this new class of E3 ligase.</p>

        <p>Parkin autoubiquitination reactions were typically carried out in a 25-Î¼l reaction volume in reaction buffer of 50âmM HEPES, 50âmM NaCl, pH 8.0 for 1âh at 37âÂ°C using E1 (250ânM), E2 (5âÎ¼M), ubiquitin (23.5âÎ¼M), Mg-ATP solution (10âmM) and Parkin species (0.46âÎ¼M). Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-loading buffer.</p>
        <p>Parkin activity-probe labelling with HA-Ub-VS was as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Briefly Parkin (5âÎ¼g) was incubated with HA-Ub-VS (or other Ub-like VS, Boston Biochem) at 3:1 Parkin:Ub-VS molar ratio or at 1:1 Parkin:Ub-VS ratio for 3âh at room temperature in 50âmM HEPES, 50âmM NaCl, over a range of pH.

        <title>Parkin cellular assay</title>
        <p>Cells were stained as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> with the exception that cells were typically grown in 24-well plastic dishes. Images were captured on the Cellomics ArrayScan VTi platform (Thermo Scientific) using the Target Activation BioApplication to quantify the percentage of cells containing Tom20 mitochondrial staining. Cell fields were imaged using a Ã 10 objective lens with an average of 250 cells detected per field. Data were collected from at least 2,000 cells per well of a 96-well plate. The readout parameters for the cellular assay were average fluorescence intensity and the percent of cells showing little or no Tom20 staining. The percentage of Tom20 loss relative to full-length wild-type Parkin was calculated by setting full-length wild-type Parkin-induced Tom20 loss after CCCP treatment to 100%. Data presented are representative of three to four independent experiments (error bars represent s.e.m.).</p>

        <title>Detection of cellular Parkin-linked oxyester</title>
        <p>Cells were transfected with XtremeGene according to the manufactures protocol (Roche) using untagged full-length Parkin (or mutants) together with HA-ubiquitin with a DNA ratio of 1:10 respectively. Transfections were for 48âh with media exchange and addition of CCCP (10âÎ¼M final) after 24âh. Cells were lysed on ice for 30âmin in 20âmM HEPES, 150âmM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton-X-100, pH 7.2 with EDTA-free complete protease inhibitors (Roche). Lysates were clarified for 10âmin at 16,000â<italic>g</italic> in a tabletop microcentrifuge at 4âÂ°C. Protein was quantified using BCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To obtain sufficient separation of Parkin and the oxyester-linked Parkin, samples were typically run for 2âh on a 10% Tris-Glycine gel (Invitrogen). For immunoprecipitation of oxyester-linked Parkin, one mg of protein extract (after a one hour preclear with protein A beads alone) was incubated with Protein A resin and HPA1A (5âÎ¼g) overnight with rotation at 4âÂ°C. The next day samples were washed 3 Ã with lysis buffer followed by addition of SDS-loading dye. Reactions were then incubated with NaOH (0.14âmolâl<sup>â1</sup>) or buffer control for 20âmin at 37âÂ°C before being boiled.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) The activity-probe HA-Ub-VS was incubated with various Parkin constructs (or USP2 control) to determine intrinsic Parkin enzymatic activity. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 3âh, or for the Parkin blot (loading control) samples were removed at time zero (t0) hours and terminated by the addition of SDS-loading dye. For RBR samples, the reaction proceeds so quickly that even at time zero, the reaction is observed. (<bold>b</bold>) The potential catalytic triad residues C431, H433 and E444 are misaligned. H433 is engaged in a water-mediated hydrogen bond with W462 and is ~5.1âÃ from C431. A GG-C431 motif is present (asterisks), which could serve as a classical oxyanion hole during catalysis. (<bold>c</bold>) Parkin probe reactivity requires elements of a classical catalytic triad. Ub-VS probe reactivity was assessed in various Parkin mutants over a range of pH.</p>
