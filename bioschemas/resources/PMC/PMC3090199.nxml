      <abstract>
        <p>Human infertility is common and frequently linked to poor germ cell development. Yet, human germ cell development is poorly understood, at least in part due to the inaccessibility of germ cells to study especially during fetal development. Here, we explored the function of a highly conserved family of genes, the <italic>NANOS</italic> genes, in the differentiation of human germ cells from human embryonic stem cells. We observed that NANOS-1, -2 and -3 mRNAs and proteins were expressed in human gonads. We also noted that NANOS3 was expressed in germ cells throughout spermatogenesis and oogenesis and thus, focused further efforts on this family member. NANOS3 expression was highest in human germ cell nuclei where the protein co-localized with chromosomal DNA during mitosis/meiosis. Reduced expression of NANOS3 (via morpholinos or short hairpin RNA) resulted in a reduction in germ cell numbers and decreased expression of germ cell-intrinsic genes required for the maintenance of pluripotency and meiotic initiation and progression. These data provide the first direct experimental evidence that <italic>NANOS3</italic> functions in human germ cell development; indeed, <italic>NANOS3</italic> is now one of just two genes that has been directly shown to function in germ cell development across diverse species from flies, worms, frogs and mice to humans [the other is <italic>BOULE</italic>, a member of the <italic>Deleted in Azoospermia (DAZ)</italic> gene family]. Findings may contribute to our understanding of the basic biology of human germ cell development and may provide clinical insights regarding infertility.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The specification of germ cell versus somatic cell fate is of primary importance to all species and occurs early in embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C1">1</xref>). In model organisms, two divergent methods of germ cell specification and maintenance are apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C3">3</xref>). In non-mammalian species, germ cell fate is determined by the inheritance of germ plasm, microscopically distinct oocyte cytoplasm, enriched in RNAs and RNA-binding proteins, that segregates with cells destined to become germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C3">3</xref>). In contrast, in mammalian species, germ cells are specified independently of germ plasm via inductive signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C10">10</xref>). Fate mapping studies of the pre-implantation mouse epiblast have revealed that germ cells are specified in the proximal epiblast in response to signals such as bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) from the neighboring extra-embryonic ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C11">11</xref>). Yet it is clear that the proximal epiblast is not predestined to the fate of a germ cell since transplantation of distal epiblast to contact extra-embryonic ectoderm also results in germ cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C7">7</xref>). Germ cells are definitively recognized at â¼7.2 days post-coitum as an extra-embryonic cluster of cells that express tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase, <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Stella</italic>, at the base of the allantois (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C15">15</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>NANOS</italic> gene family is required for germ cell development in diverse model organisms, although the processes that are regulated vary among species and between different homologs. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the single <italic>nanos</italic> homolog is implicated in germ cell migration, suppression of somatic cell fate in the germ line and maintenance of germ stem cell self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C18">18</xref>), in addition to involvement in somatic patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C19">19</xref>). In general, Nanos is recruited to Nanos-response elements of target mRNAs by its co-factor Pumilio, where the Nanos protein functions to repress translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C21">21</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, three homologs exist, with <italic>Nos-1</italic> and <italic>Nos-2</italic> functioning primarily in germ cell development in maintaining germ cell viability and incorporation into the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C22">22</xref>).</p><p>Mouse models of <italic>Nanos1</italic> did not reveal a discernible germ cell function for this homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C23">23</xref>). Contrarily, male <italic>Nanos2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice have decreased testis size and are infertile due to a loss of germ cells following primordial germ cell (PGC) incorporation into the gonad, while female mice appear developmentally normal and retain fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C24">24</xref>). Characterization of <italic>Nanos3</italic> knockout mice revealed decreased gonad size and infertility in both male and female mice. Similar to <italic>Nanos2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice, PGC specification occurred in <italic>Nanos3<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice, although the PGCs were not maintained during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C24">24</xref>). Later studies implicated <italic>Nanos3</italic> in the maintenance of PGCs during migration via suppression of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C25">25</xref>). Notably, <italic>Nanos2</italic> and <italic>Nanos3</italic> phenotypes indicate independent, non-redundant roles for these homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C26">26</xref>).</p><p>While recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in the understanding of germ cell development in model systems, it is difficult to translate information directly to the human system. This difficulty is due, in large part, to several factors. First, many genes required for reproduction have evolved so rapidly that even the same homolog in the closest evolutionary neighbors differ significantly in either sequence or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C28">28</xref>). Secondly, genes that reside on sex chromosomes can be expressed at various dosages, dependent on the species of the organism, or in more extreme cases, as in the <italic>Deleted in Azoospermia (DAZ)</italic> gene, may be missing from the genome altogether, even in closely related mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C29">29</xref>). Thirdly, in contrast to other species, humans are remarkably imprecise in aspects of germ cell development commonly considered to be highly conserved. For example, meiotic chromosome mis-segregation occurs in yeast in â¼1/10 000 cells. In flies, mis-segregation occurs in 1/1000 to 1/2000 cells and in mice in &lt;1/100 cells. In humans, meiotic mis-segregation occurs in 5â20% of cells, dependent on sex and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C30">30</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examined the function of <italic>NANOS</italic> homologs in the formation and/or differentiation of human germ cells, focusing on <italic>NANOS3</italic>. Using a previously described differentiation system, in which human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are differentiated in an adherent monolayer in the presence of BMP4, 7 and 8b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C31">31</xref>), we introduced various gene knockdown technologies to specifically focus on the function of one homolog, <italic>NANOS3</italic>, that demonstrated intriguing expression of mRNA and localization of the protein throughout germ cell development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>mRNA and protein expression of human NANOS homologs</title><p>The human genome contains three genes that share extensive sequence similarity with the <italic>Nanos</italic> genes of other mammalian species (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F1">1</xref>A). Comparison of the <italic>Nanos</italic> sequences in several model organisms reveals that there is a highly conserved region with 8 invariant cysteine and histidine residues in a CCHC CCHC configuration characteristic of zinc finger motifs (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F1">1</xref>B). Zinc fingers are generally thought to facilitate the binding of DNA and RNA; previous studies determined that these 8 conserved amino acids form the two zinc fingers which confer translational repression properties to the <italic>Nanos</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C32">32</xref>).

This pattern was similar to that of the germ cell-specific markers, <italic>VASA</italic> and <italic>DAZL</italic> and was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddr114/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A</ext-link>). In contrast, <italic>NANOS1</italic> was expressed ubiquitously (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddr114/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1B</ext-link>).</p><p>To examine protein expression and localization, we generated antibodies against each of the 3 homologs. One antibody was designed to detect NANOS1, and two antibodies were designed against NANOS2 and NANOS3, although one of the NANOS2 peptides failed to initiate an immune response. Of the two NANOS3 antibodies designed, NANOS3-1 more effectively detected the NANOS3 protein via western blot analysis, whereas NANOS3-2 better detected the NANOS3 protein within tissue sections and in fixed cells. Preliminary experiments revealed that both NANOS3 antibodies were able to detect exogenous NANOS3âgreen fluorescent protein (GFP). The NANOS1, NANOS2 and NANOS3 antibodies detected proteins of â¼60, 24 and 28kDa, respectively (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F1">1</xref>D). Notably, NANOS2 and NANOS3 antibodies also appear to detect NANOS1 as bands of â¼60 kDa were detected when blotting with each of these antibodies. This cross-reactivity could indicate the presence of NANOS1âNANOS3 or NANOS1âNANOS2 complexes, or may be attributed to sequence similarity between homologs. Western blot analysis revealed that NANOS-1, -2 and -3 proteins are expressed in fetal and adult gonadal tissue, with NANOS3 expression also detected in the human brain (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F1">1</xref>E). While western blot analysis appears to reveal slight expression of NANOS3 in the adult heart, further characterization via immunohistochemistry indicates that NANOS3 is not expressed in any heart-specific cell types (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddr114/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2B</ext-link>). Western blot analysis of the adult liver demonstrated only a non-specific band corresponding to a protein smaller than NANOS3; this lack of NANOS3 expression in liver was confirmed via immunohistochemistry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddr114/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2D</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>NANOS3 localizes to germ cells during human oogenesis and spermatogenesis</title><p>We focused further experiments on human <italic>NANOS3</italic> and examined expression in both the human ovary and testis. For this purpose, biopsies of adult human ovaries were analyzed via immunohistochemistry and assessed for NANOS3 expression and localization. We observed that the NANOS3 protein was expressed during multiple stages of human oogenesis, including primordial, primary, secondary and antral follicles (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F2">2</xref>AâC) with the highest expression in the oocytes; negative controls did not demonstrate specific staining (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F2">2</xref>DâF). Parallel analysis of human testis sections also revealed that NANOS3 was expressed in germ cells of the testis (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F2">2</xref>G). Cells positive for NANOS3 include those at multiple stages of spermatogenesis, including type A spermatogonia (S<sub>A</sub>), primary spermatocytes (S<sub>1</sub>), round spermatids (S<sub>3</sub>) (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F3">3</xref>H) and elongated spermatids (S<sub>4</sub>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddr114/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>). However, NANOS3 expression was not detected in immature sperm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddr114/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>). Most striking in these studies, and in contrast to the cytoplasmic expression of Nanos homologs in model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C33">33</xref>), human NANOS3 localized to the nuclei of human germ cells and co-localized with DNA during cellular division (arrowhead, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F2">2</xref>H). NANOS3 protein expression in the human fetal testis (as determined via western blot analysis) was confirmed upon staining of human fetal testis, although no specific cell types were identified in this assay (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddr114/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>).

HSF1 and HSF6 were differentiated in parallel experiments for 21 days, with sample time points taken at 0, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days. We observed that NANOS3 mRNA expression increased upon spontaneous differentiation of hESCs, peaking at 4 days of differentiation in both cell lines assessed (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F3">3</xref>A). In contrast, NANOS1 was expressed throughout differentiation, while NANOS2 expression was not detected throughout the period of hESC differentiation, in either line (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddr114/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4A and B</ext-link>).

NANOS3 was not expressed in undifferentiated H9 cells, but increased at day 3 and remained expressed through day 10 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F3">3</xref>A). This later observation may reflect differences in derivation and/or genetic background but suggests potential inherent differences in germ cell development.

Thus, in hESCs, NANOS3 is not detected in undifferentiated cells but later increases upon differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>NANOS3 co-localizes with BLIMP1, STELLA and VASA in dividing hESC-derived germ cells</title><p>We examined the localization of NANOS3 during hESC differentiation via a 7-day protocol in which cells were differentiated adherently in media supplemented with BMPs and then analyzed via immunofluorescence<italic>.</italic> We observed that a subpopulation of differentiated hESCs expressed the NANOS3 protein in: (i) both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with the protein co-localized with the chromosomes and (ii) in actively dividing cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F3">3</xref>B). We then assayed expression of other proteins required for germ cell development in diverse organisms, namely BLIMP1, STELLA and VASA. We observed that all three of these germ cell-specific proteins were also co-expressed in mitotically dividing cells, where, in contrast to NANOS3, each protein localized to the cytoplasm, with STELLA expression also identified in the nucleus (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F3">3</xref>B). Thus, within the differentiating hESC population, we observed cells that express the NANOS3 protein in the nucleus, and also are positive for the germ cell proteins BLIMP1, STELLA and VASA. The co-localization of these four proteins is diagnostic of germ cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, and suggests that these cells are <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived germ cells and that NANOS3 localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus where it co-localizes with the chromatin (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F3">3</xref>B). To further verify antibody specificity, we generated GFP-tagged NANOS3 constructs (NANOS3-GFP) for over-expression in a bacterial expression system (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F3">3</xref>C). Detection of the GFP-tagged NANOS3 protein was achieved by probing with NANOS3-1, NANOS3-2 or GFP (JL-8) antibodies (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F3">3</xref>D). With each antibody, NANOS3-GFP was detected, although a non-specific band was also detected when probing with NANOS3-1. This band, however, is likely an artifact of the bacterial expression system, as it is not detected when probing human testicular lysates with the same antibody. NANOS3-GFP [or red fluorescent protein (RFP)] constructs were transfected into mouse spermatogonial stem cells (mSSCs), with high levels of fluorescence expression observed in the germ cell nuclei, and lower levels of expression in the cytoplasm (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F3">3</xref>E). These data provide further corroborating evidence that NANOS3 predominantly localizes to the nuclei of mammalian germ cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Decreased expression of NANOS3 results in reduced germ cell numbers and aberrant expression of germ cell markers</title><p>To examine whether NANOS3 is required for the differentiation of germ cells from hESCs, we developed a knockdown strategy that relied on morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) (typically â¼25bp in length) to inhibit protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C34">34</xref>). MOs block protein synthesis by altering the DNA backbone linkages, thereby conferring resistance to digestion by nucleases. The oligonucleotides are generally targeted to the 5â² untranslated region (UTR) or start codon of the genes of interest to avoid displacement by the translation machinery. We designed MOs to target the NANOS3 start site (NANOS3 MO/N3 MO) and introduced them into undifferentiated hESCs via nucleofection. Following nucleofection, hESCs were maintained as undifferentiated hESCs or differentiated in the presence of BMPs. Cells were harvested at days 0, 3, and 7 and then analyzed via western blot to assess the efficiency of NANOS3 protein reduction. As shown, we detected an â¼50% reduction in the NANOS3 protein levels upon introduction of the NANOS3 MO at day 0 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F4">4</xref>A). Following 3 days of differentiation, NANOS3 protein levels were still reduced, relative to the control (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F4">4</xref>A). By day 7, NANOS3 expression returned to levels comparable with those found in cells nucleofected with the standard control (SC) (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F4">4</xref>B). Further analysis of the cells collected after 7 days of NANOS3 MO-knockdown and differentiation revealed, however, that DAZL expression was reduced by â¼50% (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F4">4</xref>B).

While the NANOS3 MO line (N3 MO <italic>T</italic> = 7) upregulates expression of some genes required for germ cell development (<italic>1FITM1, 1FITM3, FSHR</italic>), most of the genes activated in the SC sample are not expressed in the NANOS3-knockdown line.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddr11404"/></fig></p><p>Germ cell numbers in both the control and NANOS3-knockdown populations were quantified by counting the actively dividing cells that expressed both STELLA and VASA.

Analysis of gene expression data from cells differentiated for 7 days, however, indicated significant differences between the NANOS3 MO and SC MO (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F4">4</xref>D).

This suggests that wild-type levels of the NANOS3 protein are required for proper regulation and expression of key regulators of germ cell development, meiotic progression and ectodermal differentiation.</p><p>Quantitation of the gene expression in cells nucleofected with the NANOS3 MO and SC MO was also carried out.

For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the disruption of genes such as <italic>Oskar</italic>, <italic>Vasa</italic>, <italic>Tudor</italic>, <italic>Germ cell-less</italic> and <italic>Aubergine</italic> results in the lack of a germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C35">35</xref>). The function of these genes is to assemble germ plasm, which contains highly conserved, interacting RNA-binding proteins such as Pumilio and Nanos which are thought to act to repress translation and indirectly silence gene transcription in nascent germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C35">35</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C38">38</xref>). In <italic>Pumilio</italic> and <italic>Nanos</italic> mutants, nascent germ cells may divide prematurely, migrate abnormally and subsequently die during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C35">35</xref>). Several years ago, homologs of several germ plasm components were identified in mammalian germ cells, including those of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C44">44</xref>). In a screen for proteins that interact with DAZ and DAZL, Moore <italic>et al</italic>. identified a set of genes that included PUMILIO homologs, PUM1 and PUM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C39">39</xref>). In other studies, it was shown that a human NANOS homolog interacts with PUMILIO homologs and is expressed in germ cells as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C44">44</xref>). These interactions are intriguing given that, in humans, deletions and variants of DAZ homologs are associated with the production of very few or no germ cells and, in diverse model organisms, these genes are required solely in the development of the germ cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C44">44</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C51">51</xref>). Thus, it has been hypothesized that the protein complex containing human DAZ, PUMILIO and NANOS homologs likely functions in germ cell formation and/or differentiation by regulating RNA localization, transcription, translation or stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C52">52</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C56">56</xref>). However, previously, it was not possible to directly test this hypothesis in humans. Indeed, human germ cell development remains very poorly understood in spite of the fact that defects in germ cell development contribute to a majority of infertility in the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C57">57</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report our analysis of a highly conserved family of proteins that is implicated in germ cell development in diverse species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C58">58</xref>). We show that, in human ovary and testis tissues, NANOS3 is expressed in human germ cells, with the protein localized to the germ cell nucleus. Nuclear localization of the NANOS3 protein and co-expression with known germ cell proteins BLIMP1, VASA and STELLA were also observed in hESC-derived germ cells. Moreover, we found that, in the absence of NANOS3, the molecular program(s) which drive human germ cell development were altered, thereby altering gene expression and quantifiably reducing the total germ cell number in active cell division. Taken together, these findings suggest that NANOS3 functions during human germ cell development in a cell-autonomous fashion and provides the first direct experimental evidence that <italic>NANOS3</italic> functions in human germ cell development. Thus, <italic>NANOS3</italic> is one of just two genes that has been shown directly to function in germ cell development from flies and worms to frogs, mice and now, humans (the other is <italic>BOULE,</italic> a member of the <italic>DAZ</italic> gene family).</p><p>The decreased mRNA levels of NANOS3 following 7 days of differentiation are somewhat surprising, given that MOs should only affect protein levels. It is possible, however, that a negative-feedback loop exists whereby <italic>NANOS3</italic> mRNA levels are regulated based on the NANOS3 protein levels. Alternatively, <italic>NANOS3</italic> mRNA may have been converted to protein following the decreased effectiveness of the MOs after 7 days. Given that so little is known regarding the mechanism of NANOS3 expression regulation, this is an area of study which warrants further investigation.</p><p>Due to the lack of an internal reporter system when using MOs, we were unable to track each cell in which NANOS3 expression levels were decreased. Despite this inability to track individual cells in such a heterogeneous cell population, we were able to quantify that fewer hESCs differentiated to germ cells in culture when NANOS3 expression was decreased.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose a model for NANOS3 expression in human hESC-derived germ cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDR114F6">6</xref>). The inner cell mass (ICM) of a human blastocyst can be extracted, and, in concert with the loss of positive and/or negative signals, gives rise to hESCs which can be maintained <italic>in vitro</italic>. ES cells, which express DAZL, are capable of differentiating to both germ and somatic cellular lineages. With the addition of extracellular signaling, PGCs can be derived <italic>in vitro</italic> from hESCs. PGCs express numerous factors required for germ cell development, including (but not limited to) VASA, STELLA and BLIMP1, and give rise to the germ cell lineage exclusively. In this study, we show that PGCs also express the highly conserved germ cell factor NANOS3. Based on our observations, we propose that down-regulation of NANOS3 results in decreased expression of genes required for several processes required for the development of human germ cells including (i) decreased expression of germ cell genes, (ii) decreased expression of genes required for the maintenance of pluripotency and (iii) reduced DAZL protein levels. The resultant down-regulation of the germ cell molecular profile ultimately disrupts the process of human germ cell development.

Gene expression was normalized in one of the two ways: (i) against GAPDH using the calculation 2<sup>â(C</sup><sub>T</sub><sup>, Sample â C</sup><sub>T</sub><sup>, Reference)</sup> or (ii) using the program GeNorm, with gene expression normalized to at least three of the following housekeeping genes (<italic>GAPDH</italic>, <italic>RPLPO</italic>, <italic>EEF1A1</italic>, <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, <italic>TBP</italic> or <italic>ACTB</italic>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C63">63</xref>). Briefly, a normalization factor was calculated (via GeNorm) based on the geometric mean of multiple housekeeping genes and was used to normalize the expression levels of the genes of interest within each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>shRNA vectors</title><p>shRNA vectors targeting NANOS3 were constructed using the Block-It inducible H1 lentiviral system (Invitrogen). The shRNAs were cloned into the pENTR/H1/T0 vector and then transferred into pLenti4/BLOCK-It-DEST destination vectors. Viral supernatants were prepared as described for pLVGV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDR114C31">31</xref>). hESCs were transduced with NANOS3 shRNA lentiviral supernatant as described for pLVGV, although selection was performed using 2 mg/ml of zeocin in conditioned media for 3 days. NANOS3 shRNA primer sequences are available upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>GFP and RFP fusion proteins</title><p>Human testis cDNA was amplified via PCR using primers to amplify NANOS2 and NANOS3 ORFs (available upon request). ORFs were cloned into the peGFP-C2 (Clontech) or pDSRed2-C1 (BD Biosciences) vectors. Eight clones were mini-prepped according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen), digested, run on 1.5% tris-borate-EDTA gels, gel extracted (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen) and sequenced to confirm that no mutations were introduced. Using the pET Expression System (Novagen), the GFPâNANOS3 protein was produced in bacteria, and then assessed via western blot analysis using antibodies against NANOS3 (NANOS3-1 and NANOS3-2) and GFP (JL-8). Constructs were also introduced into mSSCs via Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection for use in immunofluorescence experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Custom antibodies</title><p>Custom antibodies were designed against NANOS1, NANOS2 and NANOS3 using Custom Polyclonal Antibody Production (Invitrogen). The NANOS1 antibody (NANOS1 RSARDGPPGKKLR) was raised in chickens, harvested after 10 weeks, and then purified via IgY Purification (Invitrogen). Two NANOS2 peptides (NANOS2-1 GQRLETQEIEEPS; NANOS2-2 RRSGRNSAGRRVKR) were introduced into mice, with the antibody harvested after 10 weeks, although NANOS2-2 peptide did not generate an immunological response. Two NANOS3 antibodies were raised in rabbits (NANOS3-1 GKEGPETRLSPQPE; NANOS3-2 KAKTQDTGHRRGG). NANOS3-1 antibody was used for all western blot protocols and NANOS3-2 antibody was used for all immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence protocols. Each western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence experiment was performed in parallel with the corresponding pre-immune serum to confirm antibody specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>hESCs were grown on Lab-Tek II chambered coverglass (Nunc) coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Media were aspirated, the cells were washed once with 1Ã PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST) for 5 min each at RT, followed by permeabilization with 1% Triton X in PBST for 10 min (for cytoplasmic proteins) or 1 h and 30 min (for nuclear proteins) at RT. Cells were blocked ON in 4% goat serum (NANOS, STELLA, SSEA1) or 4% chicken serum (VASA) in PBST at 4Â°C. Primary antibody was added in 1% serum for 4 h at RT [NANOS3 1:500 (Custom, Invitrogen), VASA 1:200 (R&amp;D), STELLA 1:200, SSEA1 1:200 (Millipore), BLIMP1 1:200 (Novus Biologicals)]. Cells were washed three times in PBST, 5 min each and then secondary antibody in 1% serum was applied for 30 min at RT (NANOS3: goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:500, VASA: chicken anti-goat IgG 1:500, STELLA, BLIMP1: goat anti-mouse IgG 1:500, SSEA1: goat anti-mouse IgM 1:500) (Molecular Probes). If cells were stained using two independent antibodies, the immunofluorescence protocol (block, primary antibody and secondary antibody) was performed sequentially. Cells were washed three times with PBST for 5 min each, counterstained with DAPI/PBS and imaged using either a Zeiss LSM510 Meta inverted confocal microscope with an environmental control chamber or a Leica DMI6000B.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Tissue sections on glass slides were de-paraffinized in 2 Ã 10 min xylene washes. Sections were rehydrated in descending concentrations of ethanol washes for 3â5 min each (2 Ã 100%, 95%, 70%, 50%), incubated in Coplin jars filled with Target Retrieval Solution (Dako) in 95â99Â°C water bath for 30 min, cooled at RT for 20 minÂ and then washed in PBS, three times at 5 min each. Ten percent hydrogen peroxide in methanol was used to block endogenous peroxidase activity (20 min, RT). Slides were washed 3 Ã 10 min in PBS + 1% BSA + 0.1% Tween (PBST). Triton X at 0.1% in PBS was used to permeabilize cell membranes (5 min), followed by three 5 min washes in PBST. Tissues were blocked in 4% goat serum in PBST for 1 h at RT. Primary antibody was added (in 1% serum) ON at 4Â°C in humid chamber (NANOS3-2 or Pre-Immune, 1:1000). Following ON incubation, sections were equilibrated to RT and then washed 3 Ã 10 min in PBST. Secondary antibody (1:200 anti-rabbit HRP) in 1% goat serum/PBST was applied to slides for 45 min at RT, followed by 3 Ã 10 min washes in PBST. Protein localization was imaged using Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Labs) and DAB (Vector Labs) according to the manufacturer's protocols. DAB reactivity was stopped by incubating slides with water. Tissue sections were rehydrated for 3â5 min each in 50, 70, 95 and 2 Ã 100% ethanol washes. Cells were mounted and cover-slipped and then imaged using a Leica DM4000B upright microscope. Tissue section sources are as follows: Adult Human Testis: Joerg Gromoll Laboratory, Germany; Adult Human Ovary: Zyagen; Adult Thymus and Heart: Imgenex.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Morpholino oligonucleotides</title><p>Two anti-sense non-overlapping MOs were designed to target either the 5â² UTR of NANOS3 or the NANOS3 start codon in the ORF (Gene-tools, LLC); both MO constructs yielded similar results. A SC MO (SC: CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA) (Gene-tools, LLC) was used in parallel, as a negative control. MOs were nucleofected using the Human Stem Cell (H9) 96-well Nucleofector Kit (Amaxa/Lonza) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Following nucleofection, cells were replated in 12-well tissue-culture dishes (Falcon) or Lab-Tek II Chambered Coverglass (Nunc) coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in the conditioned medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Quantification of dividing germ cells</title><p>Cells were prepared for analysis via immunofluorescence, as previously described using the following primary antibodies: [VASA 1:200 (R&amp;D), STELLA 1:200 (Millipore)]. Secondary antibodies are chicken anti-goat 1:500 IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG 1:500 (Molecular Probes). Cells were counterstained using DAPI in PBS. Germ cells were quantified by screening for cells undergoing cellular division (as assessed via DNA morphology), and then assessing the percentage of dividing cells which positively express both STELLA and VASA.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Apoptosis</title><p>Apoptosis was assessed using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagents were reconstituted and added to identical cell numbers (as determined via flow cytometry) and volumes for the assays (H9, LACZ, 133, 826), negative control samples and blanks. Following incubation for 30 minâ3 h, luminescence of each sample was read using a plate-reading luminometer as directed by the manufacturer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddr114/DC1">Supplementary Material is available at <italic>HMG</italic> online.</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</funding-source> (#<award-id>F31HD054017</award-id> to V.T.A.J. and <award-id>U54HD055764</award-id> as part of the <funding-source>Specialized Cooperative Centers Program in Reproduction and Infertility Research</funding-source> to R.A.R.P.) and the <funding-source>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</funding-source> (CIRM Comprehensive Grant #<award-id>RC1-00137</award-id> to R.A.R.P.).
