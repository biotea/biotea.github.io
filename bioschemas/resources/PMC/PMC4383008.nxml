      <abstract>
        <p>RAB39B is a member of the RAB family of small GTPases that controls intracellular vesicular trafficking in a compartment-specific manner. Mutations in the <italic>RAB39B</italic> gene cause intellectual disability comorbid with autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy, but the impact of RAB39B loss of function on synaptic activity is largely unexplained. Here we show that protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) is a downstream effector of GTP-bound RAB39B and that RAB39B-PICK1 controls trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and, hence, surface expression of GluA2, a subunit of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). The role of AMPARs in synaptic transmission varies depending on the combination of subunits (GluA1, GluA2 and GluA3) they incorporate. RAB39B downregulation in mouse hippocampal neurons skews AMPAR composition towards non GluA2-containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable forms and thereby alters synaptic activity, specifically in hippocampal neurons. We posit that the resulting alteration in synaptic function underlies cognitive dysfunction in RAB39B-related disorders.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The human <italic>RAB39B</italic> gene, which maps to the distal Xq28 locus, encodes RAB39B, a member of the RAB GTPases, small monomeric GTPases belonging to the RAS-like GTPase superfamily, that have a key role in the regulation of intracellular vesicular trafficking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Indeed, RAB GTPases are physically associated with specific organelles, through specific effector protein interaction, and act as a network to regulate both spatially and temporally the transport of specific vesicles switching from the active GTP-bound and the inactive GDP-bound state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. RAB and RAB-associated proteins have been shown to play an important role in a number of rare monogenic as well as multifactorial diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> characterized by cognitive deficit. In particular, previous work on X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) has identified mutations in the <italic>GDI1</italic> gene that cause loss of function of the RAB-interacting protein Î±GDI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. RAB GTPases and interacting proteins are abundantly expressed in the central nervous system across species, and <italic>Gdi1</italic> mouse models have been relevant to demonstrate the causal link of Î±GDI loss of function with deficits in glutamate release and cognitive impairment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Our group previously demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations in human <italic>RAB39B</italic> gene are associated with XLID comorbid with autism spectrum disorder and seizures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and also comorbid with early onset of Parkinsonâs disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Moreover, it was reported that also a 0.5-Mb tandem copy-number gain at distal Xq28 including <italic>RAB39B</italic> was linked to XLID<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. We defined that RAB39B is a neuronal-specific protein localized at the Golgi compartment, but its functional role is unknown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The demonstrated link with a human genetic disease urged us to define the functional role of RAB39B in neurons and the potential link to cognitive function.</p>
    <p>In the present study, we define that RAB39B interacts with protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1), which became an attractive target for further studies. Previous studies defined the functional role of PICK1 in synaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) surface expression, trafficking and post-synaptic targeting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, but the mechanism of AMPAR biogenesis, assembly and trafficking is poorly understood. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, AMPARs are hetero-tetramers formed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> mostly composed of GluA1/GluA2 or GluA2/GluA3 hetero-dimers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Export of AMPARs from the ER requires the interaction of the C-terminal domain of AMPAR subunits with other proteins. In fact, synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) interacts with the immature GluA1 C-terminal domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> early in the secretory pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, while GluA2 C-terminal domain interacts with PICK1, which is necessary for GluA2 exit from the ER. Thus, PICK1 selectively binds GluA2/GluA3 heterodimers for exit from the ER to Golgi compartment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>
    <p>Given the RAB39BâPICK1 interaction and the Golgi localization of RAB39B, here we hypothesize that RAB39B might be a key molecule fundamental to regulate a specific secretory trafficking step of GluA2 AMPAR subunit. Supporting this idea, <italic>Rab39b</italic>-silenced mouse hippocampal neurons show increased GluA2 immature form suggesting ER retention. This result provokes, as a final step, a reduction in the amount of GluA2 AMPAR subunits at the post-synaptic membrane, leading to the formation of GluA2-lacking, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs, often associated with immature synapses and cognitive impairment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p>
    <p>We report here that RAB39B is the key molecule regulating the translocation of GluA2/GluA3 heterotetramers into the Golgi. Indeed, in the absence of RAB39B, AMPARs arrangement at the post-synaptic site is misregulated, which provides an explanation for the involvement of <italic>RAB39B</italic> mutations in the aetiology of ID and autism spectrum disorder.</p>

        <title>GTP-bound RAB39B interacts with PICK1</title>
        <p>To understand the causal link between XLID and gene defects associated with RAB39B, we set out to map the role of RAB39B in vesicular trafficking. As a first step, we searched for downstream effectors of RAB39B by use of a yeast two-hybrid screening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1aâc</xref>). With the human full-length RAB39B protein as bait, by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library we identified a protein originally described as protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) as the strongest interacting molecule. In agreement with our results from the two-hybrid screen, recombinant GST-RAB39B locked in the active state with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GTPÎ³S and the dominant active GST-RAB39B Q68L efficiently pulled down PICK1, as compared with GDP-bound or dominant-negative GST-RAB39B S22N, using whole-brain lysate of murine origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Instead, recombinant GST-RAB39A, sharing 76% identity at protein level with RAB39B, did not pull down PICK1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
        <p>GST-RAB39B GTPÎ³S likewise pulled down PICK1, obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and translation, which indicated that PICK1 interacts directly with RAB39B, and mostly in its GTP-bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Furthermore, myc-tagged PICK1 co-immunoprecipitates with flag-tagged RAB39B from lysates of HEK293T cells in which the two constructs were co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Finally, we performed the reverse pull down using GST-PICK1 and found that it pulled down RAB39B from the mouse brain lysate, as well as previously identified interacting proteins PKCÎ±<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and the GluA2 AMPAR subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>

        <title>RAB39B effector-binding region interacts with PICK1 PDZ domain</title>
        <p>To define how the two proteins interact at the molecular level, COS7 cells were transfected with RAB39B or PICK1 mutant constructs and interactions were tested again by pull down assays. Since GST-PICK1 did not pull down RAB39B construct lacking a stretch (flag-ÎER, aa 35â49) corresponding to the canonical effector-binding region as present in all RAB proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, we concluded that the association between RAB39B and PICK1 is a conventional RAB-effector protein interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To better define the residues involved in the PICK1-RAB39B effector-binding region, RAB39B constructs carrying different point mutations were used (flag-D38A, flag-V41G42V43AAA or flag-D44F45AA). Such RAB39B constructs were generated based on the predicted structural complex between RAB39B and PICK1 PDZ (see below). Consistently with structure predictions, GST-PICK1 did not pull down RAB39B construct carrying D44 and F45 mutated to alanines (aa D44F45AA), indicating that such amino-acid pair in the N-terminal half of the Î²2-strand of RAB39B play a central role in the association between RAB39B and PICK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). PICK1 is a PDZ- and BAR-domain-containing protein. GST-RAB39B GTPÎ³S pulled down recombinant myc-tagged PDZ domain (myc-PDZ; aa 23â99), but not flag-tagged recombinant PICK1 lacking the PDZ domain (flag- Î 121, aa 1â121; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Thus, the interface between the two interacting proteins involves amino acids D44 and F45 of the ER domain of RAB39B and, respectively, the PDZ domain of PICK1.</p>
        <p>The PDZ domain of PICK1 has been shown before to interact with a variety of proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, and point mutations within the PDZ domain of lysine 83 (K83) or of both lysine 27 (K27) and aspartate 28 (D28) with alanines abolished protein binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Since GST-RAB39B GTPÎ³S pulled down full-length myc-PICK with the K83A substitution (myc-K83A), but not with the K27D28AA substitutions (myc-KDAA), we concluded that K27 and D28 in the PDZ domain is key for the interaction of PICK1 with RAB39B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p>In agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays, we co-expressed flag-RAB39B and myc-PICK1 constructs in COS7 cells that lack the corresponding endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).

As a control of specificity of RAB39B co-localization with PICK1, we co-expressed GFP-RAB39A with myc-PICK1, because RAB39A is endogenously expressed in COS7 cells. PCC analysis revealed that PICK1 highly co-localized with RAB39B but not with RAB39A (GFP-RAB39A/myc-PICK1: <italic>n</italic>=27 cells, PCC=0.29, adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value for multiple comparison (<italic>P</italic>-adj.)=1Eâ08; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2aâc</xref>). Moreover, PCC from immunofluorescence on co-transfection of the relevant mutant constructs in COS7 cells showed that the co-localization of PICK1 and RAB39B was significantly abolished when either RAB39B is mutated in the D44F45AA (flag-RAB39B D44F45AA/myc-PICK1: <italic>n</italic>=14 cells, PCC=0.23, <italic>P</italic>-adj.=1.7Eâ08; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g,h</xref>) or PICK1 is mutated in the PDZ domain (flag-RAB39B/myc-PICK1 KDAA: <italic>n</italic>=23 cells, PCC=0.22, <italic>P</italic>-adj.=1.7Eâ08; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,h</xref>).</p>

        <title>RAB39BâPICK1 interaction is necessary and sufficient for GluA2 trafficking</title>
        <p>Given that RAB proteins direct vesicular transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and previous studies defined the functional role of PICK1 in GluA2 but not GluA1 AMPAR subunit trafficking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, we hypothesized that based on RAB39B and PICK1 interaction, they jointly coordinate trafficking of GluA2, but not of GluA1. To test these assumptions, we transfected into the heterologous COS7 cell system tagged constructs of RAB39B, PICK1, GluA1 and GluA2 either individually or in combination. Pearsonâs correlation coefficient was measured to verify co-localization between these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) and the receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
        <p>When expressed alone, GFP-GluA1 as well as GFP-GluA2 localized at the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Co-expression of flag-RAB39B did not change the localization of either GFP-GluA1 or GFP-GluA2, neither RAB39B co-localized with GluA1 and GluA2 (flag-RAB39B/GFP-GluA1: <italic>n</italic>=26 cells, PCC=0.09, flag-RAB39B/GFP-GluA2: <italic>n</italic>=26 cells, PCC=0.06; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d,i</xref>). Co-expression of myc-PICK1 and GFP-GluA1 did not show co-localization (myc-PICK1/GFP-GluA1: <italic>n</italic>=29 cells, PCC=â0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,i</xref>). Conversely, GFP-GluA2 co-clustered with myc-PICK at the perinuclear region when co-expressed, as has been previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> (myc-PICK1/GFP-GluA2: <italic>n</italic>=38 cells, PCC=0.66; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,i</xref>).</p>
        <p>Remarkably, GFP-GluA2 co-localized with flag-RAB39B only when co-expressed with myc-PICK1, and a significant correlation was found between RAB39B and GluA2 depending on the presence of PICK1 in the cells (flag-RAB39B/GFP-GluA2 with PICK1: <italic>n</italic>=12 cells, PCC=0.71, <italic>P</italic>-adj.=1.8Eâ08 comparing flag-RAB39B/GFP-GluA2 in PICK1 absence versus presence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h,i</xref>). In contrast, GFP-GluA1 never showed co-localization regardless of the co-expression of RAB39B and PICK1 constructs (flag-RAB39B/GFP-GluA1 with PICK1: <italic>n</italic>=24 cells, PCC=0.06; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g,i</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we then demonstrated receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane by TIRF. Co-expression of flag-RAB39B did not drive the plasma membrane translocation of either GFP-GluA1 or GFP-GluA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Remarkably, in triple transfected cells, flag-RAB39B mediated the GFP-GluA2 translocation to the plasma membrane in the presence of myc-PICK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>) but not GFP-GluA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
        <p>All together our results clearly indicate that the effector-binding region of RAB39B interacts with the PDZ domain of PICK1, also required for interaction with the GluA2 AMPAR subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. We also demonstrated that the RAB39BâPICK1 interaction is necessary for the RAB39B-driven trafficking of GluA2 cargo. PICK1-mediated functional linkage between RAB39B and GluA2-containing AMPAR relies on PICK1 dimer to act as a scaffold that hosts the other two proteins. In fact, GluA2 co-immunoprecipitates with PICK1 and RAB39B in a wild -type mouse brain lysate, but not in the <italic>Pick1</italic>-knockout brain, demonstrating the existence of the endogenous complex and that PICK1 acts as the bridge between RAB39B and GluA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>

        <title>A model of interactions among the RAB39B-PICK1-GluA2</title>
        <p>To gain insight, at the atomic level, into the supramolecular organization of RAB39B, PICK1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunit, we modelled the structure of RAB39B:2PICK1:GluA2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). This required comparative modelling and rigid-body docking to predict structure and interaction modes of PICK1 and RAB39B (see Methods). In contrast, the complex between the GluA2 C-terminus (GluA2Ct; aa 858-ESVKI-862) and PICK1 was extracted from a conformational ensemble solved by NMR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. In our structural model, the N-terminal half of the Î²2-strand of RAB39B (that is, amino-acid stretch 43â47 of the effector-binding region) interacts with the PDZ domain of PICK1 in a similar and partially overlapping manner as GluA2Ct, which is a Î²-strand as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6aâc</xref>). The major portions of RAB39B participating in the interface with PICK1 PDZ include (a) the 43â47 segment of the Î²2-strand, which makes inter-backbone and inter-side chain interactions with PICK1 Î²B and with Î±B; (b) switch 1 (swI) that interacts with the PICK1 Î²A/Î²B loop and Î±B; and (c) the switch 2 (swII) that interacts with PICK1 Î²C as well as the Î²A/Î²B and Î²B/Î±A loops (b and c). The predicted complex highlights D44 and F45 in the N-terminal half of the Î²2-strand as playing a central role in the interface, D44 making a salt bridge with K83 of PICK1 PDZ. Such a centrality of D44 and F45 has been validated by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Remarkably, the PICK1 Î²A/Î²B loop of PDZ holds the K27-D28 pair that we found essential for PICK1âRAB39B interaction. Structure predictions indicate D28 as more important than K27 in RAB39B recognition. Indeed, K27 is buried at the Î²B/Î±B interface, its positively charged nitrogen atom being about 9âÃ from the carboxylate oxygen atoms of D38 on the swI of RAB39B, and we postulate that the effect of the K27A mutation on RAB39B recognition, if any, is indirect. In contrast, D28 recognizes the G protein via a salt bridge with R70 in swII. Structure prediction therefore suggests that the interactions of RAB39B and GluA2 with the PDZ domain of PICK1 are mutually exclusive. In line with evidence that PICK1 can dimerize<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, the structural model suggests that dimerization of PICK1 is a prerequisite for simultaneous recognition of both RAB39B and GluA2 each by one of the PICK1 molecules in the PICK1 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6aâc</xref>). The existence of such complex is supported by our co-immunoprecipitation experiments shown above.</p>

        <title>RAB39B directs GluA2 trafficking in neurons</title>
        <p>The two most prevalent AMPAR variants contain a tandem of either GluA1 and GluA2 or GluA2 and GluA3 subunits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Exports of GluA1/GluA2 hetero-tetramers from the ER requires GluA1 interaction with SAP97 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), while GluA2/GluA3 hetero-tetramers need GluA2 interaction with PICK1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p>
        <p>To assess whether the RAB39B-PICK1 tandem directs trafficking of GluA2/GluA3 hetero-tetramers in their endogenous neuronal context, we first analysed the intracellular localization of RAB39B and PICK1 in flag-RAB39B-transfected primary mouse hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Flag-RAB39B appears to partially co-localize with PICK1 in the cell body, instead of along dendrites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). In a similar manner, flag-RAB39B and PICK1 co-localize in part with the ER or Golgi markers, calreticulin and GM130, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b,c</xref>). No co-localization was observed between flag-RAB39B and adaptor protein 2 (AP2), which was used as a negative control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Although RAB39B and PICK1 are certainly involved in many other intracellular pathways, our data support that RAB39BâPICK1 interaction has a role in cargo trafficking between the ER and the Golgi compartments.</p>
        <p>We then analyse the effect of <italic>Rab39b</italic> downregulation in transduced murine primary hippocampal neurons with previously described shRab39b and shScramble lentiviral particles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Silencing with shRab39b led to a 40% downregulation of RAB39B expression levels (meanÂ±s.e.m., shScramble: 1.1Â±0.13, shRab39b: 0.68Â±0.08; <italic>n</italic>=3; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.035), without affecting protein expression levels of PICK1, GluA1, GluA2 and GluA3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>We first determined the effect of RAB39B silencing on the intracellular localization of PICK1 GluA1, GluA2 and GluA3 in the murine hippocampal neurons by immunofluorescence at 14 DIV. We found an increase in PICK1, GluA2 and GluA3 levels in the cell body of shRab39b-treated neurons as compared with the neurons treated with the control shRNA (meanÂ±s.e.m., PICK1 shScramble <italic>n</italic>=21: 2.98Â±0.28, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=21: 4.25Â±0.35; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.009; GluA2 shScramble <italic>n</italic>=9: 0.60Â±0.05, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=5: 0.88Â±0.05; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.003; GluA3 shScramble <italic>n</italic>=6: 0.42Â±0.03, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=7: 0.62Â±0.04; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>), which suggests that there is a defect in protein trafficking when levels of RAB39B are downregulated.</p>
        <p>Next, we analysed the effect of RAB39B silencing on the intracellular trafficking in murine hippocampal neurons of the AMPAR subunits GluA1, GluA2 and GuA3 by examining their glycosylation status. Both AMPAR subunits are <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated and their N-glycans are subsequently modified in the ER before they are targeted to the plasma membrane. We therefore deglycosylated lysates from RAB39B silenced or control neurons with either Endo-Î²-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminidase H (EndoH), which removes only unmodified N-glycans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, or, as a control, with peptide-<italic>N</italic>-Glycosidase F (PNGasef), which removes all N-glycans, before analysis of the AMPAR subunits by immunoblotting. In the control lysates two isoforms, differing in their mobility in gel, were detected for GluA1, GluA2 and GluA3 on treatment with EndoH: an upper band, corresponding to the mature isoform (as it acquired partial EndoH resistance), and a lower band, corresponding to the immature isoform (as it acquired no EndoH resistance). The ratio between the two bands thus is a measure for AMPAR subunit maturation. As such, we determined that GluA2 and GluA3 maturation was impaired in shRab39b-treated neurons compared with the control neurons (meanÂ±s.e.m., GluA2 shScramble: 0.96Â±0.05, shRab39b: 0.52Â±0.05; <italic>n</italic>=3; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.002; GluA3 shScramble: 1.0Â±0.07, shRab39b: 0.0Â±0.0; <italic>n</italic>=3; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>), while GluA1 maturation was not affected by the shRab39b silencing (meanÂ±s.e.m., shScramble: 1.29Â±0.21, shRab39b: 1.28Â±0.15; <italic>n</italic>=3; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next examined the role of the RAB39B-PICK1 tandem in post-Golgi trafficking of AMPAR subunits along dendrites. We noted that, in RAB39B-silenced cells, the increased PICK1 as well as GluA2 and GluA3 density at the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>) was mirrored by a decreased PICK1, GluA2 and GluA3 density along dendrites (meanÂ±s.e.m., PICK1 shScramble <italic>n</italic>=14: 17.82Â±1.13, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=15: 14.98Â±0.61; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.03; GluA2 shScramble <italic>n</italic>=10: 0.82Â±0.02, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=5: 0.49Â±0.02; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=2.8Eâ7; GluA3 shScramble <italic>n</italic>=7: 1.24Â±0.06, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=10: 0.62Â±0.07; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=1.6Eâ5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Likewise, downregulation of RAB39B resulted in a decrease in surface density of GluA2 as measured by immunostaining without permeabilization of the cells (meanÂ±s.e.m., GluA2 shScramble <italic>n</italic>=89: 0.88Â±0.02, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=70: 0.72Â±0.03; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.006). Curiously, surface expression of GluA1 slightly increased on RAB39B silencing (meanÂ±s.e.m., shScramble <italic>n</italic>=41: 0.62Â±0.02, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=40: 0.77Â±0.02; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>), mirrored by a significant increase along dendrites (meanÂ±s.e.m., GluA1 shScramble <italic>n</italic>=10: 0.87Â±0.02, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=10: 1.05Â±0.04; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.0007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). The reintroduction of RAB39B by co-transducing shRab39b-treated neurons with a cherryRab39b-rescue lentiviral particles recovered the intracellular distribution of PICK1 (shRab39b versus Rab39b-rescue <italic>n</italic>=8; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.002), GluA2 (shRab39b versus Rab39b-rescue <italic>n</italic>=11; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.004) and GluA3 (shRab39b versus Rab39b-rescue <italic>n</italic>=12; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.007) and GluA1 (shRab39b versus Rab39b-rescue <italic>n</italic>=10; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.006) and GluA2 (shRab39b versus Rab39b-rescue <italic>n</italic>=8; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.01) surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, downregulation of RAB39B has a mild effect on spine morphology without altering spine number and type (meanÂ±s.e.m., spine length shScramble <italic>n</italic>=26: 1.20Â±0.02, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=30: 1.12Â±0.02; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.05; spine width shScramble <italic>n</italic>=25: 0.68Â±0.01, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=29: 0.64Â±0.009; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.02; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
        <p>These results indicate that in neurons the RAB39B-PICK1 tandem directs trafficking specifically of GluA2/GluA3 heterotetramers to the Golgi and, consequently, regulates GluA2 cell surface expression and spine morphology.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>RAB39B determines AMPAR composition and synaptic transmission</title>
        <p>Since our results so far demonstrated that RAB39B is key to ensure efficient trafficking of GluA2/GluA3 to the Golgi compartment, and, hence, its cell surface expression, we reasoned that ultimately RAB39B controls the availability of GluA2 and thus AMPAR composition at the post-synapses. Because the subunit composition, in turn, determines Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of the AMPARs and therefore impacts on synaptic transmission, we asked whether RAB39B-PICK-directed trafficking of GluA2/GluA3 is key for glutamatergic synapses. To this end, we performed electrophysiological recordings on primary murine hippocampal neurons that were infected with the shRab39b or control shScramble lentiviruses at low doses to ensure that most pre-synaptic inputs would come from non-infected (unaltered) neurons, while post-synaptic outputs would come from infected (silenced) neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>). The amplitude of miniature EPSCs was slightly but significantly larger in RAB39B-silenced neurons (meanÂ±s.e.m. in pA, shScramble <italic>n</italic>=14: â17.1Â±1.1, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=13: â22.9Â±1.9; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8aâc</xref>). The miniature frequency, however, was unaffected, suggesting that indeed RAB39B silencing occurred mostly in post-synaptic neurons due to the low-density lentiviral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>). Interestingly, kinetic analysis of the miniature currents indicated that RAB39B silencing accelerated decay (meanÂ±s.e.m. in ms, shScramble <italic>n</italic>=14: 2.60Â±0.32, shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=13: 1.71Â±0.05; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) but not rise times of synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b,c</xref>). The specificity of shRab39b effect was determined using a rescue experiment. Electrophysiological recordings were carried out on primary murine hippocampal neurons that were infected with the shRab39b or control shScramble lentiviruses at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1 to ensure that pre-synaptic inputs and post-synaptic outputs come from infected (silenced) neurons and after 6 days in culture transfected with a flag-RAB39B-rescue, as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c,d</xref>). The reintroduction of RAB39B recovered the amplitude and kinetic of the miniature currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8dâg</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since RAB39B directs GluA2 traffic and thus cell surface expression, we attributed the electrophysiological changes on RAB39B silencing to an altered subunit composition of synaptic AMPARs. To test this hypothesis, we monitored inward rectification of AMPAR-mediated synaptic responses in organotypic hippocampal slices from mice that were injected in the CA1 with the relevant lentiviruses (shScramble or shRab39b) by evoked EPSCs, recorded at â60âmV and +40âmV. The ratio of synaptic responses at +40âmV over responses at â60âmV was calculated to serve as a rectification index (R.I.). We found a significant increase in the R.I. of RAB39B silenced neurons (meanÂ±s.e.m., uninfected <italic>n</italic>=6: 1.801Â±0.175; shScramble <italic>n</italic>=6: 1.403Â±0.166; shRab39b <italic>n</italic>=6: 2.998Â±0.297; ANOVA: <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8h,i</xref>), indicative of enrichment at synapses of inward rectifying AMPARs. Since GluA2-lacking AMPARs in fact are inward rectifying<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> we concluded that the alterations in synaptic transmission are due to a lowered GluA2 availability. This interpretation also fits with our observation that RAB39B down regulation leads to increased miniature EPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8aâg</xref>), in agreement with the higher conductance of GluA2-lacking AMPARs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Finally, we tested whether long-term depression (LTD) was altered in RAB39B down regulated cells, given the involvement of PICK1 in activity-dependent AMPAR endocytosis and LTD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. To this end, we assessed NMDAR-dependent LTD in shRab39b-, shScramble- and non-infected CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8j</xref>). After LTD induction (500 stimuli at 1âHz, with postsynaptic depolarization at â40âmV), AMPAR-mediated synaptic responses were equally depressed in the three conditions. These results suggest that, in contrast with PICK1, RAB39B is not required for LTD. Therefore, RAB39B does not appear to be involved in activity-dependent AMPAR endocytosis or recycling.</p>

      <p>Our results define RAB39B in tandem with its downstream effector PICK1 as a key molecule dedicated to GluA2 AMPAR subunit trafficking.

      <p>Subsequently, the remarkable inference from this study is that RAB39B interacting with PICK1 ensures selectively the GluA2/GluA3 AMPAR exit from the ER and its maturation entering into the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>).

However, rules governing subunit assembly and the progression of distinct AMPAR complexes through the secretory pathway are largely unknown. It is known that AMPAR subunits preferentially homodimerize soon after the translocation in the ER and tetramerize before ER exit in GluA1/GluA2 and GluA2/GluA3 complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Greger and coauthors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> found unexpected differences in the subcellular localization and ER export kinetics of the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits. Whereas GluA1 receptor exit the ER and traffic to the surface, GluA2 partly remains in the ER, suggesting the existence of an intracellular GluA2 reserve pool. GluA2 ER pool is, at least partly, associated with GluA3, whereas GluA1/A2 heteromers are mostly confined to post-ER compartments. Finally, to become competent for ER export, AMPARs need to co-assemble with auxiliary proteins. In the brain, auxiliary subunits of the stargazing/TARP (transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein) family and the cornichon family are physically associated with the channel and regulate their trafficking and gating<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Recently, Cornichon-2/-3 was described as cargo receptors to selectively bind GluA1, and not GluA2, in hippocampal neurons, allowing the forward trafficking of GluA1-containing AMPARs from the ER to Golgi and finally their synaptic expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Instead, our study identifies RAB39B as the first RAB GTPase regulating a vesicular trafficking step for the transport of GluA2/GluA3 heteromers into the secretory pathway.</p>
      <p>Finally, our analysis of the steady-state levels of AMPAR subunits at the post-synaptic membrane of <italic>Rab39b</italic> silencing hippocampal neurons demonstrates that the alteration in the RAB39B-mediated secretory pathway leads to a decrease in surface GluA2 density and an increase in GluA1 AMPAR subunits. This observation was confirmed functionally by the analysis of the rectification properties of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission resulting in an increased rectification index suggestive of an increased fraction of GluA2-lacking AMPARs at synapses related to the increased amplitude of miniature EPSCs. Because it was previously described that, in the hippocampus, heterotetramers of GluA1/GluA2 and GluA2/GluA3 subunits, together with a smaller contribution from GluA1 homomers, represent the most common combinations in excitatory synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, we could speculate that altering RAB39B-mediated early trafficking step of GluA2/GluA3, the result will be an increase in GluA1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable homomers.</p>
      <p>In fact, the AMPA-type glutamate receptors play a critical role in synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory by mediating the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission and by trafficking into and out of the synapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. The presence of GluA2 in heteromeric AMPAR renders the channel impermeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, thus influencing channel kinetic, channel conductance and synaptic transmission. In contrast, GluA2-lacking AMPAR is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable and is mostly observed in young animals or after an epoch of plasticity-inducing neuronal activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. In fact, our results describe a slight alteration in spine morphology, depicting a scenario of immature spines in shRab39b-treated neurons, as they are shorter and wider than control neurons. Previous studies described that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs are important in experience-dependent and synaptic plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. These studies suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPAR play a prominent role in maintaining circuits in a labile state where further plasticity can occur, thus promoting metaplasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Moreover, it was shown that the abnormal expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs is implicated in drug addiction and memory disorders, with significant implication in the development of therapeutic approaches to these disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. In addition, alteration of the relative proportion of AMPAR subunits after pathological insults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> or in response to physiological stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref> will shift the balance towards homomers and in turn alter the signalling landscape of the neuron.</p>
      <p>Altogether our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the maturation and the trafficking of GluA2/GluA3 AMPAR in the secretory pathway, and pave the way to explain the functional role of RAB39B in cognitive disorder.</p>
      <p>Unsolved questions remain still open. At first, what other molecules convey the transport competence to RAB39B? One possibility could be the involvement of additional downstream effectors proteins that give the directionality and the timing for RAB39BâPICK1âGluA2 complex movement. GM130 a <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi protein involved in accepting vesicles from the ER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>, as well as dynein/dynactin motor complex, driving microtubule-dependent trafficking from the ER to Golgi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref> and along dendrites to the post-synaptic sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref> or myosin Va<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref> involved in dendritic and post-synaptic actin-dependent trafficking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref> could be the most reliable factors. At present, RAB39B is required for the transport of GluA2-containing AMPAR from the ER to the Golgi, but we cannot assess its involvement from the Golgi to the neuronal surface. Future studies will undoubtedly be necessary to answer these questions as well as the availability of <italic>Rab39b</italic>-null mouse model to better define the link between RAB39B-mediated intracellular trafficking and cognitive disorders.</p>

        <p>Hippocampal slice cultures were prepared from postnatal day 5â7 mice C57BL/6N. After 1 day in culture every slice was transduced with lentiviral particles (shScramble or shRab39b). After 10â12 days in culture, simultaneous voltage-clamp whole-cell recordings were obtained from nearby infected and uninfected CA1 pyramidal neurons. Whole-cell recordings were made with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and electrophysiological data were collected with pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Experimental Procedures</xref> for details.</p>
