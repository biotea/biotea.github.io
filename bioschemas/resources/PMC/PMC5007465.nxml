      <abstract>
        <p>Human CtIP is a decisive factor in DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice by enabling DNA-end resection, the first step that differentiates homologous recombination (HR) from non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). To coordinate appropriate and timely execution of DNA-end resection, CtIP function is tightly controlled by multiple proteinâprotein interactions and post-translational modifications. Here, we identify the Cullin3 E3 ligase substrate adaptor Kelch-like protein 15 (KLHL15) as a new interaction partner of CtIP and show that KLHL15 promotes CtIP protein turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. A tripeptide motif (FRY) conserved across vertebrate CtIP proteins is essential for KLHL15-binding; its mutation blocks KLHL15-dependent CtIP ubiquitination and degradation. Consequently, DNA-end resection is strongly attenuated in cells overexpressing KLHL15 but amplified in cells either expressing a CtIP-FRY mutant or lacking KLHL15, thus impacting the balance between HR and NHEJ. Collectively, our findings underline the key importance and high complexity of CtIP modulation for genome integrity.</p>

  <body>
    <p>To preserve genome integrity, cells have evolved a complex system of DNA damage detection, signalling and repair: the DNA damage response (DDR). Following genotoxic insults, upstream DDR factors rapidly assemble at damaged chromatin, where they activate lesion-specific DNA repair pathways as well as checkpoints to delay cell cycle progression, or, if DNA repair fails, to trigger apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most lethal types of DNA damage with the potential to cause genomic instability, a hallmark and enabling characteristic of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. DSBs are induced by ionizing irradiation (IR) or frequently arise during replication when forks collide with persistent single-strand breaks, such as those generated by camptothecin (CPT), a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. To maintain genome stability, cells have evolved two major pathways dealing with the repair of DSBs: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. NHEJ is the canonical pathway during G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and repairs the majority of IR-induced DSBs. In this process, broken DNA ends are religated regardless of sequence homology, making NHEJ potentially mutagenic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. HR, instead, is an error-free repair pathway, which requires the presence of an undamaged homologous template, usually the sister chromatid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Thus, HR is restricted to S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and preferentially repairs DSBs resulting from replication fork collapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The first step of HR, termed DNA-end resection, involves the processing of one DSB end to generate 3â²single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails that, after being coated by the Rad51 recombinase, mediate homology search and invasion into the sister chromatid strand. DNA-end resection is initiated by the combined action of the MRE11âRAD50âNBS1 (MRN) complex and CtIP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, and is a key determinant of DSB repair pathway choice, as it commits cells to HR by preventing NHEJ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
    <p>The ubiquitination and neddylation machineries have recently emerged as a crucial players for maintaining genome stability by orchestrating key DDR events including various DNA repair pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Ubiquitination of target proteins involves the concerted action of three factors: E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin ligases, which determine substrate specificity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Among the estimated &gt;600 human E3s, Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) are the most prevalent class, controlling a plethora of biological processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Although few CRLs, in particular those built up by Cullin1 (also called SCF complex) and Cullin4, were shown to function in cell cycle checkpoint control and nucleotide excision repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, a role for CRLs in the regulation of DSB repair has so far remained largely elusive.</p>
    <p>Here, we identify the human Kelch-like protein 15 (KLHL15), a substrate-specific adaptor for Cullin3 (CUL3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligases, as a novel CtIP interaction partner. We show that CUL3-KLHL15 catalyses polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of CtIP. Mechanistically, we find that KLHL15 recognizes a short-tripeptide motif (FRY) located in the conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) of CtIP and that mutation of this motif protects CtIP from KLHL15-dependent degradation resulting in prolonged CtIP protein half-life and, consequently, excessive DNA-end resection. We further demonstrate that cells lacking KLHL15 phenocopy the behaviour of FRY mutant cells, including reduced NHEJ efficiency as a consequence of CtIP protein accumulation and increased resection. Finally, we provide evidence that PIN1-dependent isomerization of CtIP facilitates its targeting by CUL3-KLHL15. Taken together, our results uncover a critical role for CUL3-KLHL15 ubiquitin ligase in governing CtIP DNA-end resection activity and DSB repair pathway choice.</p>

        <title>CtIP interacts with the CUL3 substrate adaptor KLHL15</title>
        <p>To gain further insights into the regulation of DNA-end resection in human cells, we searched for novel interacting partners of CtIP by tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. To this end, we generated a stable HEK293 cell line inducibly expressing Strep-HA-tagged CtIP. To reduce the number of false positive proteinâprotein interactions, we used a tetracycline concentration (10ângâml<sup>â1</sup>) at which the expression levels were comparable to those of endogenous CtIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Remarkably, besides the CtIP bait protein, only two proteins were identified with multiple peptides in two independent mass spectrometry analyses, Kelch-like protein 15 (KLHL15) and Cullin3 (CUL3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). KLHL15 belongs to a family of 42 human proteins that possess an N-terminal BTB-BACK domain and a C-terminal Kelch domain comprising five to six Kelch repeats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Kelch-like proteins bind CUL3 through their BTB-BACK domain, whereas substrate recognition is mediated by the Kelch domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Importantly, many Kelch-like proteins function as substrate-specific adaptors in CUL3-based E3 ligase complexes to catalyse protein ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p>
        <p>To confirm the result of our proteomic analysis, suggesting that CtIP and CUL3-KLHL15 form a complex, we first performed an immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment and found that endogenous KLHL15 and CUL3 efficiently co-precipitated with GFP-tagged CtIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Similarly, endogenous CtIP was successfully recovered following co-IP of FLAG-tagged KLHL15, but was not present in co-immunocomplexes containing CUL3 and KLHL22 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>), which is the closest ortholog of KLHL15 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Next, we generated two FLAG-KLHL15 truncation mutants lacking either the Kelch (ÎKelch) or the BTB-BACK (ÎB+B) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). As expected, CUL3-KLHL15 interaction was largely abolished in the ÎB+B mutant, whereas CtIP binding to KLHL15 was strongly impaired in the ÎKelch mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that direct interactions between the individual KLHL15 domains and CUL3 or CtIP were weakened in both truncation mutants, indicating that the structural integrity of full-length KLHL15 is important for stable ternary complex formation between CtIP, KLHL15 and CUL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In case of the ÎB+B mutant, this could in part be explained by the fact that the BTB adaptor domain was shown to be required for the efficient dimerization and activation of CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. To identify specific amino acid residues in KLHL15 that mediate binding to CUL3, we performed multiple sequence alignments of various human BTB-Kelch proteins and the MATH-BTB protein SPOP. This revealed the presence of a conserved, paired helix structure following the BTB domain of KLHL15, which is predicted to constitute a CUL3-interacting box (3-box) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Similar to what we observed for the ÎB+B truncation mutant, substituting either asparagine 132 or isoleucine 136 for alanine (N132A and I136A, respectively) in the 3-box of full-length FLAG-KLHL15 decreased its interaction with CUL3, especially with the neddylated form of CUL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,e</xref>). Neddylation, the covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to proteins, has been demonstrated to be essential for the activation of most cullin-based E3 ligases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Next, through sequence alignments of the Kelch domain of human and zebrafish KLHL15 with the respective Keap1 (alias KLHL19) homologues, we located glycine 386 in the third repeat (G386) and tyrosine 552 (Y552) in the sixth repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). Importantly, mutation of these residues in Keap1 disrupted its ability to bind Nrf2 and repress Nrf2-dependent transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Consistently, we observed that KLHL15-G386C and -Y552A mutants were defective in CtIP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,f</xref>).</p>
        <p>In the course of these experiments, we noticed that endogenous CtIP protein levels were differentially altered in cells transfected with KLHL15 expression constructs with a marked decrease in presence of wild-type (wt) KLHL15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1dâf</xref>). To further address this issue, we measured CtIP protein stability using a cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay and found that CtIP shows a decreased protein half-life and is more rapidly degraded in cells overexpressing KLHL15-wt than in cells transfected with KLHL15-Y552A mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated that CUL3-KLHL15 specifically interacts with CtIP and controls its protein turnover.</p>

        <title>CRL3<sup>KLHL15</sup> ubiquitin ligase targets CtIP for degradation</title>
        <p>To confirm our above results, using a different cell system, we generated stable U2OS cells expressing doxycycline (Dox)-inducible GFP-tagged KLHL15. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, we detected a significant decrease of endogenous CtIP protein levels already at 24âh following induction of KLHL15 expression and found that this was partially restored by addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Similarly, treatment of KLHL15-induced cells with MLN-4924, a small molecule inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, greatly increased CtIP protein stability, indicating that CtIP degradation by KLHL15 requires CUL3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Specifically, our results indicated that CUL3 acts together with KLHL15 in promoting CtIP degradation, as its downregulation stabilized CtIP in cells overexpressing KLHL15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Consistently, transfection of three siRNA oligos targeting different regions in the KLHL15 transcript reproducibly increased CtIP protein levels in parental U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>); without affecting cell cycle distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Of note, we only detected a robust KLHL15 protein signal in the chromatin-enriched fraction, suggesting a role for KLHL15 in targeting substrates predominantly in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Furthermore, using stable U2OS<sup>GFP-KLHL15</sup> cells, siRNA oligos targeting the coding sequence of KLHL15 (#1 and #2) efficiently depleted exogenous KLHL15, thereby restoring CtIP protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In contrast, CtIP was still degraded upon induction of GFP-KLHL15 in cells transfected with siRNA against the 3â²-untranslated region of KLHL15 (#3) specifically silencing endogenously expressed KLHL15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Consistent with a key function of KLHL15 in regulating CtIP protein turnover, we observed that the half-life of CtIP was prolonged after KLHL15 downregulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
        <p>Proteasome-dependent proteolysis typically requires the conjugation of ubiquitin to the target protein. Therefore, we next addressed whether KLHL15 mediates CtIP ubiquitination <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we transfected HEK293 cells inducibly expressing GFP-CtIP with histidine-tagged ubiquitin and analysed the level of CtIP ubiquitination after Ni-NTA pull-down under denaturing conditions. As previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, we readily detected polyubiquitinated species of CtIP upon MG-132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). In contrast, however, CtIP ubiquitination was severely impaired in KLHL15- or CUL3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). To prove that the CUL3-KLHL15 E3 ligase complex is sufficient to catalyse CtIP ubiquitination <italic>in vitro</italic>, we expressed and purified recombinant FLAG-CtIP and MBP-KLHL15 from HEK293T and Sf9 insect cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Recombinant CUL3/RBX1 was neddylated <italic>in vitro</italic> using the purified NEDD8 (N8) conjugation system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Next, CtIP and KLHL15 were mixed with CUL3-N8/RBX1 complex and incubated with ATP, ubiquitin, E1 (UBE1) and E2 (Cdc34 or UbcH5b) enzymes. Western blot analysis revealed that CtIP was extensively modified when all components of the ubiquitination machinery were present in the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Moreover, we found that this reaction was specifically catalysed by KLHL15 <italic>in vitro</italic>, since CtIP ubiquitination was not supported by KLHL21 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>, lanes 11â13). As it is well-established that proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation are often conjugated to lysine 48 (K48) linked ubiquitin chains, we compared the efficiency of CtIP polyubiquitination by CUL3-KLHL15 between K48-only and K48R ubiquitin mutants using the same assay. We observed that CtIP ubiquitination was almost completely abrogated in presence of the K48R mutant, whereas chain formation was indistinguishable between wild-type and K48-only ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). Collectively, our results demonstrated that CUL3-KLHL15 promotes K48-linked CtIP polyubiquitination leading to its proteasome-dependent degradation.</p>

        <title>CtIP protein accumulates in KLHL15 knockout cells</title>
        <p>Since HEK293 cells were used in our proteomics screen for proteins that interact with CtIP, we rationalized that KLHL15 is adequately expressed in this cell line. Thus, we generated stable HEK293 KLHL15 knockout cells (HEK293<sup>Cas9/<italic>KLHL15Î</italic></sup>) using the CRISPR method introduced by Munoz <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> We first screened several, single-cell clones for Cas9-induced disruption of KLHL15 protein by western blotting performed with a homemade rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant fragment (amino acids 300â604) of human KLHL15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Remarkably, and consistent with our previous findings, we observed a perfect positive correlation between the absence of KLHL15 and increase of CtIP protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To further prove that the <italic>KLHL15</italic> gene was efficiently knocked out, the CRISPR-targeted genomic locus in HEK293<sup>Cas9/<italic>KLHL15Î</italic></sup> clone 1 was PCR-amplified and subjected to deep-sequencing demonstrating that biallelic <italic>KLHL15</italic>-editing resulted in two truncated KLHL15 proteins harbouring only the N-terminal BTB domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Consistent with our previous data in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), KLHL15 is strongly associated with the chromatin compartment in HEK293 cells, further indicating that KLHL15 targets CtIP for ubiquitination and degradation in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Notably, we found that KLHL15 loss does not affect cell cycle progression and, vice versa, that KLHL15 is expressed throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c,d</xref>). Finally, we observed that CtIP protein half-life was dramatically prolonged in KLHL15 knockout cells and that MG-132 treatment did not alter CtIP protein stability in those cells, further supporting the importance of KLHL15 in governing CtIP protein turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>

        <title>KLHL15 expression sensitizes cells to CPT by inhibiting resection</title>
        <p>To investigate the role of KLHL15 in the DDR, we generated U2OS clones inducibly expressing GFP-tagged KLHL15-G386C and -Y552A, two mutants defective in CtIP binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). However, in contrast to KLHL15-wt and KLHL15-Y552A, which localized predominantly in the nucleus and were present in the chromatin-enriched fraction, KLHL15-G386C was exclusively cytoplasmic and therefore excluded from further studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings, CtIP protein levels were reduced in KLHL15-wt compared with KLHL15-Y552A mutant cells already at 24âh following induction of KLHL15 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
        <p>In S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, CtIP is required for the processing of DSBs into ssDNA, triggering HR. Consequently, CtIP-deficient cells display reduced DNA-end resection and hypersensitivity towards CPT, a DNA topoisomerase inhibitor causing DSBs specifically at the replication fork<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In large agreement with that, we found that cells overexpressing KLHL15-wt, therefore harbouring very little amounts of CtIP, were hypersensitive to CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In response to DSBs, CtIP is required for RPA2 hyperphosphorylation, a commonly accepted marker for DNA-end resection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Strikingly, the level of phosphorylated RPA2 upon CPT treatment was significantly reduced in KLHL15-wt compared with KLHL15-Y552A mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). Next, using a recently established flow-cytometry-based method to detect RPA retention on damaged chromatin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, we observed that the percentage of CPT-induced RPA-positive cells was specifically reduced upon induction of KLHL15-wt expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), indicative of DNA-end resection defect. To directly measure the formation of ssDNA in response to CPT treatment, we employed the same approach but instead immunostained bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labelled cells with an anti-BrdU antibody. Consistently, the BrdU signal was dramatically reduced in cells overexpressing KLHL15-wt, but not in the Y552A mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Importantly, the reported cellular phenotypes caused by KLHL15-wt overexpression were generally milder but followed the same trend as those caused by CtIP downregulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4dâf</xref>). On the basis of these findings, we analysed the effect of KLHL15 expression on the efficiency of DSB repair by HR in established reporter cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. As expected, transient transfection of these cells with KLHL15-wt, but not with KLHL15-Y552A, resulted in a significant reduction in HR frequency compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that KLHL15 overexpression is detrimental to DNA-end resection and HR, most likely caused by enhanced CtIP proteasomal degradation.</p>

        <title>The C-terminal domain of CtIP mediates binding to KLHL15</title>
        <p>To gain further insights into the mechanism by which KLHL15 promotes CtIP protein turnover, we sought to identify the region within CtIP responsible for KLHL15 interaction. Human CtIP has two recognizable domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), a coiled-coil domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and a highly conserved Sae2/Ctp1-like CTD, which is required for DNA-end resection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In addition, CtIP contains several short sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) that are important for CtIP tetramerization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> or for physical interactions with other proteins, such as FANCD2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), PIN1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), BRCA1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) and CDH1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Interestingly, by performing MBP-KLHL15 pull-down experiments from HEK293T cell lysates expressing different CtIP constructs, we found that GFP-CtIP-wt and GFP-CtIP-ÎN (deleted of amino acids (aa) 153â322) interacted with KLHL15, whereas GFP-CtIP-ÎC1 lacking the entire CTD (aa 790â897) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Moreover, when the same constructs were cotransfected with FLAG-KLHL15 into HEK293T cells, quantification of protein levels revealed that CtIP-ÎN showed rather variable abundance, whereas CtIP-ÎC1 was resistant to KLHL15 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). In fact, increased protein stability of a C-terminally truncated form of CtIP has been reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Consistently, we observed that ubiquitination of CtIP-ÎC1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>) was decreased compared with CtIP-wt. These results indicated that the CTD in CtIP is required for KLHL15 binding and subsequent ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of CtIP.</p>
        <p>To narrow down our search for a putative KLHL15-interaction motif in CtIP, we generated two additional CtIP C-terminal truncation mutants. Interestingly, GFP-CtIP-ÎC3 (aa 1â863) was still efficiently pulled-down and degraded by KLHL15, whereas GFP-CtIP-ÎC2 (aa 1â812) was not, suggesting that KLHL15 binds to a small region in the CTD of CtIP encompassing residues 813â863 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). In addition, by using pull-down assays, we found that a synthetic 15-mer peptide consisting of CtIP residues 830â844 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) strongly interacted with GFP-KLHL15 expressed in cells as well as with endogenous KLHL15 in pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). Remarkably, the short peptide was effective in outcompeting the binding of endogenous CtIP to MBP-KLHL15, indicating that its amino acid sequence contained key residues required for KLHL15 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>).</p>

        <title>Tyrosine residue 842 of CtIP is essential for KLHL15 binding</title>
        <p>To date, the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulatory subunit Bâ²-beta is the only described substrate for the CUL3-KLHL15 E3 ubiquitin ligase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. This study established a tyrosine residue within a conserved stretch of three amino acids (FRY) as being critically important for KLHL15-mediated degradation of PP2A/Bâ²-beta. Strikingly, when we looked for the presence of a similar motif in human CtIP, sequence alignments highlighted a well-conserved FRY motif (aa 840â842) located exactly within the region previously shown to mediate KLHL15 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Of note, CtIP homologues in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> did not contain a FRY motif at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), which could be partly explained by the fact that BTB-BACK-Kelch family proteins are extremely rare in worms and completely absent in slime molds and yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether the CtIP FRY motif is involved in KLHL15 recognition, we first generated a triple-alanine substitution mutant (GFP-CtIP-AAA) and observed that the protein was partially resistant to KLHL15-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Next, we focused on elucidating the role of Y842 in being the prime determinant for the physical interaction between CtIP and KLHL15, as shown for Y52 in PP2A/Bâ²-beta<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Indeed, pull-down assays using bacterially expressed GST-CtIP-CTD as bait showed that the replacement of tyrosine 842 with alanine (Y842A) severely impaired binding of the CUL3-KLHL15 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>), whereas the previously established interaction with MRE11 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>) remained largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b,c</xref>). Next, we subjected cell lysates expressing GFP-CtIP to IP using GFP antibody beads and found that the Y842A mutant exhibited reduced binding to endogenous KLHL15 and CUL3 as compared with wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Likewise, MBP-pull-down assays showed decreased interaction between KLHL15 and CtIP-Y842A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Importantly, using the same approach, we found that replacing Y842 with a non-phosphorylatable phenylalanine completely restored KLHL15-CtIP interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>), indicating that Y842 phosphorylation is not required for KLHL15 binding, whereas the side-chain aromatic ring at this position is. As a functional consequence of reduced KLHL15 interaction, we observed that the CtIP-Y842A mutant was partially defective in polyubiquitination <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Consistent with these findings, CtIP-Y842A was resistant to KLHL15 overexpression, whereas CtIP-Y842F was degraded to the same extent as CtIP-wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>). To examine whether the FRY motif indeed constitutes a canonical docking site for KLHL15, we constructed two additional CtIP mutants in which F840 and R839, located in the conserved neighbouring 'RHR' motif, were also substituted with alanine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We again cotransfected the GFP-tagged versions together with FLAG-KLHL15 and found that F840A behaved identical to Y842A in terms of being resistant to KLHL15 overexpression, whereas R839A was degraded to a similar extent as compare to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that the FRY motif and Y842 in particular are essential for KLHL15 recognition and subsequent degradation of CtIP by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.</p>

        <title>KLHL15 regulates DNA-end resection and DSB repair</title>
        <p>To investigate the role of CtIP ubiquitination by KLHL15 in response to DNA damage, we generated stable U2OS cell clones inducibly expressing siRNA-resistant GFP-tagged CtIP-wt or CtIP-Y842A. Importantly, cell cycle profiles, CtIP nuclear localization and accumulation to DSB-containing tracks generated by laser microirradiation were highly similar in both cell lines, indicating that these transgenes are functional (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7aâc</xref>). Interestingly, cycloheximide chase experiments revealed that CtIP-Y842A had a much prolonged half-life compared with CtIP-wt, a phenotype reminiscent of the reduced CtIP protein turnover in KLHL15 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>). However, CtIP-Y842A efficiently rescued CPT hypersensitivity of CtIP-depleted cells, suggesting that increased CtIP protein stability does not negatively affect CtIP function in DSB processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7e</xref>). Next, we compared CPT-induced ATM/ATR activation between the two cell lines by western blotting to assess whether impairment of KLHL15 binding to CtIP has an impact on DNA damage signalling. Interestingly, we found that ATR-mediated CHK1 and RPA2 phosphorylation was increased in CtIP-Y842A mutant compared with CtIP-wt cells, indicative of elevated DNA-end resection, whereas ATM autophosphorylation remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Moreover, Y842A rescued defective RPA2 hyperphosphorylation in CtIP-depleted cells to a much higher extent as compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Next, we analysed RPA accumulation on damaged chromatin as well as the formation of ssDNA by flow-cytometry. Consistent with our immunoblot analysis, Y842A led to increased RPA chromatinization and ssDNA formation upon CPT treatment, further demonstrating that impaired CtIP protein turnover causes hyper-resection of DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Underscoring the importance of KLHL15 in regulating DNA-end resection, we observed that KLHL15 knockout cells display elevated RPA2 phosphorylation levels as compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Importantly, siRNA-mediated downregulation of CtIP in KLHL15 knockout cells suppressed the hyper-resection phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>), indicating that KLHL15 limits resection by promoting CtIP proteasomal degradation and that CtIP is most likely the key substrate of KLHL15 involved in the DDR. Next, using the flow-cytometry-based assay to quantify DNA-end resection, we observed that the amount of RPA-bound ssDNA in KLHL15 knockout cells was far higher than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). Furthermore, loss of KLHL15 resulted in a marked increase of RPA2 hyperphosphorylation after treatment with ionizing radiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). DNA-end resection is inhibitory to the repair of DSBs by NHEJ. With regards to this view and since NHEJ is the predominant repair mechanism for IR-induced two-ended DSBs, we next addressed the survival of KLHL15 knockout cells following IR treatment using clonogenic assay. Remarkably, HEK293<sup>Cas9/<italic>KLHL15Î</italic></sup>cells were hypersensitive to IR, indicative of compromised NHEJ activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g</xref>). To investigate whether regulation of CtIP protein turnover by KLHL15 plays a direct role in DSB repair pathway choice, we measured NHEJ or HR frequencies in HEK293 GFP-reporter cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. First, we discovered that KLHL15 knockdown caused a significant reduction in NHEJ, similar to that seen after depletion of the canonical NHEJ factor XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7h</xref>). In large agreement with this finding, NHEJ frequency was decreased upon overexpression the CtIP-Y842A mutant, further supporting the concept that excessive DNA-end resection is counterproductive for NHEJ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>). Next, we performed HR reporter assays and observed that downregulation of KLHL15 coincided with increased HR efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7i</xref>), whereas CtIP-Y842A had no major impact on homology-directed repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7g</xref>). Altogether, this data provide evidence that KLHL15 is a key factor governing DNA-end resection and DSB repair pathway choice through regulating CtIP ubiquitination and, ultimately, CtIP protein turnover.</p>

        <title>PIN1 and KLHL15 cooperate in promoting CtIP degradation</title>
        <p>In an earlier study, we have reported that PIN1, a phosphorylation-specific prolyl isomerase, promotes CtIP degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, the responsible E3 ligase working in concert with PIN1 in CtIP ubiquitination has not been identified yet. Specifically, we demonstrated that disruption of this regulatory function by PIN1 depletion or expression of a CtIP mutant refractory to PIN1 binding resulted in hyper-resection and reduced NHEJ, meanwhile PIN1 overexpression suppressed resection and HR. As these cellular phenotypes are highly reminiscent of those observed in this study, we speculated whether CtIP isomerization by PIN1 may facilitate KLHL15-dependent CtIP degradation. Interestingly, we found that CtIP S276A/T315A (2A) impaired in PIN1 binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> was partially resistant to KLHL15 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). In contrast, the CtIP KEN-box mutant (K467A) defective in CDH1 binding and subsequent polyubiquitination by the APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup> E3 ligase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, was as efficiently degraded by KLHL15 as the wild-type CtIP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). This result indicated a possible functional connection between PIN1 and KLHL15 in controlling CtIP protein turnover. To address this further, we next investigated whether CtIP isomerization by PIN1 may foster CtIP-KLHL15 interaction. MBP-pull-down assays revealed that the GFP-CtIP-2A mutant protein was fully proficient in binding to recombinant KLHL15 purified from insect cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). Interestingly, however, KLHL15-CtIP interaction was reduced in cells depleted for PIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>), indicating that isomerization of CtIP is not essential for physical interaction between KLHL15 and CtIP, yet that it somehow aids the formation of a ternary CUL3-KLHL15-CtIP complex in cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, simultaneous downregulation of KLHL15 and PIN1 did not further reduce CtIP ubiquitination when compared with the single knockdowns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). As reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, PIN1 overexpression destabilized CtIP particularly in response to DSBs causing reduced RPA2 hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>, lanes 1â4). We now observed that both phenotypes can be reversed by transfecting PIN1 into KLHL15 knockout cells, indicating that PIN1-mediated CtIP degradation after DNA damage requires KLHL15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>, lanes 5â8). Taken together, these experiments suggested that the PIN1 isomerase, at least in certain scenarios, facilitates CtIP ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation through the CUL3-KLHL15 E3 ligase.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Ubiquitination and its crosstalk with other post-translational modifications have recently emerged as key regulatory mechanisms in the cellular response to DNA damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. As a consequence, defects in the ubiquitination machinery have been shown to be associated with reduced cellular survival and increased genomic instability in response to DSBs, mainly due to impaired proteinâprotein interactions causing mislocalization of DSB repair factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Of note, these processes mostly involve non-proteasomal ubiquitin signalling instead of the classical function of E3 ubiquitin ligases in targeting substrates to proteasome-dependent degradation.</p>
      <p>Here, we demonstrate that proteasomal degradation triggered by a CRL3 E3 ligase plays a prominent role in the regulation of DSB repair. Specifically, our results indicate that the BTB-BACK-Kelch protein KLHL15 acts as an adaptor for CUL3 to target the DNA-end resection factor CtIP for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). We further define the molecular basis of the CUL3-KLHL15-CtIP ternary complex by showing that KLHL15 interacts with CUL3 <italic>via</italic> its canonical â3-box' motif and recruits CtIP to CUL3 via its C-terminal Kelch domain. Moreover, our data reveals that the FRY tripeptide sequence, present in the C-terminus of CtIP, may serve as general KLHL15 docking motifs present in substrate proteins targeted by the CUL3-KLHL15 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Specifically, we report that CtIP-Y842, located within a conserved âFRY motif', is essential for KLHL15-mediated CtIP ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.</p>
      <p>CtIP is required for DNA-end resection, the initial step of homology-directed repair, and is therefore a key factor in controlling repair pathway choice as processed DSB ends can no longer serve as substrates for NHEJ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Collectively, our findings support a model in which the CUL3-KLHL15 ubiquitin ligase governs the turnover of CtIP to fine-tune the balance between HR and NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). Accordingly, cells that express high levels of KLHL15 exhibit unscheduled and enhanced CtIP degradation, ultimately leading to strong defects in DNA-end resection and increased channelling of DSB repair from error-free HR into error-prone NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). In contrast, cells either lacking KLHL15 or expressing a mutant of CtIP refractory to KLHL15 binding display aberrant accumulation of CtIP and excessive DNA-end resection, thereby suppressing DSB repair by NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). Recently, a similar regulatory function in DSB repair has been proposed for Keap1, another CUL3 substrate adaptor. However, rather than involving the proteasome, the authors of this study showed that Keap1-dependent ubiquitination of PALB2 suppresses its interaction with BRCA1, thereby prohibiting HR in G1 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.</p>
      <p>Previously, we reported that PIN1 isomerase tips the balance between HR and NHEJ by a very similar mechanism involving CtIP ubiquitination and degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Here, we provide circumstantial evidence that CUL3-KLHL15 is the responsible E3 ligase operating in conjunction with PIN1 to control CtIP protein turnover. Interestingly, we find that isomerization of CtIP is not essential for the direct physical interaction between CtIP and KLHL15, but that PIN1 is important for stable complex formation of CUL3-KLHL15-CtIP, thereby reinforcing CtIP polyubiquitination and degradation in specific cellular contexts. For instance, as PIN1 binding to CtIP requires initial phosphorylation of CtIP by proline-directed kinases (for example, cyclin-dependent kinases), we previously proposed that PIN1 triggers CtIP ubiquitination and degradation predominantly upon DNA damage in late S and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. We now conclude that PIN1 and CUL3-KLHL15 collaborate in fine adjusting CtIP protein stability to attenuate DNA-end resection activity whenever NHEJ is the preferred mode of DSB repair. Interestingly, a similar mechanism has been described for PML degradation, which, in response to hypoxia, gets first isomerized by PIN1 and then ubiquitinated by the CUL3-KLHL20 E3 ubiquitin ligase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Clearly, further investigations are required to elucidate how, at the molecular level, isomerization-induced conformational changes in CtIP stimulate its ubiquitination by CUL3-KLHL15 interaction.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it also remains to be determined under which physiological conditions CUL3-KLHL15 primes CtIP for degradation in otherwise unperturbed cells. So far, studies on Keap1 and KLHL20 revealed a possible mode for regulating ubiquitination, which occurs at the level of the CUL3 adaptor rather than at the level of the substrate. CUL3-Keap1 constitutively targets Nrf2 until oxidative stress modifies several redox-sensitive cysteine residues of Keap1 interfering with the E3-ligase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Similarly, DAPK is constitutively degraded by CUL3-KLHL20, until stress-induced interferon production causes sequestering of KLHL20 into PML nuclear bodies and thus away from its substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. In analogy to that, one could envision that KLHL15 controls the basal protein level of CtIP to keep DNA-end resection in check until certain stimuli modulate CUL3-KLHL15 ubiquitin ligase activity to either accelerate or delay CtIP protein turnover, thereby guiding DSB repair towards either NHEJ or HR. Furthermore, we observed that KLHL15 is predominantly chromatin-bound, suggesting that it may only target CtIP for degradation in genomic loci where error-prone repair by NHEJ is not detrimental to the cell. On the other hand, KLHL15 may be absent from transcriptionally active chromatin to allow DNA-end resection and HR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>.</p>
      <p>We also anticipate that KLHL15 function may be regulated at multiple levels, including gene expression and subcellular localization, as previously reported for KLHL20 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). Along this line, KLHL15 mRNA levels were reported to be highest in lung, muscle and spleen, suggesting tissue-specific regulation of KLHL15 expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Interestingly, publicly available gene expression databases, such as MediSapiens, indicate highest KLHL15 expression levels predominantly in hematopoietic stem cells and in all four main types of leukemia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ist.medisapiens.com/#ENSG00000174010">http://ist.medisapiens.com/#ENSG00000174010</ext-link>). Notably, the role for CtIP ubiquitination by KLHL15 in the regulation of DSB repair was most likely acquired later during evolution, as both KLHL15 as well as the KLHL15-binding motif in CtIP (FRY) are highly conserved in vertebrates but missing in yeast and worms.</p>
      <p>Based on our data and the study of Oberg <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> on KLHL15-dependent degradation of PP2A/B'-beta, we further hypothesize that the FRY tripeptide sequence may constitute a consensus KLHL15-Kelch domain interaction motif. In analogy to this, the CUL3 adaptor Keap1 recognizes its substrates including NRF2 and PALB2 via a conserved E(S/T)GE motif<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. Moreover, we demonstrate that a CtIP-Y842F mutant is proficient in being targeted for degradation by KLHL15, excluding the possibility that Y842 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for KLHL15 binding. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of Y842 may negatively interfere with CtIP-KLHL15 interaction. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition of substrate recruitment to CRL3s by phosphorylation has been previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. For instance, NRF2 threonine phosphorylation of the aforementioned ETGE motif disrupts its interaction with Keap1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). It did also not escape our notice that the KLHL15-binding motif is in immediate proximity to an 'RHR' motif recently shown to be important for <italic>S. pombe</italic> Ctp1 binding to DNA <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. However, based on the fact that the 'FRY motif' is not conserved in yeast and considering that, according to our data, CtIP-R839A is still degraded by KLHL15, we think it is reasonable to conclude that CtIP ubiquitination by KLHL15 (mediated through the 'FRY motif') and CtIP binding to DNA (mediated through the 'RHR motif') are mutually exclusive events in the regulation of DNA-end resection.</p>
      <p>Lastly, our findings may have important therapeutic implications for some cancer types displaying KLHL15 overexpression. For example, high KLHL15 protein levels may render cancer cells hypersensitive to DNA topoisomerase inhibitors. Likewise, mutations of KLHL15 may lead to aberrant activation of DNA-end resection and HR-mediated DSB repair, which in turn could again provide the opportunity to design more effective personalized therapeutic strategies. In this respect, over 90 cancer-associated somatic mutations of KLHL15 are currently recorded in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.sanger.ac.uk">www.cancer.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>), but their molecular effects on cancer pathogenesis require further investigations.</p>

Neddylated CUL3 in complex with RBX1 was produced as described before. In brief, full-length CUL3, tagged with an N-terminal PreScission-cleavable StrepII2x tag, and RBX1 were cloned into a pFBDM multibac transfer vector. Following the generation of recombinant baculoviruses, CUL3/RBX1 complexes were expressed and purified from high five insect cells following standard Strep-Tactin affinity, ion exchange and Superdex200 size exclusion chromatography procedures. Neddylation of CUL3/RBX1 was performed by incubating 10âÎ¼M CUL3/RBX1, 0.5âÎ¼M APPB1/UBA3 (NEDD8-specific activating enzyme E1), 1âÎ¼M UBC12 (NEDD8-specific conjugating enzyme E2) and 20âÎ¼M NEDD8 at room temperature for 10âmin in buffer containing 100âmM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 100âmM NaCl, 2.5âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 150âmM ATP. The neddylated CUL3-N8/RBX1 was subsequently purified by Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography with the untagged neddylation reagents retained in the flow through<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Full-length wild-type human KLHL21 was cloned into a pGEX-5 expression vector and expressed in BL21 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The cells were lysed by sonication in the presence of protease inhibitors and lysozyme. The soluble supernatant was bound to a 5âml GST HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) with a flow rate of 1âmlâmin<sup>â1</sup>. The column was washed with 20 column volumes (CV) of washing buffer and eluted with five CV of washing buffer supplemented with 10âmM reduced L-gluthatione (AppliChem). The eluted GST-KLHL21 was incubated in a 1:50 molar ratio with GST-tagged PreScisscion protease at 4âÂ°C and the buffer exchanged by dialysis into 150âmM NaCl, 20âmM HEPES pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 2âmM DTT. To remove cleaved GST and GST-PreScission proteins, the sample was run through a GST HiTrap column a second time, and purified KLHL21 was collected in the flow-through. The CtIP substrate was purified as follows: NP-40 lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-CtIP were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) for 1âh at 4âÂ°C. The resin was washed four times with NTEN500 buffer (0.5% NP-40, 0.1âmM EDTA, 20âmM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500âmM NaCl) and once with TEN100 buffer. FLAG-CtIP was eluted with 3xFLAG peptides (Sigma) in TBS. If not indicated otherwise, ubiquitination reactions were performed at 37âÂ°C for 90âmin with 400ânM of FLAG-CtIP, 250ânM of KLHL15 or KLHL21, 200ânM of neddylated CUL3/RBX1, 250ânM UbE1 (Lifesensor), 500ânM UbcH5b or 2âÎ¼M Cdc34 and 75âÎ¼M ubiquitin wild-type or mutants (Bostonbiochem). The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer supplemented with 20âmM DTT and boiling for 5âmin at 95âÂ°C and analysed by SDSâPAGE followed by immunoblotting on PVDF membrane (Amersham).</p>
