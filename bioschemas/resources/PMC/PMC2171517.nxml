        <p>Mutations in <italic>GDAP1</italic> lead to severe forms of the peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), which is characterized by heterogeneous phenotypes, including pronounced axonal damage and demyelination. We show that neurons and Schwann cells express ganglioside-induced differentiation associated protein 1 (GDAP1), which suggest that both cell types may contribute to the mixed features of the disease. GDAP1 is located in the mitochondrial outer membrane and regulates the mitochondrial network. Overexpression of GDAP1 induces fragmentation of mitochondria without inducing apoptosis, affecting overall mitochondrial activity, or interfering with mitochondrial fusion. The mitochondrial fusion proteins, mitofusin 1 and 2 and Drp1(K38A), can counterbalance the GDAP1-dependent fission. GDAP1-specific knockdown by RNA interference results in a tubular mitochondrial morphology. GDAP1 truncations that are found in patients who have CMT are not targeted to mitochondria and have lost mitochondrial fragmentation activity. The latter activity also is reduced strongly for disease-associated GDAP1 point mutations. Our data indicate that an exquisitely tight control of mitochondrial dynamics, regulated by GDAP1, is crucial for the proper function of myelinated peripheral nerves.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most frequent inherited peripheral neuropathy in humans; it affects 1 in 2,500 people (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 2002</xref>). CMT is grouped into demyelinating and axonal forms according to electrophysiologic and pathologic findings. The defects in demyelinating types are believed to originate in myelinating Schwann cells, whereas neurons are first affected in axonal forms. However, recent studies on the molecular and cellular basis of CMT suggest that this distinction might not be absolute (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Suter and Scherer, 2003</xref>). Demyelinating forms are associated with reduced nerve conduction velocity, segmental de- and remyelination, and âonion bulbâ formations (CMT1, CMT3, and CMT4). The axonal forms (CMT2) show axonal degeneration without overt demyelinating lesions (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Suter and Scherer, 2003</xref>). Among the recessive forms, the subtype CMT4A is the most frequent (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nelis et al., 2002</xref>), and disease-associated mutations in <italic>GDAP1</italic> (ganglioside-induced differentiation associated protein 1) have been identified. Initially, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baxter and colleagues (2002)</xref> reported patients with an early onset of the disease and severe symmetric weakness and atrophy of the feet and hands. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities were reduced which was consistent with a demyelinating form of CMT (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baxter et al., 2002</xref>). <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cuesta et al. (2002)</xref> described a classic axonal phenotype, without apparent demyelination, with hoarse voice and vocal cord paresis as additional symptoms that was associated with other mutations in <italic>GDAP1</italic>. Later, even patients with an identical mutation (homozygous GDAP1 S194X) were depicted with demyelinating or axonal phenotypes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baxter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nelis et al., 2002</xref>). Today, approximately 20 CMT-associated <italic>GDAP1</italic> alterations, including point mutations and changes leading to truncated proteins (see Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] number *606598), have been described, causing axonal, demyelinating, or intermediate forms (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Di Maria et al., 2004</xref>). No obvious correlation between the position and nature of the mutations and the electrophysiologic or neuropathologic phenotype could be discerned. Thus, the issue of axonal versus demyelinating phenotypes and the cellular origin and basis of the disease remain open.</p>
      <p>The available information about the biology of GDAP1 is scarce. GDAP1 was identified as a transcript that was up-regulated after ganglioside-induced cholinergic differentiation of the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, an increase of GDAP1 mRNA expression also was found in neural-differentiated P19 cells and during development of the mouse brain (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>Some hints about the molecular function of GDAP1 have been provided by bioinformatic analyses (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Marco et al., 2004</xref>) confirming and extending previous reports (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baxter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cuesta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nelis et al., 2002</xref>). These studies demonstrated that GDAP1 and related proteins in invertebrates and vertebrates contain the characteristic domains of GSTs (GST-N, GST-C). Based on its particular domain features, GDAP1 was proposed as the founder of a new GST family. Members of this family are characterized by an enlarged interdomain between the GST-N and GST-C domains, and contain COOH-terminal hydrophobic stretches with potential transmembrane features (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Marco et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here we show that Schwann cells and neurons of myelinated peripheral nerves express GDAP1. Thus, both cell types might be affected directly by the consequences of the disease-causing mutations in <italic>GDAP1</italic>. Within the cell, GDAP1 functions as a tail-anchored protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane and promotes fragmentation of mitochondria. On this basis, we define GDAP1 as a novel regulator of the mitochondrial network. This ability is lost or reduced in CMT-associated mutated forms of GDAP1 and is very likely to contribute to the axonal and/or demyelinating defects that are seen in patients. The precise regulation of fusion and fission of mitochondria seems to be crucial for the integrity of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).</p>

        <title>GDAP1 is expressed by myelinating Schwann cells and neurons of the PNS</title>
        <p>To examine the function of GDAP1 in peripheral nerves and to determine its role in neuropathies, we developed rabbit antisera against two GDAP1-specific peptides (Fig. S1; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200507087/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200507087/DC1</ext-link>). Western blot analysis of extracts that were derived from various neural tissues revealed that GDAP1 is expressed most prominently in different regions of the central nervous system, including the cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, olfactory bulb, and spinal cord (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Consistent with the consequences of GDAP1 mutations leading to motor and sensory neuropathies, we also found GDAP1 expression in sciatic nerves and in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The results were identical with antisera against each of the two GDAP1 peptides (unpublished data). Furthermore, the levels of GDAP1 protein correlated well with parallel measurements of GDAP1 transcripts that were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (unpublished data) and with previously published data (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cuesta et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

        <p>In humans, the most prominent result of mutations in <italic>GDAP1</italic> is a pronounced motor and sensory neuropathy with a remarkable variability in phenotypic expression that ranges from primarily demyelinating to strong axonal involvement, and mixed forms with both alterations. Unraveling this complex situation, in efforts to clarify the underlying disease mechanisms, requires the determination of whether GDAP1 is expressed exclusively by only one of the two cell types involvedâSchwann cells or neuronsâor both. Such an analysis recently elucidated that mutations in the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (<italic>NDRG1</italic>) primarily target myelinating Schwann cells in the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we have analyzed the expression of GDAP1 in peripheral nerves in detail. GDAP1 was found in cross sections of rat sciatic nerves and colocalized with the Schwann cell marker S100 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B, aâc) and the neuronal marker neurofilament (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B, dâf; neurofilament-positive axons stained for GDAP1 with punctuated patterns). Consistent with these observations, the cell bodies of motoneurons in the spinal cord (not depicted) and sensory neurons in DRG (Fig. S2; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200507087/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200507087/DC1</ext-link>) were labeled with anti-GDAP1 antibodies. The specificity was confirmed by successful blocking of the staining by preincubation of the serum with the antigenic peptide (Fig. S2), and concordant results for GDAP1 mRNA expression were obtained by in situ hybridization on spinal cord and DRG sections (not depicted). Teased sciatic nerve fiber preparations revealed that GDAP1 is present in the cytoplasm of myelinating Schwann cells, with particularly strong staining in the perinuclear region and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures (unpublished data). We conclude that PNS neurons and Schwann cells, both commonly involved in the etiology of motor and sensory neuropathies, express GDAP1 with potential functional implications.</p>

        <title>GDAP1 is a mitochondrial protein</title>
        <p>We next determined the precise subcellular localization of GDAP1. In COS-7 cells that were transfected with an untagged GDAP1 full-length expression construct, we found GDAP1 in distinct structures with tubular and vesicular appearances throughout the cytoplasm at the onset of expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). These GDAP1-positive formations were identified as mitochondria by congruent costaining with the mitochondrial markers MitoTracker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, aâd), cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B), and porin (not depicted). No appreciable overlap was found with other membranous compartments, including the Golgi complex (marker giantin; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, eâh) or the ER (marker protein disulfide isomerase [PDI]; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, iâl).</p>

Bars in c, g, and k, 10 Î¼m; bars in d, h, and l, 2 Î¼m. Boxes in c, g, and k indicate the magnified areas in d, h, and l. (B) Mitochondria from endogenously GDAP1-expressing N1E-115 cells were enriched in a differential centrifugation approach. 20 Î¼g of protein yielded by the centrifugation steps were loaded per lane. The mitochondrial protein porin and GDAP1, but not the ER protein PDI, showed increased levels in the pellets.</p>

          <graphic xlink:href="200507087f2"/>
        </fig>
        <p>To exclude potential localization artifacts that are due to overexpression, we also examined the intracellular confinement of endogenous GDAP1. In agreement with previous results, we found GDAP1 staining of mitochondria in Neuro2a (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1999</xref>), N1E-115 cells, C2C12 cells (not depicted), and primary Schwann cells in culture (Fig. S2). Finally, GDAP1 and porin colocalized in sections of rat DRG (Fig. S2).</p>
        <p>To support further the localization of GDAP1 to mitochondria, we used a cell fractionation approach. Mitochondria were enriched by differential centrifugation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Graham, 2004</xref>), and the various steps were analyzed by Western blotting. Cell fractionations were performed with transfected Cos-7 cells (not depicted) and with endogenously GDAP1-expressing N1E-115 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). As expected, GDAP1 levels were enhanced specifically by this procedure in parallel with porin, an abundant transmembrane protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and in contrast to proteins of the ER, like PDI. Thus, GDAP1 is located in mitochondria.</p>

        <title>GDAP1 is an integral membrane protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane</title>
        <p>To elucidate the localization of GDAP1 within the mitochondria, we purified mitochondria from COS-7 cells, 24 h after transfection with a GDAP1 expression construct. Mitochondria were resuspended and digested with an excess of proteinase K in the presence or absence of detergent (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Olichon et al., 2002</xref>), and analyzed by Western blot. The GDAP1 signal was lost upon proteinase incubation, whereas cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, located in the intermembrane space, was protected and disappeared only if increasing amounts of digitonin or SDS were added (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Because the antisera used in this analysis recognize the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal proximal segment of GDAP1 (Fig. S1), these data indicate that the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of GDAP1, and thereby, the GST domains, are exposed to the cellular cytoplasm. In support of this interpretation, we found GDAP1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane by ultrastructural analysis using immunogold labeling (unpublished data).</p>

<bold>GDAP1 is a transmembrane protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane.</bold> (A) A crude mitochondrial extract of transfected COS-7 cells was digested with proteinase K in the presence of increasing concentrations of digitonin. The digest was stopped after 30 min on ice with an excess of PMSF, and was analyzed by Western blot. The signal for GDAP1 was lost in the absence of digitonin. Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> was protected against the digest until the mitochondrial outer membrane was permeabilized with high concentrations of digitonin, or with SDS (bottom lane). (B) The mitochondrial pellet of transfected COS-7 cells was resuspended in buffer (control), in 1 M NaCl, in 0.1 M carbonate (pH 11), or in buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged to separate the soluble protein supernatants from membranous pellets. GDAP1 and the known transmembrane protein porin are found in the supernatant only in the presence of detergent.</p>

          <graphic xlink:href="200507087f3"/>
        </fig>
        <p>We next asked whether GDAP1 is associated peripherally with mitochondrial membranes or whether it is an integral membrane protein as proposed (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Marco et al., 2004</xref>). Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in various buffers and, after centrifugation, supernatants and membranous pellets were analyzed by Western blotting (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sogo and Yaffe, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Olichon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Stojanovski et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). GDAP1 remained associated with the mitochondrial pellet after treatment with 1 M sodium chloride or 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 11). Detergent treatment released GDAP1 to the supernatant, comparable to the integral membrane protein porin. Together, these experiments demonstrate that GDAP1 is an integral membrane protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane.</p>

        <title>GDAP1 regulates the architecture of mitochondria</title>
        <p>In various experiments, we observed time-dependent changes in the mitochondrial morphology upon GDAP1 transfection. With prolonged expression of GDAP1, the mitochondria in COS-7 cells became more fragmented, and tubular forms were less prominent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, c and d). This effect was not seen in mock-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, a). We reasoned that overexpression of any protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane could cause this effect. However, mitochondrial morphology was not appreciably altered upon transient expression of the GFP-tagged human transporter of the outer membrane subunit 7 (EGFP-hTOM7), in agreement with previous results (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Stojanovski et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, b). This indicates a specific effect of GDAP1 in our experimental settings. Thus, we quantified the morphologic alterations caused by GDAP1 overexpression. To this end, we defined five distinct mitochondrial architectures within cells (for examples, see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, e, bottom panel): perinuclear aggregated (âaggregatedâ), predominantly tubular (âtubularâ), tubular and vesicular (âmixedâ), predominantly vesicular but with some tubular structures (âvesicularâ), and completely vesicular or fragmented mitochondria (âfragmentedâ). This analysis revealed that 15 h after transfection with GDAP1, fragmented mitochondria increase significantly at the expense of tubular and mixed mitochondrial formations compared with control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, e). As suspected from our previous impressions, this shift toward mitochondrial fragmentation was even more pronounced 20 h after transfection.</p>

        <title>GDAP1-induced fragmentation is not associated with defective overall mitochondrial physiology</title>
        <p>Fragmentation of mitochondria can occur in response to apoptotic stimuli (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we tested whether GDAP1 overexpression induces apoptosis. Initial qualitative observations of transiently transfected HeLa, Neuro2a, or COS-7 cells did not suggest massive induction of apoptosis. To analyze this issue more precisely, we transfected HeLa cells with GDAP1 or EGFP-hFis1, a protein that is known to induce mitochondrial fission and apoptosis (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2003</xref>); fixed the cells after 36 h; and stained for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and GDAP1. As anticipated, EGFP-hFis1 promoted the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (note the diffuse cytochrome c staining exclusively in the transfected cell, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, d), whereas in cells expressing GDAP1, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> was restricted to mitochondria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, a and b).</p>
        <p>Loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ÎÎ¨m) also triggers the fragmentation of mitochondria (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Legros et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, we asked whether the fragmentation that is induced by overexpression of GDAP1 might be secondary to an effect on ÎÎ¨m. The uptake of the dye, MitoTrackerH<sub>2</sub>XRos, into mitochondria is dependent on mitochondrial activity (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Cushion, 1994</xref>), which provides a mean to test this possibility (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, a and b). Transient transfection with low amounts of an EGFP-hFis1 expression construct served as positive control (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Yoon, 2004</xref>). Dye uptake was unchanged in GDAP1-expressing cells compared with nontransfected HeLa cells, whereas it was reduced to 70% in EGFP-hFis1âpositive HeLa cells. In addition, we generated stably transfected Neuro2a cells that inducibly overexpress GDAP1. Using 5,5â²,6,6â²-tetrachloro-1,1â²,3,3â²-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide in flow cytometry (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cossarizza et al., 1993</xref>), we confirmed that overexpression of GDAP1 does not induce apoptosis or influence ÎÎ¨m in these cells (unpublished data).</p>

        <title>GDAP1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation is blocked by dynamin-related protein 1 (K38A) coexpression and counterbalanced by mitofusin 1 and 2</title>
        <p>The shape of mitochondria depends on the balance of fusion and fission. Thus, we tested whether the induction of fragmentation by GDAP1 can be counterbalanced by proteins that are known to induce fusion or block fission. The dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) plays a central role in the fission of mitochondria; the dominant-negative Drp1(K38A) form blocks mitochondrial fission (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Smirnova et al., 1998</xref>). We coexpressed GDAP1 with Drp1 or Drp1(K38A) in COS-7 cells, and analyzed the mitochondrial morphology of cells that express both proteins 17 h after transfection. Western blotting confirmed comparable expression levels of the transfected constructs (unpublished data). Coexpression of GDAP1 and Drp1 did not influence GDAP1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation considerably (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, aâf). This outcome was expected, because overexpression of Drp1 per se does not change the mitochondrial architecture; there is an abundant pool of endogenous Drp1 in the cell (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Yoon, 2004</xref>). In contrast, if coexpressed with GDAP1, Drp1(K38A) partially inhibited the fragmentation of mitochondria (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, gâi). An increased number of GDAP1-Drp1(K38A) doubly expressing cells still had fragmented mitochondria compared with EGFP-hTOM7 control-transfected cells; however, this number was reduced significantly compared with GDAP1-only expressing cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, j). Also, more cells than controls showed extended tubular mitochondrial morphology, the most prominent phenotype observed when Drp1(K38A) is expressed alone (85%; unpublished data). In summary, coexpression of Drp1(K38A) can block GDAP1-induced fragmentation partially, but without restoring the normal pattern completely.</p>

        <title>GDAP1 does not reduce mitochondrial fusion</title>
        <p>Our previous experiments have shown that the overexpression of GDAP1 promotes mitochondrial fragmentation. This mitochondrial morphology might result from increased mitochondrial fission, reduced mitochondrial fusion, or a combination of both effects. Using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based cell fusion technique, we examined the effect of GDAP1 on mitochondrial fusion (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mattenberger et al., 2003</xref>). HeLa cells that were transfected transiently with mitochondrial targeted DsRed (mtDsRed) were coplated with HeLa cells that were transfected transiently with mitochondrial targeted GFP (mtGFP; see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, aâc) or GDAP1 (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, dâf). The cells were fused with PEG and cultivated in the presence of cycloheximide. As reported previously, we found mitochondrial fusion in hybrids of cells transfected with mtDsRed fused to cells transfected with mtGFP 3â4 h after cell fusion. This process was almost complete 6 h after cell fusion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, aâc, g; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mattenberger et al., 2003</xref>). An identical timing and extent of mitochondrial fusion was observed in cell hybrids of cells that were transfected with mtDsRed fused with cells transfected with GDAP1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, dâg). Thus, GDAP1 overexpression does not interfere significantly with mitochondrial fusion, and indicates that GDAP1 is a fission-inducing factor.</p>

This reduction could not be determined reliably at the single-cell level by immunocytochemistry. Thus, we counted at least 750 randomly chosen cells per condition in blinded experiments.

To answer this question, we generated a set of GDAP1 expression constructs, that represents three different stop mutations and five different point mutations (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) that were identified previously in patients who had CMT (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baxter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cuesta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nelis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ammar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Azzedine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Boerkoel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Senderek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Di Maria et al., 2004</xref>).

        <title>The COOH-terminal transmembrane domain of GDAP1 contains the mitochondrial-targeting information</title>
        <p>Computer analysis revealed that GDAP1 carries no canonical mitochondrial targeting signal (unpublished data). Because the GDAP1 truncation T288fsX290 apparently has lost the mitochondrial-targeting information, the deleted 68 COOH-terminal amino acids are likely to harbor such signals. To assess this issue in more detail, we generated fusion proteins in which portions of GDAP1 were linked to the COOH terminus of EGFP. A full-length EGFP-GDAP1 fusion protein, colocalized with MitoTracker, demonstrated that the EGFP tagging allows efficient mitochondrial targeting in transfected COS-7 cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B, aâc). As expected, the last 78 amino acids of GDAP1 (EGFP-GDAP1<sub>280â358</sub>) were sufficient for mitochondrial localization (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B, dâf), and confirmed that the signal is close to the COOH terminus. Our further experimental strategy was based on the knowledge that mitochondrial proteins with a COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain, surrounded by basic amino acids, are targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kutay et al., 1993</xref>). Mfn2 belongs to this class of proteins, called âtail-anchored proteins.â For Mfn2, proper targeting requires the two transmembrane domains surrounded by basic amino acids, and coiled-coiled domains (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rojo et al., 2002</xref>). For GDAP1, the situation seems to be related, but different. An EGFPâfusion protein with the first hydrophobic domain, including its flanking regions (EGFP-GDAP1<sub>280â316</sub>), is not targeted to mitochondria (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B, gâi). However, the second hydrophobic domain and flanking regions are sufficient to direct an EGFPâfusion protein (EGFP-GDAP1<sub>308â358</sub>) to mitochondria (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B, jâl).

Each mutant showed some impairment in the ability to induce fragmentation compared with wild-type GDAP1 protein, as indicated by the variable reduction of the fraction of cells with only fragmented mitochondria (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> C, a). The mutants R161H and R310Q were completely inactive with respect to the promotion of mitochondrial fragmentation, and showed morphologies that were comparable to those seen in control transfections.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have identified GDAP1 as a novel regulator of mitochondria. GDAP1 is a component of the outer mitochondrial membrane and, in concert with other proteins, influences the balance between fused and fragmented mitochondria. The mitochondrial localization of GDAP1 is required for this activity; the necessary information for proper organelle targeting is contained within the COOH-terminal part of the polypeptide. Analysis of GDAP1 mutations associated with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies revealed that both features of GDAP1âproper localization and the modulating activity on mitochondriaâare likely to be crucial for the functional integrity of myelinated peripheral nerves.</p>
      <p>It is well-established that the nervous system is especially sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bouillot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bossy-Wetzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Finsterer, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, a critical role for mitochondria is discussed in the context of diseases and syndromes with liability to neuropathies, including diabetes (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vincent et al., 2004</xref>) or degeneration related to ageing (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bossy-Wetzel et al., 2003</xref>). We have found that GDAP1, the product of the disease-causing gene in particular forms of the neurodegenerative disorder CMT, is a key regulator of mitochondrial fragmentation. The observed fragmentation effect most likely is linked closely to mitochondrial fission. This important specific aspect of the biology of mitochondria has been appreciated fully only recently (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Mozdy and Shaw, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Chan, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rube and van der Bliek, 2004</xref>). In relation to diseases, two proteins that are involved in mitochondrial fusion are involved in neuropathies (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bossy-Wetzel et al., 2003</xref>). Mutations in the dynamin-related GTPase, OPA-1, lead to optic atrophy (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Delettre et al., 2000</xref>); mutations in <italic>MFN2</italic> were linked recently to CMT2A (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Zuchner et al., 2004</xref>). We describe that GDAP1 also takes part in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by promoting mitochondrial fission. The fission effect is not secondary as a result of the induction of apoptosis or the reduction of the ÎÎ¨m. GDAP1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation was counteracted by the fusion inducing factors, Mfn1 and Mfn2 and the dominant negative fission-blocking Drp1(K38A). PEG-mediated cell fusions further demonstrated that GDAP1 expression does not interfere with mitochondrial fusion. These findings suggest that common elements in the disease mechanisms of CMT are caused by mutations in <italic>GDAP1</italic> and <italic>MFN2</italic>, although GDAP1 and Mfn2 have opposite effects on the mitochondrial morphology. The relation between GDAP1 and Mfn2 is intriguing if the two phenotypes of the associated diseases are compared. Mfn2 has been described exclusively in the context of axonal neuropathies in CMT2A, which indicates a neuronal basis of the disease mechanism. GDAP1 has been associated with axonal, demyelinating, and mixed phenotypes in CMT. Thus, a neuronal disease origin also might be favored in CMT caused by mutations in <italic>GDAP1</italic> if an altered mitochondrial regulation by mutations in <italic>GDAP1</italic> and <italic>MFN2</italic> is put forward as the hypothetic basis of both genetically distinct disorders. However, we found that GDAP1 is expressed by myelinating Schwann cells as well as motor and sensory neurons; it is possible that the disease primarily affects Schwann cells, neurons, or both. Cell-type specific elimination of GDAP1 individually from neurons or Schwann cells will be required to resolve this issue.</p>
      <p>Truncations and point mutations in <italic>GDAP1</italic> are associated with CMT. Our results indicate that the COOH-terminal truncations that were tested have lost mitochondrial localization, whereas the examined GDAP1 proteins carrying missense mutations remained correctly targeted to mitochondria. These data are consistent with a recent report on the subcellular localization and effects of some GDAP1 mutations (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pedrola et al., 2005</xref>). We further demonstrate that GDAP1 proteins carrying disease-related mutations have lost the ability to induce mitochondrial fragmentation to various degrees. However, we have been unable to correlate the activity differences to disease onset, severity, and/or pathology. The variability of the phenotypes seems to be too high, even between relatives with the identical mutation (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Azzedine et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The mitochondrial network is dynamic, and shifting the balance of fusion and fission is a major regulatory mechanism. Although the functional consequences of these events are understood poorly, it is obvious that complex and divergent stimuli influence the mitochondrial appearance (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Goglia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bossy-Wetzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Honda and Hirose, 2003</xref>). The finding that mutations in genes affect this process in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies suggests that myelinated peripheral nerves are particularly dependent on the proper function and control of this system. Whether this vulnerability is the consequence of a deregulation of the mitochondrial architecture or an impaired mitochondrial transport (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Shy, 2004</xref>) remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>Recently, evidence for mitochondrial fusion intermediates and an Mfn complex mediating mitochondrial tethering was provided (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Meeusen et al., 2004</xref>). How the potential GST protein GDAP1, might, on a molecular level, be involved in the regulation of the mitochondrial architecture remains elusive. On a highly speculative note, the mitochondrial morphology is dependent on glutathione (GSH). Depletion of GSH leads to mitochondrial fusion, and results in a tubular mitochondrial network (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Soltys and Gupta, 1994</xref>), although this effect may not be based solely on the GSH concentration (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bowes and Gupta, 2005</xref>). It remains unknown whether these are genuine hints that GDAP1 is a mitochondrial fission-inducing factor that is dependent on GSH.</p>
      <p>In summary, we introduce GDAP1 as a key regulator of mitochondrial dynamics. If this activity is lost, the integrity of peripheral nerves is disturbed and leads to myelin and axonal defects. We anticipate that further elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathology of GDAP1-based CMT will help to uncover the function of GDAP1 and mitochondrial dynamics in peripheral nerves. Conversely, further examination of the molecular function of GDAP1 in the biology of mitochondria will contribute significantly to our basic understanding of CMT.</p>

        <p>Cells were fixed with 2.5% PFA/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Tissue was fixed overnight with 3.7% formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin in a Tissue Processor TP1010 (Leica). 6-Î¼m sections were prepared using a Rotary Microtome HM 330 (Microm). For immunohistochemistry, fixed cells and rehydrated sections were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS, the specimens were incubated with 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies in 10% goat serum/PBS for 90 min at room temperature or overnight at 4Â°C. After washing, samples were exposed to appropriate secondary antibodies. Cy3- and Cy5-conjugated antibodies were from the Jackson Laboratory, secondary antibodies with Alexa-dyes from Molecular Probes. Samples were incubated with DAPI (Roche) and mounted in Immu-Mount (ThermoShandon). Specimens were analyzed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.). Alternatively, we used confocal microscopy on an inverted microscope DM IRB/E equipped with a true confocal scanner TCS SP1, a PL APO 63Ã/1.32 oil immersion objective (Leica) as well as argon, heliumâneon lasers. Image processing was done on a Silicon Graphics workstation using Imaris (Bitplane AG). For labeling of mitochondria, we used MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's recommendations. MitoTracker Red CM-H<sub>2</sub>XRos was added to the medium in a final concentration of 0.5 Î¼M for 30 min. After this pulse, the cells were cultivated in growth medium without dye for 10 min before fixation. To determine the relative uptake of MitoTrackerH<sub>2</sub>XRos into transfected cells, we analyzed single-plane confocal images. Using ImageJ, we measured the relative fluorescence (RF) intensity of MitoTrackerH<sub>2</sub>XRos and the area. We determined the RF/area in transfected cells and in untransfected cells on the same picture. For each picture, the RF/area of transfected cells was divided by the RF/area of untransfected cells. The average and the standard deviation of several pictures (<italic>n</italic> â¥ 6) were determined using two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test.</p>
