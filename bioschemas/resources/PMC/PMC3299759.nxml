      <abstract>
        <p>Senescence, a hallmark of mammalian aging, is associated with the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling and zinc homeostasis dysfunction are increased with age and are linked to cardiovascular disease, but the relationship among these processes has not been investigated. We used a model of cellular senescence induced by Ang II in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to explore the role of zinc in vascular dysfunction. We found that Ang II-induced senescence is a zinc-dependent pathway mediated by the downregulation of the zinc transporters ZnT3 and ZnT10, which work to reduce cytosolic zinc. Zinc mimics Ang II by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating NADPH oxidase activity and Akt, and by downregulating ZnT3 and ZnT10 and inducing senescence. Zinc increases Ang II-induced senescence, while the zinc chelator TPEN, as well as overexpression of ZnT3 or ZnT10, decreases ROS and prevents senescence. Using HEK293 cells, we found that ZnT10 localizes in recycling endosomes and transports zinc into vesicles to prevent zinc toxicity. Zinc and ZnT3/ZnT10 downregulation induces senescence by decreasing the expression of catalase. Consistently, ZnT3 and ZnT10 downregulation by siRNA increases ROS while downregulation of catalase by siRNA induces senescence. Zinc, siZnT3 and siZnT10 downregulate catalase by a post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These data demonstrate that zinc homeostasis dysfunction by decreased expression of ZnT3 or ZnT10 promotes senescence and that Ang II-induced senescence is a zinc and ROS-dependent process. Our studies suggest that zinc might also affect other ROS-dependent processes induced by Ang II, such as hypertrophy and migration of smooth muscle cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Aging is associated with physiological changes that increase predisposition to cardiovascular diseases <xref rid="pone.0033211-Lakatta1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. For example, increases in inflammatory responses with age promote atherosclerosis <xref rid="pone.0033211-Marin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, which is thought to result from age-related dysfunction of the vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0033211-Brandes1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Cellular senescence, a hallmark of mammalian aging, is a process of permanent cell cycle arrest involving changes in gene expression and cell morphology <xref rid="pone.0033211-Hayflick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, such as increase in the expression of senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-gal) and increase in cell size <xref rid="pone.0033211-Dimri1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Senescent vascular cells in culture present similar changes to the ones observed in aged arteries, such as an increase in ROS levels in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) <xref rid="pone.0033211-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Senescent VSMCs positive for SA-Î²-gal have been found in arteries of old animals <xref rid="pone.0033211-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and in atherosclerotic plaques <xref rid="pone.0033211-Minamino1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, indicating that cellular senescence could contribute to <italic>in vivo</italic> vascular aging <xref rid="pone.0033211-Faragher1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and atherosclerosis <xref rid="pone.0033211-Erusalimsky1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Thus, the study of molecular mechanisms regulating cellular senescence <italic>in vitro</italic> is important to our understanding of age related pathologies like atherosclerosis.</p>
      <p>Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a potent mediator of vascular disease including atherosclerosis and the metabolic syndrome <xref rid="pone.0033211-Ferrario1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Ang II signaling pathways become activated with age and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis <xref rid="pone.0033211-Hirata1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> as well as vascular senescence <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0033211-Najjar1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033211-Kunieda1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and <italic>in vitro</italic> in VSMCs <xref rid="pone.0033211-Kunieda1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Moreover, disruption of the Ang II type 1 receptor promotes longevity <xref rid="pone.0033211-Benigni1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, suggesting that prevention of Ang II signaling is not only beneficial to prevent cardiovascular disease but also to delay the aging process. Ang II induced-senescence involves a p53/p21-dependent pathway in VSMCs <xref rid="pone.0033211-Kunieda1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanism is not fully understood and whether other processes that are also disrupted by age could modulate this pathway has not been investigated.</p>
      <p>Among the changes induced by age, zinc deficiency is common in the elderly <xref rid="pone.0033211-Sandstead1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Zinc is an important nutritional factor contributing to the function of the immune system, metabolic function and antioxidant capacities. Zinc supplementation protects from oxidative stress in cells in culture <xref rid="pone.0033211-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and in animal models <xref rid="pone.0033211-Bediz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. On the other hand, zinc deprivation increases oxidative stress, induces apoptotic cell death <xref rid="pone.0033211-Oteiza1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and influences renal and cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0033211-Tomat1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Importantly, zinc deficiency has been postulated as a risk factor in the development of atherosclerosis <xref rid="pone.0033211-Beattie1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> yet the cellular and molecular basis of this association remains largely unexplored. Since vascular senescence is increased by age and Ang II, and zinc homeostasis dysfunction is also increased by age, we hypothesize that zinc homeostasis regulatory mechanisms and Ang II signaling pathways converge to promote vascular senescence.</p>
      <p>Zinc homeostasis is tightly regulated by the expression of metallothioneins (MTs) and membrane proteins that buffer and transport zinc, respectively. Zinc transport and distribution are carried out by two families of zinc transporters <xref rid="pone.0033211-Lichten1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Fourteen members of the Zips (Zrt/Irt-like proteins)/SLC39 (solute carrier 39) family of zinc importers work to increase cytosolic zinc by importing zinc from extracellular or from intracellular compartments. In contrast, ten members of the ZnT (zinc transporter)/SLC30A family of zinc exporters work in the opposite direction to reduce cytosolic zinc concentration by moving zinc out of the cell or into various intracellular compartments. Expression of members of the ZnT family is decreased by age <xref rid="pone.0033211-Saito1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> suggesting that ZnT family members could be relevant in age-related dysfunction of zinc homeostasis and cardiovascular diseases, but virtually nothing is known about the expression profile of ZnTs or about the regulation of zinc homeostasis in the vasculature.</p>
      <p>Here we show the expression profile of members of the ZnT family in VSMCs and mouse aorta and identify ZnT3 and ZnT10 as important regulators of VSMC senescence. We show that Ang II, as well as zinc, downregulates ZnT3 and ZnT10 expression. This event decreases catalase expression, which leads to accumulation in ROS levels and the induction of senescence. Zinc regulates catalase protein stability by an ERK1/2-dependent mechanism. Zinc-induced senescence is prevented by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), suggesting that ZnT3 and ZnT10 work to prevent increases in ROS levels by modulating the expression of catalase.</p>

        <title>Zinc increases ROS and induces senescence of VSMCs</title>
        <p>To investigate if zinc homeostasis regulatory mechanisms and Ang II signaling pathways interact to promote vascular senescence, we first determined whether addition of exogenous zinc could increase intracellular zinc levels and enhance Ang II signaling in VSMCs. We incubated VSMCs with zinc and monitored the level of intracellular zinc using the specific zinc fluoroprobe Zinpyr-1 <xref rid="pone.0033211-Burdette1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). VSMCs show a basal vesicular and perinuclear staining that was increased by zinc and was reduced by the zinc chelator TPEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033211.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). We next tested if increases in intracellular zinc levels could affect Ang II signaling by monitoring Akt, p38MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). These three kinases mediate Ang II effects in VSMCs <xref rid="pone.0033211-UshioFukai1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Pre-incubation with zinc increases Akt and p38MAPK and decreases ERK1/2 phosphorylation in basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, lane 7) and after Ang II treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, compare lanes 2â6 and 8â12). Since Akt and p38MAPK, but not ERK1/2, are activated by Ang II in a ROS-dependent manner in VSMCs <xref rid="pone.0033211-UshioFukai1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and senescence is induced by ROS <xref rid="pone.0033211-Herbert1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, we tested whether zinc could increase ROS levels and induce senescence. Zinc increased ROS levels 1.4Â±0.28, 1.97Â±0.28 and 2.12Â±0.4-fold after incubations with 25, 50 and 100 ÂµM zinc, respectively (nâ=â7, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Increases in ROS levels by 50 ÂµM zinc (1.99Â±0.4-fold nâ=â8, p&lt;0.01 vs control) were similar to the ones observed after Ang II treatment (1.94Â±0.28-fold nâ=â4, p&lt;0.01 vs control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).

        <p>To determine senescence, we incubated VSMCs with increasing concentrations of zinc for five days and measured SA-Î²-gal activity, a senescence marker. 50 ÂµM zinc is the optimal concentration for long-term incubations based on cell viability assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033211.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>) and ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

        <title>Zinc is required for Ang II-induced senescence</title>
        <p>The fact that zinc mimics Ang II effects led us to hypothesize that zinc could be required for Ang II-induced senescence. This hypothesis predicts that Ang II-induced increases in ROS levels and senescence should be increased by zinc and prevented by TPEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). ROS levels induced by Ang II were significantly increased by zinc (1.43Â±0.04-fold vs 1.3Â±0.06-fold, nâ=â6, p&lt;0.01) and were reduced by TPEN (0.968Â±0.24-fold, nâ=â6, p&lt;0.01). Further, basal as well as zinc-induced increases in ROS were also reduced by TPEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Next, we incubated VSMCs with Ang II in the presence of zinc or TPEN for three days to determine senescence. Cell viability assays show that 100 nM TPEN is a non-toxic concentration for long-term incubations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033211.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>). This concentration is 100 times lower than the concentration (10 ÂµM TPEN) described to remove zinc from zinc containing proteins such as transcriptional factors <xref rid="pone.0033211-Seve1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Zinc increases and TPEN reduces Ang II-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g002">Fig. 2BâD</xref>). Ang II treatment leads to 27.9Â±2.8% SA-Î²-gal positive cells compared to 6.1Â±2.4% in control cells (p&lt;0.01). The effect of Ang II was increased to 34.9Â±1.6% (p&lt;0.05 vs Ang II) when cells were co-incubated with 50 ÂµM zinc, and was reduced to 11.3Â±1.65% (p&lt;0.01 vs Ang II) when cells were co-incubated with 100 nM TPEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Similar results were observed when SA-Î²-gal activity was determined by quantitative chemiluminescence using the Galacto-Light Plusâ¢ System (Applied Biosystems) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). We detected an increase of 1.35Â±0.14-fold (nâ=â6, p&lt;0.01) in Ang II-induced senescence compared to control cells (1.03Â±0.16-fold). Incubation with 50 and 100 ÂµM zinc increased Ang II-induced senescence 1.75Â±0.05-fold (nâ=â6, p&lt;0.01) and 2.34Â±0.57-fold (nâ=â3, p&lt;0.05), respectively, compared to Ang II alone. In contrast, TPEN prevents Ang II effects (0.88Â±0.03-folds, nâ=â3, pâ=â0.24 vs control). Thus, zinc increases ROS levels and senescence while TPEN prevents them. To further evaluate the dependence of ROS in zinc-induced senescence, we incubated VSMCs with zinc in the presence or absence of the antioxidant NAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g002">Fig. 2E and F</xref>). The increase in senescence induced by zinc (50.6Â±4.4%) was similar to incubation with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> alone (66.9Â±10.44%, p&lt;0.05 vs zinc). NAC significantly reduced zinc-induced senescence to 25Â±1.2% (p&lt;0.01 vs zinc). All together, these data indicate that zinc is required for Ang II-induced senescence via a ROS-dependent mechanism.</p>

        <title>Ang II downregulates zinc transporters ZnT3 and ZnT10 to induce senescence</title>
        <p>The observation that zinc is required for Ang II-induced senescence suggests that Ang II may affect the availability and/or distribution of free zinc and, therefore, zinc homeostasis to mediate senescence. To test this idea, we monitored changes in intracellular zinc using Zinpyr-1 staining in VSMCs treated for three days with Ang II alone or together with TPEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Ang II induced changes in zinc distribution from a vesicular to a perinuclear Golgi-like staining in 64.3% of cells (14 different fields) compared to 21% (12 different fields) in control cells. This staining was reduced by TPEN. The change in zinc distribution suggests that Ang II may affect the expression of SLC30A/ZnT family members of zinc transporters, which work to reduce cytosolic zinc concentration by moving zinc out of the cells or inside vesicular compartments, such as endosomes and Golgi. We determined mRNA expression levels of SLC30A/ZnT family members by RT-PCR and found that VSMCs, as well as mouse aorta, express eight out of ten members of the ZnT family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). We found ZnT1, that localizes at the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0033211-Palmiter1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, ZnT3 and ZnT4 that localize at endosomes <xref rid="pone.0033211-Salazar2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033211-Murgia1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and ZnT5, ZnT6 and ZnT7 found at the Golgi complex <xref rid="pone.0033211-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We also found ZnT9/HUEL, which was shown to translocate to the nucleus in a cell-cycle dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0033211-Sim1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and ZnT10, whose subcellular localization and zinc transporter capacities have not been investigated. Next, we determined ZnTs mRNA expression levels in response to Ang II treatment.

        <p>To determine the functional consequences of ZnT3 and ZnT10 downregulation by Ang II, we knocked down their expression levels by siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033211.s002">Fig. S2A and S2B</xref>) and determined senescence by SA-Î²-gal staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Fig. 3F and 3G</xref>). ZnT3 and ZnT10 downregulation decreased the levels of vesicular zinc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Fig. 3D and 3E</xref>) and increased basal senescence to 24.72Â±3.6% and 25.97Â±2.65%, respectively. These levels are similar to those observed in cells treated with Ang II in control conditions (23.41Â±5.19%). Similar to Ang II and zinc treatments, downregulation of both ZnTs also increased the expression of the senescence marker p21 and p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>). Further, ZnT3 and ZnT10 downregulation increased Ang II-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>). These data suggest that downregulation of ZnT3 and ZnT10 might lead to increases of zinc in the cytosol before the addition of Ang II, which could accelerate senescence (more SA-Î²-gal positive cells). This idea is supported by the fact that zinc alone increases, while TPEN prevents, senescence. This hypothesis predicts that increases of cytosolic zinc by downregulation of any other zinc transporter should also induce senescence. To test this idea, we knocked down the Ang II-insensitive ZnT5 by siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033211.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>) and found that this treatment also induces senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Fig. 3F and 3G</xref>). siZnT5 increased basal (15.48%Â±3.05%, p&lt;0.01 vs control cells) as well as Ang II-induced senescence (36.88Â±7.9%, p&lt;0.01, vs Ang II in control cells), suggesting that zinc homeostasis dysfunction mediates senescence of VSMCs. Further, no changes in cellular distribution of Ang II-insensitive ZnTs, such as ZnT5 and ZnT4 was observed by Ang II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033211.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since expression of zinc transporters such as ZnT1 are transcriptionally regulated by zinc <xref rid="pone.0033211-Vallee1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and zinc induces senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1FâI</xref>), we asked whether ZnT3 and ZnT10 could be downregulated by zinc. Both ZnTs mRNA were downregulated by zinc similar to Ang II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Fig. 3I and 3J</xref>), suggesting that increase in zinc levels could be mediated by Ang II in an early event upstream of ZnTs downregulation.

        <title>Overexpression of ZnT3 and ZnT10 prevents Ang II-induced senescence</title>
        <p>To further test the role of ZnT3 and ZnT10 in Ang II-induced senescence, we asked whether overexpression of these transporters could prevent Ang II effects. Western blots with anti-myc antibodies confirmed ZnT10 and ZnT3 overexpression and show that VSMCs express lower levels of these transporters compared with HEK293 cells after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). A discrete overexpression of ZnT3 or ZnT10 decreased ROS levels 0.37Â±1.6 and 0.62Â±0.14-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) and prevented Ang II-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g004">Fig. 4C and D</xref>). VSMCs overexpressing ZnT10-myc were 23.3Â±1.35% positive for SA-Î²-gal compared to 41.6Â±4%, p&lt;0.05 in mock-transfected cells treated with Ang II. Non-significant (ns) differences were observed between transfected and mock-transfected cells in basal conditions or between transfected cells with and without Ang II (23.3Â±1.4 and 21Â±4%, respectively, pâ=â0.4). Similarly, ZnT3 overexpression reduced Ang II-induced senescence from 49.23Â±3.08% in mock-transfected cells to 23.91Â±1.68% (p&lt;0.01). Thus, overexpression of ZnT3 and ZnT10 mimics the effects of TPEN by decreasing ROS levels and preventing senescence, suggesting that senescence is mediated by zinc.

Images were acquired with a confocal microscope using a 63Ã/oil objective. C) HEK293 cells transiently transfected with ZnT10-myc and ZnT3-GFP were cross-linked with 1 mM DSP, lysed and Triton X-100 soluble extracts immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies against myc. ZnT3 and ZnT10 interaction (lanes 6 and 7) was determined by western blots using polyclonal antibodies against myc and GFP. 10 Âµg of Triton X-100 soluble extracts were used as inputs (lanes 8â10). D and E) Control and HEK293 stable cells lines expressing ZnT10-myc were incubated with and without zinc and stained with Zinpyr-1. Fluorescence intensity was determined by confocal microscopy and quantified using MetaMorph software. F) Cell viability was determined by trypan-blue exclusion in HEK293 control and ZnT10-myc expressing cells after incubations with 100 ÂµM zinc for 24 hrs. Barâ=â10 Âµm in A, B and D.</p>

        <title>Zinc and ZnT3/ZnT10 downregulation decrease catalase expression to induce senescence</title>
        <p>We next explored the mechanism by which zinc and ZnT3/ZnT10 downregulation promotes senescence. We focused on catalase because transient activation of the ROS-dependent Akt, but not the ERK1/2 pathway, mediates catalase downregulation by Ang II in VSMCs <xref rid="pone.0033211-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. We show that zinc increases ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1C and 1D</xref>) and activates Akt, but not ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Zinc reduced catalase protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033211.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>), similar to Ang II alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, 47Â±4.94%, nâ=â5, p&lt;0.01 vs control). In contrast, chelation of zinc with TPEN increases basal levels of catalase and prevents its downregulation by Ang II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033211.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>). These data support the idea that TPEN prevents Ang II-induced senescence by preventing increases in ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and catalase downregulation. Time course experiments show that catalase, but not the peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70, was significantly downregulated after two days of zinc incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Fig. 6B and 6C</xref>), indicating that peroxisome biogenesis was not affected. No significant changes were observed in other antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD1, SOD2 or glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) after three days of zinc incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Fig. 6B and 6C</xref>). Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased and decreased by zinc, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Since zinc also downregulates ZnT3 and ZnT10, we asked whether downregulation of zinc transporters is upstream of catalase reduction. Knock down of ZnT3 and ZnT10 by siRNA decreased catalase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Fig. 6D and 6E</xref>) and increased ROS levels 2.11Â±0.43-fold and 2.07Â±0.33-fold (nâ=â12, p&lt;0.01) compared to siControl-treated cells (0.98Â±0.14), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our findings, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g008">Fig. 8</xref>, demonstrate that Ang II-induced senescence requires a zinc-dependent pathway mediated by the downregulation of the zinc transporters ZnT3 and ZnT10. This event would disrupt zinc homeostasis leading to downregulation of catalase and increases in ROS levels that promotes senescence. Zinc shows similar effects to Ang II. Zinc increases ROS levels, activates NADPH oxidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1CâE</xref>), decreases ZnT3, ZnT10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Figs. 3I an J</xref>) and catalase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Fig. 6AâC</xref>) and increases senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1GâI</xref>). In contrast, the zinc chelator TPEN, as well as overexpression of ZnT3 or ZnT10, decrease ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g004">4B</xref>), increase catalase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Figs. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g007">7J and 7K</xref>) and prevent Ang II-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g002">Figs. 2BâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g004">4C and 4D</xref>). Consistently, downregulation of ZnT3, ZnT10 or catalase by siRNA increases ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>) and senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Figs. 3F, 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g006">6G</xref>).

          <p>Similar to Ang II, zinc activates NADPH oxidase activity, increases ROS levels and Akt phosphorylation and downregulates ZnT3, ZnT10 and catalase. However, Ang II-induced downregulation of catalase is mediated by an Akt-dependent transcriptional mechanism, while zinc-induced downregulation of catalase is mediated by an ERK1/2-dependent post-transcriptional mechanism. Downregulation of catalase further increases ROS that mediates senescence. Perpendicular red arrows indicate increased or reduced expression.</p>

      <p>The observations that zinc increases ROS levels and activates Akt, similar to Ang II, lead us to speculate that zinc levels could increase after Ang II stimulation. Increases in zinc levels could be caused by release of zinc from zinc containing proteins and/or from membrane compartments. In VSMCs, we identified eight out of the ten members of the SLC30A/ZnT family of zinc transporters, which are responsible for zinc accumulation in membrane compartments. ZnT3, ZnT4 and ZnT10 localize in endosomes and ZnT5, ZnT6 and ZnT7 in the Golgi complex. Thus, endosomes and/or Golgi could serve as reservoirs of free zinc for signal transduction in VSMCs. Alternatively, zinc could be ejected from zinc-binding proteins, such as MTs. MT is a family of cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins that bind labile zinc, which could be released by cysteine oxidation <xref rid="pone.0033211-Maret1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Zinc is redox inert but it binds to proteins through sulfurs of cysteines, allowing its rapid exchange by the redox environment. An interesting possibility is that Ang II-induced increases of ROS levels could lead to zinc release from proteins/compartments leading to increases in free zinc. This free zinc could further activate NADPH oxidase activity and increase ROS leading to the induction of senescence. The source of zinc that activates Ang II signaling and increases ROS remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Our data are in agreement with the reported effects of zinc in signaling pathways in other cellular systems. In HepG2 human hepatoma cells, zinc activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, inducing the phosphorylation, inactivation and nuclear exclusion of FoxO1 <xref rid="pone.0033211-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Zinc shows insulin-mimetic effects by activating the insulin-dependent signaling cascade <xref rid="pone.0033211-Ilouz1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The effects of zinc in the insulin pathway are ROS-dependent. In rat adipocytes, zinc increases the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide to stimulate glucose metabolism <xref rid="pone.0033211-May1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Moreover, zinc activates NADPH oxidase activity and increases ROS in cortical neurons <xref rid="pone.0033211-Noh1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033211-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and in the renal epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1 <xref rid="pone.0033211-Matsunaga1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Here we show that zinc also activates a NADPH oxidase in VSMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Aortic VSMCs express Nox1 and Nox4 <xref rid="pone.0033211-Hilenski1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, which has been associated with cellular senescence <xref rid="pone.0033211-Schilder1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The nature of the zinc-induced Nox(es) remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Zinc and Ang II regulate catalase expression by different mechanisms. Ang II downregulates catalase by an Akt-dependent (ERK1/2-independent) acetylation/inactivation of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1Î± (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1Î±), leading to reduced binding of FoxO1 to the catalase promoter <xref rid="pone.0033211-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Akt and its upstream kinase p38MAPK, but not ERK1/2, are activated by Ang II in a ROS-dependent manner in VSMCs <xref rid="pone.0033211-UshioFukai1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Although zinc activates Akt phosphorylation, Akt inhibition, as well as overexpression of FoxO1 <italic>wt</italic> or a constitutive active mutant (FoxO1-CA), failed to prevent zinc-induced downregulation of catalase. Instead, zinc decreases catalase by decreasing ERK1/2 phosphorylation without affecting catalase mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033211.s006">Fig. S6A and B</xref>). Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation with PD98059 decreases catalase expression and induces senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g007">Fig. 7DâG</xref>). siZnT3/ZnT10 and ZnT3/ZnT10 overexpression decreases and increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation and catalase, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g007">Fig. 7HâK</xref>), suggesting that ZnT3/ZnT10 are upstream of ERK1/2. These data are in agreement with recent observations that ZnT3 regulates presynaptic ERK1/2 signaling, which is required for hippocampus-dependent memory <xref rid="pone.0033211-Sindreu1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The data presented here have important implications in the possible role of ZnT3 regulating ROS levels in the brain. Future studies will determine whether regulation of ROS levels by ZnT3/ZnT10 is also observed in other tissues.</p>
      <p>The differential mechanism of catalase downregulation by Ang II and zinc may explain why zinc and siZnT3/siZnT10 show additive effects on Ang II-induced senescence. At least two pathways are involved in catalase downregulation. One involves a transcriptional mechanism mediated by Ang II-dependent activation of a ROS/Akt/FoxO1 pathway <xref rid="pone.0033211-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The anti-oxidant NAC, which inhibits Akt phosphorylation as well as the Akt inhibitor TCN, increase basal levels of catalase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Consistently, overexpression of FoxO1 <italic>wt</italic> and the Akt-insensitive mutant FoxO1-CA also increase catalase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), suggesting that catalase is in fact regulated by a ROS/Akt/FoxO1 transcriptional mechanism. The second is a zinc-dependent post-transcriptional mechanism involving ROS/ZnT3/ZnT10/ERK1/2 that regulates catalase protein stability. Ang II also downregulates ZnT3 and ZnT10, but activates ERK1/2 signaling. Addition of zinc to Ang II-treated cells will decrease ERK1/2 signaling leading to a decrease in catalase mRNA levels and protein stability, which will further increase senescence. Zinc may affect catalase protein stability by preventing synthesis and/or increasing degradation. For example, zinc was shown to increase the ubiquitination of the phosphatase PTEN leading to its proteasome-dependent degradation with the subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway <xref rid="pone.0033211-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Catalase is also regulated by ubiquitination and proteosome degradation in mouse embryo fibroblasts and HEK293 cells <xref rid="pone.0033211-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we reported the subcellular localization and zinc transport capacities of the zinc transporter ZnT10. ZnT10 localizes in rab11 and Tfr-R positive recycling endosomes, similarly to the localization of ZnT3 in PC12 cells <xref rid="pone.0033211-Salazar2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Using Zinpyr-1 staining and zinc toxicity assays, we show that ZnT10 indeed transports zinc likely into early/recycling endosomes. We hypothesize that downregulation of ZnT3 or ZnT10 would disrupt zinc homeostasis by increasing its concentration in the cytosol. This hypothesis predicts that downregulation of any other ZnT would induce similar phenotypes. In fact, we found that ZnT5 siRNA, a zinc transporter localized in the Golgi complex <xref rid="pone.0033211-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and that is insensitive to downregulation by Ang II, induces basal senescence. siZnT5 also increases Ang II-induced senescence to similar levels compared with siZnT3 and siZnT10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033211-g003">Fig. 3F and G</xref>). These data suggest that ZnT3, ZnT10 and ZnT5 regulate zinc homeostasis to prevent increases of zinc in the cytosol and to prevent senescence.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that Ang II-induced senescence is a zinc-dependent process regulated by the downregulation of ZnT3 and ZnT10 leading to the decreased expression of catalase. Zinc mimics Ang II by increasing ROS levels, activating NADPH oxidase activity and Akt, decreasing ZnT3 and ZnT10, reducing catalase and inducing senescence. Our studies suggest that zinc may also affect other Ang II-induced and/or ROS-dependent processes, such as hypertrophy and migration of smooth muscle cells. These findings inform a cellular and molecular mechanism to understand the putative role of zinc homeostasis dysfunction in the development of atherosclerosis. We propose that manipulation of metal pools may modify the outcome of cardiovascular diseases. Future experiments will determine if zinc homeostasis dysfunction, such as zinc deficiencies in vivo, may exacerbate Ang II maladaptive effects. This information will provide important insight into possible nutritional interventions to lessen Ang II-induced age-dependent diseases.</p>
