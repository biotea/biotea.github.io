        <p>Protein kinases are essential molecules in life and their crucial function requires tight regulation. Many kinases are regulated via phosphorylation within their activation loop. This loop is embedded in the activation segment, which additionally contains the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding loop and a Pâ+â1 loop that is important in substrate binding. In this report, we identify Abl-mediated phosphorylation of a highly conserved Tyr residue in the Pâ+â1 loop of protein kinase D2 (PKD2) during oxidative stress. Remarkably, we observed that the three human PKD isoforms display very different degrees of Pâ+â1 loop Tyr phosphorylation and we identify one of the molecular determinants for this divergence. This is paralleled by a different activation mechanism of PKD1 and PKD2 during oxidative stress. Tyr phosphorylation in the Pâ+â1 loop of PKD2 increases turnover for Syntide-2, while substrate specificity and the role of PKD2 in NF-ÎºB signaling remain unaffected. Importantly, Tyr to Phe substitution renders the kinase inactive, jeopardizing its use as a non-phosphorylatable mutant. Since large-scale proteomics studies identified Pâ+â1 loop Tyr phosphorylation in more than 70 Ser/Thr kinases in multiple conditions, our results do not only demonstrate differential regulation/function of PKD isoforms under oxidative stress, but also have implications for kinase regulation in general.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein kinases are essential as receivers, transmitters and executors of a wide variety of cellular stimuli. Their activation results in a plethora of biological responses such as cellular movement, proliferation, and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Proper control of these processes requires tight regulation, and deregulation of kinase activity causes a variety of diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The activity of many kinases is regulated via the conformation of their activation segment, which is defined as the region between the conserved DFG and APE motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The activation segment can be subdivided into the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding loop, the activation loop and the Pâ+â1 loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In many kinases, the activation loop is phosphorylated, inducing a conformational change of the activation segment, thereby establishing the active conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The Pâ+â1 loop was originally named for its involvement in contacts with the Pâ+â1 amino acid residue in Protein Kinase A (PKA) substrates (i.e. the first residue C-terminal of the phospho-acceptor), but actually makes extended contacts with the substrate. Remarkably, while phosphorylation events in the activation loop are well-documented, kinases can also be phosphorylated in their Pâ+â1 loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. This phenomenon has become increasingly clear as a consequence of large scale proteomics studies that give unprecedented insight in post-translational modifications (PTMs) in a variety of proteins. However, in most cases the functional consequences of these Pâ+â1 loop phosphorylation events remain undefined.</p>
      <p>The protein kinase D (PKD) family belongs to the CAMK group of the kinome and consists of three highly homologous members (PKD1, 2, and 3) in humans. They have a modular structure, consisting of two diacylglycerol (DAG) binding C1 domains that connect via an acidic stretch to a PH domain, followed by the kinase catalytic domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The activity of PKD is regulated through auto-inhibition by the C1 and PH domains. Classically, PKDs are DAG responders that in many cases signal downstream of PKC pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. They bind at DAG-containing membranes through their C1 domains, where they co-localize with PKC isoforms. PKC subsequently phosphorylates the activation loop Ser-738/742 residues (hPKD1 numbering), resulting in alleviation of auto-inhibition of the PH domain and activation of PKD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>PKDs are also responsive to oxidative stress conditions. Here, PKD1 activation is dependent on the hierarchical phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues. First, Tyr-463 in the PH domain is phosphorylated by Abl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Tyr-463 phosphorylation induces a conformation permissive for subsequent Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr-95 in the N-terminus of PKD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Phospho-Tyr-95 serves as a docking site for the C2 domain of PKCÎ´, which phosphorylates PKD1 at its activation loop Ser-738/742 residues, an event that has been shown to be essential for PKD1 activation under oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. One of the downstream effectors of stress activated PKD1 is the NF-ÎºB pathway. PKD1 activates the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB target genes via the IKK complex; however a direct target of PKD1 in this pathway remains elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Activation of NF-ÎºB via mitochondrial ROS results in expression of MnSOD, thereby detoxifying the cell from damaging ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. On the other hand, PKD activated under oxidative stress conditions also increases JNK activity downstream of DAPK in a PKC- and pSer-738/742 independent manner, promoting cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Studies on the activation mechanisms of PKD enzymes by tyrosine phosphorylation have been largely limited to PKD1. However, under oxidative stress conditions, PKD2 is phosphorylated at Tyr-87<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Furthermore, PKD2 is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by the BCR-Abl fusion protein in BCR-Abl<sup>+</sup> CML cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. BCR-Abl phosphorylates PKD2 at Tyr-438 in its PH-domain (the site analogous to Tyr-463 that is phosphorylated in oxidative stress conditions in PKD1).</p>
      <p>In this study, we reveal phosphorylation of a key tyrosine residue in the Pâ+â1 loop of PKD2 under oxidative stress conditions. Despite its very high conservation, we observe remarkable isoform-specific phosphorylation, revealing unprecedented insight into differential regulation of the PKD family that impacts on their activity towards substrates.</p>

        <title>PKD2 is phosphorylated at Tyr-717 in the activation segment under oxidative stress conditions</title>
        <p>PKD2 undergoes many post-translational modifications (25 sites are reported as phosphorylated in the Phosphosite database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org">www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>), selecting those found in at least 5 independent studies, see Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), the effect of which in the majority of cases is not known. Interestingly, we noticed that phosphorylation of Tyr-717 in the activation segment Pâ+â1 loop, just before the highly conserved APE motif, was detected in as many as 39 proteomic data sets (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). However, the role of this phosphorylation event has never been addressed. Because the PKD family of kinases is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation during oxidative stress, we investigated whether Tyr-717 could also be phosphorylated under these conditions. Mass spectrometric analysis of PKD2 purified from HEK293 cells stimulated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> indicated that indeed, Tyr-717 is a target site on PKD2 under oxidative stress conditions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). To study this phenomenon in further detail, we generated a phosphorylation site-specific antibody (PSSA) directed against this site. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, PKD2 stimulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was recognized by the PSSA, while no Tyr-717 phosphorylation could be detected under basal conditions or in a stimulated enzyme where Tyr-717 is substituted by Phe. Furthermore, we could also detect phosphorylation on Tyr-717 in endogenous PKD2 after oxidative stress (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Tyr-717 phosphorylation could also be detected with sub-millimolar doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), but no phosphorylation was seen during classical activation of PKD2 with GPCR agonists or phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Identification of PKD2 Tyr-717 phosphorylation during oxidative stress.

        <title>Abl acts as an upstream kinase for Tyr-717 under oxidative stress conditions</title>
        <p>PKD1 is Tyr phosphorylated by both Src and Abl kinases during oxidative stress. For Tyr-717 in PKD2, Abl was an intriguing candidate, since the motif surrounding Tyr-717 corresponds to the preferred Abl recognition sequence (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Abl has already been identified as an upstream kinase for tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-438 in PKD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. To test whether Abl could act as an upstream kinase for Tyr-717 in oxidative stress, we pre-incubated cells with a pharmacological inhibitor (STI-571) or activator (DPH) of Abl, and then stimulated them with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Phosphorylation of Tyr-717 was markedly decreased in presence of STI-571, while incubation with DPH, resulting in stronger Abl activation, enhanced Tyr-717 phosphorylation even further (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Furthermore, co-transfection of PKD2 with WT Abl resulted in a potent phosphorylation of Tyr-717 in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). We could confirm the involvement of Abl in PKD2 Tyr-717 phosphorylation using siRNA targeted against Abl, which also resulted in a strong decrease in Tyr-717 phosphorylation following oxidative stress (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Direct phosphorylation at Tyr-717 by Abl was confirmed in an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).

</p>
        <p>For PKD1, activation during oxidative stress requires a hierarchical multistep phosphorylation sequence. First, Tyr-463 in the PH domain is phosphorylated, which promotes N-terminal Tyr-95 phosphorylation, allowing PKCÎ´ to dock to the N-terminal phospho-tyrosine motif to subsequently phosphorylate the activation loop at Ser-738/742 (schematically represented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).</p>
        <p>We assessed the dependency of Tyr-717 phosphorylation in PKD2 on Tyr-438 phosphorylation (homologous to Tyr-463 in PKD1, the first step in the PKD1 activation model) and Ser-706/710 phosphorylation (the last step in the PKD1 activation model) using phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable mutants of these sites.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, we observed that Tyr-717 phosphorylation was partly dependent on Tyr-438 phosphorylation, with some increase in the case of a phosphomimetic substitution, but no decrease in Tyr-717 phosphorylation in a Y438F mutant (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).</p>
        <p>In contrast however, we observed a strong dependency of Tyr-717 phosphorylation on activation loop Ser-706/710 phosphorylation. Indeed, when a PKD2 mutant with Ser-706/710-Glu substitutions was retrieved from cells stressed with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we observed a potent (about 4-fold) increase in Tyr-717 phosphorylation compared to WT. Conversely, a Ser-706/710-Ala mutant showed complete loss of Tyr-717 phosphorylation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Furthermore, similar effects were observed for overall tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD2, as demonstrated with a general phospho-tyrosine antibody (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). It thus became clear that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD2 is dependent on activation loop Ser-706/710 phosphorylation.</p>
        <p>To further substantiate these findings, we modulated PKC activity in oxidative stress conditions and probed for the effect on Tyr-717 and overall tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD2. We used both PKC inhibitors (BimI and GÃ¶6983) and the PKC activator PDB. Treatment with BimI and GÃ¶6983 resulted in an expected decrease of Ser-706/710 phosphorylation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), but also in a decrease in Tyr-717 and overall tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Conversely, when cells were pretreated with PDB and subsequently exposed to oxidative stress, we noticed a marked increase in Tyr-717 and overall tyrosine phosphorylation. Treatment with PDB alone did not result in any tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD2 while potently stimulating Ser-706/710 phosphorylation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). These results further substantiate the conclusion that activation loop Ser-706/710 phosphorylation potentiates tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD2 in oxidative stress conditions.</p>
        <p>In agreement with previously published data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, we did not observe a dependency of Tyr phosphorylation on the activation loop Ser phosphorylation state in PKD1, since both Ser-738/742-Glu and Ala mutants had similar levels of overall Tyr phosphorylation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). This indicates that these enzymes, though closely related, display divergent activation mechanisms in oxidative stress conditions.</p>

        <title>The interaction between PKD2 and PKCÎ´ is independent of N-terminal Tyr-87 phosphorylation</title>
        <p>In the activation model for PKD1 in oxidative stress, Tyr-95 phosphorylation by Src creates a docking site for the C2 domain of PKCÎ´ which in turn phosphorylates Ser-738/742. In contrast, in PKD2 Ser-706/710 phosphorylation primes for all PKD2 tyrosine phosphorylation during oxidative stress, since the PKD2 S706/S710A mutation completely abolishes subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD2. Hence, this would imply that PKCÎ´ can efficiently bind and phosphorylate non-tyrosine phosphorylated PKD2 in oxidative stress.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we probed for the association between PKCÎ´ and PKD2 in oxidative stress in presence or absence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP2 (Src) or STI-751 (Abl). We could indeed show that this interaction is not affected by tyrosine kinase inhibition (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). To further verify that N-terminal Tyr-87 phosphorylation in PKD2 is not required for PKCÎ´ binding and Ser-706/710 phosphorylation, we probed for PKCÎ´ interaction with a non-phosphorylatable PKD2 Y87F mutant. When this mutant was precipitated from cells stressed with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we observed similar PKCÎ´ binding to WT and Y87F kinase and Ser-706/710 phosphorylation was not affected (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). This indicates that, for PKD2 at least, ROS-stimulated interaction with PKCÎ´ does not require Tyr-87 phosphorylation.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Different binding mode of PKCÎ´ to PKD1 versus PKD2 in oxidative stress conditions.

        <title>The three PKD isoforms are differentially phosphorylated on Tyr in the activation segment</title>
        <p>Since the activation segment (containing Tyr-717) is entirely conserved in all three PKD isoforms, the antibody we raised against the phospho-Tyr-717 site of PKD2 is fully cross-reactive to the other isoforms. Strikingly, we observed that the degree of Tyr phosphorylation in the YxAPE motif in response to oxidative stress is significantly different between the isoforms. Indeed, PKD2 is most abundantly phosphorylated, with 70% less phosphorylation in PKD3 and 90% less in PKD1 when compared to PKD2 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). To elucidate whether this difference is due to a signaling pathway specifically targeting PKD2 during oxidative stress, or to the fact that Abl is incapable to phosphorylate PKD1, we co-expressed GST-tagged PKD1 and PKD2 with FLAG-tagged Abl. As expected, we could detect phosphorylation of PKD2 at Tyr-717, which was completely reversed by addition of the Abl inhibitor STI-571. However, Abl was unable to phosphorylate PKD1 at Tyr-749, indicating that Abl cannot efficiently phosphorylate PKD1 <italic>in cellulo</italic> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). It is known that PKD1/2 and Abl do not form a stable complex during immunoprecipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, and we were also not able to show such an interaction (data not shown). Since PKD1 is known to be phosphorylated by Abl in the PH domain, but is not phosphorylated in the Pâ+â1 loop, we reasoned that a local molecular difference between PKD1 and PKD2 might contribute to their differential phosphorylation in the activation segment. Interestingly, while the kinase domains of hPKD1 and hPKD2 are 95% identical, the transition region between subdomain VIII (which ends with the APE motif) and subdomain IX is different between the two isoforms. Indeed, PKD1 contains a positively charged <sup>764</sup>RNK<sup>766</sup> motif, while PKD2 contains a non-charged, partially hydrophobic <sup>724</sup>LNQ<sup>726</sup> motif in this region (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The region C-terminal of the APE motif together with the Î±G helix is important for interactions of many protein kinases with upstream kinases, substrates, regulatory proteins, and phosphatases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. We therefore swapped the three differential amino-acids between PKD1 and PKD2 and probed these exchange mutants for Tyr phosphorylation in the activation segment upon oxidative stress. Interestingly, we observed a strong decrease of Tyr-717 phosphorylation in PKD2 when its <sup>724</sup>LNQ<sup>726</sup> motif was swapped with <sup>764</sup>RNK<sup>766</sup> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Conversely, we also observed increased Tyr-749 phosphorylation of PKD1 when its <sup>764</sup>RNK<sup>766</sup> motif was swapped with <sup>724</sup>LNQ<sup>726</sup>, albeit rather moderately (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Similar effects were also observed upon co-expression of Abl with PKD2 and the exchange mutants (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). These data indicate that the LNQ motif is essential, but not sufficient for activation segment Tyr phosphorylation of PKD1/2 by Abl.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>The PKD2-specific LNQ motif in the activation segment underlies the differential phosphorylation of PKD isoforms at Tyr in the Pâ+â1 loop during oxidative stress.

</p>
        <p>To examine whether this difference in activity could be due to Tyr-717 phosphorylation in PKD2, we made use of the aforementioned PKD2 LNQ.RNK exchange mutant, which shows a strong reduction in Tyr-717 phosphorylation compared to WT PKD2, without aberrations in activation loop Ser-706/710 phosphorylation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Interestingly, this PKD2 mutant follows similar kinetics as wild-type (WT) PKD1 during oxidative stress (albeit with slightly higher K<sub>m</sub> values) indicating that Tyr-717 phosphorylation is responsible for the increase in k<sub>cat</sub> for PKD2 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In PDB stimulated conditions, this mutant remarkably shows higher activity than WT PKD1/2, which can be correlated to increased PDB-induced activation loop Ser-706/710 phosphorylation, for hitherto unknown reasons (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b,c</xref> and TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our kinetic analysis also indicates that a Tyr to Phe substitution is not an adequate non-phosphorylatable mutant, despite its use in several other studies (see discussion). Indeed, this substitution results in drastically increased K<sub>m</sub> and lowered k<sub>cat</sub> levels compared to WT PKD2, even in PDB stimulated conditions, where Tyr-717 is not phosphorylated (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a,b</xref> and TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Interestingly, while the Y717F mutant displays strongly impaired activity, activation loop Ser-706/710 phosphorylation is higher than in WT under oxidative stress (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c and d</xref>). This indicates that this mutation possibly alters the activation segment conformation/flexibilty, increasing accessibility for upstream PKC, while it has an incorrect conformation for optimal catalysis.</p>
        <p>To directly assess how Tyr-717 phosphorylation affects PKD2 activity, we purified PKD2 from unstimulated cells co-expressing Abl. It should be noted that in conditions of high-level expression, (unstimulated) Abl can phosphorylate PKD2 independent of activation loop Ser phosphorylation, although still preferring Ser-phosphorylated species as indicated by a PKD2 S706/710E mutant (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). This is in contrast to oxidative stress conditions, where endogenous levels of activated Abl are incapable of phosphorylating a PKD2 S706/S710A mutant (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, lane 6 and Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Kinetic analysis of purified PKD2 from Abl overexpressing cells treated with or without STI-571 revealed an increase in k<sub>cat</sub> values for PKD2 phosphorylated at Tyr-717 by about 1.5 fold compared to a non-Tyr phosphorylated species (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> and TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This increase is independent of the activation loop Ser phosphorylation state, which is at similar (basal) levels in both conditions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). In absolute terms, however this stimulatory effect is quite small compared to the stimulatory effect under oxidative stress when Ser-706/710 phosphorylation also increases (compare Abl-phosphorylated PKD2 k<sub>cat</sub>â=â32.6 to Ox. stress stimulated PKD2 k<sub>cat</sub>â=â96âpmol phosphate/min/pmol PKD).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Tyr phosphorylation by Abl results in an increase in k<sub>cat</sub> independent of the activation loop Ser phosphorylation state.

        <title>Tyr-717 phosphorylation does not affect NF-ÎºB signaling by PKD2</title>
        <p>Since PKDs are known to signal to NF-ÎºB in oxidative stress, we wondered whether the phosphorylation of PKD2 on its regulatory sites, including Tyr-717, might influence the signaling output. Therefore, we tested WT PKD2 and several mutants for their ability to signal to NF-ÎºB via a luciferase reporter assay (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). WT PKD2 displays an approximate 1.5 fold increase in NF-ÎºB activity, but interestingly, strong potentiating effects are observed with S706/710âA and Y717F mutants. This could be due to loss of Tyr-717 phosphorylation, since both Y717F and S706/710A cannot be phosphorylated at Tyr-717 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), but it could also be an effect of PKD inactivation, since a S706/710âA mutant is inactive, and we have shown here that a Y717F mutant is catalytically impaired (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a,b</xref>). To discriminate these effects we used the PKD2 LNQ.RNK exchange mutant, which is still active, but shows strongly reduced Tyr-717 phosphorylation. This mutant supported levels of NF-ÎºB reporter activation equivalent to WT PKD2 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>), indicating that effects observed with S706/710A and Y717F mutants are likely due to inactivation of PKD2 rather than blocking Tyr-717 phosphorylation. Consistent with this idea, increasing PKD2 activity in oxidative stress does not affect PKD2 signaling to NF-ÎºB, as shown with a S706/710E mutant (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Signaling to NF-ÎºB by different PKD2 mutants in oxidative stress conditions.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this work, we show that PKD2 can be phosphorylated in oxidative stress conditions in the Pâ+â1 loop of the kinase activation segment at a highly conserved Tyr residue just N-terminal of the APE motif.</p>
      <p>This Tyr residue shows very high conservation among Ser/Thr kinases, with Tyr occurring in most (73%) cases, followed by Phe (15%) and Trp (11%). Despite the high conservation of the Tyr residue in the Pâ+â1 loop, there are only a few reports of phosphorylation in the YxAPE motif in other kinases. For example, phosphorylation is also reported for PKCÎ´ in oxidative stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> and in EGF signaling for PKCÎµ, PKCÎ¶ and PKB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Also, the residue was implicated in activation of PKB downstream of RET/PTC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. IKKÎ² has also been reported as a kinase regulated by this site in TNF signaling to NF-ÎºB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Recently, ERK has been shown to be phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> at this residue by MEK1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Chk2 is also phosphorylated at this residue after irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. All these studies make use of Tyr to Phe substitutions as non-phosphorylatable mutants, and one must be cautious to not over-interpret functional results with these mutants. This is especially evident in our NF-ÎºB assays, where we observed a strong increase in signaling with the Y717F mutant, but not with the LNQ.RNK exchange mutant, which causes a disruption of Tyr-717 phosphorylation without directly affecting the phosphoacceptor. These misrepresentative results stem from the fact that a Tyr to Phe substitution results in drastic effects on kinase activity, with about a 7-fold increase in K<sub>m</sub> values for Syn-2 phosphorylation, occurring even in PDB stimulated conditions where WT PKD2 is not phosphorylated on Tyr-717. A similar increase in K<sub>m</sub> has been shown for an analogous Y204F substitution in PKA, which has not yet been identified to be phosphorylated at this residue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. This indicates that for Tyr containing kinases the hydroxyl group is of critical importance for their activity. It would be interesting to determine why Phe containing enzymes do not have this requirement.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, while a Y717F substitution in PKD2 resulted in impaired kinetics, activation loop Ser-706/710 phosphorylation is even higher than in WT PKD2. This is possibly due to alterations in the conformation of the activation segment, facilitating phosphorylation of the Ser residues by PKCÎ´. These observations emphasize the fact that activation loop phosphorylation cannot always be used as a readout for kinase activity. This was also shown in a previous study using the allosteric PKD inhibitor CID-755673, where PKD was shown to display elevated activation loop Ser phosphorylation upon inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Strikingly, the phosphosite database reports phosphorylation at the YxAPE motif in more than 70 kinases (combining human, rat and mouse proteomes), suggesting that this phenomenon might be more widespread than was previously appreciated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org">www.phosphosite.org</ext-link> and Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).</p>
      <p>We observed differential phosphorylation levels of the YxAPE Tyr after oxidative stress within the PKD family, despite 100% conservation of this motif in all three PKD isoforms. One of the molecular determinants that we identified for the discrepant phosphorylation at this site is the loop between subdomain VIII and IX, just C-terminal of the APE motif. While the kinase domains of the three PKD isoforms share 90% sequence identity, there is remarkable divergence in this region, with a RNK motif in PKD1, a LNQ motif in PKD2 and a RSK motif in PKD3. Together with the Î±G helix this region is important for interactions with upstream kinases, substrates, regulatory proteins, and phosphatases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. When we swapped the LNQ motif of PKD2 with the RNK motif of PKD1, we observed a drastic decrease in Tyr-717 phosphorylation. This decrease is possibly due to the charge content in this loop in PKD1/3 that might be electrostatically unfavorable for interaction with Abl. Having established that the Y717F substitution is disruptive for PKD2 function, the mutant where this region was swapped between PKD1 and PKD2 was an ideal tool to study the effects of Tyr phosphorylation in the Pâ+â1 loop on kinase activity. By following the kinetics of WT PKD1/2 and the PKD2 LNQ.RNK mutant, we were able to show that Tyr-717 phosphorylation can modulate the activity of PKD2 towards the model peptide substrate Syn-2. In particular, Tyr-717 phosphorylated PKD2 displays higher turnover compared to a non-phosphorylated species. Tyr phosphorylation in the Pâ+â1 loop alters the charge, and possibly the conformation of the activation segment, which may enhance the release of phosphorylated substrate.</p>
      <p>The differential regulation of PKD isoforms in oxidative stress extends beyond Tyr phosphorylation in the Pâ+â1 loop. Our experiments also revealed that the activation mechanism of PKD isoforms is entirely different. While PKD1 has been shown to be dependent on Tyr-463 and Tyr-95 phosphorylation for activation loop Ser-738/742 phosphorylation, we do not see this dependency in PKD2. In fact, we see the opposite: activation loop Ser-706/710 phosphorylation primes for subsequent Tyr phosphorylation. PKD2 can also be phosphorylated at Tyr-438 in the PH domain, (corresponding to Tyr-463 in PKD1), for example in BCR-ABL<sup>+</sup> cell lines and upon interferon stimulation of HeLa cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. While this residue is not implicated in the PKD2 activation mechanism, it may play a role in stabilization of the active conformation. The PKCÎ´âPKD2 interaction is not dependent on N-terminal Tyr-87 phosphorylation, whereas it has been shown to be highly dependent on Tyr-95 phosphorylation in PKD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. PKD3 contains a Phe residue at this position, but nonetheless has recently been shown to be activated via oxidative stress in fibroblasts, which is reversible by treatment with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. This suggests that PKD3 can also be activated by PKCs in oxidative stress despite the absence of a pTyr in the N-terminus. It is likely that additional motifs are present in PKD2/3 that facilitate the interaction with upstream PKCs. For PKD2 we could show that the extreme N-terminal AP-rich region, as well as the CRD is important for a robust interaction. The different determinants for PKCÎ´ binding could be explained by structural diversity, since this region (AP-rich regionâ+âCRD) is only 48% identical between the 3 isoforms.</p>
      <p>The differential biochemical regulation of PKD isoforms in oxidative stress exposes a potential mechanism for functional divergence between the isoforms. Such divergence has been reported in restricted cases. For example, PKD1 and PKD2, but not PKD3 phosphorylate PI4KIIIÎ²<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Furthermore, PKD2, and not PKD1 specifically regulates MMP9 secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. It was also shown that in cardiomyocytes Î±1-ARs selectively activate PKD1 while PAR-1 and PDGFRs selectively activate PKD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. PKD2 was specifically activated during murine myoblast differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. While differential activation is well documented, it is unclear what molecular mechanisms underlie this isoform-specific regulation. Our current study provides biochemical evidence for isoform-specific regulation in oxidative stress conditions through differential phosphorylation of Tyr in the Pâ+â1 loop.</p>
      <p>Since oxidative stress induces signaling from PKDs to NF-ÎºB, we wondered if the ROS-induced Tyr-717 phosphorylation in PKD2 might play a role in this pathway. Intriguingly, we found that, while WT PKD2 signals to NF-ÎºB, signaling is highly potentiated with Y717F and S706/710A mutants (both of which cannot be phosphorylated at Tyr-717 but are also inactive). By using the PKD2 LNQ.RNK exchange mutant we found that the observed effects are not due to loss of Tyr-717 phosphorylation, but rather to an abolishment of PKD2 activity. We therefore conclude that PKD2 activity is counterproductive for its signaling output to NF-ÎºB signaling, which is consistent with results obtained by the Seufferlein lab, where it was also shown that NF-ÎºB signaling by PKD2 is potentiated by a kinase dead mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Since Tyr-717 phosphorylation results in increased PKD2 activity, it consequently does not potentiate signaling to NF-ÎºB. The effects we observed are in marked contrast with PKD1 signaling to NF-ÎºB, where PKD activity is crucial for signaling output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The final signaling output is likely determined by the differential regulation and different proteinÂ levels of PKD1 and PKD2, which is an intriguing question for further investigation. However, while Tyr-717 phosphorylation does not affect NF-ÎºB signaling, it might differentially affect other pathways in oxidative stress.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, in this paper we show differential phosphorylation of PKD isoforms at a highly conserved Tyr residue in the activation segment Pâ+â1 loop, which modulates kinase activity towards peptide substrate. These results might have broader implications for our understanding of kinase regulation in general since the residue is highly conserved among Ser/Thr kinases and is found to be phosphorylated in more than 70 cases in proteomic studies.</p>

To determine MichaÃ«lis-Menten kinetics the following reaction mixture was prepared: 50âmM Tris, pH 7.4, 10âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50âng PKD and 100âÂµM ATP added with 2âÂµCi [Î³-32P]ATP (Perkin-Elmer, Massachusetts, USA). Reactions were started with Syntide-2 (Syn-2) peptide at different concentrations (15â480âÂµM). After 10â² (in the linear range) the reaction was stopped by spotting 30âÂµl on a Whatman P81 filter paper. The filter papers were washed 3 times in 0.5% phosphoric acid, followed by one wash in 100% acetone. Subsequently, the papers were air-dried and counted using the Tri-Carb 2810 TR scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer). Non-linear regression analysis and determination of kinetic parameters was performed using Graphpad (PRISM).</p>

        <p>HeLa cells per well of a 6 well plate were transiently co-transfected with 3âÂµg NF-ÎºB-luciferase reporter (NF-ÎºB-LUC), 1âÂµg pCS2-(n) Î²-Galactosidase reporter and the 1âÂµg cDNA of interest, using Superfect (Qiagen). 4âhours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 500âÂµM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 18âhours. At the endpoint, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped in 250âÂµl Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and centrifuged (13,000ârpm, 10âmin, 4âÂ°C). Assays for luciferase and Î²-gal activities were performed using standard assays (as described in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>) and measured using a Veritas luminometer (Symantec, Cupertino, CA). Luciferase activity of the NF-ÎºB-LUC reporter construct was normalized to Î²-Gal activity.</p>

        <title>Peptide arrays</title>
        <p>Peptide array analysis to determine PKD2 phosphorylation site specificity was carried out essentially as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Briefly, 180 peptide mixtures (50âÎ¼M) with the general sequence Y-A-x-x-x-x-x-S/T-x-x-x-x-A-G-K-K(biotin), where âxâ indicates a mixture of the 17 proteogenic amino acids (excluding Cys, Ser and Thr) and S/T is an even mixture of Ser and Thr, were arrayed in 1536 well plates in 2.5âÎ¼L of 50âmM Tris, pH 7.5, 100âmM NaCl, 10âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1âmM DTT, 0.1% Tween 20. In each well, one âxâ position was fixed as one of the 20 amino acids. In addition, two wells contained peptides in which the central S/T position was fixed as either Ser or Thr. Reactions were initiated by adding FLAG-PKD2 that had been isolated from cells either activated with PDB (not phosphorylated at Tyr-717) or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (to induce Tyr-717 phosphorylation) together with ATP (to a final concentration of 50âÎ¼M including 33âÎ¼Ci/mL [Î³-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP). Plates were incubated for 2âh at 30âC, and then 200ânl aliquots were spotted onto streptavidin coated membrane (Promega SAM<sup>2</sup> biotin capture membrane). The membrane was washed extensively as described and exposed to a phosphor storage screen. Radiolabel incorporation was quantified by phosphor imaging. Data were normalized so that the average value at each peptide position was equal to 1. Data from 3 independent experiments were averaged, and log<sub>2</sub> transformed data were converted to a heat map in Microsoft Excel.</p>
