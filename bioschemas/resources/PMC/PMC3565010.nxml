      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Autophagy is a finely orchestrated cellular catabolic process that requires multiple autophagy-related gene products (ATG). The ULK1 complex functions to integrate upstream signals to downstream ATG proteins through an unknown mechanism. Here, we identified an interaction between mammalian FIP200 and ATG16L1, essential components of the ULK1 and ATG5 complexes, respectively. Further analyses demonstrate that this is a direct interaction mediated by a short domain of ATG16L1 which we term the FIP200-Binding Domain (FBD). The FBD is not required for ATG16L1 self-dimerization or interaction with ATG5. Importantly, FBD-deleted ATG16L1 mutant is defective in mediating amino acid starvation-induced autophagy, which requires the ULK1 complex. Intriguingly, this mutant retains its function in supporting glucose deprivation-induced autophagy, a ULK1 complex-independent process. Our study has therefore identified a novel interaction between the ULK1 and ATG5 complexes that can distinguish ULK1-dependent and -independent autophagy processes.</p>

    <p id="P2">Degradation of cellular contents can occur via the proteasome or lysosome systems<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. A number of pathways exist that deliver substrates for degradation to either systems. Macroautophagy (commonly referred to as autophagy) is one pathway that facilitates the degradation of long lived proteins, damaged organelles and infectious pathogens, resulting in the clearance of toxic materials and increased nutrients availability in the cell<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Because of these substrates, autophagy has been implicated in a number of physiological and pathological processes including development, pathogen infection, neurodegeneration and cancer<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">During autophagy, a number of protein complexes orchestrate the formation of a lipid bilayer (termed phagophore or pre-autophagosome) which upon maturation, engulfs cytoplasmic materials and forms the autophagosome. The eventual fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes results in the degradation of the autophagosome content and the recycling of nutrients back into the cytoplasm. Key players in these events include a family of ubiquitin-like proteins, such as LC3, which are involved in the phagophore maturation and possibly cargo selection<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Membrane targeting of LC3 is essential for autophagy and requires a series of ubiquitin-like conjugation events that lead to the conjugation of cytosolic LC3 (LC3âI) to membrane bound, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-conjugated form (LC3âII)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. These events are catalyzed by autophagy-related proteins (or ATG proteins) with E1, E2 and E3-like enzymatic activities termed ATG7, ATG3 and ATG5âATG12, respectively. The ATG5âATG12 conjugate (herein referred to as ATG5â12) formation is also catalyzed by similar conjugation events but requires a distinct E2-like enzyme termed ATG10<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. In addition to its possible role as an E3-like enzyme during LC3âII formation, the ATG5â12 conjugate was shown to form a large protein complex with ATG16L1 which is thought to be required to specify the site of LC3 conjugation during autophagy<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Depletion of any of ATG5, ATG16L1 or ATG7 completely abolishes autophagosome formation<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, depletion of ATG3 results in defective maturation of the phagophore structure<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. LC3 can also be recruited to single membrane structures, for example during phagocytosis or entotic cell clearance<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In these cases, the core machinery utilized during LC3âII formation is also required.</p>
    <p id="P4">A number of upstream signaling complexes can regulate autophagy including the Vps34 and ULK1 complexes. The Vps34 complex is comprised of a number of proteins, including the Vps34 lipid kinase, p150, Beclin and ATG14, and is essential for phagophore formation and proper recruitment of ATG proteins to the phagophore<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the ULK1 complex, comprised of the protein kinase ULK1 and several regulatory components including ATG13 and FIP200, is suppressed by the mTORC1 kinase activity<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Once mTORC1 activity is inhibited, for example by amino acid deprivation or cytotoxic response, the ULK1 complex becomes activated and stimulates autophagy. Mechanistically, how the ULK1 complex coordinates with other ATG complexes during autophagy is not clear, and the protein substrate(s) of its kinase activity required for autophagy induction have not yet been identified.</p>
    <p id="P5">In this study we sought to identify novel players in autophagy that are particularly required during the initial phagophore formation stage. To do so, we developed a system to isolate membrane-localized ATG proteins. Using this system, we conducted tandem affinity purification and identified FIP200 as a direct binding partner of ATG16L1. We further provide evidence to demonstrate that this novel interaction between the ULK1 complex and the ATG5 complex is required for ULK1 complex-dependent but not ULK1 complex-independent autophagy processes.</p>

        <title>Pre-autophagosomes accumulate in the absence of ATG3</title>
        <p id="P6">In order to study the molecular events during pre-autophagosome structures formation, we separated membrane-bound proteins from cytosolic proteins by subcellular fractionation. As can be seen in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1a</xref>, cytosolic LC3 (LC3âI) was separated from membrane-bound LC3 (LC3âII) in wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). However, using this method, we hardly detected the accumulation of upstream ATG proteins, such as ATG16L1, in the membrane fraction of wild type MEFs even when autophagy was induced by amino acid deprivation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This suggests that the recruitment of upstream ATG proteins to pre-autophagosome structures may occur in a transient manner. Previous studies suggest that in the absence of ATG3, pre-autophagosome structures are unable to mature into autophagosomes and therefore accumulate in the cell likely leading to stabilization of upstream autophagy events which are transient in ATG3-expressing cells<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested the subcellular localization of ATG16L1 in <italic>Atg3<sup>â/â</sup></italic>. Interestingly, ATG16L1 accumulated on the membrane fraction of these cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). We observed no detectable increase of ATG16L1 recruitment to the membrane fraction after 2 hrs of amino acid starvation in <italic>Atg3<sup>â/â</sup></italic>, in agreement with previous studies<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Similarly, we show by immunofluorescence analyses that ATG16L1 positive structures, which co-localize with endogenous ATG5, were detectable even under nutrient rich conditions in the absence of ATG3 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

        <title>Identification of FIP200 as an ATG16L1-interacting partner</title>
        <p id="P7">We further sought to identify novel protein-protein interactions of membrane bound ATG proteins in <italic>Atg3<sup>â/â</sup></italic> using ATG14 and ATG16L1 as baits. To do so, we used tandem affinity purification to purify ATG14 and ATG16L1 complexes followed by SDSâPAGE analysis and silver staining (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We observed prominent bands in the ATG14 sample that correspond to known ATG14 interacting partners, including Vps34 and p150, thereby confirming that this method is able to purify functional autophagy complexes. In the case of ATG16L1 purification, we detected a prominent distinct band of a molecular weight greater than 170 kDa in addition to the ATG5â12 conjugate, the known binding partner of ATG16L1. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed the identity of this band as FIP200, an essential component of the ULK1 complex. Previously, the ULK1 complex was proposed to be functionally linked to the ATG5 complex, but how these two complexes cross-talk is unclear.</p>
        <p id="P8">To verify the interaction between ATG16L1 and FIP200, we expressed ATG16L1 in 293T cells and found that ATG16L1, but not ATG14, can pull down FIP200 as well as ATG13 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, stably expressed ATG16L1 in <italic>Atg3<sup>â/â</sup></italic> can also pull down endogenous FIP200, ATG13 and to a lower extent ULK1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Reciprocal pull down of FIP200 expressed in 293T cells can co-precipitate ATG16L1 as well as the ATG5â12 conjugate (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Furthermore, we tested the potential interaction of endogenous FIP200 with ATG16L1. Because their interaction is most likely transient and stabilized by ATG3 deletion, we used <italic>Atg3<sup>â/â</sup></italic> for this purpose. As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2d</xref>, immunoprecipitation of endogenous FIP200 can co-precipitate endogenous ATG16L1 in these cells. Using immunofluorescence analysis we show that ATG16L1 punctate structures almost completely co-localized with FIP200 in both wild type MEFs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>) and <italic>Atg3<sup>â/â</sup></italic> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>) as was described previously<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p>

        <title>Interaction between FIP200 and ATG16L1 is direct</title>
        <p id="P9">Having shown that the ATG16L1-containing ATG5 complex and the FIP200-containing ULK1 complex can co-precipitate, we further sought to determine which proteins directly mediate the interaction between these two complexes. First, we found that ATG16L1 and FIP200 can interact in MEF cells lacking the expression of ATG5 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) or ATG13 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), indicating that ATG5 and ATG13 are dispensable for the interaction between ATG16L1 and FIP200. Furthermore, ATG5 and its ATG12 conjugation mutant (ATG5 K130R) were unable to pull down FIP200 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, we show that purified recombinant ATG16L1 can interact with recombinant FIP200 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, left panel) but not with recombinant ATG13 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, right panel), ATG3 or ATG7 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that ATG16L1 and FIP200 directly interact with each other independently of other complex components.</p>

        <title>Identification of ATG16L1 domain required for FIP200 binding</title>
        <p id="P10">In order to determine the function of the ATG16L1âFIP200 interaction in autophagy, we first sought to map the ATG16L1 domain required to mediate its binding to FIP200. To do so, we generated a series of ATG16L1 truncation fragments (depicted in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) based on previous structural analysis of yeast ATG16<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. These include truncations of ATG16L1 that lack ATG5-binding region (mediated through the N-terminal region), coiled-coil domain (CCD, required for self-dimerization), and seven WD40 repeats (located at the C-terminal half). We expressed the truncation fragments of ATG16L1 in 293T cells and tested their interaction with endogenous FIP200 and ATG5. As shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4b</xref>, ATG16L1 fragments that were defective in ATG5 binding can still bind to FIP200, indicating that FIP200 and ATG5 interact with ATG16L1 through distinct domains. The ATG16L1 fragment lacking a region between the WD40 and coiled-coil domains (Î4 fragment, residues 1â335 deleted) were defective in binding to FIP200. These results suggest that the interaction between ATG16L1 and FIP200 is mediated through residues 206â335 of ATG16L1. This region of ATG16L1 was previously shown to be required for Rab33B binding<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P11">The Î4 fragment includes a large deletion of the N-terminal half of ATG16L1 and is therefore unable to bind ATG5 or self-dimerize in addition to its inability to bind FIP200. Therefore, we sought to identify a smaller region of ATG16L1 that is required for FIP200 binding. By further mutational analyses we identified a shorter region of ATG16L1 within residues 206â335 to be required for FIP200 binding. As shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4c</xref>, ATG16L1 mutant deleted of residues number 229â242 (denoted as Î229â242) as well as an additional mutant harboring a larger deletion (Î182â242) were defective in binding to FIP200 when compared to the full length protein. Importantly, Î229â242 mutant of ATG16L1 still retained its ATG5 binding ability (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>) as well as its ability to dimerize with full length protein (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Interestingly, residues 229â242 were previously shown dispensable for Rab33B binding<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In addition, these residues are not conserved in ATG16L2, which does not support autophagy despite its ability to self-dimerize and bind to ATG5<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, but is conserved in ATG16L1 from various vertebrate species (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Consistently, we found that FIP200 was unable to bind ATG16L2 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). These results demonstrate that residues 229â242 can differentiate the ability of ATG16L1 to bind to FIP200 from binding to ATG5 or self-dimerization. We name this region as the FIP200-binding domain (FBD) of ATG16L1.</p>

        <title>ÎFBD mutant is defective in ULK1-dependent autophagy</title>
        <p id="P12">To test whether the FIP200âATG16L1 interaction is required for the function of ATG16L1 in autophagy, we reconstituted <italic>Atg16l1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> with either full length or FIP200-binding domain truncated mutant (ÎFBD). In the absence of ATG16L1 expression, autophagy was completely disrupted<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, when we expressed full length ATG16L1 or ATG16L1 FBD basal levels of autophagy was restored, as measured by LC3âI to LC3âII conversion (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 5). However, when we induced autophagy by depriving cells of amino acids, ATG16L1ÎFBD-expressing cells showed greatly reduced autophagy compared to cells expressing full length ATG16L1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 6). We obtained similar results when we induced autophagy by treating cells with the selective mTOR inhibitor, Torin 1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The defect of ATG16L1ÎFBD in mediating amino acid starvation-induced autophagy is further supported by impeded p62 degradation (a well establish autophagosome substrate) in the ATG16L1ÎFBD-reconstituted cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). On the other hand, we found that the ÎWD40 mutant, which retains its ability to bind to FIP200 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), can restore amino acid starvation-induced autophagy to similar levels to full length protein (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Consistently, we show that ATG16L1ÎFBD exhibits reduced ability to localize to punctate structures corresponding to pre-autophagosomes (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). The formation of GFPâLC3 punctate structures, a marker of autophagosomes, was also markedly reduced in cells reconstituted with ATG16L1ÎFBD compared to cells reconstituted with full length ATG16L1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). Therefore, the FIP200âATG16L1 interaction is crucial for the function of ATG16L1 during amino acid starvation-induced autophagy, a process which requires the FIP200-containing ULK1 complex.</p>

        <title>ÎFBD mutant is fully active during ULK1-independent autophagy</title>
        <p id="P13">The inability of ATG16L1ÎFBD to fully restore autophagy can be potentially due to an overall misfolding of the protein caused by the introduced truncation rather than its deficiency in binding FIP200. If so, our results in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref> would not be able to support a functional relevance of the FIP200âATG16L1 interaction. Therefore, we sought to assess whether ATG16L1ÎFBD possesses any biological function that is independent of FIP200 and thereby the ULK1 complex. Recently, glucose starvation was suggested to induce autophagy in a ULK1 complex-independent manner which correlates with an increase in cellular ammonia levels and lack of mTORC1 inhibition<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We confirmed this by using ULK1 and ULK2 double knockout MEFs (ULK DKO) where glucose starvation induced LC3âII formation which is susceptible to lysosomal degradation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Meanwhile, we observed that glucose starvation did not induce ULK1 dephosphorylation on residues that are dephosphorylated during amino acid starvation<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Interestingly, we when reconstituted <italic>Atg16l1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> with full length ATG16L1 or ATG16L1ÎFBD comparable LC3âI to LC3âII conversion upon glucose starvation were exhibited whereas the absence of ATG16L1 expression completely abolished LC3 conjugation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>) indicating that ATG16L1ÎFBD is fully functional during such ULK1 complex-independent autophagy. Similarly, we observed comparable GFPâLC3 punctate structure formation between full length ATG16L1 and ATG16L1ÎFBD expressing cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Overall, these analyses suggest that, unlike ULK1 complex-dependent autophagy induced by amino acid starvation, ULK1 complex-independent autophagy induced by glucose starvation does not require FIP200 binding to ATG16L1.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P14">In this study we provide evidence for a direct interaction between the ULK1 complex component, FIP200, and the ATG5 complex component, ATG16L1. This interaction is specifically required for ULK1 complex-dependent autophagy, thus providing mechanistic insights into how the ULK1 complex communicates with other ATG complexes, such as the ATG5 complex. Meanwhile the ATG5 complex (including its component ATG16L1) belongs to the essential core autophagy machinery, the ULK1 complex appears to only mediate autophagy induced by certain specific triggers. The biochemical LC3 conjugation reaction is intact in cells with genetic deletion of ULK1<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and LC3âII formation takes place at basal levels in cells depleted of the ULK1 complex components<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Indeed, the ULK1 complex, but not the ATG5 complex, is dispensable for glucose starvation-induced autophagy<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P15">Could ATG16L1 be a converging point mediating other upstream autophagy signals in addition to those through ULK1? This would be an interesting hypothesis to consider. It is clear, however, that the FBD domain of ATG16L1 is not necessarily responsible for all other signals, because ATG16L1ÎFBD is functionally intact during glucose starvation-induced autophagy. Another recognizable structure in ATG16L1 is its C-terminal WD40 repeats, which is a versatile protein-protein interaction domain and is not present in yeast ATG16. Although not required for autophagy triggered by amino acid starvation, it is possible that this region mediates certain other autophagy signals. If so, then the C-terminal region of ATG16L1 enables the mammalian autophagy pathway to sense more diverse and complex signals compared to its yeast counterpart. On the other hand, it is also possible that the WD40 repeats in mammalian ATG16L1 might only be relevant to non-autophagy processes<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. In this sense, the potential pathological role of the Crohnâs disease-associated ATG16L1 mutation (T300A), which lies within the WD40 repeats, during both autophagy-related and non-autophagy-related processes should be explored<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P16">A detailed comparison of ATG16L1 with its homolog ATG16L2 should also shed light on the function of ATG16L1 during autophagy. Unlike ATG16L1, ATG16L2 is unable to support autophagy or localize to the phagophore structures despite its ability to bind ATG5, self-oligomerize and form a large protein complex with the ATG5â12 complex<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. ATG16L1 from various vertebrate species all possess highly conserved FBD regions, whereas ATG16L2 lacks this domain. Consistently, we found ATG16L2 failed to interact with FIP200. However, whether the lack of FBD renders ATG16L2 inactive in autophagy is unclear, as ATG16L1 with its FBD deleted can still mediate ULK1 complex-independent autophagy. In addition, neither yeast nor <italic>C. elegans</italic> ATG16 have this domain (there is no true FIP200 homolog in these organisms either). Furthermore, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical studies suggest that yeast ATG16 is not required for the E3-like activity of the ATG5â12 during the conjugation of ATG8 (the yeast homologue of LC3) to PE<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Thus in mammalian cells, the difference between ATG16L1 and ATG16L2 in autophagy does not appear to be due to their differential influence on the E3-like enzymatic activity of the ATG5 complex. As such, the exact structural and biochemical basis that renders ATG16L1 but not ATG16L2 to be an essential functional component in autophagy has yet to be defined.</p>
      <p id="P17">In conclusion, this study has uncovered a novel functional interaction between two upstream ATG complexes, and demonstrated that ATG16L1 is not only an essential structural component of the ATG5 complex but also a signaling protein that can mediate specific upstream signals during autophagy such as those transduced by the ULK1 complex.</p>

Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against endogenous FIP200, ATG13 or ULK1. (C) Interaction between FIP200 and the ATG5â12âATG16L1 complex in 293T whole cell lysate. Cell lysates expressing myc-FIP200 were subjected to anti-myc antibodies immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis to detect S-tagged ATG16L1 and endogenous ATG5â12 conjugate. (D) Endogenous FIP200 and ATG16L1 can co-immunoprecipitate. Endogenous FIP200 was immunoprecipitated from <italic>Atg3<sup>â/â</sup></italic> followed by Western blot analysis to detect endogenous ATG16L1 binding. (E) ATG16L1 and FIP200 co-localize.

        <p>(A) Schematic presentation of ATG16L1 fragments used encompassed the following amino acids: FL: 1â623; Î1: 39â623; Î2: 120â623; Î3: 206â623; Î4: 336â623; ÎWD40: 1â335. The Î229â242 lacks amino acids 229â242 and is termed ÎFBD (for FIP200-Binding Domain) in subsequent figures. (B) S-tagged fragments depicted in (A) were expressed in 293T, followed by S protein agarose pull down. Interaction with endogenous FIP200 and ATG5â12 was analyzed by Western blot. Note that residual binding of Î1 fragment to ATG5â12 is most likely due to dimerization with endogenous ATG16L1. (C) S-tagged deletion mutants of ATG16L1 lacking residues 229â242 or 182â242 expressed as in (B). (D) FL GFP-tagged ATG16L1 was co-expressed with S-tagged FL, Î229â242 or Î3 mutants of ATG16L1 followed by S protein agarose pull down. Note, the Î3 mutant lacking the CCD is unable to self-dimerize. (E) 293T whole cell lysate expressing myc-tagged FIP200 was subjected to anti-myc immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis using antibodies against endogenous ATG16L2 (left panel) or ATG16L1 (right panel). WD: WD40 repeats; FL: Full Length; CCD: Coiled-Coil Domain.</p>

        <title>The FIP200-binding mutant of ATG16L1 is defective in amino acid starvation-induced autophagy</title>
        <p>(A) Amino acid starvation-induced autophagy is reduced in cells reconstituted with the ATG16L1ÎFBD mutant. <italic>Atg16l1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> reconstituted with FL or ATG16L1ÎFBD were either left untreated or amino acid-starved for 2 hrs. Bafilomycin A1 was included for 2 hrs in all samples. (B) Cells as in (A) were treated with Torin 1 (1 Î¼M) for 4 hrs prior to harvesting. (C) p62 degradation induced by amino acid starvation is impeded in <italic>Atg16l1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> reconstituted with ATG16L1ÎFBD. Cells were left untreated or starved of amino acids for 2 hrs. (D) <italic>Atg16l1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> expressing the indicated constructs were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies against ATG16L1 and FIP200. Quantification of ATG16L1 punctate structures per cell is shown in the right panel with standard deviation error bars included of 3 independent experiments of approximately 16 cells counted per condition. (E) GFP-LC3 expressed in <italic>Atg16l1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> reconstituted with FL or ATG16L1ÎFBD and treated as in (D). Right panel shows quantification of GFP-LC3 punctate structures with standard deviation error bars included of 3 independent experiments. AA starve: Amino Acid starvation; FL: Full Length; FBD: FIP200-Binding Domain.</p>

        <title>ATG16L1ÎFBD mutant retains full activity during ULK1 complex-independent, glucose starvation-induced autophagy</title>
        <p>(A) Glucose starvation-induced autophagy occurs independently of the ULK1 complex. WT and ULK1âULK2 double knockout MEFs (ULK DKO) were cultured in full growth media or in glucose free media for 20 hrs followed by Bafilomycin A1 treatment for additional 3 hrs. (B) ULK1 phosphorylation was examined in wild type MEFs starved of amino acids for 2 hrs or glucose for 20 hrs. ULK1 phospho-specific antibodies against phospho-serines 637 and 757 were used as indicated. (C) ÎFBD mutant of ATG16L1 can fully reconstitute autophagy induced by glucose starvation. <italic>Atg16l1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> reconstituted with full length or ÎFBD mutant of ATG16L1 were either left untreated or glucose-starved for 20 hrs and samples were analyzed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. (D) Cells as in (C) expressing GFP-LC3 were subjected to fluorescence analysis. The quantification of cells with GFP-LC3 punctate structures is shown in the right panel with standard deviation error bars included of 3 independent experiments. Approximately 400 cells were counted per condition. AA starve: Amino Acid starvation; Glu starve: Glucose starvation; FL: Full Length; FBD: FIP200-Binding Domain; WT: Wild Type.</p>
