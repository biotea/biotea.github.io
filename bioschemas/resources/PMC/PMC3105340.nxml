      <abstract>
        <p>Sensorineural hearing loss affects the quality of life and communication of millions of people, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identify mutations in <italic>Gipc3</italic> underlying progressive sensorineural hearing loss (age-related hearing loss 5, <italic>ahl5</italic>) and audiogenic seizures (juvenile audiogenic monogenic seizure 1, <italic>jams1</italic>) in mice and autosomal recessive deafness DFNB15 and DFNB95 in humans. Gipc3 localizes to inner ear sensory hair cells and spiral ganglion. A missense mutation in the PDZ domain has an attenuating effect on mechanotransduction and the acquisition of mature inner hair cell potassium currents. Magnitude and temporal progression of wave I amplitude of afferent neurons correlate with susceptibility and resistance to audiogenic seizures. The <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343A</italic></sup> allele disrupts the structure of the stereocilia bundle and affects long-term function of auditory hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. Our study suggests a pivotal role of Gipc3 in acoustic signal acquisition and propagation in cochlear hair cells.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Degeneration of the sensory hair cells in the organ of Corti and their innervating afferent neurons in the cochlear spiral ganglion results in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), which typically begins at the higher frequencies (&gt;15 kHz) and gradually affects lower frequencies. SNHL is among the most common sensory impairment affecting â¼17% of adult Americans. Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) or presbycusis impairs 30% of adults older than 65 years in the US<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Heritability and twin studies have suggested genetic contributions to presbycusis and a genome-wide-association study recently identified a genetic variant in the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (<italic>GRM7</italic>) gene as a risk factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, the majority of the genetic variation underlying susceptibility to SNHL remains unknown. Progressive SNHL in mice displays a histopathology similar to that in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Extensive natural variation in mouse strains has caused a remarkable phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of SNHL, providing experimental model systems to systematically decipher the underlying risk factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
    <p>We recently identified an early-onset hearing loss in Black Swiss (BLSW) mice that is controlled by the quantitative trait loci (QTL) age-related hearing loss 5 (<italic>ahl5</italic>) and <italic>ahl6</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), whereby the <italic>ahl5</italic> QTL accounts for â¼60% of the variation observed. The 95% confidence interval for <italic>ahl5</italic> is localized to a 25 Mbp region on chromosome 10 (<italic>D10Mit20</italic>-<italic>D10Mit95;</italic> 66, 475â91, 965 kbp). BLSW mice are also sensitive to acoustic stimulation, responding to loud noise with seizures, characterized by wild running, and tonic and clonic convulsions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Sensitivity to audiogenic seizures is highest at 2â3 weeks of age, but then susceptibility gradually decreases and mice become resistant at 6 weeks of age. The underlying locus, juvenile audiogenic monogenic seizure 1 (<italic>jams1</italic>), localizes to a 1.6cM region that overlaps with the <italic>ahl5</italic> interval<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The genetic location and their related pathology suggested that the <italic>ahl5</italic> and <italic>jams1</italic> phenotypes are caused by the same allele as previously shown for the 6748delG mutation in the <italic>Gpr98</italic> gene causing both audiogenic seizures and hearing loss in the Frings and BUB/BnJ mouse strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
    <p>The <italic>Gipc</italic> (GAIP interacting protein, C terminus) genes encode a small family of proteins characterized by a single, centrally located PDZ domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. GIPC1 was first identified through its interaction with regulator of G-protein signalling 19 (<italic>Rgs19</italic>) and has now been shown to interact with a host of proteins that are involved in signal transduction, vesicular trafficking, endocytosis and neurotransmitter release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Using its carboxy (C) terminal domain, GIPC1 was demonstrated to interact with Myosin VI, which is associated with SNHL in both mice and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Loss of Gipc1 function (<italic>Gipc1</italic><sup><italic>tm1Mvc</italic></sup>) results in a reduction in pre- and postsynaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>
    <p>Here, we identified a sequence polymorphism in the PDZ domain of Gipc3 as the cause of SNHL (<italic>ahl5</italic>) and audiogenic seizure susceptibility (<italic>jams1</italic>) in BLSW mice and we implicate mutations in <italic>GIPC3</italic> in human recessive SNHL (DFNB15 and DFNB95). Our study suggests a critical role of Gipc3 in signal acquisition and propagation in auditory hair cells.</p>

        <title>Positional cloning of <italic>ahl5</italic></title>
        <p>To genetically refine the <italic>ahl5</italic> region, we generated two congenic lines, 10.R and 10.2, by serial backcrossing normal hearing BLSW.CAST-<italic>+/ahl5</italic> progeny to BLSW mice. At generation N8 and higher, there was a significant correlation between segregation of <italic>ahl5</italic> alleles and auditory brain stem response (ABR) thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Recombination events delimited the <italic>ahl5</italic> interval to a 2.19 Mbp region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). We sequenced 735 of the 831 coding exons in BLSW genomic DNA and identified one nucleotide substitution, which was a guanine to adenine transition in exon 2 of the <italic>Gipc3</italic> gene (c.343G&gt;A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). The mutation was absent in 14 inbred and four heterogeneous mouse strains (NMRI, Swiss Webster, CF1 and ICR). However, the 343G/A alleles segregated in mice of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Swiss founder strain and showed significant correlation with hearing status. <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343A/A</italic></sup> homozygotes had impaired hearing (95Â±7 dBSPL at 16 kHz), whereas NIH Swiss mice homozygous at the wild-type allele (<italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343G/G</italic></sup>) exhibited normal hearing (16Â±5 dBSPL at 16 kHz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The missense mutation replaced a glycine with an arginine at position 115 (Gly115Arg) located within the PDZ domain (aa107â174). The Gly115 residue is highly conserved, showing 100% identity in all published GIPC protein sequences in animals and plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>

        <title>SNHL and audiogenic seizures in BLSW</title>
        <p>At 4 weeks of age, BLSW mice showed a moderate hearing impairment with mean thresholds significantly elevated for the click, 8, 16 and 32 kHz stimuli (68Â±7, 41Â±6, 41Â±5 and 85Â±5 dBSPL) compared with thresholds of 4-week-old normal hearing C3HeB/FeJ mice (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). At 52 weeks of age, BLSW mice exhibited a profound hearing loss that progressed from higher to lower test frequencies. The increase in hearing thresholds was most pronounced at 16 kHz with a shift of 48 dBSPL over the threshold of 4-week-old BLSW mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
        <p>The availability of the BLSW.CAST-<italic>+/ahl5</italic> congenic lines allowed us to evaluate the effect of <italic>ahl5</italic> on the progression of the hearing loss. BLSW.CAST-<italic>+/+</italic> mice showed normal hearing at 2 and 12 months of age with mean thresholds of 12Â±4 and 16Â±5 dBSPL for the 16 kHz stimulus, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). BLSW.CAST-+<italic>/ahl5</italic> heterozygotes had normal thresholds at 2 months of age (21Â±6 dBSPL), but exhibited significantly elevated thresholds at 12 months. This increase was more prominent in males (57Â±23 dBSPL) than in females (25Â±16 dBSPL; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, analysis of variance (ANOVA)). The threshold increase in 12-month-old female heterozygotes was modest with large standard deviations, but the difference compared with 2-month-old females was not significant. Last, the elevated thresholds of male heterozygotes were lower than the thresholds in 12-month-old BLSW mice (89Â±7 dBSPL). These results suggest that a genderâ<italic>ahl5</italic> interaction controls the progression of hearing loss in BLSW.CAST-<italic>+/ahl5</italic> heterozygotes.</p>
        <p>We next measured distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), which are an indicator of outer hair cell (OHC) function. At 4 weeks of age, DPOAEs were reduced at the 5â20 kHz f2 frequencies (L2=65 dBSPL) and were absent between 20 and 55 kHz compared with normal hearing C3HeB/FeJ mice at the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To test for a defect in the stria vascularis, we measured the endocochlear potential (EP). In 10-week-old BLSW mice, the EP was 104Â±8 mV, which was comparable with potentials obtained from C3HeB/FeJ mice (105Â±7 mV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Together, the data suggest that BLSW mice exhibit progressive SNHL.</p>
        <p>To test whether <italic>jams1</italic> localized to the <italic>ahl5</italic> critical region, we tested BLSW.CAST congenic mice for audiogenic seizure susceptibility. An acoustic stimulus of 90â100 dBSPL for the duration of 61Â±20 s readily induced a seizure response in 3-week-old BLSW mice. Age-matched C3HeB/FeJ mice showed no seizing activity after 180 s at 110 dBSPL (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Likewise, BLSW.CAST-<italic>ahl5/ahl5</italic> homozygotes were highly susceptible to white noise stimulation showing a rapid seizure response (27Â±31 s). In contrast, BLSW.CAST-<italic>+/+</italic> showed no signs of audiogenic seizures (180 s) exhibiting a response identical to that of C3HeB/FeJ mice (180 s, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In addition, although five BLSW.CAST-<italic>+/ahl5</italic> responded with convulsions at the highest 110 dBSPL stimulus (132Â±4 s), most of the BLSW.CAST-<italic>+/ahl5</italic> mice were resistant to seizure induction (180 s, <italic>n</italic>=18) and the mean response latency between BLSW.CAST-+/+ and BLSW.CAST-+/<italic>ahl5</italic> was not different. Together, these data indicate that the <italic>jams1</italic> locus resides within the <italic>ahl5</italic> critical interval.</p>

        <p>To further test that the 343G&gt;A mutation in <italic>Gipc3</italic> causes the <italic>ahl5</italic> and <italic>jams1</italic> phenotypes, we generated transgenic animals expressing <italic>Gipc3</italic>. Transgenic mice that were backcrossed to BLSW (N2âN3) were phenotyped using ABR at 6â8 weeks of age. In the control groups, <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343G/A</italic></sup> heterozygotes, irrespective of the presence or absence of the transgene (tg(+/â)G/A), expressed normal hearing thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343A/A</italic></sup> homozygotes without the transgene (tg-A/A) exhibited the hearing loss characteristic of the <italic>ahl5</italic> phenotype. Interestingly, <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343A/A</italic></sup> homozygotes with the transgene (tg+A/A) showed hearing thresholds to the click, 8 and 16 kHz stimulus that were significantly lower than those of the tg-A/A mice. Furthermore, those thresholds were in the normal range and did not differ from those of the tg(+/â)G/A heterozygotes (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). For the 32 kHz stimulus tg+A/A mice had thresholds that were elevated compared with tg(+/â)G/A heterozygotes (71Â±9 dBSPL; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), although these thresholds were still lower than those of tg-A/A (92Â±8 dBSPL). Next, transgenic and non-transgenic N2âN3 backcross mice were exposed to white noise at 3 weeks of age. <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343A/A</italic></sup> homozygotes without the transgene (tg-A/A) reacted instantly at the 90 dBSPL stimulus with severe convulsions with an average latency period of 24 s. In contrast, <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343A/A</italic></sup> homozygotes with the transgene (tg+A/A) showed a significant delay (108 s); none of the animals seized at the 90 dB stimulus and two animals showed a complete resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343G/A</italic></sup> heterozygotes (tg(+/â)G/A) did not show any signs of seizing activity after 180 s of stimulation.

        <title><italic>GIPC3</italic> and human recessive deafness</title>
        <p>To test whether mutations in <italic>GIPC3</italic> also underlie human SNHL, we screened panels of families of Dutch and Indian origin presenting with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment. In one Dutch family, W98-042, a homozygous region at 19p13.11-p13.3 encompassing <italic>GIPC3</italic> was shared by the two affected siblings (<italic>rs11880407</italic>â<italic>rs6512152</italic>; assigned locus symbol: DFNB95). <italic>GIPC3</italic> mutation analysis revealed a homozygous nucleotide substitution in exon 6, c.903G&gt;A that segregated with the disease in the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The c.903G&gt;A change is predicted to truncate the protein after residue 300 (p.Trp301X) causing the deletion of the C-terminal 12 amino acids of the protein. The mutation was not found in 156 (312 chromosomes) ethnically matched control individuals.</p>
        <p>The hearing loss in family W98-042 is bilateral and sensorineural with an early onset. Brainstem-evoked response audiometry for individual II.1 at 11 months of age revealed a threshold of â¼70 dB hearing levels (HL). For individual II.3 at the age of 3 months, brainstem-evoked response audiometry demonstrated a threshold of â¼80 dB HL. In individual II.1, the hearing loss progressed slowly to a loss of 110 dB at 12 years of age and individual II.3, who is now 14 years old, has a stable hearing loss of 90 dB HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
        <p>In an Indian family, segregating autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment previous linkage analyses detected a 32 cM region of homozygosity by descent at 19p13 (<italic>D19S209</italic>â<italic>D19S411;</italic> assigned locus symbol: DFNB15) that included the <italic>GIPC3</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.

Sequence alignments of GIPC proteins indicated that the Leu262 residue is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>).

        <title>Hair bundle defects and sensorineural degeneration in BLSW</title>
        <p>The high-to-low frequency progression of the hearing loss suggested a histopathology in the organ of Corti. By confocal and scanning electron microscopy we observed an irregular structure of the stereocilia bundle of OHC and inner hair cells (IHC). Starting from postnatal day 3 (P3) onwards, OHC bundles were slightly disoriented and smaller, with bent lateral edges and a rounded apical pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). The hair bundle of IHC appeared less rigid and sparse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>) and at P21 stereocilia were thinner and at times also shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Stereocilia bundles at the base and mid-apical region were present and were affected to a similar degree. Histological sections of 8-week-old BLSW ears revealed a normal morphology of the organ of Corti and the spiral ganglion. At 52 weeks of age, there was a significant degeneration of the organ of Corti starting at the base and progressing towards the apex. Concomitantly, the spiral ganglion exhibited a severe loss of neurons that was most obvious at the base and the mid-apical region of the cochlea. The organ of Corti and spiral ganglion at the apex were of normal appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Together, these data suggest that <italic>Gipc3</italic> is required for postnatal maturation of the hair bundle and long-term survival of hair cells and spiral ganglion.</p>

        <title>Reduced Gipc3 protein levels in the BLSW cochlea</title>
        <p>We reasoned that the Gly115Arg mutation might alter the expression or stability of Gipc3. To test this hypothesis, we probed western blots with polyclonal antisera raised against Gipc3-specific peptides. In protein extracts derived from HEK293T cells transiently expressing wild-type <italic>Gipc3</italic>, the Pb867, Pb869 and Pb877 antisera detected a single â¼40 kDa immunoreactive band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). When we probed western blots of cochlea and testis protein extracts from BLSW and C3HeB/FeJ we detected a reduction in intensity of the â¼40 kDa band in BLSW cochlea extracts by 82Â±7% (<italic>n</italic>=3) and in testis extracts by 42Â±9% (<italic>n</italic>=3) compared with wild-type C3HeB/FeJ extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). As an additional test of the expression level differences, we generated a mutant <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343A</italic></sup> cDNA construct for expression in HEK293T cells. Quantification, after normalizing against actin expression, revealed a reduction in expression levels by 69% of the mutant Gipc3(115Arg) protein compared with that for wild-type Gipc3(115Gly) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). TaqMan qPCR analyses revealed no significant differences in <italic>Gipc3</italic> mRNA expression in HEK293T cells transfected with wild-type (<italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343G</italic></sup>) or mutant (<italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343A</italic></sup>) construct (data not shown). In addition to the â¼40 kDa band, Pb867 recognizes a â¼37 kDa band in both cochlea and testis extracts. Both bands can be blocked by the Gipc3-specific peptide used for generating the Pb867 antibody and are also detected by the Pb869/Pb877 antiserum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). In addition, Pb867 is specific for Gipc3, showing strong reactivity with human GIPC3 and only faint cross reactivity with mouse Gipc1 and Gipc2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Thus, the â¼37 kDa band may represent either an alternate isoform or partially cleaved product of the â¼40 kDa protein. Together, these data indicate that the Gly115Arg substitution causes a reduction of the 40 kDa Gipc3 protein in BLSW cochleae.</p>

        <title>Gipc3 localization in hair cells and ganglion neurons</title>
        <p>Using the Pb867 antibody on cochlear sections, we detected Gipc3-specific immunoreactivity in IHCs and OHCs, as well as in cochlear spiral ganglion neurons in C3HeB/FeJ mice. Similar expression domains were observed in the BLSW cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e,f</xref>). Staining was also present in the cytoplasm of vestibular hair cells and vestibular ganglion neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). On whole-mount organ of Corti preparations, we noted abundant staining in the cytoplasm of IHCs and OHCs characterized by fine punctate staining apparent at the base, around the nucleus and throughout the apical part of the hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6gâi</xref>). There was no obvious staining at the stereocilia bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6j</xref>). Immunostaining with Pb877 revealed a similar expression and localization profile, showing staining of the cytoplasm of vestibular and cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Staining with antibodies against Vglut3 and Myosin VI showed localizations similar with Gipc3 in BLSW cochleae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6k,l</xref>).

        <title>Mechanotransduction and K<sup>+</sup> currents in BLSW</title>
        <p>The compromised structure of the stereocilia bundle suggested a defect in mechanotransduction. At P6, we found no difference in transduction currents recorded from OHCs and IHCs between BLSW and Swiss Webster control mice. The mean maximal amplitudes of the transduction currents operating range and adaptation time constants were not significantly different between BLSW and control hair cells. However, by P12 we observed a significant reduction in the maximal transduction current amplitude in both IHCs and OHCs. The mean maximal transduction currents recorded from IHCs and OHCs of P12-P14 BLSW mice were reduced by 57 and 71%, respectively, compared with control hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). This reduction likely accounts for the elevated hearing thresholds.</p>
        <p>To examine voltage-dependent channel activity, we delivered 50-msec voltage steps and measured families of potassium currents from IHCs. At P6, both control and BLSW IHCs had currents with similar amplitudes and kinetics. By P13, control cells had acquired a large rapidly activating potassium current (1726Â±323 pA at 0 mV) consistent with previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In contrast, potassium currents from IHC of BLSW mice at P12 had significantly smaller amplitudes (869Â±323 pA at 0 mV; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01; <italic>t</italic>-test) not unlike those at P6, albeit with faster activation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). To consider the functional impact of the attenuated current amplitudes in the BLSW IHCs, we switched to current-clamp mode and delivered current steps of â100, 100 and 250 pA. Control cells had small membrane potentials consistent with a previous report on wild-type responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, but in BLSW mice the responses were substantially larger, with depolarizations that reached well into the range of calcium channel activation (positive to â60 mV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>).</p>

        <title>ABR amplitudes and audiogenic seizure progression</title>
        <p>To investigate the cause of the audiogenic seizure susceptibility and resistance, we correlated various ABR output parameters with seizure progression. Acoustic stimulation showed that BLSW mice were most susceptible to seizures between 2 and 4 weeks of age with mean seizure latencies of 40Â±42 s (<italic>n</italic>=19) and 89Â±32 s (<italic>n</italic>=21), respectively. Thereafter, latencies increased until animals became completely resistant at 6 weeks of age (180 s, <italic>n</italic>=15). Increases in seizure latencies were significant between 3 and 5 weeks and between 4 and 6 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>).</p>
        <p>Amplitudes of the first (I) ABR wave (click at 100 dBSPL) were significantly higher in 2-week-old BLSW mice (6.8Â±2.6 Î¼V, <italic>n</italic>=24) compared with control C3HeB/FeJ mice (3.9Â±1.0 Î¼V, <italic>n</italic>=12). These high amplitudes declined rapidly to 0.55Â±0.25 Î¼V (<italic>n</italic>=10) at 7 weeks of age. In particular, decreases in wave I amplitudes were significant between 3 (3.5Â±1.5 Î¼V, <italic>n</italic>=18) and 5 (2.1Â±1.5 Î¼V, <italic>n</italic>=24) and between 4 (3.3Â±1.5 Î¼V, <italic>n</italic>=33) and 6 (1.2Â±0.9 Î¼V, <italic>n</italic>=32) weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). In contrast, the wave I amplitude in control mice remained constant over the 8-week test period, showing no difference between 2- and 10-week-old mice (2.9Â±0.8 Î¼V, <italic>n</italic>=10, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). Amplitudes of waves II through V were not significantly different between BLSW and controls at 2 weeks of age. At 6 weeks of age the amplitude of wave II was reduced in BLSW, but the amplitudes of waves III through V were not diffierent compared with C3HeB/FeJ control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c,d</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next analysed the latency of the ABR wave I. Latencies of 3- to 10-week-old BLSW mice were on average 0.14 ms higher than those in control mice (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), but did not change significantly over the test period (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). Specifically, no significant delays were observed between 3 (0.4Â±0.04 ms, <italic>n</italic>=10) and 5 (0.4Â±0.03, <italic>n</italic>=8) and between 4 (0.4Â±0.05 ms, <italic>n</italic>=9) and 6 (0.4Â±0.04, <italic>n</italic>=17) weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8e</xref>).</p>
        <p>Last, we correlated ABR thresholds at the click stimulus with seizure progression. ABR thresholds slightly increased in BLSW mice between 2 and 12 weeks of age. However, there were no significant increases in thresholds in mice between 3 (65Â±6 dBSPL, <italic>n</italic>=33) and 5 (67Â±6 dBSPL, <italic>n</italic>=27) and between 4 (69Â±8 dBSPL, <italic>n</italic>=32) and 6 weeks of age (71Â±7 dBSPL, <italic>n</italic>=24; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8f</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the elevated and subsequent decline of the wave I amplitude correlated with the susceptibility and resistance to audiogenic seizures, respectively.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Despite significant advances in the understanding of monogenic deafness, the molecular genetics of the more common and complex forms of hearing loss is poorly characterized. Nine QTLs controlling oligogenic hearing impairment in the mouse have been reported, but, thus far, only two loci have been molecularly characterized (<italic>Cdh23</italic><sup><italic>753A</italic></sup> and <italic>Fscn2</italic><sup><italic>326A</italic></sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Here, we identified the <italic>ahl5</italic>/<italic>jams1</italic> and <italic>DFNB15/DFNB95</italic> loci uncovering a function for Gipc3 in peripheral auditory signal transmission in mouse and human.</p>
      <p>Gipc3 distribution in hair cells is reminiscent of vesicular staining and shows a similar localization as Vglut3 and Myosin VI, proteins that regulate synaptic glutamate release and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis at the IHC ribbon synapse, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. GIPC1 was shown to associate with membranous and cytosolic fractions and also localizes to synaptic vesicles at presynaptic axon terminals of hippocampal neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Interestingly, glutamate release from presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus was shown to depend on GIPC1/Myo6 interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Given the hair bundle defect, reduced mechanotransduction and K<sup>+</sup> currents as well as abnormal ABR wave I amplitude in BLSW mice, we hypothesize that Gipc3 may be part of a protein complex involved in vesicle trafficking that transports factors critical for signal aquisition and propagation in cochlear hair cells.</p>
      <p>The Gly115Arg change occurring in the loop connecting the Î²B with the Î²C strand of the PDZ domain is positioned closely to the peptide recognition pocket<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Our western blot data indicate that the Gly115Arg substitution leads to a reduction in Gipc3 protein levels. It is possible that a conformational change or loss of stable interactions may target Gipc3(115Arg) for early degradation. The human Trp301X mutation truncates a peptide that shows 42% sequence identity with the GIPC1 C-terminus. It was recently shown that truncation of 29 residues of the C-terminus of GIPC1 abolishes interaction with Myosin VI suggesting that the full-length C-terminus is required to form stable interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In addition, both Leu262 and Trp301 residues are highly conserved among metazoan GIPC proteins. These data indicate that Trp301X and Leu262Arg are pathogenic mutations.</p>
      <p>It was recently suggested that the transient audiogenic seizures in BLSW mice occur independent of the hearing loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Indeed, our data do not support a correlation between hearing thresholds and audiogenic seizure progression. Furthermore, the reduced mechanosensitivity seems to be at odds with audiogenic seizure susceptibility. However, our results implicate the ABR wave I amplitude, which represents the summed activity of the cochlear nerve fibres projecting from IHCs to the cochlear nucleus, in seizure susceptibility and resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The high wave I amplitude at 2 weeks of age may result from the stunted developmental acquisition of IHC K<sup>+</sup> currents. Whereas the normal acquisition of potassium currents attenuates the IHC receptor potential, lack of those currents in BLSW allows greater depolarization, which may in turn enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmission, perhaps leading to synchronized cochlear nerve activity, enhanced ABR wave I amplitudes and seizure susceptibility. The subsequent decline in the ABR wave I amplitude and seizure resistance in BLSW mice may be indicative of a neuropathy at the IHC spiral ganglion neuron synapse. In the cochlea, glutamate receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission at the IHC afferent synapse and glutamate excitotoxicity is central to the neural damage during acoustic trauma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p>
      <p>Clinically, the audiogenic seizure pathology in BLSW mice is a form of reflex epilepsy, in which external sensory stimuli induce seizures. In humans, acoustic reflex epilepsies, although rare, include startle and musicogenic epilepsies and overt sensitivity to sound also underlies hyperacusis and hyperacute hearing in autism syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. The pathogeneses underlying these sensitivities are not understood or is it clear whether they originate in the central or peripheral auditory system. BLSW mice and perhaps other mutant alleles of <italic>Gipc3</italic> may prove critical to better understand the cause of acoustic hypersensitivity.</p>
      <p>Our analysis of the hearing loss in BLSW mice has interesting implications for the genetics of human progressive SNHL. <italic>GIPC3</italic> and its paralogs are excellent candidate genes for ARHI. It can be argued that <italic>ahl5</italic> is a monogenic trait not modelling the degree of genetic complexity presumed to underlie AHRI. Although this argument assumes the common variant-common disease hypothesis, it is also conceivable that rare alleles with strong effects in homozygous or heterozygous state may be strong contributors to ARHI. Furthermore, a mutation in the grainyhead like 2 gene (<italic>GRHL2</italic>) causes progressive hearing loss in humans and a candidate gene approach subsequently associated a <italic>GRHL2</italic> variant with ARHI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Susceptibility to metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7)-mediated excitotoxicity was suggested as risk factor for ARHI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Interestingly, mGluR7 and Gipc3 show identical localization domains in the mouse cochlea and also share functional similarities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Primary neuronal degeneration, which causes hearing impairment because of spiral ganglion degeneration in the absence of hair cell loss, was recently shown to underlie the long-term effect of noise exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Likewise, hearing loss in BLSW mice at 8 weeks of age occurs without a noticeable hair cell loss. Together, these observations suggest a prominent role for variations in genes affecting spiral ganglion function in sensorineural progressive hearing loss.</p>

        <title>Auditory tests in mice</title>
        <p>For ABR, acoustic stimuli were generated from a high frequency transducer and presented at varying intensity at a rate of 19.1 times per s for a total of 350 presentations. Neuronal responses were captured through subdermal needle electrodes inserted at the vertex, filtered, amplified and displayed. Thresholds, latencies and amplitudes were determined using IHS software.</p>
        <p>DPOAEs were measured using National Instruments (NI) LabView 8.6 software, operating an NI PCI-4461 Dynamic Signal Analyzer sound card (National Instruments), to generate two pure tones, f1 and f2, at the fixed f2/f1 ratio of 1.25, which were emitted separately by two Clarion SRU310H high frequency dome tweeters (Clarion) placed in the outer ear canal at the presentation level of f2=f1. Emissions were measured using an EtymÃµtic-ER-10B+ microphone. The amplitude of the 2f1-f2 distortion product was plotted in dBSPL against the f2 frequency where the distortion product is generated.</p>
        <p>To measure the EP, a silver/chloride electrode bathed in 0.1 M KCl was inserted through the round window into the endolymph using a remote controlled motorized Micromanipulator (Piezo World Precision Instrument). The electrode was connected to a Warner Dual Channel Differential Electrometer (HiZ-223; Warner Instruments), which amplified and routed the voltage difference (subdermal 1 M KCl reference electrode) to the data acquisition system (Digidata 1440A, Axon Instruments) using AxoScope software (Axon) at a sampling rate of 10 kHz for 60 s.</p>
        <p>To induce audiogenic seizures, mice were exposed to white noise of 90, 100 and 110 dBSPL consecutively for 60 s each stimulus. Acoustic stimuli were generated by a Bose loudspeaker (Bose) operated by ToneGen software. Speaker levels were calibrated with SoundProDL (Clarke Analytical Instruments). The mouse was placed in a clear polypropylene box container with a lid with the loud speaker mounted into the side. Each stimulus was maintained for 60 s or until a seizure occurred as evidenced by wild running, flexing and tonic-clonic convulsions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Seizure latency (sec) was defined as the time of the first stimulus onset to the time of seizure onset. Animals resistant to the three consecutive sound stimuli were scored as having a latency of 180 s.</p>
        <p>To measure mechanotransduction, the hair bundles were stimulated with a fire polished glass probe that fit the shape of the bundles. The stimulator was cemented to a PICMA ultra fast piezo actuator (Physik Instrumente), driven by a ENV-400 amplifier (Piezosystem Jena). Transduction currents were recorded using the whole-cell, tight-seal technique. Recording pipettes were filled with intracellular solution. Membrane potential was clamped to â64 mV and controlled using an Axopatch Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices). pClamp 8.2 (Molecular Device) and Origin 7.5 (OriginLab) were used to record and analyse the currents.</p>

Informed consent was obtained from the participating subject or, in the case of children, from their parents. For the DFNB95 family, members were examined by otoscopy and pure-tone audiometry in a sound-treated room in accordance with current clinical standards. Individual II.1 received a cochlear implant after the audiogram taken at 11.5 years of age. High-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and mutation analysis was performed as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Briefly, genome-wide linkage scans were performed using the Affymetrix mapping 250K SNP array (Affymetrix). Genotypes and regions of homozygosity were defined using the Genotyping Console software (Affymetrix). Primers for amplification of exons and exonâintron boundaries of GIPC3 were designed with ExonPrimer according to the reference sequences NM_133261.2 and NT_011255.14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). To determine the segregation of the c.903G&gt;A variant in the family and the presence in normal controls, exon 6 was amplified and the PCR product was digested with <italic>Sau96I</italic> (New England Biolabs).</p>

Note the compromised hair bundle structure of OHC (white arrow) and collapsed bundle of IHC (arrowhead) in BLSW mice. Scale bar, 5 Î¼m. (<bold>b</bold>) Shown are scanning electron microscopy images of OHC (arrow) and IHC (arrowhead) stereocilia bundles at P14. Compare the inward-bended stereocilia on BLSW OHCs to the organized and upright standing bundles in C3HeB/FeJ. Compare the sparse IHC stereocilia in BLSW with the dense bundle in C3HeB/FeJ. Scale bar, 2 Î¼m. (<bold>c</bold>) Shown are confocal images of IHC stereocilia bundles at P21. Note the thinner (arrow) and shorter (star) stereocilia in BLSW. Scale bar, 5 Î¼m. (<bold>d</bold>) Images of tolouidine-stained cross-sections of the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion are shown. Age and region of the cochlea is indicated. Note the normal appearance of organ of Corti (arrows point to OHC and arrowhead to IHC) and spiral ganglion neurons (arrow) in 8-week-old BLSW mice, but base to midâapex degeneration (red star) in 52-week-old BLSW cochleae. Scale bar, 20 Î¼m (top panel) and 50 Î¼m (bottom panel).</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Western blot analysis of <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343G</italic></sup> transfected (+) and untransfected (â) HEK293T cell lysates using Gipc3-specific polyclonal antiserum Pb867 detecting a single â¼40 kDa band (black arrow). (<bold>b</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of protein extracts from cochlea and testis from BLSW and C3HeB/FeJ (C3 H) mice with anti-Gipc3 antiserum Pb867. Lysates from HeLa cells transfected with the wild-type <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343G</italic></sup> construct were included as control. The â¼40 kDa band (black arrow) was detected in both tissues from C3HeB/FeJ wild-type mice. The similar â¼40 kDa band was detected with reduced intensity in mutant BLSW cochlea and testis. The â¼37 kDa band (arrow head) and â¼29 kDa band (dot, presumably nonspecific) are indicated. (<bold>c</bold>) Quantitative analysis of wild-type Gipc3(115Gly) and mutant Gipc3(115Arg) expression in lysates from transiently transfected HEK293T cells with varying amounts of protein loaded (10 and 30 Î¼g) for wild-type <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343G</italic></sup> and mutant <italic>Gipc3</italic><sup><italic>343A</italic></sup>. Protein blots were probed with the anti-Gipc3 antiserum Pb867and anti-Î±-actin antibody. (<bold>d</bold>) Densitometric analysis of Gipc3 expression from wild-type Gipc3(115Gly) and mutant Gipc3(115Arg)-transfected HEK293T cells. The data are represented as meanÂ±s.e.m., **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 (<italic>n</italic>=6, <italic>t</italic>-test). Confocal images of cryosections of organ of Corti (<bold>e</bold>) and spiral ganglion (<bold>f</bold>) stained with Pb867 antibody (red) demonstrating Gipc3 localization in IHCs (arrow head) and OHCs (arrow) and spiral ganglion (arrow). Confocal images of organ of Corti of C3HeB/FeJ (<bold>g</bold>, <bold>h</bold>, <bold>j</bold>) and BLSW (<bold>i</bold>, <bold>k</bold>, <bold>l</bold>) demonstrating Gipc3 (<bold>gâi</bold>) and Vglut3 (<bold>k</bold>) and myosin VI (<bold>l</bold>) localization; (<bold>i</bold>â<bold>l</bold>) counterstained with phalloidin (green); arrows point to positive staining.
