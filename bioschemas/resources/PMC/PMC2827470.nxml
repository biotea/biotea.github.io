          <title>Background</title>
          <p>TFIID is a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription owing to its core promoter recognition and co-activator functions. TAF6 is a core TFIID subunit whose splice variants include the major TAF6Î± isoform that is ubiquitously expressed, and the inducible TAF6Î´. In contrast to TAF6Î±, TAF6Î´ is a pro-apoptotic isoform with a 10 amino acid deletion in its histone fold domain that abolishes its interaction with TAF9. TAF6Î´ expression can dictate life versus death decisions of human cells.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Here we define the impact of endogenous TAF6Î´ expression on the global transcriptome landscape. TAF6Î´ was found to orchestrate a transcription profile that included statistically significant enrichment of genes of apoptotic function. Interestingly, gene expression patterns controlled by TAF6Î´ share similarities with, but are not equivalent to, those reported to change following TAF9 and/or TAF9b depletion. Finally, because TAF6Î´ regulates certain p53 target genes, we tested and demonstrated a physical and functional interaction between TAF6Î´ and p53.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Apoptosis is an active program of cell death that is required for normal development and tissue homeostasis in metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The deregulation of apoptotic pathways underlies many human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Consequently, apoptotic pathways represent potential targets for therapeutic control of cell death for diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune diseases and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Our previous studies have uncovered the existence of an apoptotic pathway termed the TAF6Î´ pathway that controls cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>TAF6Î´ is an inducible splice variant of the TFIID subunit TAF6 (previously termed hTAF<sub>II</sub>70 or hTAF<sub>II</sub>80). TFIID is a multiprotein complex containing the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and up to 14 evolutionarily conserved TBP-associated factors (TAFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. TFIID is the primary core promoter recognition complex for RNA polymerase II (pol II) and thus plays a key role in the regulation of transcription of protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The major TAF6Î± isoform is ubiquitously expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] whereas strong expression of the TAF6Î´ isoform has only been detected in apoptotic conditions (e.g. HL-60 cells undergoing retinoic acid dependent death) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The use of modified antisense RNA oligonucleotides, also termed splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSO), to experimentally direct the expression of endogenous TAF6Î´ in living cells has recently demonstrated the pro-apoptotic activity of TAF6Î´ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>The major TAF6Î± isoform contributes to the stability of core TFIID complexes in part by dimerizing with TAF9 via its histone fold domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Structurally, TAF6Î´ differs from TAF6Î± only in that it lacks 10 amino acids within its histone fold domain. These amino acids, however, are critical for the interaction of TAF6Î± with TAF9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and as a consequence, TAF6Î´ cannot interact with TAF9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As is the case for TAF9, the highly homologous protein TAF9b cannot interact with the pro-apoptotic TAF6Î´ isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. TAF6Î´ does retain the capacity to interact directly with other TFIID subunits including TAF1, TAF5, TBP and TAF12. Consequently, within cells TAF6Î´ is incorporated into a TFIID-like complex that lacks TAF9 and TAF9b, termed TFIIDÏ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Depletion of TAF9 or the highly homologous protein TAF9b in HeLa cells has been shown to alter global gene expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Presently it is not known whether the transcriptional effects of TAF6Î´ are related to those resulting from the depletion of TAF9 and/or TAF9b. Our previous work revealed that TAF6Î´ can alter gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but a physiologically informative definition of the transcriptome impact of TAF6Î´ is currently lacking.</p>
      <p>Data documenting a direct interaction between the major TAF6Î± isoform with p53 has been shown <italic>in vitro </italic>using recombinant proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], <italic>in vitro </italic>using endogenous human TFIID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and in cultured cells using reporter assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the interaction of TAF6Î± with p53 has been shown to be essential for the activation of transcription by p53 <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] as well as <italic>in vivo </italic>in mice bearing point mutations within p53 that block its interaction with TAF6Î± [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Currently it is not known whether the inducible pro-apoptotic TAF6Î´ isoform can interact with p53. Importantly, TAF6Î´ induces apoptosis in cell lines that lack p53 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, the induction of TAF6Î´ produced similar levels of apoptosis in the HCT-116 p53 -/- colon carcinoma cell line as in its p53 positive counterpart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, TAF6Î´ can induce programmed cell death independently of p53, however the functional relationship between the TAF6Î´ and p53 pathways requires further clarification.</p>
      <p>The TAF6Î´ pathway represents a tractable experimental paradigm to elucidate the mechanisms by which human cells respond to their environment through subunit changes in the general transcription machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that the TAF6Î´ pathway may be altered in certain cancers. Aberrant TAF6 expression has been documented in human cancers including lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The molecular basis for the induction of apoptosis by TAF6Î´ is currently unknown. In order to shed further light on the impact of TAF6Î´ on the human transcriptome, here we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of the impact of endogenous TAF6Î´ expression in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. Our data provide the first physiologically coherent transcriptome signature for TAF6Î´, establish the relationship of the TAF6Î´ signature with those of TAF9/TAF9b, and identify a functional and physical interaction of TAF6Î´ with p53.</p>

        <title>The TAF6Î´ orchestrates a pro-apoptotic gene expression program</title>
        <p>To establish the impact of TAF6Î´ on global gene expression patterns, the expression of the endogenous TAF6Î´ splice variant was experimentally induced using splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSO) as previously documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The HeLa cell line was chosen as a model system for transcriptome studies for three principle reasons. Firstly, these cells are readily transfectable and produce a robust apoptotic response to TAF6Î´-inducing SSO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Secondly, the TAF6Î´ cDNA was cloned from a HeLa cell library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and therefore these cells provide a natural cellular context. Thirdly, HeLa cells express no detectable TAF6Î´ protein under standard culture conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], thus these cells provide a stringently inducible model for SSO studies. To define the impact of TAF6Î´ expression on transcriptome dynamics we took advantage of an experimental approach that combines SSO treatment with high sensitivity microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We note that to achieve the statistically significant overrepresentation of gene ontology pathways reported here it was necessary to employ optimized SSO sequences designed to more efficiently induce TAF6Î´ expression than those employed in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The improved SSO were transfected into HeLa cells and the induction of endogenous TAF6Î´ mRNA and protein was confirmed, as shown in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. Total RNA was isolated 18 hours post-transfection and subjected to microarray analysis as previously detailed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Biological triplicates were performed with SSO T6-1 and, as a control to normalize for any non-specific SSO effects, a scrambled oligonucleotide (SSO ctrol). The statistical analysis and filtering of the raw microarray data was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] to identify significantly (P &lt; 0.05) regulated mRNAs.</p>
        <p>The induction of endogenous TAF6Î´ resulted in significant changes in the levels of 961 probes corresponding to 955 independent genes of 27,868 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Remarkably, 90.5% of the mRNAs significantly changed by TAF6Î´ are upregulated and only 9.5% are downregulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). These data are consistent with previous results obtained with a less efficient SSO in the HCT-116 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and further demonstrate that TAF6Î´ acts primarily as a positive regulator of gene expression. The data also rule out the possibility that TAF6Î´-induced cell death is a result of a global reduction in mRNA transcription. To validate the TAF6Î´ transcriptome signature we selected 14 genes (and the internal control beta-2-microglobulin gene) for quantitative RT-PCR confirmation. Gene expression changes measured by real-time RT-PCR for the 14 genes showed a strong correlation with changes measured by microarray analysis (Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.769, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> &amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). To further confirm the specificity of the TAF6Î´ transcriptome signature we employed a distinct TAF6 targeting antisense oligonucleotide (SSO T6-3), whose binding to the TAF6 pre-mRNA is shifted five nucleotides downstream with respect to SSO T6-1. SSO T6-3 is slightly more efficient in inducing endogenous TAF6Î´ than SSO T6-1 (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Real-time RT-PCR shows that like SSO T6-1, SSO T6-3 also altered the expression of the same 14 TAF6Î´ target genes (Pearson correlation coefficient with microarray measurements <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.836, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> &amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The above data confirm that the microarray results provide an accurate and reproducible measure of the TAF6Î´-controlled transcriptome landscape.</p>

        <p>To examine the specificity of the TAF6Î´-induced transcriptome signature, we compared the microarray data with those obtained when the pro-apoptotic isoform of a distinct gene, Bcl-x, was induced by SSO under identical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As shown in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, the transcriptome signatures resulting from the induction of TAF6Î´ and Bcl-xS are highly distinct. The vast majority of TAF6Î´-regulated transcripts (90.5%) were induced while Bcl-xS expression results in a majority of transcripts being repressed (58%). Only a minor fraction (3.4%) of the 870 genes upregulated by TAF6Î´ was also upregulated by Bcl-xS. Of the small number of transcripts repressed (46) by TAF6Î´, 45 are also repressed by Bcl-xS, possibly reflecting a minor subset of genes that are repressed by both of these pro-apoptotic pathways. The portion of Bcl-xS repressed genes also repressed by TAF6Î´ was minor (15.8%). The fact that genes induced by TAF6Î´ share little overlap with those induced by Bcl-xS underscores the highly specific impact of the TAF6Î´-inducing SSO on the transcriptome.</p>
        <p>To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic capacity of TAF6Î´, we performed gene ontology analysis to identify pathways that are statistically overrepresented within the microarray data (see details in Materials and Methods). Of 131 cellular pathways surveyed, those that are statistically (P &lt; 0.05) overrepresented in the TAF6Î´ data set are the Notch, oxidative stress response, integrin, p53, apoptosis and p53 pathway feedback loops 2 pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Genes in the angiogenesis pathway were also overrepresented (P = 0.0535, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) in the TAF6Î´-induced gene pool. The TAF6Î´-regulated genes found in the overrepresented pathways are shown in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>. We next postulated that if the pathways activated by TAF6Î´ represent a physiologically coherent response, then the functional connections between these pathways would not be random. We therefore performed a statistical analysis to identify pathways that share two or more genes activated by TAF6Î´ at frequencies higher than those expected in a random sample. Statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) overrepresentation of shared genes between the integrin and angiogenesis pathways, as well as between the p53 and integrin pathways was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To provide a visual framework that depicts the interconnections between the overrepresented pathways they were mapped onto cellular signaling networks using the Pajek algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This global view reveals that the activated pathways are not randomly distributed and moreover that there is a network of interconnections between TAF6Î´-regulated pathways, as seen by black points at which distinct colored lines intersect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Taken together, the results above define a specific TAF6Î´-driven transcriptome landscape that includes the induction of genes in the Notch, oxidative stress response, integrin, p53, apoptosis, p53 pathway feedback loops 2 and angiogenesis pathways.</p>

        <p>To determine whether or not the changes in mRNA expression in response to TAF6Î´ expression result also in changes in protein levels we selected representative proteins from the TAF6Î´ transcriptome signature for verification by immunoblotting experiments. The microarray data showed expression of ARNT mRNA was repressed by TAF6Î´, and immunoblotting showed the corresponding ARNT protein levels also decreased in response to TAF6Î´-inducing SSO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The levels of the transcription factor TBP were tested as a control for specificity and remained relatively constant in response to TAF6Î´ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The levels of FOS, JUN, HES1, CDKN2B (p15INK4B), and PMAIP1 (NOXA) were assayed and TAF6Î´ expression resulted in increased protein levels that paralleled increased mRNA levels detected in the microarray experiments in each case (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Importantly, Bcl-x SSO treatment did not result in comparable changes of protein levels, showing the specificity of their response to TAF6Î´ expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These data demonstrate that for the proteins tested the impact of TAF6Î´ on gene expression programs occurs at both the mRNA and protein levels, including the induction of the known pro-apoptotic protein PMAIP1 (NOXA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p>

        <p>Changes in mRNA levels detected by microarray analysis can in principle result from a number of effects including alterations in mRNA stability. To obtain evidence that TAF6Î´ can regulate gene expression in a promoter-dependent and promoter-specific fashion, we tested the ability of endogenous TAF6Î´ to increase target gene expression in luciferase reporter gene assays. We selected four promoters for analysis. The HES1, DUSP1 and ADM promoters were selected since the endogenous <italic>HES1</italic>, <italic>DUSP1 </italic>and <italic>ADM </italic>mRNA levels are induced in response to TAF6Î´ expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> &amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In the case of HES1, the levels of endogenous HES1 protein were also shown to be induced in response to TAF6Î´ expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The 3 selected genes act in several of the pathways activated by TAF6Î´ including the Notch (HES1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], angiogenesis (ADM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], oxidative stress and p53 pathways (DUSP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The Bax promoter was also included because it is a p53-responsive and pro-apoptotic gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], yet is not induced by TAF6Î´. The induction of TAF6Î´ in HeLa cells resulted in increased HES1, DUSP1, and ADM promoter-driven gene expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In contrast, the Bax promoter was not induced and even measurably repressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These results demonstrate that endogenous TAF6Î´ can act directly or indirectly to stimulate transcription in a promoter-dependent manner.</p>

        <title>The TAF6Î´ transcriptome signature is not equivalent to those resulting from depletion of TAF9 and/or TAF9b</title>
        <p>The only currently known functional distinction between pro-apoptotic TAF6Î´ and TAF6Î± is that TAF6Î´ cannot interact with TAF9 or TAF9b. We therefore analyzed the extent to which the transcription footprints resulting from TAF6Î´ induction resembles those reported following the depletion of TAF9 and/or TAF9b by treatment with siRNAs in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. After mapping of the previous microarray data to enable comparison with our current microarray platform (see Materials and Methods), the datasets were co-filtered to compare transcriptome changes. Of the 961 TAF6Î´-dependent mRNAs selected for comparative analysis, 803 mRNAs could be mapped between the datasets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). A global view of the magnitude of the changes for these 803 genes showed that changes in response to TAF6Î´ induction were more pronounced than those resulting from TAF9/TAF9b depletion as depicted by heat maps (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). 204 mRNAs that are statistically significantly regulated by TAF9 and/or TAF9b were found within the TAF6Î´-regulated transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Of the 204 genes, 50 showed regulation by both TAF9 and TAF9b. 90 showed regulation by TAF9 alone and 64 showed regulation by TAF9b alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). To probe for communalities between TAF6Î´, TAF9 and TAF9b-controlled transcriptomes, pathway analysis was performed on the genes regulated by TAF6Î´ and TAF9 as well as genes regulated by TAF6Î´, TAF9, and TAF9b. The only pathway that was statistically significantly overrepresented in these subsets was the "p53 feedback loop 2" ontology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Pathway analysis was also performed on the TAF9b-dependent gene set alone. Interestingly, the only pathway that was overrepresented was angiogenesis, a pathway also overrepresented in the TAF6Î´ transcriptome signature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Finally, we compared the effects of TAF6Î´, TAF9, and TAF9b on single genes from the subset of 50 genes that respond to changes in the expression all of TAF6Î´, TAF9, and TAF9b. A majority of genes (~80%) had comparable changes in response to TAF6Î´ induction and TAF9 or TAF9b depletion of which 10 examples are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>. In contrast, approximately 20% of the TAF6Î´- TAF9- and TAF9b-dependent genes were positively regulated by TAF6Î´ induction whereas TAF9 or TAF9b depletion resulted in their suppression (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Taken together the analysis shows that TAF6Î´ induction has both overlapping and unique impacts on the transcriptome, when compared to TAF9 and/or TAF9b depletion.</p>

        <title>TAF6Î´ interacts physically and functionally with p53</title>
        <p>TAF6Î± is known to interact with the p53 tumor suppressor protein (see Introduction), but whether the pro-apoptotic TAF6Î´ isoform could retain the capacity to interact with p53 is unknown. Our previous work demonstrated that TAF6Î´ induces apoptosis independently of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Interestingly, the current transcriptome data show that TAF6Î´ induces the expression of several p53 target genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). We therefore investigated the capacity of TAF6Î´ to interact with p53. Recombinant Histidine tagged TAF6Î´ was produced in bacteria and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. GST tagged p53 was produced and immobilized on glutathione-sepharose beads. Purified recombinant TAF6Î´ and TAF6Î± were assayed for their capacities to interact with immobilized GST-p53. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], TAF6Î± bound efficiently to GST-p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 3, upper row). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) served as a control for specificity and did not bind to GST-p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 3, lower row). Purified His-TAF6Î´ was efficiently retained by GST-p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 3, middle row), but not by GST alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 2). Resistance to high ionic strength buffers can provide a measure of the strength of protein-protein interactions. We therefore challenged the p53-TAF6 interactions with 600 mM KCl washes and found that the interactions were stable in high salt conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These data show a direct and selective interaction between TAF6Î´ and p53 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

        <p>To determine whether the TAF6Î´-p53 interaction can occur in living cells we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. As endogenous TAF6Î´ is highly labile and expressed at very low levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], TAF6Î´ was expressed by transfection of an expression vector into HCT-116 p53 -/- cells. Exogenous p53 was provided by co-transfection of an expression vector. Immunoprecipitation of TAF6Î´ resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, lane 3), in contrast to the negative control immunoprecipitation of tubulin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, lane 2). In addition, the reciprocal experiment, immunoprecipitation of p53 resulted in recovery of TAF6Î´ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, lane 4). Together, these data show that the interaction between TAF6Î´ and p53 can occur in the cellular context.</p>
        <p>We next sought to determine whether the interaction between TAF6Î´ and p53 has functional consequences. We took advantage of the fact that the DUSP1 promoter is activated by TAF6Î´ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and is also activated by p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A reporter construct expressing firefly luciferase under the control of the DUSP1 promoter was co-transfected with p53 expression vectors, as well as vectors expressing TAF6 variants. TAF6Î´ transfection resulted in enhanced DUSP1 expression when co-transfected with p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). A truncated version of TAF6 that lacks pro-apoptotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] failed to show significant co-activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). The protein levels resulting from transfected plasmids were determined by immunoblotting experiments and are shown in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>. The data exclude the possibility that higher levels of TAF6Î´ protein (compared to the truncated negative control TAF6) contribute to the activation levels observed. These data show for the first time that TAF6Î´ can interact functionally with p53 to co-activate DUSP1 gene transcription.</p>
        <p>Having established that TAF6Î´ can interact functionally with p53, we next sought to define the role of this interaction with endogenous TAF6Î´ and p53. Moreover we sought to define the potential crosstalk of TAF6Î´ with p53 upon endogenous genes and at the transcriptome-wide level. We therefore revisited microarray data derived from either wild-type HCT-116 or their p53 negative counterpart HCT-116 p53 -/- in which endogenous TAF6Î´ expression was induced by SSO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link> under accession number GSE10795) to test for transcriptional crosstalk between TAF6Î´ and p53. We re-filtered the data specifically to determine the influence of TAF6Î´ versus TAF6Î± on p53-dependent genes. The effects of TAF6 isoforms are illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, and reveal three classes of genes. Importantly, 20% of p53-regulated genes (e.g. CAMK2B &amp; THEDC1) change only in the presence of TAF6Î´ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). 53% of the p53-regulated genes change specifically in the presence of TAF6Î±, for example TNFRSF10C and CHIA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). 25% of p53-regulated genes, such as FAS and ANGPT2, change expression in the presence of both TAF6Î´ and TAF6Î± (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). The data show that the expression of TAF6Î´ versus TAF6Î± can dictate the outcome of p53-mediated transcriptional signals.</p>

        <p>We also filtered the data to determine the reciprocal influence of p53 status upon previously identified TAF6Î´-dependent mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. 51% of the TAF6Î´-regulated mRNAs changed significantly only in the absence of p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>), for example TNFRSF6B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). 9% of the TAF6Î´-regulated mRNAs changed independently of p53 status, including ACRC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). 40% of TAF6Î´-regulated mRNAs changed significantly only in cells expressing p53, such as TP53I3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). In general the influence of p53 on TAF6Î´-dependent transcription was relatively subtle in magnitude, with at least one exception where the gene LOC342293 displayed opposing regulation in presence or absence of p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The TAF6Î´ pathway has emerged as an apoptotic signaling hub [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], yet the mechanisms by which TAF6Î´ promotes apoptosis have remained unknown. Here we provide a transcriptome-wide microarray analysis that defines the impact of endogenous TAF6Î´ induction on gene expression patterns. The TAF6Î´ transcriptome footprint showed a predominant role for TAF6Î´ in the activation of gene expression, with approximately 90% of TAF6Î´-regulated mRNAs being induced. Genes annotated as belonging to apoptotic pathways were found to be statistically overrepresented in the TAF6Î´-induced genes. The data therefore provide experimental support for a model wherein TAF6Î´ initiates the apoptotic cascade by inducing pro-apoptotic gene expression. Examples of apoptotic TAF6Î´-induced genes identified include NOXA and FDXR (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) that both code for proteins that each alone possess pro-apoptotic activity, are p53 target genes, and localize to the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. As TAF6Î´ induces the expression of hundreds of genes, including established pro-apoptotic genes, we propose a model whereby TAF6Î´ represents a signaling hub that transduces apoptotic stimuli to redirect the transcriptional machinery to tip the balance from an anti- to a pro-apoptotic program (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p>

      <p>In addition to apoptotic genes the unbiased statistical analysis of our microarray data revealed overrepresentation of genes in the Notch, oxidative stress response, integrin, p53, p53 pathway feedback loops 2, and angiogenesis pathways. The TAF6Î´ pathway is an orphan pathway whose molecular trigger remains unknown. The novel links between these pathways and TAF6Î´ expression provide testable hypotheses for the potential physiological triggers and functions of TAF6Î´. For example, the identification of p53 target genes prompted us to test and demonstrate a physical interaction between TAF6Î´ and p53 (see below). Within the TAF6Î´-activated transcriptome signature, unbiased statistical approach showed significant overrepresented interconnections between these individual signaling pathways (e.g. integrin and angiogenesis). Additional support for functional interconnections amongst TAF6Î´-associated pathways comes from interactions documented in the literature. For example, the Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] pathways both play important roles in angiogenesis. The fact that several of the TAF6Î´-induced pathways converge upon the process of angiogenesis implies a physiological coherent impact of TAF6Î´ on gene expression programs. Interestingly, many of the pathways associated with TAF6Î´ expression play roles in the tumor progression. For example, angiogenesis is both a key event in tumor progression and a target for anti-cancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our study therefore provides the rationale to initiate studies to test the impact of TAF6Î´ on the process of angiogenesis <italic>in vivo </italic>in the future.</p>
      <p>The incorporation of TAF6Î´ into TAF-containing complexes results in the formation of TFIIDÏ that lacks TAF9 (see Introduction). The currently available evidence is consistent with the lack of TAF9 being the only difference between canonical TFIID complexes and TFIIDÏ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], however it is conceivable that the inclusion of TAF6Î´ could cause as yet unknown changes in TFIIDÏ subunit composition. TAF6 interacts with TAF9 and the resulting dimeric complex can bind to downstream promoter elements (DPEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. To date our analysis of TAF6Î´-responsive promoters has revealed no statistically significant enrichment of DPEs or any of the known core promoter element within the promoter regions of genes induced by TAF6Î´ (unpublished data). One mechanistic explanation for the transcriptome impact of TAF6Î´ could be that the loss of TAF9 or TAF9b from TFIID alone drives transcriptional changes. A prediction of this model is that the transcriptome signatures resulting from depletion of TAF9 and/or TAF9b by small interfering RNAs would be highly similar to that resulting from induction of TAF6Î´. The comparative transcriptomic analysis we provide shows both overlapping and unique features of the TAF6Î´ versus TAF9/TAF9b-dependent transcriptomes. Interestingly, TAF9b-depletion, like TAF6Î´ induction resulted in transcriptome profile with overrepresentation of genes functioning in angiogenesis pathways. Gene ontology analysis of the genes regulated by all of TAF6Î´, TAF9 and TAF9b showed an overrepresentation of a single ontology termed the p53 feedback loops 2 pathway, suggesting overlap in the gene expression programs controlled by these TAFs. A limitation of the current study is that the distinct approaches (siRNA versus SSO RNA) and microarray platforms employed results in the loss of information. Nevertheless, clear differences were observed between the transcriptome profiles of TAF6Î´ versus TAF9 and TAF9b (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). We conclude that exclusion of TAF9 and/or TAF9b from TFIID results in transcriptome changes that share certain targets with, but that do not fully recapitulate the TAF6Î´ transcriptome signature.</p>
      <p>The current transcriptome analysis showed that TAF6Î´ induces genes in the p53 pathway, a result not revealed by previous transcriptome analysis of TAF6Î´ in HCT-116 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Based on the finding that TAF6Î´ and p53 can share target genes, we tested and confirmed the direct physical and functional interaction of TAF6Î´ with p53. The impact of endogenous TAF6Î´ on p53-dependent gene expression was further demonstrated at the transcriptome-wide level. The reciprocal capacity of endogenous p53 to influence TAF6Î´-mediated transcription was also detected, although the magnitude of these effects was globally more modest. Taken together, the data show that there is reciprocal crosstalk between the TAF6Î´ and p53 pathways. The microarray experiments measure changes in expression resulting from both direct and indirect effects of TAF6Î´ and p53. Therefore, the crosstalk we have documented includes that resulting from the direct TAF6Î´- p53 but also that resulting from indirect transcriptional changes. Given the previous demonstration that TAF6Î´ can induce apoptosis independent of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], we conclude that TAF6Î´ possesses both p53 independent and p53 dependent activities.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In summary, we report here that the transcriptome landscape orchestrated by TAF6Î´ includes the induction of apoptotic gene expression. The transcriptome data further uncovered novel links between TAF6Î´ expression and the Notch, oxidative stress response, integrin, p53, p53 feedback loop 2, and angiogenesis pathways. The TAF6Î´-controlled transcriptome landscape was shown not to be equivalent to those resulting from depletion of TAF9 and/or TAF9b. Finally, the data establish a physical and functional interaction between TAF6Î´ and the p53 tumor suppressor protein.</p>

        <title>Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression</title>
        <p>Transcriptome analysis was performed as we previously detailed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], using the NeONORM normalization method with k = 0.20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The published microarray data for TAF9 and TAF9b depletion by siRNA were generated on the GÃ©nopole Genomics Platform Strasbourg using custom technology. In order to be able to compare those data directly to data generated from commercial platforms, the unique probe-set identifiers were mapped to non-redundant NCBI and Ensemble gene IDs. Similarly, the AB1700 data generated for this study or from previous studies on an Applied Biosystems Microarray platform were mapped according to the published procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] to the same set of gene IDs. After these mapping procedures &gt;87.9% of unique probe-set or probe IDs could be directly compared which corresponds to &gt; 93.2% comparable genes. For comparative pathway inference analyses the TAF9 and TAF9b data were mapped to, and treated as if AB1700 data to avoid any potential bias stemming from the use of different ontology annotation databases.</p>
        <p>Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG annotations were analyzed using the Panther Protein Classification System <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org">http://www.pantherdb.org</ext-link> to identify functional annotations that were significantly enriched in the different gene sets when compared to the whole set of genes present on the ABI microarray. Note that a given gene can be assigned to different pathways; in order to reduce multiple probing biases a gene is weighted by the inverse of the number of pathways it can be assigned to, leading to non-natural numbers for the gene counts. P-values are determined using a binominal distribution and a null hypothesis of a random set of genes with identical size. Pathway interconnectivity analysis was performed for the significantly overrepresented pathways based on genes that are annotated to be part of any combination of two of the selected pathways and that were significantly regulated in the subtraction profile analysis. Those numbers were then compared to the entire set of shared genes, and P-values were calculated as above.</p>

          <p><bold>Splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) targeting of TAF6</bold>. (A) The region of the TAF6 pre-mRNA that includes two alternative 5' splice sites (SSs) that produce either the constitutive Î± splice variant or the alternative Î´ splice variant is schematically depicted. Selection of an intron-proximal Î± 5' splice site (SS) results in production of the Î± isoform of TAF6 (at right) whereas the selection of the proximal Î´ 5' SS results in the production of the Î´ isoform (at left). The SSO oligonucleotides (SSO T6-1 &amp; SSO T6-3) base pair with the alternative exon to force splicing from the distal 5' SS and enforce expression of the endogenous TAF6Î´ isoform (at left). The protein produced by the major splice variant, TAF6Î±, can interact with the TFIID subunit, TAF9 via its histone fold domain. In contrast, TAF6Î´ lacks 10 amino acids of helix 2 of its histone fold motif and therefore cannot interact with TAF9. (B) SSO T6-3 induces endogenous TAF6Î´ mRNA expression. HeLa cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotides: SSO Ctrol, SSO T6-1 or SSO T6-3. 24 hours post-transfection total RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-PCR with primers that amplify both the TAF6Î± and the alternative TAF6Î´ mRNAs. (C) Quantification of TAF6Î´ expression. Black bars show the percentage of TAF6Î´ over total TAF6 mRNA as amplified by RT-PCR as in B and separated by microfluidity and analyzed using a 2100 Agilent Bioanalyzer. Light grey bars show the percentage of TAF6Î´ expressing cells after SSO transfection as in B except that cells were fixed and stained with an anti-TAF6Î´ antibody for immunocytochemistry (ICC) and a minimum of 500 cells were scored for their staining with an anti-TAF6Î´ antibody.</p>
