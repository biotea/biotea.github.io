      <abstract>
        <p>GPR56 is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Mutations in GPR56 cause a devastating human brain malformation called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). Using the N-terminal fragment of GPR56 (GPR56<sup>N</sup>) as a probe, we have recently demonstrated that collagen III is the ligand of GPR56 in the developing brain. In this report, we discover a new functional domain in GPR56<sup>N</sup>, the ligand binding domain. This domain contains four disease-associated mutations and two N-glycosylation sites. Our study reveals that although glycosylation is not required for ligand binding, each of the four disease-associated mutations completely abolish the ligand binding ability of GPR56. Our data indicates that these four single missense mutations cause BFPP mostly by abolishing the ability of GPR56 to bind to its ligand, collagen III, in addition to affecting GPR56 protein surface expression as previously shown.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Adhesion GPCRs are a relatively new family of GPCRs that have a very long N-terminal extracellular domain. In humans, there are a total of 33 members of adhesion GPCRs that are thought to mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interaction, with GPR56 as the first one linked to a human developmental malformation <xref rid="pone.0029818-Schioth1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Strokes1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>GPR56</italic> cause BFPP, a specific human brain malformation <xref rid="pone.0029818-Piao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Piao2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. To date, a total of fourteen BFPP-associated mutations have been identified, including one deletion, two splicing, and eleven missense mutations <xref rid="pone.0029818-Strokes1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Based on the fact that all of the missense mutations render an identical clinical phenotype as the deletion mutation, it is presumed that all missense mutations result in a null allele <xref rid="pone.0029818-Piao2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Previously, we have shown that all of the missense mutations affect GPR56 protein trafficking and cell surface expression to variable degrees <xref rid="pone.0029818-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, we can only say for certain that the two mutations in the GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) domain, C346S and W349S, cause a brain malformation through trapping the mutated proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum <xref rid="pone.0029818-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Most recently, we have discovered that the ligand of GPR56 is collagen III <xref rid="pone.0029818-Luo2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In this report, we aim to identify and characterize the binding domain of GPR56 to collagen III. Although the N-terminal extracellular domain of GPR56, GPR56<sup>N</sup>, is heavily glycosylated, we provide strong evidence that glycosylation is not required for ligand binding. Moreover, disease-associated mutations in the ligand binding domain completely eliminate its ligand binding ability, revealing the molecular mechanism for GPR56-related brain malformation.</p>

To identify the ligand binding domain of GPR56, we engineered a series of truncated GPR56<sup>N</sup>-hFc fusion protein constructs by gradually trimming GPR56<sup>N</sup> from both the N- and C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The constructs were transiently expressed in HEK-293T cells to generate fusion proteins that were naturally glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The concentrated fusion proteins were then used for ligand binding assays on embryonic day (E) 14.5 mouse cortices. We were able to observe putative ligand binding with all of the fusion proteins except the ones containing aa 27â142 and aa 49â160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g002">Fig. 2CâJ</xref>).

        <title>N-glycosylation is not required for ligand binding</title>
        <p>The ligand binding domain of GPR56 contains two N-glycosylation sites, N39 and N148. To investigate whether glycosylation at each of these two sites is required for ligand binding, we generated two mutations, N39Q and N148Q, in the fragment of aa 27â160 to individually remove the corresponding N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The mutant proteins were detected in the conditioned media of transiently transfected cells and, as expected, both mutations abolished one N-glycosylation site resulting in a protein that migrates faster on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The mutant fusion proteins were concentrated from the conditioned media and used for both the putative ligand binding assay and co-IP experiments. Both mutants retained a ligand binding capacity comparable to the wild-type protein, suggesting glycosylation of GPR56 is not necessary for ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g003">Fig. 3CâF</xref>).</p>

        <title>Disease-associated mutations abolish ligand binding</title>
        <p>The four reported disease-associated mutations in the ligand binding domain are R38Q, R38W, Y88C, and C91S. We have previously shown that these four mutations decreased mutant proteins expression on the cell surface and its secretion into the conditioned media <xref rid="pone.0029818-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It is not clear, however, how each of the four missense mutations completely demolishes the receptor function. To study whether these mutations also affect ligand binding, we generated individual mutant ligand binding domains by site-directed mutagenesis in the pFUSE-hFc2 construct containing aa 27â160 of GPR56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). We were able to detect the fusion mutant proteins in the conditioned media of the transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The mutant fusion proteins were concentrated from the conditioned media and used for the putative ligand binding assay and co-IP experiments. None of these four mutant proteins could bind the ligand in both the putative ligand binding assay and co-IP experiments, propositioning that the four missense mutations completely killed the ligand binding ability of GPR56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g004">Fig. 4CâH</xref>).</p>

We have previously shown that collagen III inhibits neural migration via GPR56 and that wild type GPR56<sup>N</sup> can rescue this inhibition <xref rid="pone.0029818-Luo2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. To further investigate the impact of BFPP-associated mutations on the receptor function, we performed a neurosphere migration assay to examine whether the four BFPP-associated mutations - R38Q, R38W, Y88C, and C91S - functionally abolish receptor-ligand interaction. As expected, in contrast to the wild type GPR56<sup>N</sup>, none of the four mutant proteins were able to reverse the collagen III-mediated neural migration inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

        <p>We have thus demonstrated that mouse GPR56 binds to both mouse and human collagen III. To study whether the interaction can extend to the human GPR56 protein, we constructed a human GPR56<sup>N</sup>-hFc fusion protein (hGPR56<sup>N</sup>-hFc) and the corresponding BFPP-associated mutants: R38Q, Y88C, and C91S. We first performed co-IP experiments using purified human collagen III. As expected, we can only detect collagen III in wild type hGPR56<sup>N</sup> but not in the mutant hGPR56<sup>N</sup> co-IP protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029818-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). We next examined the tissue binding activity on E14.5 mouse brain sections.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>GPR56 is a particularly distinct member of the adhesion GPCRs since its mutations are associated with a devastating human brain malformation called BFPP <xref rid="pone.0029818-Piao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Piao3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Jin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. There are a total of eleven reported null allele missense mutations associated with BFPP, two of which reside in the GPS domain and cause brain malformation by demolishing the autoproteolytic process, thus trapping the mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum <xref rid="pone.0029818-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Jin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A recent study by Lin's group indicates that mutations in the tip of GPR56<sup>N</sup> likely render the receptor null status by affecting their binding to a putative cellular ligand in HT1080 cells <xref rid="pone.0029818-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Here, we show four mutations in the tip of GPR56<sup>N</sup> impair the receptor function by aborting its ligand binding ability, in addition to affecting the receptor cell surface expression.</p>
      <p>GPR56 is cleaved at aa 382 via a GPS-mediated autoproteolytic process <xref rid="pone.0029818-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Shashidhar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Although the cleaved GPR56<sup>N</sup> lacks a transmembrane sequence, it is expressed on the cell surface via an unknown mechanism <xref rid="pone.0029818-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition, GPR56<sup>N</sup> is secreted into the conditioned media <xref rid="pone.0029818-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We previously showed that the four missense mutations on the tip of GPR56<sup>N</sup> (R38Q, R38W, Y88C, and C91S) affect the secretion of GPR56<sup>N</sup> into the conditioned media <xref rid="pone.0029818-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In this study, we were able to detect secreted mutant proteins in their short forms. The possible explanations could be either that the pFUSE-hFc2 vector was more efficient in driving protein expression/secretion since it uses the IL2 signal peptide sequence or that replacing aa 160â382 with the large hFc fragment facilitated the shedding of the fusion protein.</p>
      <p>GPR56 functions in a capacity to mediate cell-extracellular matrix interaction. Our recent finding demonstrates that collagen III is the ligand of GPR56 in the developing brain <xref rid="pone.0029818-Luo2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Collagen III is a major collagen in the connective tissues with integrin Î±1Î²1 and Î±2Î²1 both serving as it's receptors <xref rid="pone.0029818-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Nykvist1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In this report, we identified the binding domain of GPR56 to collagen III. Since there is no consensus amino acid sequence between integrin Î±1Î²1/Î±2Î²1 and GPR56, it is likely that GPR56 binds to a different region of collagen III.</p>
      <p>In addition to its vital function in brain development, GPR56 also plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis. GPR56 was originally cloned by two independent groups in 1999, one using a degenerative PCR approach and the other through differential display in high and low metastatic melanoma cell lines <xref rid="pone.0029818-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Zendman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The latter group revealed that GPR56 is significantly down regulated in high metastatic melanoma cell lines, indicating a possible role of GPR56 in tumor metastasis <xref rid="pone.0029818-Zendman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. It was subsequently demonstrated that GPR56 inhibits tumor growth/metastasis, likely by regulating VEGF production and tumor angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0029818-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, they showed that GPR56 binds to TG2, a major crosslinking enzyme in the extracellular matrix, at aa 108â177 <xref rid="pone.0029818-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029818-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Although knockdown of TG2 did not lead to an increase of VEGF, deleting the TG2 binding domain led to enhanced angiogenesis and tumor growth <xref rid="pone.0029818-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. There is some overlap between the collagen III and TG2 binding domains on GPR56. It is highly desirable to reveal the crystal structure of these two binding domains in order to fully understand how GPR56 dynamically interacts with both collagen III and TG2 in both the developing brain as well as tumor growth and metastasis.</p>
