      <abstract>
        <p id="P2">We demonstrate the successful application of exome sequencing<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> to discover a gene for an autosomal dominant disorder, Kabuki syndrome (OMIM %147920). The exomes of ten unrelated probands were subjected to massively parallel sequencing. After filtering against SNP databases, there was no compelling candidate gene containing novel variants in all affected individuals. Less stringent filtering criteria permitted modest genetic heterogeneity or missing data, but identified multiple candidate genes. However, genotypic and phenotypic stratification highlighted <italic>MLL2</italic>, a <italic>Trithorax</italic>-group histone methyltransferase<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, in which seven probands had novel nonsense or frameshift mutations. Follow-up Sanger sequencing detected <italic>MLL2</italic> mutations in two of the three remaining cases, and in 26 of 43 additional cases. In families where parental DNA was available, the mutation was confirmed to be <italic>de novo</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 12) or transmitted (<italic>n</italic> = 2) in concordance with phenotype. Our results strongly suggest that mutations in <italic>MLL2</italic> are a major cause of Kabuki syndrome.</p>

    <p id="P3">Kabuki syndrome is a rare, multiple malformation disorder characterized by a distinctive facial appearance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), cardiac anomalies, skeletal abnormalities, immunological defects, and mild to moderate mental retardation. Originally described by Niikawa <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and Kuroki <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> in 1981, Kabuki syndrome has an estimated incidence of 1 in 32,000<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and about 400 cases have been reported worldwide. The vast majority of reported cases have been sporadic, but parent-to-child transmission in more than a half a dozen instances<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> suggests that Kabuki syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. The relatively low number of cases, the lack of multiplex families, and the phenotypic variability of Kabuki syndrome have made the identification of the gene(s) underlying Kabuki syndrome intractable to conventional approaches of gene discovery, despite aggressive efforts.</p>
    <p id="P4">We sequenced the exomes of ten unrelated individuals with Kabuki syndrome, seven of European ancestry, two of Hispanic ancestry, and one of mixed European/Haitian ancestry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Enrichment was performed by hybridization of shotgun fragment libraries to custom microarrays, followed by massively parallel sequencing<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. On average, 6.3 gigabases of sequence were generated per sample to achieve 40Ã coverage of the mappable, targeted exome (31 megabases). As previously, our analyses focused primarily on nonsynonymous (NS) variants, splice acceptor and donor site mutations (SS) and coding indels (I), anticipating that synonymous variants were far less likely to be pathogenic. We also predicted that variants underlying Kabuki syndrome are rare, and therefore likely to be novel. Novelty was defined here by absence from all datasets used for comparison, including dbSNP129, the 1000 Genomes Project, exome data from sixteen individuals previously reported by us<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, and ten exomes sequenced as part of the Environmental Genome Project (EGP).</p>
    <p id="P5">Under a dominant model in which each case was required to have at least one novel NS/SS/I variant in the same gene, only a single candidate gene (<italic>MUC16</italic>) was shared by all ten exomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, row 4; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). However, <italic>MUC16</italic> was considered likely to be a false positive due to its extremely large size (14,507 aa). Potential explanations for our failure to find a compelling candidate gene in which novel variants are observed in all affected individuals included: (a) that Kabuki syndrome is genetically heterogeneous, and therefore not all affected individuals will have mutations in the same gene; (b) that we failed to identify all mutations in the targeted exome; (c) that some or all causative mutations were outside of the targeted exome, e.g., in non-coding regions or unannotated genes. To allow for a modest degree of genetic heterogeneity and/or missing data, we conducted a less stringent analysis by looking for candidate genes shared among subsets of affected individuals. Specifically, we searched for subsets of <italic>x</italic> out of 10 exomes having â¥ 1 novel variant in the same gene, for <italic>x</italic> = 1 to 10. For <italic>x</italic> = 9, 8, and 7, novel variants were shared in three genes, six genes, and sixteen genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, row 4). However, there was no obvious way to rank these candidates.</p>
    <p id="P6">We speculated that genotypic and/or phenotypic stratification would facilitate the prioritization of candidate genes identified by subset analysis. Specifically, we assigned a categorical rank to each Kabuki case based on a subjective assessment of the presence of, or similarity to, the canonical facial characteristics of Kabuki syndrome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) and the presence of developmental delay and/or major birth defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The highest ranked case was one of a pair of monozygotic twins with Kabuki syndrome. We then categorized the functional impact (i.e. nonsense versus nonsynonymous substitution, splice-site disruption, frameshift versus in-frame indel) of each novel variant in candidate genes shared by each subset of two or more ranked cases. Manual review of these data highlighted distinct, novel nonsense variants in <italic>MLL2</italic> in each of the four highest ranked cases. On sequential analysis of phenotype-ranked cases with a loss-of-function filter, <italic>MLL2</italic> is the only candidate gene remaining after addition of the second individual (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, row 5, column "+2"). No novel variant in <italic>MLL2</italic> was found in the Kabuki case ranked 5<sup>th</sup>, such that the number of candidate genes drops to zero after the fourth individual (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, row 5). However, a 4-bp deletion was found in the case ranked 6<sup>th</sup> and nonsense variants in the cases ranked 7<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>. Thus, exome sequencing identified a nonsense substitution or frameshift indel in <italic>MLL2</italic> in seven of the ten Kabuki cases.</p>
    <p id="P7">Retrospectively, if we apply a loss-of-function filter to the subset analysis of exome data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, row 5), at <italic>x</italic> = 7, <italic>MLL2</italic> is the only candidate gene. We also developed a <italic>post hoc</italic> ranking of candidate genes based on functional impact of variants present (âvariant scoreâ) and the rank of the cases in which each variant was observed (âcase scoreâ). When applied to the exome data as a combined metric, <italic>MLL2</italic> emerges as the top candidate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">In parallel with these analyses, we applied genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> to exome data. GERP uses mammalian genome alignments to define a rejected substitution (RS) score for each variant, regardless of functional class. We have previously shown that the quantitative ranking of candidate genes by the RS scores of their novel variants can facilitate the exome-based analysis of Mendelian disorders<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In subset analysis with GERP-based ranking, <italic>MLL2</italic> remains on the candidate list up to <italic>x</italic> = 8, ranking 3<sup>rd</sup> in a list of 11 candidate genes at this threshold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, the additional <italic>MLL2</italic> variant contributing to this analysis (such that <italic>MLL2</italic> is still considered at <italic>x</italic> = 8) is a synonymous substitution with an RS score of 0.368 in the 5<sup>th</sup> ranked case.</p>
    <p id="P9">We sought to confirm all novel variants identified in <italic>MLL2</italic>, particularly because loss-of-function variants identified through massively parallel sequencing have a higher prior probability of being false positives. All seven loss-of-function variants in <italic>MLL2</italic> were validated by Sanger sequencing. We further analyzed the three cases in which we did not initially find a loss-of-function variant in <italic>MLL2</italic>, first by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to determine any gross structural changes, and then by Sanger sequencing of all exons of <italic>MLL2</italic> in case of false negatives by exome sequencing. Since an average of 96% of coding bases in <italic>MLL2</italic> were called at sufficient quality and coverage for single-nucleotide variant detection, we anticipated that any missed variants were more likely to be indels instead, because of the higher coverage required for confident indel detection in short-read sequence data. Indeed, although aCGH did not find any structural variants in the region, Sanger sequencing did identify frameshift indels in two of these three cases (ranked 8<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup>).</p>
    <p id="P10">Ultimately, loss-of-function mutations in <italic>MLL2</italic> were identified in nine out of ten cases in the discovery cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), making it a compelling candidate for Kabuki syndrome. For validation, we screened all 54 exons of <italic>MLL2</italic> in 43 additional cases by Sanger sequencing. Novel nonsynonymous, nonsense or frameshift mutations in <italic>MLL2</italic> were found in 26 of these 43 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). In total, through either exome sequencing or targeted sequencing of <italic>MLL2</italic>, 33 distinct <italic>MLL2</italic> mutations were identified in 35 of 53 families (66%) with Kabuki syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). In each of twelve cases for which DNA from both parents was available, the <italic>MLL2</italic> variant was found to have occurred <italic>de novo</italic>. Three mutations were found in two cases each: one mutation was confirmed to have arisen <italic>de novo</italic> in one of the cases, indicating that some mutations are recurrent. Novel <italic>MLL2</italic> mutations (K4527X and T5464M) were also identified in each of two families in which Kabuki syndrome was transmitted from parent-to-child. None of the additional <italic>MLL2</italic> mutations were found in 190 control chromosomes from individuals of matched geographical ancestry.</p>
    <p id="P11">Our results strongly suggest that mutations in <italic>MLL2</italic> are a major cause of Kabuki syndrome. <italic>MLL2</italic> encodes a large 5,262 residue protein that is part of the SET family of proteins, of which <italic>Trithorax</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of <italic>MLL</italic>, is the best characterized<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. The SET domain of <italic>MLL2</italic> confers strong histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferase activity and is important in the epigenetic control of active chromatin states<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Murine loss of <italic>Mll2</italic> on a mixed 129Sv/C57BL/6 background slows growth, increases apoptosis and retards development leading to early embryonic lethality, due in part to mis-regulation of homeobox gene expression<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. However, no morphological defects have been reported in <italic>Mll2</italic><sup>+/â</sup> mice<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P12">Most of the <italic>MLL2</italic> variants identified in Kabuki cases are predicted to truncate the polypeptide chain before translation of the SET domain. Accordingly, though it is not certain whether Kabuki syndrome results from haploinsufficiency or a gain-of function at <italic>MLL2</italic>, haploinsufficiency seems to be the more likely mechanism. Deletion of chromosome 12q12-q13.2, which encompasses <italic>MLL2</italic>, has been reported in a child with characteristics of Noonan syndrome<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. However, we re-analyzed this case using oligo aCGH (including 21 probes that cover <italic>MLL2</italic>) and found the distal breakpoint to be located ~700 kb proximal of <italic>MLL2</italic> (data not shown). Interestingly, all of the pathogenic missense variants identified herein are located in regions of <italic>MLL2</italic> that encode C-terminal domains. This suggests that missense variants elsewhere in <italic>MLL2</italic> could be better tolerated or, alternatively, are embryonic lethal.</p>
    <p id="P13">For the 18 of 53 cases for which no novel protein-altering variant was found, it is possible that non-coding or other missed mutations in <italic>MLL2</italic> are responsible instead. Alternatively, Kabuki syndrome could be genetically heterogeneous, and further analysis of these cases by exome sequencing may elucidate additional genes for Kabuki syndrome and potentially explain some of the phenotypic heterogeneity seen in this disease. Notably, 9 of 10 individuals in the discovery cohort (90%), but only 26 of 43 individuals in the replication cohort (60%), were ultimately found to have mutations in <italic>MLL2</italic>. It is therefore possible that the careful selection of canonical Kabuki cases for the discovery cohort enriched for a shared genetic basis. This underscores the importance of access to deeply phenotyped and well-characterized cases.</p>
    <p id="P14">In summary, we applied exome sequencing of a small number of unrelated cases to discover that mutations in <italic>MLL2</italic> underlie Kabuki syndrome. As predicted in previous analyses<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, allowing for even a small degree of genetic heterogeneity or missing data significantly confounds exome analysis by increasing the number of candidate genes consistent with the model of inheritance. To facilitate the prioritization of genes under such criteria, we stratified data by ranked phenotypes and found that <italic>MLL2</italic> was prominent in the higher ranked cases. However, nine of the ten Kabuki cases in the discovery cohort were ultimately found to have <italic>MLL2</italic> mutations, such that stratification by phenotype was of less importance than originally appeared to be the case. Nonetheless, the sequential analysis of ranked cases may have reduced the probability of confounding due to genetic heterogeneity. All of the <italic>MLL2</italic> mutations found in the discovery set via exome sequencing were loss-of-function variants. As a result, <italic>MLL2</italic> ranked highly among candidates assessed by predicted functional impact. Such a pattern will likely occur for some, but not all, Mendelian phenotypes subjected to this approach. We anticipate that the further development of strategies to stratify data at both the genotypic and phenotypic level will be critical for exome and whole genome sequencing to reach their full potential as tools for discovery of genes underlying Mendelian and complex diseases.</p>
