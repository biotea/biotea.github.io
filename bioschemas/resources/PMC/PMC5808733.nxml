        Abstract
          See Dasgupta et al. (doi:10.1093/awv237) for a scientific commentary on this article.
        Defects of mitochondrial dynamics are emerging causes of neurological disease. In two children presenting with severe neurological deterioration following viral infection we identified a novel homozygous STAT2 mutation, c.1836 C>A (p.Cys612Ter), using whole exome sequencing. In muscle and fibroblasts from these patients, and a third unrelated STAT2-deficient patient, we observed extremely elongated mitochondria. Western blot analysis revealed absence of the STAT2 protein and that the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 (encoded by DNM1L) is inactive, as shown by its phosphorylation state. All three patients harboured decreased levels of DRP1 phosphorylated at serine residue 616 (P-DRP1S616), a post-translational modification known to activate DRP1, and increased levels of DRP1 phosphorylated at serine 637 (P-DRP1S637), associated with the inactive state of the DRP1 GTPase. Knockdown of STAT2 in SHSY5Y cells recapitulated the fission defect, with elongated mitochondria and decreased P-DRP1S616 levels. Furthermore the mitochondrial fission defect in patient fibroblasts was rescued following lentiviral transduction with wild-type STAT2 in all three patients, with normalization of mitochondrial length and increased P-DRP1S616 levels. Taken together, these findings implicate STAT2 as a novel regulator of DRP1 phosphorylation at serine 616, and thus of mitochondrial fission, and suggest that there are interactions between immunity and mitochondria. This is the first study to link the innate immune system to mitochondrial dynamics and morphology. We hypothesize that variability in JAK-STAT signalling may contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity of mitochondrial disease, and may explain why some patients with underlying mitochondrial disease decompensate after seemingly trivial viral infections. Modulating JAK-STAT activity may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for mitochondrial diseases, which remain largely untreatable. This may also be relevant for more common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s, Huntington&#x02019;s and Parkinson&#x02019;s diseases, in which abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology have been implicated in disease pathogenesis.STAT2dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)mitochondrial diseaseJAK-STAT signallingmitochondrial fissionmitochondrial fusionNational Institutes of Health10.13039/100000002) -->

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitochondrial diseases are clinically, biochemically and genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by dysfunction of mitochondria, which are highly dynamic organelles with multitudinous functions including energy generation by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Although the dynamic nature of mitochondria was recognized nearly 100 years ago, only recently have the processes determining mitochondrial morphology been unravelled (<xref rid="awv182-B18" ref-type="bibr">Lewis and Lewis, 1914</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B2" ref-type="bibr">Archer, 2013</xref>). Mitochondrial networks are defined by a delicate balance of fusion and fission events that link mitochondrial biogenesis to mitophagy, a quality control process for removing dysfunctional mitochondria in the mitochondrial âlife cycleâ. When this balance is perturbed, mitochondrial disease ensues (<xref rid="awv182-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (<xref rid="awv182-B5" ref-type="bibr">Chan, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B34" ref-type="bibr">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>).

      <p>Several factors necessary for mitochondrial fusion and fission have been identified (<xref rid="awv182-B2" ref-type="bibr">Archer, 2013</xref>). Mitochondrial fusion is mediated by several large membrane guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases): the mitofusins (MFN1 and MFN2) on the outer membrane, and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) on the inner membrane. Factors involved in fission include dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1, encoded by <italic>DNM1L</italic>), receptor proteins MiD49 (<italic>MIEF2</italic>) and MiD51 (<italic>MIEF1</italic>), mitochondrial fission protein 1 (<italic>FIS1</italic>) and mitochondrial fission factor (<italic>MFF</italic>) (<xref rid="awv182-B22" ref-type="bibr">Palmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B19" ref-type="bibr">LosÃ³n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, the exact processes coordinating fission and fusion remain unknown.</p>
      <p>Previously mutations in the fission factors DRP1 and MFF have been implicated in causing human mitochondrial fission defects (<xref rid="awv182-B32" ref-type="bibr">Waterham <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B26" ref-type="bibr">Shamseldin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). We have now used whole exome sequencing to identify mutations in <italic>STAT2</italic>, encoding a component of the JAK (janus kinase)-STAT (signal transduction and activation of transcription) cytokine signalling pathway (<xref rid="awv182-B28" ref-type="bibr">Steen and Gamero, 2013</xref>), as a novel cause of disrupted mitochondrial fission in three patients from two unrelated pedigrees. These data are the first to implicate signalling pathways of the innate immune system in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.</p>

        <title>Patients</title>
        <p>Patient 1 is the elder child of non-consanguineous Albanian parents. He was well and developing normally until 12 months of age when he developed a febrile illness 1 week after mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccination unresponsive to antibiotics. CSF cell count was normal. Pyrexia, lethargy, conjunctivitis, inflamed throat and lymphadenopathy continued, leading to a diagnosis of atypical Kawasaki disease, treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. Measles serology prior to immunoglobulin administration was consistent with recent MMR vaccination. C-reactive protein (CRP) was initially raised but rapidly fell to normal levels.</p>
        <p>One month later, he was readmitted with opsoclonus-myoclonus. EEG and brain MRI were normal, but repeat CSF examination revealed 12 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>/l lymphocytes and low glucose, with negative bacterial cultures and viral PCRs. He was treated empirically with intravenous acyclovir and steroids, and improved. Immunology investigations demonstrated low CD4-positive T cells. Major Histocompatibility Complex II deficiency and HIV were excluded, and proliferative response to phytohaemagglutinin was normal. He remained well until 2.5 years when he presented with fever, diarrhoea, hypoglycaemia, impaired renal and liver function, metabolic acidosis (pH 7.15), hyperammonaemia, markedly elevated CRP and thrombocytopaenia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). He then developed opsoclonus-myoclonus and seizures, with neuroimaging suggestive of meningoencephalitis. He received treatment with antimicrobials, antifungals and steroids. Seizures were very difficult to control, and he developed significant neurological impairment including four-limb spasticity, chorea and severe cortical visual impairment, which has not recovered. He remains on triple anticonvulsant therapy, replacement immunoglobulin and antibiotic prophylaxis.</p>
        <p>Patient 2, the younger sister of Patient 1, was well until aged 13 months when she developed a febrile illness 1 week after MMR vaccine. She was anaemic and lymphopaenic with deranged clotting. CSF was normal except for a positive PCR for mumps virus. Throat swab PCR was positive for measles, mumps and rubella. She had detectable antibodies to all three viruses, suggesting an appropriate immunological response to the vaccine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). She was treated with intravenous acyclovir, and was readmitted aged 15 months with persistent fever and malaise. She developed septic shock with metabolic acidosis requiring intensive care. CSF culture and PCR for herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and enterovirus were negative. She was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone, clindamycin and acyclovir. Her blood counts normalized, and bone marrow aspirate and lymph node biopsy showed no haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Autoantibodies were negative. She made a slow recovery with no neurological or other deficit, and has remained well other than a diarrhoeal illness, during which immunological testing revealed marked lymphopaenia with low B and T cells. Over the next 12 months her lymphocyte count and T and B cell numbers normalized. Due to the apparent association with infection, she remains on replacement immunoglobulin. In addition to neurological and immune dysfunction, both children had evidence of mild renal tubulopathy. Detailed clinical data are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p>
        <p>Patient 3 (<xref rid="awv182-B13" ref-type="bibr">Hambleton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), from an unrelated family, was reported previously to have experienced a prolonged febrile illness with multisystem involvement following MMR. Her affected cousin developed a sterile encephalitic illness following the same vaccine (<xref rid="awv182-B13" ref-type="bibr">Hambleton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>

          <title>Whole exome sequencing and filtering criteria</title>
          <p>The whole exome was sequenced in Patients 1 and 2 using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Sample preparation and enrichment was performed according to Agilent's SureSelect Protocol Version 1.2. Concentration of each library was determined using Agilent's QPCR NGS Library Quantification Kit (G4880A). Samples were pooled prior to sequencing, with each sample at a final concentration of 10 nM. Read files (Fastq) were generated from the sequencing platform via runs to an average 50Ã coverage on an in-house HiSeq 2000 system (Illumina). Raw fastq files were aligned to the GRCh37 reference genome using novoalign version 2.08.03. Duplicate reads were marked using Picard tools MarkDuplicates. Calling was performed using the haplotype caller module of GATK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk">https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk</ext-link>, version 3.1-1), creating gVCF formatted files for each sample. The individual gVCF files for the exomes discussed in this study, in combination with â¼3000 clinical exomes (UCL-exomes consortium), were combined into merged VCF files for each chromosome containing on average 100 samples each. The final variant calling was performed using the GATK GenotypeGVCFs module jointly for all samples (cases and controls). Variant quality scores were then recalibrated according to GATK best practices separately for indels and SNPs. Resulting variants were annotated using ANNOVAR. Candidate variants were filtered based on function (non-synonymous, presumed loss-of-function or splicing) and minor allele frequency (&lt;0.5% minor allele frequency in our internal control group, as well as the NHLBI exome sequencing data set).</p>

        <p>The siblings Patients 1 and 2 presented with severe neurological deterioration following live attenuated viral immunization, and also had evidence of immune deficiency. The multisystem nature of their disease, together with mildly elevated plasma and CSF lactate levels in Patient 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), led to clinical suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder. The elevated CSF neopterin levels observed in Patients 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were also compatible with an underlying mitochondrial disorder (<xref rid="awv182-B14" ref-type="bibr">Hasselmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Consequently open muscle biopsies were performed in both siblings. Spectrophotometric analysis of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities (OXPHOS complexes IâIV) was normal in skeletal muscle from Patients 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) but in-gel activity of ATP synthase (complex V) was reduced on blue-native gel electrophoresis, particularly in Patient 1 who was clinically more severely affected (data not shown).</p>

          <p>For DRP1 to exert its effects on initiation of mitochondrial fission, it first needs to be localized to the mitochondria. Using confocal microscopy, we examined DRP1 localization in Patient 1 and control fibroblasts, and found DRP1 to be co-localized with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein TOM20 in both patient and control fibroblasts. Thus a deficiency of STAT2 protein does not appear to affect DRP1 localization to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv182-F4">Fig. 4</xref>C).</p>

          <p>To further investigate the underlying cause of the long mitochondria, we measured activation of DRP1, the main fission factor in human mitochondria. As DRP1 levels and localization were normal in patient cells, we hypothesized that DRP1 might be inactive in patient cells and therefore unable to complete the fission process. DRP1 activity is dually regulated by phosphorylation at two key serine residues. Post-translational modification by phosphorylation at serine residue 616 (P-DRP1<sup>S616</sup>) is known to activate DRP1, whereas phosphorylation at serine 637 (P-DRP1<sup>S637</sup>) is associated with the inactive state of the GTPase. Reduced P-DRP1<sup>S616</sup> and increased P-DRP1<sup>S637</sup> was observed in all three patients compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv182-F5">Fig. 5</xref>), indicating that DRP1 is inactive in STAT2 deficiency. Introduction of wild-type <italic>STAT2</italic> into patient fibroblasts using lentiviral transduction reversed the phenotypes; we observed increased P-DRP1<sup>S616</sup>, decreased P-DRP1<sup>S637</sup> and shorter mitochondria, reflecting a state of increased fission. Conversely, knock down of <italic>STAT2</italic> in SHSY5Y cells led to increased P-DRP1<sup>S637</sup>and reduced P-DRP1<sup>S616</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv182-F5">Fig. 5</xref>) and extremely elongated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv182-F2">Fig. 2</xref>B), recapitulating the phenotype in STAT2-deficient fibroblasts.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have found that STAT2, a component of the JAK-STAT cytokine signalling pathway, is a novel regulator of mitochondrial fission. This provides new insight into how the cell may orchestrate mitochondrial morphology and dynamics in concert with other cellular compartments. Modulation of mitochondrial shape can be detrimental to organelle function and can lead to a distinct shift in cell viability with unregulated fission reported in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimerâs, Huntingtonâs and Parkinsonâs diseases (<xref rid="awv182-B7" ref-type="bibr">Dagda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B31" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B16" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>DRP1 is the master regulator of mitochondrial fission, though how it is ultimately recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane remains largely unknown (<xref rid="awv182-B22" ref-type="bibr">Palmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B19" ref-type="bibr">LosÃ³n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Complicating the issue further is the fact that DRP1 can undergo numerous post-translational modifications by the action of various proteins at different stages of the cell cycle. In this report, studies of mitochondrial morphology in three patients from two unrelated pedigrees with <italic>STAT2</italic> mutations revealed an elongated mitochondrial network. It appears that these patients harbour decreased levels of DRP1 phosphorylated at serine 616 (P-DRP1<sup>S616</sup>) and increased levels of DRP1 phosphorylated at serine 637 (P-DRP1<sup>S637</sup>). Both post-translational modifications render DRP1 largely inactive in the cytosol, unable to polymerise into higher order structures and assemble into the fission apparatus on the mitochondrial outer membraneâthus causing a block in the fission process (<xref rid="awv182-B29" ref-type="bibr">Taguchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Blackstone, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B11" ref-type="bibr">Gomes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Deducing what is a block in fission and what is stress induced hyperfusion is at times difficult; however, hyperfusion is most commonly observed as an acute response to stress and is a transient state before mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref rid="awv182-B11" ref-type="bibr">Gomes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>We observed normal steady state levels of DRP1 and increased protein levels of the fusion proteins MFN1, MFN2 and OPA1 and also other mitochondrial proteins (MTCO2 and TOM20) compared to controls. This suggests that the relative mitochondrial hyperfusion, as a result of defective fission following DRP1 inactivation in STAT2 deficiency, leads to an increase in mitochondrial mass and results in raised levels of mitochondrial proteins, including MFN1, MFN2 and OPA1, but does not affect the levels of cytosolic proteins, such as DRP1. The increase in mitochondrial mass is further corroborated by the doubling in mtDNA copy number in cultured fibroblasts from Patient 1 (data not shown). Given the reduction in endogenous levels of P-DRP1<sup>S616</sup> in these patients with <italic>STAT2</italic> mutations, it would seem that a modulation in the activity of DRP1 is directly responsible for the mitochondrial phenotype and results in defective fission.</p>
      <p>Intercurrent infection frequently triggers severe decompensation in patients with mitochondrial disease. It has been assumed that the underlying energy defect limits the ability of the patient to cope with the added metabolic stress of infection. However, more recently, we have observed in our clinical practice that very specific infections can trigger fatal outcomes in patients who were not previously known to have mitochondrial disease prior to the viral illness. For example, we demonstrated that a previously well infant with overwhelming cardiomyopathy following respiratory syncytial virus infection had mutations in the <italic>NDUFAF1</italic> gene encoding an assembly factor of complex I, a key enzyme of OXPHOS (<xref rid="awv182-B10" ref-type="bibr">Fassone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). We also found mutations in another complex I assembly factor in another previously well infant who died of severe cardiomyopathy following parainfluenza infection (unpublished data). <italic>STAT2</italic>-knockout mice have severe susceptibility to viral infection, and STAT2 is a binding target for measles, a possible culprit in these patients (<xref rid="awv182-B23" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B24" ref-type="bibr">Rarnachandran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alazawi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>In view of the endosymbiotic hypothesis (which proposes that mitochondria originate from bacteria which were engulfed by and subsequently developed an endosymbiotic relationship with the host eukaryotic cell (<xref rid="awv182-B20" ref-type="bibr">Margulis, 1975</xref>), it is not surprising that components of the innate immune system may also interact with, and perhaps even regulate, mitochondria. The data from this study suggest an unexpected link between innate immunity and mitochondrial function and suggest a potential new avenue for developing pharmacological strategies to treat mitochondrial diseases, for which virtually no effective curative treatments exist at present (<xref rid="awv182-B15" ref-type="bibr">Kanabus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>Seven known mammalian STATs have been reported to be transcription factors with diverse biological functions, including immune regulation and development (<xref rid="awv182-B21" ref-type="bibr">Meier and Larner, 2014</xref>). Recently, non-canonical STAT functions have emerged, suggesting they play fundamental roles in cellular homeostasis (<xref rid="awv182-B21" ref-type="bibr">Meier and Larner, 2014</xref>). STAT3, the first to be found in mitochondria, has been implicated in the function of OXPHOS complexes I and II, suggesting that STAT3 is required for optimal energy production (<xref rid="awv182-B33" ref-type="bibr">Wegrzyn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Basal pools of STAT1 and STAT2 have recently also been identified within mitochondria, and have been postulated to down regulate mitochondrial transcription (<xref rid="awv182-B12" ref-type="bibr">Goswami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="awv182-B17" ref-type="bibr">Lartigue and Faustin, 2013</xref>), possibly to co-ordinate the immune response and energy production. This is particularly interesting in light of a recent report that DRP1 may control T-cell activation at the immune synapse (<xref rid="awv182-B4" ref-type="bibr">Baixauli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Previously cyclin B1-cyclin-dependent kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A have been demonstrated to phosphorylate DRP1 on Ser616 and Ser637 respectively (<xref rid="awv182-B2" ref-type="bibr">Archer, 2013</xref>). We now suggest that STAT2 is an additional phosphorylase capable of phosphorylating DRP1 on Ser616.</p>
      <p>In summary, STATs have increasingly recognized roles in mitochondrial function, and we have demonstrated that STAT2 is a novel regulator of mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv182-F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Manipulation of the JAK-STAT pathway may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for mitochondrial diseases, by fine-tuning the balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion.

<bold>Activation of the JAK-STAT pathway by viruses and the biogenesis, fission and fusion life cycle of mitochondria.</bold> Viral infections activate a cascade of signals to produce cytokines, which then activate JAK-STAT proteins which then form a complex and translocate into the nucleus. The STAT1/2 dimer protein complex binds to IRF9 in the nucleus and the resulting trimer interacts with DNA at transcription factor binding sites, and upregulates gene expression. The dotted red line indicates effects of STAT2 on mitochondrial fission, mediated by DRP1 phosphorylation in healthy cells. Mitochondrial morphology is maintained by a balance of fission and fusion events, with disparity leading to a distinct shift in viability of the organelle, which can result in disease states. Phosphorylation of DRP1 at differing serine residues (Ser616 and Ser637) within the protein results in varied effects on DRP1 activity. Phosphorylation at Ser637 inhibits the GTPase activity of DRP1, leading to a defect in mitochondrial fissionâpromoting mitochondrial elongation.</p>
