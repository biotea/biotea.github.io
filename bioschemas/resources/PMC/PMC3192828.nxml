      <abstract>
        <p>We report an early onset spastic ataxia-neuropathy syndrome in two brothers of a consanguineous family characterized clinically by lower extremity spasticity, peripheral neuropathy, ptosis, oculomotor apraxia, dystonia, cerebellar atrophy, and progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.1847G&gt;A; p.Y616C) in <italic>AFG3L2</italic>, encoding a subunit of an <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease. <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases reside in the mitochondrial inner membrane and are responsible for removal of damaged or misfolded proteins and proteolytic activation of essential mitochondrial proteins. AFG3L2 forms either a homo-oligomeric isoenzyme or a hetero-oligomeric complex with paraplegin, a homologous protein mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia type 7 (SPG7). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>AFG3L2</italic> cause autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28), a disorder whose phenotype is strikingly different from that of our patients. As defined in yeast complementation assays, the AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> gene product is a hypomorphic variant that exhibited oligomerization defects in yeast as well as in patient fibroblasts. Specifically, the formation of AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> complexes was impaired, both with itself and to a greater extent with paraplegin. This produced an early-onset clinical syndrome that combines the severe phenotypes of SPG7 and SCA28, in additional to other âmitochondrialâ features such as oculomotor apraxia, extrapyramidal dysfunction, and myoclonic epilepsy. These findings expand the phenotype associated with <italic>AFG3L2</italic> mutations and suggest that <italic>AFG3L2-</italic>related disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spastic ataxias.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mitochondria are cellular organelles important for converting sugar or fats into energy that cells can use for their functions and survival. Many neurological diseases are the result of mitochondrial dysfunction as affected cells are unable to cope with lowered energy supplies and increased oxidative stress. These deficiencies cause accumulation of cellular damage and eventually cell death. Spastic ataxias are neurological disorders involving cells with large energy requirements, the cerebellar Purkinje cells and the cerebral upper motor neurons. When these cells function improperly or die, individuals develop symptoms of incoordination (ataxia) and abnormal muscle tone in their legs (spastic paraplegia). Using emerging techniques of whole-exome sequencing we discovered that homozygous mutations in the <italic>AFG3L2</italic> gene caused spastic ataxia in two brothers of a consanguineous family. <italic>AFG3L2</italic> encodes a subunit of mitochondrial matrix proteases (<italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases) that regulate the functional integrity of mitochondria. Heterozygous mutations in <italic>AFG3L2</italic> were previously found to cause a disorder involving the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum resulting in ataxia. Interestingly, another isoform of <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases consists of AFG3L2 complexing with paraplegin, a similar protein associated with a hereditary spastic paraplegia. Our analysis provides insight into why different mutations in <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease subunits cause different neurological disorders.</p>

<italic>AFG3L2</italic> encodes a subunit of the <italic>m</italic>-AAA class of mitochondrial proteases <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Maltecca1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-DiBella1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These ATP-dependent metallopeptidases assemble into large proteolytic complexes in the inner membrane of mitochondria and function to ensure mitochondrial protein quality control through the degradation of misfolded proteins and the maturation of essential proteins <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Tatsuta1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In humans, <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases assemble into different isoenzymes: homo-oligomeric complexes of AFG3L2 subunits or hetero-oligomeric complexes of AFG3L2 with paraplegin (encoded by <italic>SPG7</italic>). Notably, paraplegin is incapable of self-assembling into homo-oligomers and requires AFG3L2 for function. Mutations in <italic>AFG3L2</italic> cause autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28; MIM #610246), a recently recognized and rare disorder characterized clinically by adult-onset dysarthria, ptosis and cerebellar ataxia <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Maltecca1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Cagnoli1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Edener1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>SPG7</italic>, on the other hand, are associated with another type of <italic>m</italic>-AAA-associated neurological disease, autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia type 7 (SPG7; MIM #607259). This disorder is characterized by adult-onset spasticity and weakness of the lower extremities due to a length-dependent axonopathy of corticospinal motor neurons <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Casari1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Atorino1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The phenotypic variation between these two disorders is particularly remarkable since these proteins are <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease subunits that interact with one another.</p>
      <p>Transgenic mouse models have been informative in characterizing the functional role of <italic>m</italic>-AAA complexes in human disease. While <italic>Spg7</italic>

Of particular interest, double mutant <italic>Spg7<sup>-/-</sup>Afg3l2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit a unique phenotype with severe early-onset spasticity and impairment of cerebellar function that is associated with axonal and cerebellar degeneration. This latter result reflects the accelerated progression of each phenotype and indicates that decreased dosage of both proteins could have a synergistic effect on the expression of these respective disorders <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Martinelli1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Similar alterations in the dosage of <italic>m</italic>-AAA activity in humans would be predicted to have comparable phenotypic findings.</p>
      <p>We now describe two teenage brothers, of a consanguineous family, with a novel homozygous missense mutation in <italic>AFG3L2</italic> initially identified by whole exome sequencing (WES). Yeast studies demonstrate that this mutation decreases cellular <italic>m</italic>-AAA activity due to impaired oligomerization with itself as well as with paraplegin. As a result, our patients present with an early-onset phenotype combining features of SPG7 and SCA28 resembling the accelerated phenotype seen in compound <italic>Spg7<sup>-/-</sup>Afg3l2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, the brothers have the additional findings of oculomotor apraxia, dystonia, and progressive myoclonic epilepsy, which are common features in mitochondrial disorders and likely result from reduced <italic>m</italic>-AAA activity in other regions of the CNS. Our findings expand the spectrum of neurological features associated with defective <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease activity, and highlight the phenotypic variation of <italic>m</italic>-AAA disorders as a result of the type of mutation and subunit involved.</p>

        <p>The parents of the two affected brothers were first cousins of Hispanic origin with no family history for neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The siblings were born thirteen months apart in Colombia without complications. Their disease courses were similar, with the younger sibling's being more severe. The older brother (IV-1) had normal development until exhibiting a spastic gait in his second year. The younger brother (IV-2) never ambulated independently. At eight years of age, each developed progressive myoclonic epilepsy with stimulus-induced myoclonus associated with generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures. This was followed by progressive dysarthria, dysphagia, and motor degeneration, with the older sibling eventually losing his ability to ambulate. Both subsequently developed lower extremity weakness and distal muscle atrophy.</p>

        <p>IV-2 died at 13 years of age from pneumonia-related complications, and our evaluation was limited to other physician's notes and genetic evaluation. IV-1's examination revealed spastic paraparesis in the lower extremities as well as appendicular dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, and ataxic dysarthria. He also had decreased muscle bulk and strength in his lower extremities. Additional findings included ptosis, oculomotor apraxia, dystonic movements, and stimulus-induced myoclonus. Fundoscopic and ophthalmological exams were unremarkable. His cognition was normal. In addition, both parents were without neurological complaints and had normal neurological and ophthalmological exams.</p>
        <p>Diagnostic testing of IV-1 revealed multiple abnormalities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002325-t001">Table 1</xref>). Brain MRI without contrast revealed moderate cerebellar atrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Nerve conduction studies showed an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy affecting his lower extremities, and sural nerve biopsy revealed mild âonion bulbingâ suggestive of a mild chronic demyelinating/remyelinating process. Muscle biopsy histology by light microscopy was within normal limits and without ragged red fibers; however, transmission electron microscopy revealed misplaced mitochondria associated with large lipid droplets. Muscle samples also had decreased mtDNA copy number. Finally, an electroencephalogram was consistent with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002325-t001">Table 1</xref>). His parents underwent a less extensive evaluation. Parental nerve conduction studies were normal.

        <p>Since prior genetic testing had not yielded a diagnosis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we performed WES to search for pathogenic DNA variants <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Individual nucleotide variants were evaluated and filtered using several methods including their presence or absence in dbSNP, segregation analysis, and the estimation of pathogenic potential using amino-acid conservation programs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002325.s002">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002325.s003">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002325.s004">S3</xref>)<xref rid="pgen.1002325-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. An average of 8585 missense and 87 nonsense changes were identified in each family member tested. The presence of consanguinity and the fact that the parents appeared largely asymptomatic suggested that the patients would likely be homozygous for any disease-causing mutations, and therefore a homozygous autosomal-recessive model was applied. Final analysis yielded two variant-containing candidate genes that fulfilled our selection criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002325.s004">Table S3</xref>). One candidate gene, <italic>DMGDH</italic>, encoding dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (MIM #605850), was previously associated with a syndrome of elevated serum creatine kinase and an unusual fish-like body odor <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Moolenaar1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Binzak1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Because the brothers had the features of a cerebellar ataxia, we considered the homozygous <italic>AFG3L2</italic> mutation to be the more likely cause of the siblings' disorder. This variant consisted of a c.1847A&gt;G mutation in exon 15, which resulted in the missense change, p.Y616C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This tyrosine residue is located at the beginning of the proteolytic domain and is highly conserved among vertebrates, including mouse, chicken, frog, lizard, and stickleback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g001">Figure 1C</xref>)<xref rid="pgen.1002325-MarchlerBauer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>

        <title>AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> is functionally impaired, but retains ATPase and proteolytic activities</title>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that yeast is a useful model system to assess the functional activity of human <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases and to investigate in detail the pathogenic mechanisms of mutations in <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease subunits <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Bonn1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases are evolutionarily conserved, with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> possessing only hetero-oligomeric <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease complexes composed of Yta10 and Yta12 subunits. These proteins can be substituted with the human orthologues in order to study their respective chemistries. Yeast cells lacking Yta10 and Yta12 (Î<italic>yta10</italic>Î<italic>yta12</italic> cells) are incapable of proteolytically processing the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein MrpL32, a component of mitochondrial ribosomes. Impaired ribosome assembly in the absence of the <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease abolishes the synthesis of mitochondrial-encoded respiratory chain subunits and impairs aerobic respiration <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Nolden1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Thus, the activity of <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases in yeast cells can be monitored either directly, by western blot analysis of the conversion of MrpL32 from its precursor to its mature form, or indirectly, by assessing respiratory growth on non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Bonn1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Koppen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>

<italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases form hexameric complexes <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Two isoforms can be distinguished in human mitochondria: a homo-oligomeric form comprised of AFG3L2 subunits and a hetero-oligomeric form containing AFG3L2 and paraplegin subunits in equimolar ratios. We examined the functional activity of AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> in the context of both isoenzymes. Expression of only human AFG3L2 in Î<italic>yta10</italic>Î<italic>yta12</italic> cells restores maturation of MrpL32 and respiratory growth on glycerol-containing media, demonstrating functional conservation of yeast and homo-oligomeric human <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Bonn1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Koppen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Remarkably, expression of AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> impaired processing of MrpL32 in comparison to cells harboring AFG3L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

        <p>Respiratory growth of yeast cells and MrpL32 processing depend on both ATPase and proteolytic activities of the <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease. Mutations of the Walker A site of AFG3L2's AAA domain (K354A) or within its proteolytic center (E575Q) inactivated the homo-oligomeric protease and abolished respiratory growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In order to directly monitor both activities of the AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> variant, we exploited our previous observation that functional deficiencies in individual domains of <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease subunits can be complemented by the presence of wild-type domains in other subunits of the assembled <italic>m</italic>-AAA ring complexes <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Augustin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In other words, assembled <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease complexes composed of wild-type and inactive mutant subunits are functionally active <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Augustin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Co-expression of AFG3L2 with AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> in Î<italic>yta10</italic>Î<italic>yta12</italic> cells substantially increased MrpL32 processing and respiratory growth when compared to cells expressing only AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). MrpL32 processing and respiratory growth of Î<italic>yta10</italic>Î<italic>yta12</italic> cells were restored to a similar extent upon co-expression of AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> with either of the two inactive AFG3L2 variants (AFG3L2<sup>K354A</sup> or AFG3L2<sup>E575Q</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). As the AFG3L2<sup>K354A</sup> and AFG3L2<sup>E575Q</sup> subunits lack ATPase and proteolytic activity, respectively, and are functionally inactive as homo-oligomeric complexes, the significantly improved MrpL32 processing and respiratory growth upon co-expression with AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> indicates intersubunit complementation of both ATPase and proteolytic activities <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Augustin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
        <p>These experiments demonstrate that homo-oligomeric <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease complexes composed of AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> subunits are functionally impaired, but retain both ATPase and proteolytic activities. We conclude that AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> is not a loss-of-function mutant, but appears to be hypomorphic. This is in striking contrast to AFG3L2 mutations causing SCA28 that fail to process MrpL32 and do not promote respiratory growth in Î<italic>yta10</italic>Î<italic>yta12</italic> cells <xref rid="pgen.1002325-DiBella1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>

The interpretation of these experiments, however, is complex, since AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> may self-assemble and/or co-assemble with paraplegin. Thus, it cannot be distinguished whether respiratory growth is maintained by homo-oligomeric AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> complexes or by hetero-oligomeric <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases composed of AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> and paraplegin.</p>
        <p>We therefore introduced a point mutation in the proteolytic domains of AFG3L2 (AFG3L2<sup>E575Q</sup>) and AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> (AFG3L2<sup>Y616C/E575Q</sup>). This mutation renders each variant of AFG3L2 proteolytically inactive and abolishes their ability to restore respiratory growth of Î<italic>yta10</italic>Î<italic>yta12</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Bonn1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Koppen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, when AFG3L2<sup>E575Q</sup> and paraplegin were co-expressed in Î<italic>yta10</italic>Î<italic>yta12</italic> cells, respiratory growth was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Bonn1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Koppen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This is due to paraplegin, which is unable to self-assemble, forming hetero-oligomeric complexes with AFG3L2<sup>E575Q</sup>; in this context, paraplegin provides the proteolytic activity within the <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease ring complexes through intersubunit complementation <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Koppen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Augustin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

After destaining, the membrane was used for immunoblotting using AFG3L2- or SPG7-specific antibodies. The outer membrane protein Tom40 was used as a loading control.

        <p>To further substantiate these results, mitoplasts (isolated mitochondria without their outer membranes) were prepared from primary skin fibroblasts from family members and used to test the stability of AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup>, as well as its assembly into homo-oligomeric or hetero-oligomeric <italic>m</italic>-AAA complexes. AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> and paraplegin are present at normal levels in patient fibroblasts both in the soluble and pellet fractions, demonstrating that the mutation does not affect the solubility or the stability of the AFG3L2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, BN-PAGE analysis of the same mitoplast preparations showed a reduced amount of assembled AFG3L2-containing complexes in fibroblasts of patient IV-1; moreover, hetero-oligomeric complexes harboring paraplegin were drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Consistent with these findings, the heterozygous parents displayed intermediate levels of assembled complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002325-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, these results are not due to abnormal trafficking of AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup>, as this variant's targeting to mitochondria was not impaired when overexpressed in cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002325.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that the primary pathogenic process of AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> involves impaired oligomerization with itself and paraplegin, leading to remarkably low levels of functionally active <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease complexes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study links an early onset spastic-ataxia-neuropathy syndrome to a unique homozygous mutation in <italic>AFG3L2</italic> in the absence of any associated <italic>SPG7</italic> mutations. Studies in yeast and patient fibroblasts reveal that the AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> mutant is a hypomorphic variant with reduced respiratory capability. This reduction is a consequence of its impaired ability to undergo oligomerization with itself or, in an even more pronounced manner, with paraplegin. Recent experiments with yeast <italic>m</italic>-AAA orthologues indicate a crucial role of the proteolytic domains for protease assembly. Interestingly, within a structural model of <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases, the Y616 residue is in close proximity to amino acids that determine hetero-oligomerization of the yeast orthologue and prevent its homo-oligomerization <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Nevertheless, further interpretations regarding why the Y616C mutation has its specific effects on AFG3L2 and paraplegin oligomerization are difficult to make without the availability of crystal structures for both homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes. In the homozygous context of our patients, the reduced levels of homo-oligomeric <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases and the almost complete absence of hetero-oligomeric <italic>m</italic>-AAA isoenzymes explain the striking combination of clinical features of both SPG7 and SCA28, including spastic paraplegia, ptosis, and cerebellar ataxia <xref rid="pgen.1002325-DiBella1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Cagnoli1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Casari1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Cagnoli2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>These features could have been anticipated by the phenotype of transgenic <italic>Afg3l2</italic>

<sup>-/-</sup> mice, whose similarly reduced dosage of m-AAA activity produced a comparable syndrome. Our genetic and biochemical findings were consistent with these transgenic mouse models of <italic>m</italic>-AAA dysfunction and indicate a critical role for the dosage of <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease activity in the maintenance of neuronal functions. Homo- and hetero-oligomeric <italic>m</italic>-AAA isoenzymes exhibit overlapping activities and can partially substitute for each other <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Koppen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; however as seen in <italic>Afg3l2</italic>

AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup>, whose assembly with paraplegin is impaired, may lead to an effective loss of paraplegin function in the patients as paraplegin is unable to self-assemble and requires oligomerization with AFG3L2 for function. Mutations in this region of AFG3L2 may create a similar combined effect, as seen in <italic>Afg3l2</italic>

<italic>Spg7</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> mice, of <italic>Spg7</italic> deletion and <italic>Afg3l2</italic> heterozygosity, i.e., the loss of hetero-oligomeric <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases containing paraplegin combined with reduced levels of functional AFG3L2. The end result would be decreased total <italic>m</italic>-AAA activity in affected neural cells producing a combined SCA28/SPG7 phenotype.</p>
      <p>Our patients also exhibit additional neurological findings seen in other mitochondrial disorders, including oculomotor apraxia, dystonia, and progressive myotonic epilepsy <xref rid="pgen.1002325-McFarland1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The presence of these mitochondrial symptoms is consistent with the known function of AFG3L2 and paraplegin in mitochondrial respiration. Specifically, these proteins' involvement in mitochondrial quality control, i.e., the removal of misfolded or damaged mitochondrial proteins and activation of proteins that are essential for aerobic respiration <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Tatsuta1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Dystonia was previously observed in a family whose affected members carried an 18p chromosomal deletion that included <italic>AFG3L2</italic>

<sup>+/-</sup>
<italic>Spg7</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> mice means these mice were not an exact phenocopy; however, this may be due to the compensatory effects of an additional murine <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease subunit, Afg3l1, which has overlapping activities with Afg3l2 <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Koppen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002325-Kremmidiotis1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Overall, it is likely that decreased <italic>m</italic>-AAA dosage in regions of the CNS usually unaffected by SCA28 or SPG7 are the cause of these features, but in a consanguineous family it is important to remember other genes may be modifying the phenotype.</p>
      <p>Yeast complementation studies help explain the phenotypes of all the members of our patients' family. In the proband's cells, assembled <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases were present at decreased levels. In this respect, the <italic>AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup></italic> mutation behaved much differently as compared to the previously described loss-of-function <italic>AFG3L2</italic> variants associated with dominant SCA28 <xref rid="pgen.1002325-DiBella1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The decreased, but present, functional activity of AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> likely explains the lack of an obvious clinical phenotype in the heterozygous parents of the affected patients. In their cells, the combined expression of both the AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> and wild-type alleles appears to provide a sufficient amount of <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease activity to overcome a theoretical threshold for cerebellar disease. That threshold is likely greater than 50% of normal activity, because most heterozygotes for loss-of-function <italic>AFG3L2</italic> mutations are symptomatic. However, it should be recognized that previously reported SCA28 patients had late-onset cerebellar ataxia and, although the brain MRI of our proband's father was within normal limits, the mother had asymptomatic, mild cerebellar atrophy. This result indicates that it remains to be seen whether any family member heterozygous for <italic>AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup></italic> will develop neurological dysfunction later in life.</p>
      <p>Analysis of the AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> mutation identified here, together with data from transgenic mice and patients with either SCA28 or SPG7, link a spectrum of neurological phenotypes to specific mutations in <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease subunits. This spectrum includes: homozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>SPG7</italic> resulting in the absence of hetero-oligomeric <italic>m</italic>-AAA isoenzymes (associated with SPG7); heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>AFG3L2</italic> decreasing the dosage of both homo- and hetero-oligomeric forms of the <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases (associated with SCA28); and homozygous AFG3L2<sup>Y616C</sup> mutations also affecting both isoforms and further reducing the residual cellular <italic>m</italic>-AAA protease activity (associated with the early-onset spastic ataxia-neuropathy syndrome described here). Other genetic combinations of defective subunits could also cause neurological dysfunction, with decreased dosage of <italic>m</italic>-AAA activity resulting from various mixtures of heterozygous or homozygous mutations in <italic>AFG3L2</italic> and/or <italic>SPG7</italic>. The inheritance could appear to be either autosomal recessive and/or dominant indicating that genetic testing of <italic>AFG3L2</italic> and <italic>SPG7</italic> in any individuals with spastic ataxia, whether or not mitochondrial symptoms are present, may identify additional patients with <italic>m-</italic>AAA-related neurological disease.</p>
      <p>Although the presently described syndrome shares features with SCA28 and prominent spasticity clearly extends the phenotypic spectrum associated with <italic>AFG3L2</italic> mutations, it appears different from SCA28 in several ways, specifically: 1) much earlier onset of symptoms, 2) spastic paraplegia as the earliest and predominant feature, and 3) presence of a peripheral neuropathy. As SCA28 is also identified with autosomal dominant inheritance, we feel that the current syndrome is distinct and should be classified separately as an AFG3L2-associated spastic-ataxia-neuropathy syndrome. With the identification of other patients with similar phenotypes we may be able to delineate the consistent and variable features of AFG3L2-related disorders and whether other mutations in <italic>AFG3L2</italic> and <italic>SPG7</italic> will only cause a spastic-ataxia-neuropathy syndrome or consistently produce an expanded âPME-spastic-ataxia-neuropathyâ syndrome.</p>
