        <p>Human RAD51 protein catalyzes DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions that are central to homologous recombination and homology-directed DNA repair. Successful recombination/repair requires the formation of a presynaptic filament of RAD51 on ssDNA. Mutations in BRCA2 and other proteins that control RAD51 activity are associated with human cancer. Here we describe a set of mutations associated with human breast tumors that occur in a common structural motif of RAD51. Tumor-associated D149N, R150Q and G151D mutations map to a Schellman loop motif located on the surface of the RecA homology domain of RAD51. All three variants are proficient in DNA strand exchange, but G151D is slightly more sensitive to salt than wild-type (WT). Both G151D and R150Q exhibit markedly lower catalytic efficiency for adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis compared to WT. All three mutations alter the physical properties of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments, with G151D showing the most dramatic changes. G151D forms mixed nucleoprotein filaments with WT RAD51 that have intermediate properties compared to unmixed filaments. These findings raise the possibility that mutations in RAD51 itself may contribute to genome instability in tumor cells, either directly through changes in recombinase properties, or indirectly through changes in interactions with regulatory proteins.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Human RAD51 protein is a RecA-like DNA strand transferase that catalyzes the central reactions of homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange in the homologous recombination (HR) and homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways. Given the crucial roles played by HR in distinctive cellular genome stability processes, a linkage between HR dysfunction and cancer phenotype is now clear and widely accepted (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The causal relationship between RAD51 abnormalities and cancer, however, is poorly understood.</p>
      <p>Elevated expression of RAD51 protein has been observed in a wide variety of cancers suggesting that overexpression of RAD51 confers advantages to tumor cells (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Increased RAD51 expression was found in invasive ductal breast cancer and the level of overexpression correlated directly with the histological grading of the tumor (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). As HR machinery components have now become crucial targets for cancer treatment, there is a widely observed correlation between expression levels of RAD51 and resistance to therapeutic drugs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). High RAD51 expression was also reported in malignant prostate and small cell lung cancers (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Conversely, the expression of RAD51, as well as BRCA1, is reduced in almost one third of breast tumor cell lines and primary sporadic breast cancer cells (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Consistent with the drug resistance of the cancer cells conferred by the overexpression of RAD51, down-regulation of RAD51 also increased the radio-sensitivity of prostate cancer cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and malignant glioma cells (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Although the mechanism and significance of such deregulation of RAD51 remains speculative, a basal level of RAD51 activity appears to be kept in an elaborate balance to ensure appropriate functionality of RAD51-dependent HR in specific contexts.</p>
      <p>Another approach to assess the risk of carcinogenesis associated with RAD51 is to explore naturally occurring <italic>RAD51</italic> polymorphisms across the population. An early study conducted in Japanese hereditary breast cancer patients found 2 out of 45 patients contained a RAD51âR150Q variant that is absent among 200 sporadic breast cancer or 100 colon cancer cases, which suggested this site could be a disease-associated mutation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, the same mutation was missed in a screen conducted in 46 well-characterized <italic>brca1/2</italic>-negative breast cancer families (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A single-nucleotide variant affecting the 5â²-untranslated region of <italic>RAD51</italic> was shown to increase breast cancer risk in carriers of mutant <italic>brca2</italic> alleles but not in non-carriers (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Meanwhile, two different single-nucleotide variants affecting intron regions of <italic>RAD51</italic> were shown to increase cancer risk in carriers of mutations in the <italic>BLM</italic> gene (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In addition to the BRCA2 and BLM proteins, RAD51 interacts directly or indirectly with other key players in tumorigenesis including p53, PALB2, BRCA1 and Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)Â (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that mutations affecting RAD51 activity or its interactions with other HR/HDR machinery could contribute to genomic instability and the generation of tumorigenic mutations.</p>
      <p>Despite extensive studies of human RAD51, there are few reports on the basic biochemical behavior of tumor-associated variants. The molecular properties of RAD51 protein include ssDNA- and dsDNA-binding activities, ssDNA-stimulated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and ATP-dependent pairing and exchange of homologous ssDNA/dsDNA segments (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The enzymatic activities of RAD51 are activated upon its assembly into a right-handed, helical presynaptic filament on ssDNA. The RAD51 presynaptic filament is a dynamic nucleoprotein structure that undergoes allosteric transitions in response to ATP binding and hydrolysis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The ATP-bound form of the filament, considered to be the active form, has a high helical pitch of 90â130Ã and contains ssDNA that is significantly stretched (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The ADP-bound form of the filament, considered to be the inactive form, has a low helical pitch of 65â85Ã. In addition to regulation by the ATPase cycle, presynaptic filament dynamics are regulated by mediator proteins including BRCA2 and RAD51 paralogs, by DNA helicases and motor proteins including BLM and RAD54, and likely by signaling proteins and post-translational modifications (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
      <p>As new genetic determinants of cancer are continually identified, it is striking that many involve mutations affecting proteins that are regulators of RAD51, or even act directly as mediators of RAD51-catalyzed reactions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Evidence for direct linkages between RAD51 variants and cancer is still limited, however. One limitation is that most RAD51 mutations reported to date are located in the non-coding regions of its gene, due to the low penetrance of RAD51 missense mutations (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Here we report two novel, breast tumor-associated mutations in the coding sequence of RAD51 protein, D149N and G151D, which map adjacent to the previously described mutation R150Q that was associated with bilateral breast cancer (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). All of these mutations alter RAD51 physical properties, and two of them affect RAD51 catalytic properties <italic>in vitro</italic>. All three of the variants map to a conserved structural motif on the surface of the RAD51 filament that may participate in regulatory interactions with other molecules. The results suggest that mutations in RAD51 protein could play important roles in carcinogenesis and tumor progression.</p>

One of the mutations, G151D, resulted in altering Gly at position 151 to Asp (ggt to gat). It was found in an African American premenopausal woman who had local radiation failure. The type of breast cancer was unknown. The second mutation, D149N, resulted in altering Asp at position 149 to Asn (gac to aac). It was found in a premenopausal Caucasian woman with triple negative breast cancer. G151D was heterozygous; D149N was homozygous. Both mutations occur at positions adjacent to a previously reported R150Q mutation that was found in patients with bilateral breast cancer (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).

        <title>Structural context of tumor-associated mutations in RAD51 protein</title>
        <p>The three mutations D149N, R150Q and G151D occur in the highly conserved RecA homology domain of RAD51. This domain contains the catalytic core of RAD51 protein including Walker A and B consensus sequences for ATP binding and hydrolysis, single- and double-stranded DNA binding surfaces (loops L1 and L2), polymerization motifs and recognition sites for other recombination factors and regulators including tumor suppressor proteins BRCA2, PALB2 and p53 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The three mutations occur within the sequence PIDRGG from positions 147 to 152, a motif that is highly conserved in Rad51 proteins from yeast to humans (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This sequence forms a Schellman loop (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) that connects the C-terminus of Î±-helix 1 to the N-terminus of Î²-strand 2 in the RecA homology domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The Schellman loop is seen in X-ray crystallographic structures of both monomeric human RAD51 core domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and filamentous yeast Rad51 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>-B) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and it forms a prominent surface feature of both the monomer and filament. The average B-factor for the Schellman loop region is 13.47, which is lower than the overall value (21.10) for the RAD51 monomer (Supplementary Figure S1). Therefore, the motif in which the three tumor-associated mutations occur has rather low freedom of movement, indicating that its position in RAD51 structure is relatively conservative.</p>

In the structure of the yeast Rad51 filament, the Schellman loop is found on the outer filament surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). It is distant from the filament interface and thus from the active site for ATP binding and hydrolysis, which spans the interface and involves residues from adjacent subunits (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). It is also distant from DNA binding loops L1 and L2, which line the inner surface of the helical filament (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p>
        <p>All three of the tumor-associated mutations alter the local surface electrostatic properties of RAD51. The D149N, R150Q and G151D mutations change the net charge on RAD51 by +1, â1 and â1 units, respectively. The D149N mutation significantly increases the electropositive character of the surface created by the Schellman loop (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In contrast, both R150Q and G151D mutations significantly increase the electronegative character of the same region of the protein surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Each of these changes, when propagated throughout a RAD51 filament, might be expected to alter interactions of the filament with solvent, ions or protein partners.</p>

        <title>Folding and stability of RAD51 variant proteins</title>
        <p>Recombinant RAD51 variant proteins D149N, R150Q and G151D were expressed and purified, and their biochemical properties were compared to those of WT RAD51 protein. The folding and stability of RAD51 variants were assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and partial proteolysis. CD spectra of RAD51 WT, D149N and R150Q obtained in the presence and absence of ATP were essentially identical (Supplementary Figure S2A and B), therefore these variants share the same overall fold as WT. The G151D CD spectra were also similar in shape and amplitude to that of WT, but there were subtle differences. In the absence of ATP, the G151D spectrum was red-shifted by approximately 2 nm in the 190â222 nm region (Supplementary Figure S2A). This effect was also seen in the presence of 1 mM ATP, and a minimum at â¼208 nm became slightly more pronounced (Supplementary Figure S2B). One possible interpretation of this result is that the G151D mutation extends the helical turn portion of the Schellman loop, and that this adds helical character to the CD spectra. Such an effect is not reflected in the numerical analysis of the CD spectra, however, which revealed no significant changes in Î±-helical composition between WT and all three mutant forms of RAD51, independent of ATP (Supplementary Table S1). It seems probable that changes in the secondary structure of the Schellman loop trigger other minor changes in secondary structure without affecting the overall protein fold.</p>
        <p>Protein thermal stability was monitored by recording the change in molar ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature from 10â80Â°C (Supplementary Figure S2C). No significant changes in thermal stability were observed between the three variants and WT. Similar results were obtained using urea rather than heat as the denaturant (data not shown). Limited trypsinolysis of RAD51 WT and variants produced nearly identical fragment patterns (Supplementary Figure S3). In all cases, addition of a nucleotide ligand (ATP, ADP or ATPÎ³S) caused the appearance of additional bands at â¼15 and â¼31 kDa. Taken together, the CD and partial proteolysis data indicate that the three tumor-associated variants are folded and stable.</p>

In contrast, the activity of D149N was similar to WT at saturating ATP. Neither WT nor any of the variants showed any sign of ATP-induced cooperativity. Therefore a standard MichealisâMenten model was used to fit the data. Values for the kinetic parameters are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>. The data indicate that the R150Q and G151D mutations decrease the turnover rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) by nearly 2-fold compared to WT, while the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for ATP increases by 3- to 4-fold. The combination of these effects leads to a catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) for ATP hydrolysis that is reduced by 6- to 7-fold for R150Q and G151D compared to WT (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of D149N for ATP is identical to that of WT, and its turnover and catalytic efficiency parameters are within 90% of WT (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>).</p>

        <p>We considered the possibility that the ATPase defects seen in R150Q and G151D could be caused by inefficient binding to ssDNA. Therefore in the experiments in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> the ATP concentration was held at a constant, saturating level and the concentration of ssDNA was varied. The ATPase activity of WT RAD51 exhibits a ssDNA concentration optimum, above which the reaction velocity declines with increasing ssDNA concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Furthermore, all three of the RAD51 variants have their highest ATPase activities at the same ssDNA concentration as WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This rules out the possibility that the observed differences in kinetic parameters between R150Q, G151D and WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>) are caused by inefficient binding of the variants to ssDNA, since additional ssDNA does not compensate for the defect. Note that unlike WT and the other two variants, the ATPase activity of G151D appears to be independent of ssDNA at low concentrations of ssDNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This suggests that G151D maintains a higher-than-normal constitutive ATPase activity that is relatively insensitive to further activation by ssDNA.</p>

        <title>DNA strand exchange properties of RAD51 variants</title>
        <p>The D149N, R150Q and G151D variants are all proficient in DNA strand exchange (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

        <title>Properties of RAD51 variant nucleoprotein complexes</title>
        <p>In the presence of ATP, variant proteins D149N, R150Q and G151D all form filaments on single-stranded DNA that resemble those formed by WT RAD51, as shown by electron microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">D</xref>). The micrographs show that all four versions of RAD51 are capable of saturating M13mp18 ssDNA circles under the low-salt conditions used to form and fix complexes for EM imaging. The filaments all exhibit the zigzag pattern that is characteristic of helical RAD51âDNA filaments. Qualitatively, we noted that filaments formed by WT and D149N tended to appear segmented and stiff (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">B</xref>), while those formed by G151D (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>) and to an intermediate extent R150Q (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) tended to appear as smooth coils.

        <p>The D149N, R150Q and G151D mutations have different and dramatic effects on the electrophoretic mobility of nucleoprotein complexes formed by RAD51 in the presence of ATP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). At a protein concentration that is approximately stoichiometric with respect to DNA concentration (1 protomer per 3 nucleotide residues), WT RAD51âssDNA complexes migrate in two distinct fractions with high and low electrophoretic mobility (HM and LM, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, lane 2). The same pattern is seen with D149NâssDNA, but the mobilities of both HM and LM fractions are decreased compared to WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, lane 4). With R150QâssDNA, nearly all of the complexes migrate in the HM fraction, which has slightly higher mobility than the WT equivalent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, lane 3). Similar behavior was noted for R150QâDNA complexes in a previous study (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). G151DâssDNA complexes appear to migrate exclusively in the HM fraction, which has much higher electrophoretic mobility than the WT equivalent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, lane 5).</p>
        <p>Binding of RAD51 WT and variants to duplex DNA in the presence of ATP results in single smeared bands rather than the LM and HM species observed with ssDNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). However, differences between variants and WT follow the same pattern seen with ssDNA: D149NâdsDNA migrates slower than the WT complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, lane 9); R150QâdsDNA migrates faster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, lane 8) and G151DâdsDNA migrates much faster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, lane 10).</p>
        <p>Differences in the electrophoretic mobilities of RAD51 variantâDNA complexes could be explained by differences in filament electrostatic properties, stiffness, stability or a combination of these factors. Formation of WT, D149N and R150Q complexes on ssDNA and dsDNA show similar dependencies on protein concentration in the presence of ATP, ADP or no nucleotide (Supplementary Figure S4). The same may be true for G151DâssDNA, although the trend is harder to see because of the small difference in electrophoretic mobility between G151DâssDNA and naked ssDNA (Supplementary Figure S4). The magnitude of the ssDNA mobility shift increases steadily with increasing G151D concentration in the presence of ADP or ATP, and the complexes form tight bands, not smears (Supplementary Figure S4B and C). G151DâdsDNA complex formation appears to require ATP (Supplementary Figure S4DâF), and mobility shift is only observed at higher G151D concentrations (Supplementary Figure S4F). Collectively, the electrophoretic mobility shift data indicate that, with the possible exception of G151DâdsDNA interactions, differences in the electrophoretic properties of RAD51 variantâDNA complexes are not driven by large differences in DNA binding affinity. This general conclusion is supported by other observations including: (i) variants including G151D can saturate long ssDNA molecules by forming continuous filaments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6BâD</xref>), (ii) maximum ATPase rates of variants and WT occur at the same ssDNA/protein ratio (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and (iii) Variant strand exchange activities approach those of WT in the presence of RPA (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), indicating that all variants compete effectively with RPA for binding sites on ssDNA.</p>

        <title>Variants can form mixed filaments with WT RAD51</title>
        <p>Variants D149N, R150Q and G151D all interact with WT RAD51 protein as shown in yeast two-hybrid experiments (Supplementary Figure S5). This suggests that variants could form mixed filaments with WT RAD51 on DNA. We tested this possibility using the G151D variant, which shows the greatest difference from WT in EMSA assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In the presence of ATP, complexes formed with 20 Î¼M ssDNA and a 4 + 4 Î¼M mixture of G151D and WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lane 4) have an electrophoretic mobility that is intermediate between the complex formed with 20 Î¼M ssDNA plus 8 Î¼M G151D alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lane 3) and the complex formed with 20 Î¼M ssDNA plus 8 Î¼M WT alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lane 2). Note that all of the ssDNA in the mixed experiment undergoes an intermediate mobility shift (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lane 4). In the case where ssDNA is saturated with G151D and increasing amounts of WT are added (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lanes, 5â9), we observe that WT can partially replace G151D to generate complexes with intermediate electrophoretic mobility. Note again that, at the lower concentrations of WT RAD51 added, all or most of the ssDNA undergoes an intermediate mobility shift even though the total protein concentration is above stochiometric for binding sites on ssDNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lanes 6â7). The same behavior is observed with duplex DNA, where mixtures of G151D and WT RAD51 form complexes with intermediate electrophoretic mobility (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, lanes 13 and 15â18). The data demonstrate that the binding of G151D does not exclude WT RAD51 binding to the same DNA molecule or <italic>vice versa</italic>. Combined with the yeast two-hybrid data (Supplementary Figure S5), and with strand exchange data for the G151D/WT mixture in high salt (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), these results strongly argue that RAD51 variants can incorporate into filaments along with WT to form nucleoprotein filaments with altered properties. This finding may be significant for understanding the behavior of RAD51 variants in the heterozygous state in cancer cells, as occurs in the case of G151D.</p>

        <title>Significance of mutations in RAD51 versus its regulators</title>
        <p>Tumor-associated variants of human RAD51 protein, D149N, R150Q and G151D, are proficient in DNA strand exchange activity but have altered physical and biochemical properties. Given the location of these mutations on the surface of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments, they are candidates to affect the regulation of RAD51, or the coordination of its activities with other DNA recombination/repair proteins. In normal human cells, recombination events promoted by RAD51 protein are closely regulated to prevent genotoxic effects caused by inappropriate crossovers, break-induced replication and loss of heterozygosity (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Cancer cells frequently exhibit dysfunctional regulation of HR, which may be linked to somatic or germ-line mutations in proteins that regulate RAD51, such as BRCA2, PALB2, BLM, p53 and others (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These factors interact with RAD51 to regulate the assembly, activity and turnover of RAD51âDNA nucleoprotein filaments. It is reasonable to conclude that mutations in RAD51 that affect its interactions with regulatory molecules may be just as deleterious as mutations in the regulators themselves. In many cases the target for regulation is the RAD51âDNA <italic>filament</italic>, therefore signals from regulatory molecules must be transmitted throughout the filament. For this reason, mutations that affect endogenous signaling within the filament may be just as deleterious as mutations that affect signaling by exogenous regulators of RAD51. It is intriguing that the three variants described in this work alter properties of RAD51 filaments that could affect either endogenous or exogenous signaling, or both.</p>

        <title>Potential effects of RAD51 mutations on exogenous signaling</title>
        <p>The remarkable occurrence of D149N, R150Q and G151D mutations in the same Schellman loop motif means that each mutation alters what is a prominent feature of the surface of the RAD51 filament (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Each mutation affects the local electrostatic properties of the filament surface, with D149N more electropositive, and R150Q and G151D more electronegative than WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The mutations occur on the outer filament surface, where they could disrupt interactions with other recombination proteins and regulators. One candidate is tumor suppressor protein p53, which was reported to interact directly with RAD51 and to negatively regulate its DNA pairing activity (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). RAD51 peptides containing residues 175â190 were shown to bind to p53 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In the X-ray crystallographic structure of the RAD51 core domainâBRC4 complex (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), the side chain of Arg-150 interacts with this site via a hydrogen bond to the backbone of residue Tyr-178 (Supplementary Figure S6). This raises the possibility that mutations affecting Arg-150 or its neighbors in the Schellman loop motif could affect regulatory interactions between RAD51 and p53. The Schellman loop motif is not directly involved in binding to BRCA2 via its BRC repeats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Supplementary Figure S6), or to PALB2 which is reported to interact with residues 184â257 of RAD51 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) (Supplementary Figure S6). This does not rule out an indirect effect of mutations in the Schellman loop on interactions with these tumor suppressor proteins, however.</p>

        <title>Tumor-associated mutations alter physical properties of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments</title>
        <p>Changes in the electrostatic surface potentials of the D149N, R150Q and G151D variants correlate with changes in the physical properties of their nucleoprotein filaments on both ssDNA and dsDNA. Complexes containing the more electropositive D149N variant exhibit reduced electrophoretic mobility, while those containing the more electronegative variants R150Q and G151D exhibit increased electrophoretic mobility compared to WT complexes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The latter two mutations may also relax filament stiffness (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">D</xref>). Decreased stiffness and a more negative charge could explain the relatively rapid migration of G151DâDNA and R150QâDNA complexes through agarose gels. In cells, the altered electrostatic and hydrodynamic properties of RAD51 variants could impact a variety of biophysical processes including the formation and resolution of RAD51 foci in response to DNA damage, the turnover of nucleoprotein filaments by helicases and other functions that involve the physical manipulation of RAD51 filaments.</p>

        <title>Mutations at distant sites alter endogenous signaling in RAD51 filaments</title>
        <p>The DNA-stimulated ATPase cycle is the major pathway of endogenous signaling in RAD51 filaments. The nucleotide-bound status of the active site affects DNA binding and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Greater electronegative character in the Schellman loop region also correlates with changes in this activity, since both R150Q and G151D variants exhibit lower affinity for ATP, slower turnover and markedly reduced catalytic efficiency for ATP hydrolysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Our findings about R150Q appear to differ from those of a previous study, which found no difference in the ATPase activities of R150Q and WT RAD51 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However ATPase experiments in the earlier study were performed using an excess concentration of ssDNA, conditions in which WT and R150Q have very similar activities in our experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Furthermore we observe that the DNA strand exchange activity of G151D appears to be slightly more salt-sensitive than WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We conclude that mutations affecting the surface properties of RAD51âDNA filaments can affect reactions at distant active sites. This makes sense for a system that is allosteric in nature and dependent on filament formation for catalytic activity. Our findings suggest that computational approaches designed to identify deleterious variants based on non-conservative mutations in known functional motifs are likely to miss important mutations in RAD51 and perhaps many other allosteric proteins.</p>

        <title>Biochemical defects of the RAD51âG151D variant</title>
        <p>Of the three variants examined, G151D stands out as the one most different from WT, both in terms of its biochemical properties and in its potential effects on the structure of the Schellman loop motif. Notably, G151D was detected as a somatic, heterozygous mutation in a patient with advanced breast cancer who had local radiation failure. While the G151D variant is folded and stable, features of its CD spectrum are consistent with subtle changes in secondary structure (Supplementary Figure S2A-B).</p>
        <p>In addition to its lower ATPase catalytic efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), G151D appears to have a significant DNA-independent ATPase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In WT RAD51, as in many recombinases of the RecA/Rad51 family, high-salt conditions induce a DNA-independent ATPase activity (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The data suggest that this activity is constitutively active in G151D, even at the low salt concentrations used in our ATPase assays. We speculate that the altered surface electrostatics of the G151D variant allow it to assume an ATPase-active conformation that would normally be induced via interactions with ions. Our finding that the DNA strand exchange activity of G151D is slightly more salt-sensitive than WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>) supports the notion that this variant responds differently to ions, possibly due to its more electronegative surface character.</p>
        <p>The extremely fast electrophoretic mobility of G151DâDNA relative to WTâDNA complexes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) is consistent with the added negative charge of G151D, multiplied by thousands of protomers coating each DNA molecule and with a possible decrease in filament stiffness caused by the G151D mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). The affinity of G151D for ssDNA does not appear to differ greatly from that of WT, since the variant is capable of completely covering ssDNA in electron micrographs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>), and since it catalyzes DNA strand exchange in the presence of RPA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), with which it must compete for binding sites on ssDNA.</p>

        <title>Implications for heterozygous RAD51 variants</title>
        <p>G151D interacts with WT RAD51 and forms mixed filaments with WT on both ssDNA and dsDNA (Supplementary Figure S5 and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The hybrid filaments have intermediate electrophoretic mobility and DNA strand exchange properties (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>-D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These findings indicate that in the heterozygous state in cells, as occurred in the breast tumor from which this variant was identified, G151D will co-localize with WT and form hybrid RAD51 foci, which may have altered HDR properties. The fact that D149N and R150Q variants also interact with WT RAD51 (Supplementary Figure S5) suggests that, if they were to occur in the heterozygous state <italic>in vivo</italic>, they too could form hybrid foci and potentially influence HDR processes.</p>

        <title>Conservation and divergence of the Schellman loop motif</title>
        <p>The Schellman loop motif is conserved at the levels of sequence and structure among Rad51 proteins from yeast to humans (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However charged residues Asp-149 and/or Arg-150 from human RAD51 are non-conservatively substituted in zebrafish, fruit fly and budding and fission yeast (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Therefore Rad51 filament surfaces in these organisms will have different electrostatic properties, which may lead to differences in filament dynamics or proteinâprotein interactions. In contrast, the loop region of human meiotic recombinase DMC1 consists of the simple sequence PGAGGY, which lacks charged/polar residues altogether (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This raises the possibility that differences in filament surface properties contribute to the functional divergence of DMC1 and RAD51 in meiotic recombination. The region of the Schellman loop appears to be important in archaeal Rad51 orthologs as well, since the structure of <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> RadA protein (PDB ID: 1PZN) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) reveals a modified Schellman loop motif in which a mini-helix containing two Glu residues is separated from Î±-helix 1 by an extra Pro residue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the work presented here demonstrates that tumor-associated variants in human RAD51 have functional phenotypes including changes in the physical properties of RAD51âDNA filaments, and changes in the catalytic activities of these filaments. These changes have the potential to affect the efficacy of HDR, and therefore could contribute to the genome instability of cancer cells.</p>
