      <abstract>
        <p>Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight accounts for 90% of the symptoms of premature skin aging and skin cancer. The tumor suppressor serine-threonine kinase <italic>LKB1</italic> is mutated in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and in a spectrum of epithelial cancers whose etiology suggests a cooperation with environmental insults. Here we analyzed the role of LKB1 in a UV-dependent mouse skin cancer model and show that <italic>LKB1</italic> haploinsufficiency is enough to impede UVB-induced DNA damage repair, contributing to tumor development driven by aberrant growth factor signaling. We demonstrate that LKB1 and its downstream kinase NUAK1 bind to CDKN1A. In response to UVB irradiation, LKB1 together with NUAK1 phosphorylates CDKN1A regulating the DNA damage response. Upon UVB treatment, <italic>LKB1</italic> or <italic>NUAK1</italic> deficiency results in CDKN1A accumulation, impaired DNA repair and resistance to apoptosis. Importantly, analysis of human tumor samples suggests that <italic>LKB1</italic> mutational status could be a prognostic risk factor for UV-induced skin cancer. Altogether, our results identify LKB1 as a DNA damage sensor protein regulating skin UV-induced DNA damage response.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Environmental insults are directly involved in cancer development. In particular, Ultraviolet (UV) radiation has been associated to the acquisition of different types skin cancer and premature skin aging. UV radiation causes modifications in the genetic material of cells (DNA) that if not repaired properly will lead to a mutated DNA (mutated genes) which might trigger the development of cancer. Understanding the molecular basis of the UV-induced DNA damage response is important to elucidate the mechanisms of skin homeostasis and tumorigenesis. Here we provide a UVB-induced skin cancer animal model showing that LKB1 tumor suppressor is also a DNA damage sensor. Importantly, the data suggest that reduced amounts of LKB1 protein in skin could be a risk factor for UV-induced skin carcinogenesis in humans.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation represents the number one leading cause for skin cancer. UV radiation can cause genetic mutations to DNA that if not repaired can lead to skin cancer. Elucidation of the mechanisms involved in UV-induced DNA damage response is important to understand the human disease, its treatment and prevention.</p>

      <p>Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) has an important role modulating DNA repair processes, inhibiting cell cycle progression and apoptosis. It competes for PCNA binding with several PCNA-reliant proteins that are directly involved in DNA repair processes including mismatch repair (MMR), base excision repair (BER) and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Bendjennat1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004721-Mortusewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Evidence also suggest that CDKN1A may regulate nucleotide excision repair (NER), although its exact role has been controversial <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Fotedar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It has been showed that CDKN1A is proteolytically degraded in response to low-dose UV radiation by a mechanism that requires the physical interaction of CDKN1A with PCNA <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Abbas1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Nishitani1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

        <p>Histopathological examination of mouse tumors revealed a remarkable similarity to lesions found in SCC patients. Human and mouse tumor SCC samples showed atypical proliferative keratinocytes forming irregular nests invading the stroma.

In agreement with the previously described role of LKB1 regulating CDKN1A expression <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Tiainen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Morton1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <italic>LKB1</italic> knockdown cells showed a significant decrease in the UVB-induced transcriptional regulation of CDKN1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, the total amounts of LKB1 decreased overtime in response to UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Accumulation of CDKN1A in response to UVB was also observed in mouse keratinocytes generated from <italic>Lkb1</italic>

We next investigated whether CDKN1A accumulation in <italic>LKB1</italic> knockdown cells interfered with the repair of the UVB-damaged DNA. A global genomic DNA repair assay <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Eller1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> showed that parental cells fully repair specific UVB-induced DNA damage 48 h after irradiation. However, two different clones of <italic>LKB1</italic> knockdown cells repaired 35% and 20% of CPDs and 6-4pps, respectively, at the same time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g002">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004721.s003">S3F</xref>). Thus, these new evidence support the role of LKB1 in UVB-induced DNA damage repair, regulating the amount of CDKN1A protein. Altogether, these data suggested that the UVB-induced DNA damage response mediated by CDKN1A stability and/or transcriptional regulation was compromised in the context of <italic>Lkb1</italic> haploinsufficiency.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, LKB1 and CDKN1A form part of the same immunocomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This association was also observed with the endogenous proteins at basal levels and in response to UVB radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g003">Figure 3D and E</xref>) and it appeared to be specific to CDKN1A since CDKN1B (p27), a related CDK inhibitor family member, did not bind to LKB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004721.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).

        <title>LKB1 and its downstream kinase NUAK1 phosphorylate CDKN1A</title>
        <p>Next, we investigated the functional consequences of this interaction and examined whether LKB1 was able to phosphorylate CDKN1A. <italic>In vitro</italic> kinase assays using recombinant His-LKB1/GST-STRADÎ±/GST-Mo25 heterotrimeric complex and recombinant human GST-CDKN1A demonstrated that LKB1 phosphorylates CDKN1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

However, sequence alignment analysis of mouse, rat and human CDKN1A revealed that Thr80 is not conserved in mouse and rat proteins. Instead, mouse and rat proteins exhibit a Serine at position 78 not existing in the human orthologue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004721.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether LKB1 or any of its downstream AMPK family kinases were involved in the regulation of mouse CDKN1A. Results showed that LKB1 only phosphorylates human CDKN1A at Thr80 and not mouse CDKN1A, however, NUAK1, a downstream kinase of LKB1, phosphorylated human CDKN1A at Thr146 and mouse CDKN1A at Ser78 and Thr141, the equivalent residues in human CDKN1A (Thr80 and Thr146, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Although, LKB1 <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation of human CDKN1A (0.32Â±0.08 pmol [<sup>32</sup>P]/pmol protein) was less efficient than phosphorylation of a known substrate such as AMPKÎ± (1,2Â±0.11 pmol [<sup>32</sup>P]/pmol protein), both, mouse and human CDKN1A were efficiently phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by NUAK1 (0.8Â±0.18 pmol [<sup>32</sup>P]/pmol protein and 0.9Â±1.2 pmol [<sup>32</sup>P]/pmol protein, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004721.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). We identified by mass spectrometry phosphorylation of Ser78 in endogenous CDKN1A upon UVB irradiation in mouse melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004721.s005">Figure S5D</xref>), Phosphorylation on Ser78 was significantly decreased in LKB1 depleted cells (30% <italic>vs.</italic> 1% of peptide phosphorylated respectively; p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004721.s005">Figure S5E</xref>).

        <title>Loss of LKB1 expression is an early event in human SCC</title>
        <p>To evaluate the relevance of LKB1 in human skin SCC we examined the expression of LKB1 by immunohistochemistry in 54 human skin SCC samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004721.s009">Table S1</xref>). Samples were comprised of anatomical localizations compatible with UV-exposed and non-UV-exposed regions. Roughly 50% of the samples showed either very low or no staining for LKB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g007">Figure 7A and B</xref>). We found that the lack of expression of LKB1 was independent of the differentiation stage of the tumor samples (<italic>n</italic>â=â18 differentiated, <italic>n</italic>â=â30 moderately differentiated and <italic>n</italic>â=â8 poorly differentiated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, there was a tendency where samples showing low or no staining for LKB1 localized preferentially in UV-exposed areas (52,3% of (nâ=â45) vs. 33,3% in non-UV-exposed areas (nâ=â9)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).

Interestingly, analysis of a curated data set of 225 tumors from another relevant UV-induced skin tumor such as cutaneous melanoma (c-Bioportal, MSKCC) <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Chin1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> showed alterations in LKB1 or NUAK1 in 22.2% of cases that were mutually exclusive (odds ratio 0.625 (no association); 95% Confidence Interval: 0.138438â2.821652; <italic>P</italic>-<italic>value</italic>: 0.412752 (Fisher's Exact Test)).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Genotoxic environmental insults such as UV are associated with the development of skin cancer. DNA damage repair has been proven to be crucial in fending off detrimental effects such as mutagenesis and cell death. Here, we show that LKB1 tumor suppressor is a DNA damage sensor, and together with its downstream kinase NUAK1, contributes to UVB-induced CDKN1A degradation, allowing DNA repair and genomic integrity.</p>
      <p>
<italic>LKB1</italic>/STK11 is mutated in sporadic human cancers whose spectrum of tumor types suggests cooperation with exposure to environmental carcinogens <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Ji1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004721-Rowan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In humans, skin-SCC is associated with chronic rather than intermittent intense exposure to UV radiation <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. However, under conditions of <italic>LKB1</italic> haploinsufficiency in an <italic>Hgf</italic>
<sup>Tg</sup> background, a single neonatal suberythemal dose of UVB was sufficient to induce skin-SCC bypassing the papilloma-SCC sequence. This result highlights the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of LKB1 in response to genotoxic insults, in particular to UVB irradiation. In contrast to human SCC samples, in mice we did not detect any mutations in <italic>HRAS</italic>. This could be the reason why our mice do not develop papillomas. However, it is likely that the requirement for RAS pathway activation for tumor development and progression in humans is achieved in the mouse through the activation of c-MET by HGF over-expression. Most of the SCC tumors showed a heterogeneous expression of LKB1. In this matter, lack of expression of LKB1 was observed often associated to undifferentiated tumor regions and in mouse tumor-derived cell lines. Hence, contrary to the previously published DMBA-induced SCC mouse model <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Gurumurthy1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and in agreement with the benign gastrointestinal polyposis associated with <italic>Lkb1</italic> deficiency; in our model malignant SCC pathogenesis seems not to require biallelic inactivation of <italic>Lkb1</italic>.</p>
      <p>It is known that ATM/ATR are important kinases involved in DNA damage response <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Sancar1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Previous work suggested that a yet unidentified kinase would be likely to be involved acting between ATR and CDKN1A in response to low doses of UV irradiation <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Bendjennat1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. CDKN1A is induced after ionizing radiation, but degraded after UV exposure <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Bendjennat1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, UV-induced degradation of CDKN1A is necessary for optimal DNA repair and to preserve genomic stability. This is accomplished by CDKN1A ubiquitylation and degradation via the CRL4(Cdt2) ubiquitin ligase complex, setting free proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from the CDKN1A-PCNA complexes and controlling translesion DNA synthesis <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Bendjennat1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Mansilla1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Soria2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Abbas2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In agreement with previous publications our results show that lack of LKB1 compromised the transcriptional regulation of CDKN1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004721-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, however, it also promoted accumulation of CDKN1A protein in response to UVB irradiation. We show that LKB1 deficiency impedes physiological UVB-induced CDKN1A degradation, impairing DNA damage repair and consequently contributes to mutagenesis and tumor development. It is known that, multitask Ser/Thr kinase LKB1 becomes phosphorylated by ATR at Thr366 in response UV <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Sapkota2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, the physiological role for this modification is unknown. We show that mutation of LKB1 Thr-366 to Ala impaired the cells ability to repair UVB-induced DNA damage by affecting CDKN1A UVBâinduced degradation. Furthermore, in humans, LKB1 and its downstream kinase NUAK1 bind and phosphorylate CDKN1A (at Thr80 and Ser146, respectively) contributing to its degradation in response to UVB and DNA repair. Although LKB1 it is known to phosphorylate AMPK family members, the amount of pmol of phosphate incorporated per pmol of CDKN1A compared head to head to the <italic>in vitro</italic> efficiency toward AMPK, suggested its capability to phosphorylate other substrates different to the AMPK family members. In this matter, NUAK1 was very effective phosphorylating both human and mouse CDKN1A. Of note is that, Thr80 is not conserved in mouse CDKN1A sequence, instead, there is a Ser at position 78. Interestingly, NUAK1 phosphorylates mouse CDKN1A at Ser78 and Ser141, the homologous residues in the human orthologue, and also conserved in the rat protein. Although, the data suggest that NUAK1 contribution is mediated by LKB1, these results do not exclude its LKB1-independent effect. In fact NUAK1 has been previously involved in DNA damage response phosphorylating p53 and participating in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Hou1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. We hypothesize that this redundancy in humans (LKB1 and NUAK1) compared to mouse (NUAK1) provides biological robustness to a mechanism involved in a UV genotoxic response. This could be particularly relevant to humans which skin is clearly more exposed to environmental insults such as UV radiation.</p>
      <p>Several lines of evidence support the biological role of LKB1 in DNA damage response. First, LKB1 becomes phosphorylated at Thr366 in response to UVB. Second, LKB1 kinase activity seems to be necessary for CDKN1A degradation in response to UVB radiation. Third, LKB1 binds and phosphorylates CDKN1A. Fourth, NUAK1, the LKB1 downstream kinase, rescues the LKB1 knockdown phenotype in response to UVB. Fifth, LKB1 binds to CDKN1A and upon UVB treatment there is an increased association of CDKN1A molecules to phopho-LKB1<sup>T366</sup>. Furthermore, LKB1<sup>T366A</sup> mutant has a diminished binding to CDKN1A compared with LKB1<sup>WT</sup> and LKB1<sup>KD</sup> mutant, it does not promote CDKN1A degradation in response to UVB radiation, and impairs DNA damage repair. In addition to all these, there is concomitant degradation of LKB1 and CDKN1A in response to UV. Although, we cannot fully explain this observation, it is tempting to speculate that these two molecules are simultaneously proteasome-degraded, permitting the liberation of PCNA and DNA repair. The later, is also supported by the increment in UVB-induced DNA damage repair in LKB1 depleted cells when CDKN1A is knocked down. Although the link between CDKN1A degradation and DNA repair has been extensively demonstrated and our data, and other recent work <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Mansilla1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> confirm this connection, how UVB-induced CDKN1A phosphorylation leads to its degradation and whether the concomitant LKB1 degradation is connected needs to be further investigated.</p>
      <p>From the pathogenic point of view in addition to the UVB induced mutations, the loss of LKB1 tumor suppressor would also contribute to deregulate cell proliferation and cell-to-cell contact inhibition. Furthermore, LKB1 deficient cells were resistant to UVB-induced apoptosis, probably through the accumulation of CDKN1A <xref rid="pgen.1004721-Allan1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004721-Polyak1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Altogether this would ultimately favor the fixation of UVB-induced mutations and tumor development. All these data suggest that in humans silencing a single copy of <italic>LKB1</italic> would be sufficient to increase the risk of the acquisition and accumulation of UV-induced mutations, placing LKB1 as an important player in response to environmental insults associated to the acquisition of skin cancer. Indeed, analysis of human samples showed that 50% of skin-SCC lack or showed very low amounts of LKB1 expression. The absence of expression of LKB1 was independent of the differentiation stage of the tumor and had a tendency to be more frequent in SCC from UVâexposed areas. This suggests that the loss of LKB1 expression is an early event in tumor development and/or progression. Since our animal model demonstrates that <italic>LKB1</italic> haploinsufficiency is sufficient to cause the accumulation of UVB-induced DNA damage, we posit that the mutational status of <italic>LKB1</italic> is a prognostic risk factor for UV-induced skin cancers. In agreement to this, in melanoma and squamous cell carcinomas, <italic>LKB1</italic> is mutated in 2% and 11% of tumor samples, respectively (COSMIC-Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute). Furthermore, our data and results from other studies (c-Bioportal, MSKCC) show that tumors with a clear environmental component including, melanoma, head an neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma and endometrial squamous cell carcinoma, alterations in LKB1 or NUAK1 are mutually exclusive, reinforcing the role of this molecular axis in DNA damage and genomic instability.</p>
      <p>In summary, here we unveil a novel role for LKB1 as a UV-induced DNA damage sensor protein. Reduced amounts of LKB1 are enough to impair UVB-induced DNA repair and cooperate with HGF signaling to promote skin cancer. At the molecular level the results indicate that we have identified the missing link between ATR and the physiological regulation of CDKN1A in response to UVB. In this matter, following UVB irradiation LKB1 becomes phosphorylated by ATM/ATR and then, LKB1 and its downstream kinase NUAK1 phosphorylate CDKN1A contributing to its physiological regulation. Thus, deficiencies in LKB1 promotes fixation of UVBâinduced mutations, resistance to UVB-induced apoptosis contributing to tumor development.</p>
