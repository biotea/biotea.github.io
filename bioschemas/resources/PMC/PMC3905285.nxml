          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Synthesis and apoenzyme attachment of lipoic acid have emerged as a new complex metabolic pathway. Mutations in several genes involved in the lipoic acid <italic>de novo</italic> pathway have recently been described (<italic>i.e., LIAS, NFU1, BOLA3, IBA57</italic>), but no mutation was found so far in genes involved in the specific process of attachment of lipoic acid to apoenzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHc), Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (Î±-KGDHc) and branched chain Î±-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDHc) complexes.</p>

          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Exome capture was performed in a boy who developed Leigh disease following a gastroenteritis and had combined PDH and Î±-KGDH deficiency with a unique amino acid profile that partly ressembled E3 subunit (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase / DLD) deficiency. Functional studies on patient fibroblasts were performed. Lipoic acid administration was tested on the <italic>LIPT1</italic> ortholog <italic>lip3</italic> deletion strain yeast and on patient fibroblasts.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Exome sequencing identified two heterozygous mutations (c.875Câ&gt;âG and c.535Aâ&gt;âG) in the <italic>LIPT1</italic> gene that encodes a mitochondrial lipoyltransferase which is thought to catalyze the attachment of lipoic acid on PDHc, Î±-KGDHc, and BCKDHc. Anti-lipoic acid antibodies revealed absent expression of PDH E2, BCKDH E2 and Î±-KGDH E2 subunits. Accordingly, the production of <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> by patient fibroblasts after incubation with <sup>14C</sup>glucose, <sup>14C</sup>butyrate or <sup>14C</sup>3OHbutyrate was very low compared to controls. cDNA transfection experiments on patient fibroblasts rescued PDH and Î±-KGDH activities and normalized the levels of pyruvate and 3OHbutyrate in cell supernatants. The yeast <italic>lip3</italic> deletion strain showed improved growth on ethanol medium after lipoic acid supplementation and incubation of the patient fibroblasts with lipoic acid decreased lactate level in cell supernatants.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>We report here a putative case of impaired free or H protein-derived lipoic acid attachment due to <italic>LIPT1</italic> mutations as a cause of PDH and Î±-KGDH deficiencies. Our study calls for renewed efforts to understand the mechanisms of pathology of lipoic acid-related defects and their heterogeneous biochemical expression, in order to devise efficient diagnostic procedures and possible therapies.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) deficiency most often occurs as an isolated enzyme defect caused by mutations in X-linked <italic>PDHA1</italic> [MIM 300502] and associates with a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from fatal infantile lactic acidosis to mild psychomotor retardation and/or Leigh disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A smaller number of PDHc deficient individuals have mutations in <italic>PDHB</italic>, <italic>PDHX</italic>, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (<italic>DLAT</italic>), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (<italic>DLD</italic>), or <italic>PDP1</italic>, which is responsible for the reactivation of phosphorylated PDHc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Lipoic acid is a sulphur-containing cofactor covalently attached to the PDHc E2 subunit (DLAT) and is functionally required. A defect of lipoic acid metabolism is expected to affect PDHc as well as the other key enzymatic complexes that have similar structure and are lipoic acid dependent, notably Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (Î±-KGDH), branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) and the glycine cleavage system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>Two pathways lead to attachment of lipoic acid to apoenzymes in bacteria. In the endogenous or <italic>de novo</italic> pathway, biosynthesis of lipoic acid follows mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (FASII) and iron sulphur cluster biosynthesis. The first lipoic acid specific enzyme of this pathway is a lipoyl(octanoyl)transferase which catalyzes the attachment of octanoate to specific lysyl residues in lipoate-dependent enzymes (bacterial LipB and likely LIPT2 in humans). The second enzyme involved is lipoic acid synthase (LipA in bacteria and LIAS in humans), which catalyzes the conversion of the octanoyl side chain to an active lipoyl. The enzyme is an iron sulphur protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The [4Fe-4S] cluster is a cofactor of LIAS as well as of many proteins involved in intermediary metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, where it participates in electron transfer reactions and in the functions of complexes I, II and III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Assembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster involves a complex metabolic pathway that includes NFU1 (NFU Iron-Sulfur cluster scaffold homolog)<italic>,</italic> ISCU (Iron-Sulfur cluster scaffold homolog) and BOLA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] (bolA homolog 3).</p>
      <p>The exogenous or salvage pathway involves attachment of free lipoic acid to the specific lysine residues of the target proteins. It is still unclear to which degree the lipoic acid salvage pathway (<italic>LplA</italic> in bacteria) is conserved in humans, as the <italic>LplA</italic> orthologous gene, <italic>LIPT1</italic>, encodes a lipoyl transferase that uses free AMP-activated lipoic acid as a substrate, yet in yeasts, the <italic>LIPT1</italic> orthologue <italic>lip3</italic> may act downstream, rather than independently of the <italic>de novo</italic> pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] (see Discussion). <italic>LIPT1</italic> is organized into four exons in humans, only one of which is coding, and maps to chromosome 2q11.2.</p>
      <p>As yet, mutations have been described in genes involved in the <italic>de novo</italic> pathway, i.e., <italic>NFU1, BOLA3, LIAS</italic> and <italic>IBA57</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Here we describe a new lipoate-related disease that involves impaired lipoate attachment on PDHc and Î±-KGDH and is due to <italic>LIPT1</italic> mutations.</p>

        <title>Immunoblot analysis in LIPT1, NFU1 and PDHA1 mutant fibroblasts</title>
        <p>Total protein extracts were prepared by lysing cultured fibroblasts generated from either control individual or from patients with either <italic>LIPT1</italic>, <italic>NFU1</italic>, or <italic>PDHA1</italic> mutations. Cell pellets were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50Â mM Tris-HCl, pHÂ 7.4, 100Â mM NaCl, 50Â mM NaF, 5Â mM EDTA, 40Â mM glycerophosphate, 1Â mM Na orthovanadate, 10<sup>-4</sup>Â M PMSF, 10<sup>-6</sup>Â M leupeptin, 10<sup>-6</sup>Â M pepstatin A and 1% Triton X-100). 40Â Î¼g of total protein extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in TBS containing 5% nonfat milk for 1Â hour at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4Â°C with primary antibodies. The following antibodies were used: anti-LIPT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-lipoic acid (Abcam) to identify the lipoate containing subunits of oxo acid dehydrogenases (PDHc, Î±-KGDHc and BCKDHc) in fibroblasts, anti-Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1-Î± subunit (Abcam) and anti-Î± Tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Quantitative analyses of immunoblots were performed with the Odyssey infrared image system (LiCor) using DyLightâ¢ 800 conjugated secondary antibodies from LiCor.</p>

        <title>Patient fibroblast: LIPT1 transfection and lipoic acid supplementation in the medium</title>
        <p>Human fibroblasts from skin biopsies from a control individual and the patient were cultured in monolayer flasks with HamF10 medium containing 12% fetal calf serum and 100 UI/mL penicillin G and 100Â Î¼g/mL streptomycin. The flasks were incubated at 37Â°C with 5% carbon dioxide. Fibroblasts were transfected using pLenti-GIII-CMV-hLIPT1-HA vector (Applied Biological Material), and analysed after 36Â h.</p>
        <p>Control and patient fibroblasts were cultured with culture medium supplemented with lipoic acid (Sigma) to a final concentration of 10 and 100Â Î¼M. Biochemical investigations were analysed on cultured skin fibroblasts before and after three weeks of supplementation.</p>

        <title>Clinical phenotype</title>
        <p>The patient, a boy, was the first child of non-consanguineous French parents. He was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy and spontaneous delivery with normal birth parameters. Psychomotor development was delayed and associated with hypotonia. At age 15Â months, when the patient was referred to our unit, metabolic investigations were regarded as normal, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), muscle biopsy, plasma amino acids and urinary organic acids (data not shown). The course of the disease was marked by an episode of metabolic acidosis at 18Â months of age that occurred in the context of vomiting and dehydration associated with gastro-enteritis. The patient had hyperlactatemia (8Â mmol/L), liver cytolysis (AST 305 u/l, ALT 220 u/l, Nâ&lt;â40) and psychomotor regression that occurred suddenly and included severe trunk hypotonia, coma with dystonia and no head control. After a few days, he was bed- and wheel-chair bound, could not stand or sit unaided. Severe spastic tetraparesis and extrapyramidal syndrome were observed. He could not speak but understood simple orders. He was otherwise fully conscious, alert, and he could smile, laugh and follow with eyes. Major swallowing difficulties led to gastrostomy. Brain MRI revealed cerebellar atrophy, an important sus-tentorial cortical atrophy with ventricular dilatation, bilateral thalamic anomalies, bi-frontal white matter anomalies and delayed myelinisation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). During the decompensation, the MRS spectroscopy with long TE (144) showed a peak of lactate (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1).</p>

        <title>Biochemical parameters</title>
        <p>The most striking biochemical features involved the plasma amino acid profile that associated increased levels of glutamine and proline at presentation as well as on repeated sampling, and low levels of lysine at presentation (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This profile was consistent with multiple Î±-keto acid dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly involving PDH and Î±-KGDH, thus suggestive of E3 subunit/DLD deficiency. However, no or only slight elevations were noted for glutamate, Î±-amino, Î±-hydroxy or Î±-ketoadipic acids, thus contrasting with the large increases and sometimes massive amounts observed in typical forms of NFU1 deficiency ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and data not shown). In addition, in sharp contrast to all previously reported patients with deficiency in the de <italic>novo</italic> lipoic acid synthesis pathway, in our patient glycine was not increased in CSF, plasma or urine (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This was not consistent with deficiency of the glycine cleavage system. Furthermore, the branched chain amino acids unexpectedly showed from very low to low-normal levels, thus not suggestive of BCKDH deficiency (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p>

Subsequently, exome capture was performed and resulted in a list of 25 candidate genes, including a mitochondrial protein, LIPT1 (MIM 610284). The compound heterozygous c.875Câ&gt;âG and c.535Aâ&gt;âG transitions in <italic>LIPT1</italic> gene (NP_660200.1) on chromosome 2 resulted in a stop mutation (p.Ser292X) and the substitution of a threonine by an alanine (p.Thr179Ala) in the protein, respectively. Sanger sequencing confirmed these mutations in the affected individual and showed that the parents were heterozygous for either mutation. These changes were predicted to be âdamagingâ and âdeleteriousâ by Polyphen and SIFT softwares, respectively, and were located in a highly conserved domain of the protein. In addition, these mutations were not found in 100 controls of French origin or in exome sequencing projects including at least 13 000 alleles [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>].</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We describe here a novel disease mechanism involving lipoic acid in humans that is induced by mutations involving the <italic>LIPT1</italic> gene. This increases the spectrum of the lipoic acid defects beyond those recently implicated in the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of lipoic acid, which include <italic>LIAS</italic> and the ancillary iron sulfur [Fe-S] cluster pathway (see above). We show that <italic>LIPT1</italic> mutations reduce lipoylation of PDHc and Î±-KGDHc, and result in severely decreased PDHc and Î±-KGDHc enzyme activities and abnormal pyruvate utilization by polarography.</p>
      <p>Based on available evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], impaired attachment of non-protein bound, AMP-activated lipoic acid on mitochondrial proteins (thus affecting a putative lipoic acid âsalvageâ pathway) might be responsible for PDH and Î±-KGDH deficiencies in this patient. However, free lipoic acid does not seem to be able to compensate for other defects in the lipoylation pathway in yeast and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], whereas we show that it can partly rescue the growth of yeasts deficient for the <italic>LIPT1</italic> orthologue. Possible mechanisms are presented in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, which shows on the top, the putative salvage pathway of free AMP-activated lipoic acid, and on the bottom, an alternative or complementary mechanism with LIPT1 that redistributes lipoyl residues from the E2 subunit (H protein) of glycine cleavage system to the other complexes (as proposed in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). In this mechanism, the original <italic>de novo</italic> pathway that involves LIPT2 and LIAS would act only on the H protein. Other mechanisms, such as partial redundancy between LIPT1 and LIPT2 operating either upstream of LIAS and/or in the usage of free AMP-lipoic acid as a substrate, cannot be excluded. None of these mechanisms accounts for the low branched chain amino acid levels in our patient and the greater susceptibility to BCKDHc lipoylation rescue of the patient fibroblasts (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C), suggesting that LIPT1 may be differentially required for BCKDHc <italic>vs</italic> Î±-KGDHc and PDHc (see also below).</p>

          <p><bold>Possible pathways for lipoic acid attachment to mitochondrial Î±-ketodehydrogenase apoenzymes.</bold> AMP-activated forms of free lipoic acid could be a source of direct lipoylation via LIPT1 (the âlipoic acid salvage pathwayâ). This mechanism is at odds with some data in mice and yeast, yet it may account for apparent compensatory effects observed in the human disorders (see text). Another mechanism proposed in yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] may involve the H protein of the glycine cleavage system as a donor of lipoyl redidues to the other complexes via LIPT1. In this case, the <italic>de novo</italic> pathway involving LIPT2 and LIAS would act only on the H protein. This partly accounts for the different amino acid profiles observed in patients. The action of LIPT1 on BCKDH may be more complex than for other dehydrogenases (see text).</p>

Because of absent glycine increase, this profile more closely resembles the typical profile of E3 subunit/DLD deficiency rather than other genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of lipoic acid such as <italic>NFU1</italic>, <italic>LIAS</italic>, <italic>IBA57</italic>, <italic>BOLA3</italic> (as hyperglycinemia is a hallmark of the associated biochemical phenotype). Of note, the fact that elevated glycine (in several biological fluids) was the only observed amino acid abnormality in these diseases except for NFU1 deficiency, raises the possibility that when de novo lipoate synthesis is impaired, secondary deficiency of the dehydrogenase complexes other than the glycine cleavage system may be compensated for, though only partly, by <italic>LIPT1-</italic>mediated lipoylation. This is consistent with the possibility that part of LIPT1 action may be independent of <italic>LIPT2</italic> and <italic>LIAS</italic>, and this may be related to its ability to process free lipoate (FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In addition, the profile of our patient differed from E3 deficiency as branched chain amino acid levels were unexpectedly very low to low-normal, whereas they tend to be elevated in E3 deficiency, because of the associated BCKDH deficiency (which isolated, is responsible for maple syrup urine disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). We verified that E3 activity was normal. Branched chain amino acid levels are known to be low in presence of BCKDH derepression following BKDK inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and also in other conditions (e.g., nutritional deficiency), but none of these conditions can readily be reconciled with the proposed mechanisms of <italic>LIPT1</italic> deficiency (FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), as well as with some of our in vitro studies (FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C), or the overall amino acid profile shown by our patient at diagnosis and throughout follow-up (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Tissue specific differences may be involved, because basal BCKDH activity was clearly reduced in patient fibroblasts (FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D).</p>
      <p>Other explanations are possible and these results should be interpreted in the light that a large proportion of patients with related disorders such as E3 subunit (DLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and NFU1 deficiency have shown only transient or intermittent biochemical abnormalities (personal unpublished data), consistent with extensive heterogeneity of clinical and biochemical features in these diseases.</p>
      <p>Based on our enzyme assays, CO<sub>2</sub> production by the Krebs cycle and mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in patient fibroblasts were very low compared to controls after administration of each of three substrates (glucose, butyrate and 3OHbutyrate), suggesting a defect in both the Krebsâ cycle and PDH. Interestingly, the level of 3OHbutyrate also increased in fibroblast supernatant, presumably resulting from decreased Î±-KGDH activity. Furthermore, 3OHbutyrate level decreased with a concomitant increase of glucose in fibroblast supernatant after <italic>LIPT1</italic> transfection, consistent with the possibility that the cells metabolized 3OHbutyrate upon partial rescue of Î±-KGDH activity. The novel combination of biochemical tests presented here is a promising tool for Krebs cycle investigations, particularly for <italic>in vitro</italic> testing of potential therapeutic applications. From this test we have been able to infer that candidate dietary treatments for this metabolic disease, such as ketogenic diet, were likely detrimental. The argument was very low CO<sub>2</sub> production after administration of <sup>C14</sup>3OHbutyrate and <sup>C14</sup>butyrate.</p>
      <p>Contrary to our patient, who had biochemical abnormalities restricted to BCKDH, PDH and Î±-KGDH, the phenotype of the diseases that involve lipoic acid <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis show numerous additional dysfunctions that are related to the [Fe-S] cluster pathway. These additional dysfunctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] affect succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase, two proteins from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as the respiratory chain complexes I-III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This may explain why in these patients, neurological symptoms were associated with multisystem abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. By contrast the clinical picture of our patient was limited to brain thus similar to primary PDH deficiencies. The extreme severity of the neurological defects may result from the added contribution of Î±-KGDH deficiency which is expected to induce a stronger energetic defect compared to isolated PDH deficiency. Differential tissue-specificity of <italic>LIPT1</italic> function(s) <italic>vs</italic> the classical de novo lipoylation pathway might also be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However it is of note that in our patient, biochemical clues expected from an energetic disease such as hyperlactatemia and hyperpyruvicemia, or urinary Î±-ketoglutarate were observed only during a metabolic attack. This intermittent and moderate biochemical presentation raises the possibility that the disease may be underdiagnosed. In fact, it was mainly the amino acid profile, partly suggestive of E3 subunit/DLD-like deficiency (see above), that prompted us to test for deficiency of Î±-KGDH and PDH.</p>
      <p>A major challenge for this new and severe enzyme cofactor disease is therapy. A treatment with lipoic acid may not be indicated as its attachment to enzyme complexes is expected to be impaired in the absence of <italic>LIPT1</italic>. However <italic>Îlip3</italic> moderately improved growth in ethanol medium supplemented with lipoic acid, whereas activity of PDH, but not Î±-KGDH or BCKDH, moderately increased in patient fibroblasts cultured with lipoic acid supplementation in the medium. These preliminary results raise the possibility that lipoic acid may have therapeutic effects, though moderate and requiring further validation.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we report pathogenic <italic>LIPT1</italic> gene mutations in humans, which alter lipoate binding in PDHc and Î±-KGDHc, and we provide strong evidence for the existence of a lipoylation pathway specific to PDHc and Î±-KGDHc in humans. This pathway is at least partly distinct from the <italic>de novo</italic> pathway and does not affect lipoylation of the glycine cleavage complex, as was proposed in yeast [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>]. In addition, our data indicate that <italic>LIPT1</italic> deficiency may affect lipoylation of BKCDHc in a partly unpredicted fashion that remains to be characterized. Further investigations are required to clarify the complex metabolism of lipoic acid cofactor in humans, and more efficient procedures should be devised for early diagnosis and prevention of metabolic decompensations.</p>
