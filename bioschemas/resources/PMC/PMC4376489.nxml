      <abstract>
        <p id="P3">Signalling by Wnts is finely balanced to ensure normal development and tissue homeostasis while avoiding diseases such as cancer. This is achieved in part by Notum, a highly conserved secreted feedback antagonist. Notum has been thought to act as a phospholipase, shedding glypicans and associated Wnts from the cell surface. However, this view fails to explain specificity since glypicans bind many extracellular ligands. Here we provide genetic evidence in Drosophila that Notum requires glypicans to suppress Wnt signalling, but does not cleave their glycophosphatidylinositol anchor. Structural analyses reveal glycosaminoglycan binding sites on Notum, which likely help Notum colocalise with Wnts. They also identify, at the active site of human and Drosophila Notum, a large hydrophobic pocket that accommodates palmitoleate. Kinetic and mass spectrometric analyses of human proteins show that Notum is a carboxylesterase that removes an essential palmitoleate moiety from Wnts and thus constitutes the first known extracellular protein deacylase.</p>

    <p id="P4">Negative feedback characterises biological signalling<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and although often cell-intrinsic, is also mediated by secreted proteins. Cell- and non cell-autonomous feedbacks modulate signal transduction by Wnts, a class of secreted proteins characterised by the presence of palmitoleic acid appended on a conserved serine<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. This palmitoleic acid moiety is essential for signalling<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, contributing to interaction with Frizzled receptors<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Canonical Wnt signalling triggers expression of intracellular, extracellular and membrane-localised inhibitors of the pathway. Secreted inhibitors include Dkk family members, which bind to the extracellular domain of the Wnt coreceptor LRP5/6, as well as WIF1 and sFRPs, which sequester Wnts<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Tiki is a membrane-bound protease that cleaves the N-terminal region of Wnt ligands<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Notum is also thought to act enzymatically<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> but on glypicans, a class of heparin sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) implicated in the extracellular stabilisation, movement, and/or surface retention of Wnts, as well as of other signalling ligands<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P5">Notum orthologs are found in metazoans from planarians to humans and all bear the hallmark Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad of Î±/Î²-hydrolases<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Notumâs sequence similarity to plant pectin acetylesterases prompted the early suggestion that it could hydrolyse glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of glypicans<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, thus affecting their ability to interact with Wnts and somehow modulating signalling activity. It was subsequently reported that Notum triggers glypican shedding from cultured cells, perhaps by cleaving their GPI anchor<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Indeed, the currently accepted view is that Notum is a glypican-specific phospholipase<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. However, glypican-based interactions also modulate Dpp (<italic>Drosophila</italic> TGFÎ²), Hedgehog, and fibroblast growth factor, as well as Wingless signalling<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. One would expect therefore that these pathways would also be sensitive to Notum-induced glypican release. Yet, existing evidence suggests that Notum is primarily a feedback inhibitor of Wnt signalling. In planarian worms, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish and hepatocarcinomas, <italic>notum</italic> expression is activated by Wnt signalling and, conversely, Notum seems to preferentially suppress Wnt signalling<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Since more pleiotropic effects would be expected from an enzyme that targets glypicans, we felt compelled to reassess Notumâs specificity and mode of action.</p>
    <sec id="S1">
      <title>Notum specifically inhibits Wnt signalling</title>
      <p id="P6">To investigate systematically Notumâs specificity, we analysed its effects on <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs, which require Wingless (the main <italic>Drosophila</italic> Wnt), Dpp and Hedgehog for patterning and growth<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. As expected, overexpression of Drosophila Notum (dNotum) throughout the dorsal compartment prevented expression of <italic>senseless</italic>, a gene normally activated by high level Wingless signalling. By contrast, <italic>patched (ptc)</italic>, a Hedgehog target gene<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>) and phosphoMad (pMad) immunoreactivity, a marker of Dpp signalling<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, was only mildly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Loss-of-function assays, in homozygous <italic>notum<sup>KO</sup></italic> tissue, confirmed dNotumâs specificity to Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Although complete loss of <italic>notum</italic> was lethal, strong hypomorphic animals (<italic>notum<sup>141</sup> / notum<sup>KO</sup></italic>) survived to adulthood. The wings of such animals had supernumerary margin bristles, consistent with excess Wingless signalling, but had no defects indicative of impaired Hedgehog or Dpp signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1d-g</xref>). Nevertheless, extensive evidence suggests that glypicans contribute to these two signalling pathways<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. This is difficult to reconcile with the apparent specificity of Notum if it acts as a glypican-specific phospholipase.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S2">
      <title>Notum does not cleave the GPI anchor of glypicans</title>
      <p id="P7">One previously reported observation, namely that dNotum inhibits signalling by membrane-tethered (<italic>i.e.</italic> shedding-resistant) Wingless<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 2a, b</xref>), is incompatible with the view that Notum is a glypican-specific phospholipase. In addition, genetic removal of the two Drosophila glypicans Dally and Dlp did not abrogate high level Wingless signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These two sets of data strongly suggest that glypican shedding is unlikely to account for the inhibitory effect of dNotum on Wingless signalling. Indeed, we could not confirm the results of an earlier phase partition assay, which suggested that Notum increases the water solubility of glypicans, as expected from GPI cleavage<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Extracts from cells expressing tagged Dlp or Dally were treated with either dNotum or bacterial phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PIPLC), an enzyme known to cleave GPI anchors. PIPLC caused both glypicans to partition almost exclusively in the aqueous phase, but dNotum did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> for Dlp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref> for Dally) even though, under these conditions, it was effective at inhibiting signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). Likewise, in imaginal discs, Notum did not mimic PIPLC: while extracellular Dally and Dlp were noticeably reduced upon addition of exogenous PIPLC, overexpression of dNotum had no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2e-l</xref>). Therefore, experiments with cultured cells and imaginal discs suggest that Notum is not a glypican-specific phospholipase.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S3">
      <title>Glypicans contribute to the activity of Notum</title>
      <p id="P8">Even though dNotum does not seem to modulate Wingless signalling by cleaving the GPI anchor of glypicans, genetic interactions between <italic>notum</italic> and <italic>dlp</italic> suggest a functional relationship<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated the role of Dlp or Dally in dNotumâs ability to suppress Wingless signalling. dNotum overexpression, along the anterior-posterior (A-P) boundary, led to complete and long range suppression of Senseless expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In the absence of either Dally or Dlp, this activity was very much reduced, as indicated by the recovery of endogenous Senseless expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). Notably, Dally was also required for Notum to suppress signalling by membrane-tethered Wingless (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Since Dally is not essential for survival, this requirement could be confirmed in adult wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3b-d</xref>). To address the relevance of glypican GPI anchorage, we created a transgene expressing Dlp-CD8 (34 C-terminal amino acids of Dlp replaced by the CD8 transmembrane domain) under control of the <italic>tubulin</italic> promoter. This transgene restored the ability of overexpressed dNotum to repress Wingless signalling in <italic>dlp</italic> mutant homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>), confirming the importance of glypicans but not their GPI anchor.</p>
      <p id="P9">Glypicans bear sulfated glycans. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, sulfation of the sugar chains requires Sulfateless, a GlcNAc N-Deacetylase/N-Sulfotransferase (NDST)<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, which can be knocked down <italic>in vivo</italic> with an RNAi transgene. Gal4 was used to express this transgene specifically in the posterior compartment, leaving the anterior compartment as a control. At the same time, a <italic>dpp-LexA</italic> driver was used to overexpress dNotum along the A-P boundary. Overexpressed dNotum inhibited Senseless expression in the control compartment but not in the territory deficient in <italic>sulfateless</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Therefore sulfation of HSPGs is needed for dNotum to act. Notably, overexpressed dNotum did not accumulate in the compartment expressing the <italic>sulfateless</italic> RNAi transgene (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2eâ to Fig. 2aâ</xref>). Likewise, dNotum was depleted from the surface of <italic>dally dlp</italic> double mutant cells generated by mitotic recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). These findings suggest that Dally and Dlp retain dNotum at the cell surface through interaction with their sulfated glycans. Indeed, dNotum bound specifically to sulfated glycans on a glycan array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) showed that recombinant hNotum<sub>core</sub> (S81-T451, C330S) bound to heparin and heparan sulfate with micromolar affinities. The dissociation constant of a complex comprising hNotum<sub>core</sub> and human glypican-3 (GPC3 P31-N538) was 104Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Consistent with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic data, this binding relies largely on the two sulfated GAG chains in GPC3 since their removal led to a more than fivefold reduction in affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We conclude that sulfated GAG chains on glypicans likely mediate their interaction with Notum.</p>

      <title>Structural and enzymatic evidence for carboxylesterase activity</title>
      <p id="P12">The Î±/Î² hydrolase superfamily includes proteases, lipases, esterases, dehalogenases, peroxidases and epoxide hydrolases<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. To identify which of these activities relate most closely to Notumâs, we compared the structure of hNotum to those of all known Î±/Î² hydrolases (PDBe Fold server<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>). The search returned many weak homologs, including human esterase D<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1)<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). A structure-based search for function using the ProFunc Server<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> also suggested that Notum is a carboxylesterase. Furthermore, the closest non-animal homologs of Notum, the pectin acetyl esterases (PAEs) of angiosperms (sequence identity to hNotum 22%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>) are carboxylesterases. We assessed the functional significance of these observations by measuring the activity of hNotum<sub>core</sub> on <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl (pNP) acetate (pNP2), a chromogenic carboxylesterase substrate<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Significant activity could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This activity was strongly inhibited by Triton X-100, and by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a compound known to covalently modify the catalytic serine of serine esterases and proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8a, b</xref>). In contrast, there was no measurable hNotum activity on representative sulfatase, phosphatase, phospholipase C or amidase/protease substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Addition of SOS or heparin resulted in a modest increase in Notum carboxylesterase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig 8a</xref>). The possibility that GAGs also contribute to Notum function by allosteric activation requires further investigation.</p>
      <p id="P13">As a secreted carboxylesterase that inhibits Wnt signalling, Notum is likely to target a carboxy-oxoester or carboxy-thioester bond present on an extracellular component of the Wnt signal transduction machinery. The linkage between Wnt and palmitoleic acid is the only such chemical bond described to date, suggesting that Notum could target Wnt proteins themselves. To evaluate this possibility, we treated mWnt3A with recombinant hNotum<sub>core</sub> for specific durations, removed the hNotum<sub>core</sub> and used a cell-based luciferase assay to measure signalling activity of the remaining mWnt3A. This showed that hNotum inactivated mWnt3A directly, irreversibly and in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>), while no such activity could be detected on Norrin, a non-lipidated ligand that also acts via the Wnt receptors<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P14">Remarkably, the Notum crystal structures revealed a large (~380Ã<sup>3</sup>), hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the catalytic triad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). Computational docking showed that this pocket could accommodate long chain fatty acids of up to 16 carbon atoms (C16). The size restriction imposed on saturated fatty acids was functionally assessed by measuring hNotum enzymatic activity on commercially available saturated chromogenic pNP ester substrates of varying chain lengths. The activity of human APT1, a cytosolic thio- and oxoesterase was measured in parallel for comparison. hNotum had a pronounced preference for pNP8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), with a micromolar Michaelis constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8d, e</xref>). The activity for pNP-palmitate (pNP16) was less than 0.2% of that for pNP8. To extend our studies of hNotum specificity beyond commercially available substrates, we employed a competitive inhibition assay, using pNP8 as substrate. Saturated 8-12 carbon (C8-C12) long linear carboxylic acids had significant inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) while longer saturated fatty acids had no effect. Interestingly however, strong inhibition was observed with the Wnt-associated <italic>cis</italic>-unsaturated lipids myristoleic (C14) and palmitoleic acid (C16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8f</xref>), but not with palmitelaidic acid, the <italic>trans</italic> isomer of the 16:1 fatty acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 d</xref>). These results confirm that Notum can bind to C14 and C16 carboxylic acids if they contain a C9-C10 <italic>cis</italic> double bond and therefore might hydrolyse the oxo-ester bond linking palmitoleate or myristoleate to Wnts.</p>

      <title>Notum deacylates Wnts</title>
      <p id="P15">To test directly Notum-mediated Wnt deacylation we turned to LC-MS analysis. mWnt3A was purified from conditioned medium (CM), treated with recombinant hNotum<sub>core</sub> or a mock solution, differentially isotope labelled, and trypsinised. No significant identification could be obtained for the predicted palmitoleoylated tryptic peptide, indicating incompatibility with the LC-MS conditions. Importantly however, following treatment with hNotum, this peptide could be identified and quantified in non-acylated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended data Fig. 9a, b</xref>). Replicate LC-MS measurements and label reversal consistently showed an increase in signal intensity for the hNotum-treated de-acylated peptide whereas control peptides showed no significant change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9c, d</xref>). This suggests that treatment of mWnt3A with hNotum removes the palmitoleic acid moiety thus rendering the relevant peptide more hydrophilic and detectable by LC-MS. Encouraged by these results, we proceeded to assess the activity of hNotum on synthetic peptides. The predicted tryptic peptide from hWnt3A was synthesised in a disulphide bonded form with a palmitoleate group on the relevant serine (Methods). These peptides were treated with recombinant hNotum<sub>core</sub>, or with hNotum<sub>core</sub><sup>S232A</sup>, which is predicted to be enzymatically inactive, and the reaction products were analysed by MALDI-TOF. No significant deacylation was detected in hNotum<sub>core</sub><sup>S232A</sup>-treated samples while hNotum-treated peptides were found to be extensively deacylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9e</xref>). We conclude from these assays that Notum catalyses the removal of palmitoleic acid, which is normally O-linked to S209 of hWnt3A. We also assayed the effect of hNotum on a synthetic peptide from hSonic Hedgehog, which is N-palmitoylated at the amino terminus. No change in the level of acylation could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9f</xref>), confirming that Notumâs activity on Wnt is specific, in agreement with our genetic evidence.</p>
      <p id="P16">To gain structural insight into Wnt-Notum recognition, we co-crystallized inactive hNotum<sub>core</sub><sup>S232A</sup> with a palmitoleoylated disulfide bonded peptide corresponding to hWnt7A (C202-C209). The crystal structure revealed the palmitoleoyl group occupying the active site pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9g</xref>). Electron density was also evident for the ester bond. No interpretable density was found for the peptide, probably due to disorder. This apparent lack of interaction with the peptide concurs with the general observation that esterases/lipases of the Î±/Î² hydrolase family bind only to the acid part of the ester substrate. The carboxylic acid carbon is 3.3Ã from the CÎ² of the mutated Serine nucleophile, a distance consistent with ideal positioning of the hydroxyl for nucleophilic attack. Classically esterasecatalysed hydrolysis proceeds through a tetrahedral transition state characterized by a negatively charged carbonyl oxygen stabilised by two canonical backbone amides, the oxyanion hole<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. In hNotum the G127-W128 amide participates in formation of the oxyanion hole in addition to the canonical S232-A233 and G126-G127 amides, thereby providing optimal stabilisation during the transition state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9g</xref>). The kinked <italic>cis</italic> double bond (C9-C10) of the acyl tail is positioned at the base of the pocket between Ile291, Phe319 and Phe320. We found a similar binding mode for a hNotumâmyristoleate crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9h</xref>). Thus, the binding pocket can accommodate extended carbon tails up to C8/C10 but longer fatty acid chains must be kinked at this point in order to fit in. Saturated fatty acids generally adopt an extended conformation, explaining Notumâs preference for palmitoleate and myristoleate (both <italic>cis</italic>-unsaturated lipids kinked at C9-C10) over palmitate and myristate. The pocket entrance (lined by Ser232 and His389) is relatively narrow, but comparisons of all hNotum structures suggest substantial flexibility, compatible with palmitoleate entry and release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). Therefore crystallographic evidence strengthens our observation that Notum is a Wnt-specific deacylase with preference for <italic>cis</italic> unsaturated long chain lipids.</p>

      <p id="P17">Only a small number of secreted proteins, Wnts, Hedgehogs, and Ghrelins, are known to be acylated<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. In all cases, this post-translational modification is essential for activity and is carried out by dedicated membrane bound O-acyl transferases (MBOATs). Porcupine, the Wnt-MBOAT, appends palmitoleate and shorter <italic>cis</italic> unsaturated fatty acids onto Wnt<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. We have shown here that Notum specifically deacylates Wnts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>) and is thus the first enzyme known to deacylate an extracellular protein. Notumâs specificity can be traced to the shape of its hydrophobic pocket, which can accommodate <italic>cis</italic>-unsaturated fatty acids such as myristoleate and palmitoleate, and the nature of its enzymatic activity, a carboxyl oxoesterase. These characteristics ensure that Notum preferentially acts on Wnts, the only secreted proteins known to be O-palmitoleoyleated on a Serine residue. Notum enzymatically inhibits signalling activity by removing the palmitoleate moiety of Wnts, which contributes directly to receptor binding<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Notum could also interfere non-catalytically with formation of the WntâFrizzled complex by sequestering the palmitoleate moiety since overexpressed dNotum<sup>S237A</sup> mildly suppressed Wingless signalling <italic>in vivo</italic> (data not shown). We have found that glypicans are required for Notum function and that Notum binds to the sulfated GAGs of HSPGs. Glypicans also bind to Wnts, and can play stimulatory roles in Wnt signalling<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. However, in the presence of Notum, we suggest that glypicans are also inhibitory by acting as a scaffold that co-localises Notum and its substrate (Wnts) at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P18">Our results point to Notumâs physiological targets being exclusively Wnt family members. Notum is the only secreted Wnt feedback inhibitor found across the metazoan kingdom, from planarians to humans, although seemingly it is seemingly absent from <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Notumâs Wnt-deacylation activity, along with other means of feedback inhibition such as ligand sequestration, receptor blocking, receptor downregulation and proteolytic degradation<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>-<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> undoubtedly contributes to the fine balancing of Wnt signalling both during development, for cell fate specification, and in adults, <italic>e.g</italic>. for stem cell maintenance. Indeed, insufficient or excessive Wnt signalling has been associated with diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer respectively. Our binding data suggest that Notum could possibly be modulated by dietary <italic>cis</italic>-unsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, since Notum is an extracellular enzyme with a well defined and large active site pocket, it is likely amenable to chemical inhibition to alleviate conditions associated with insufficient Wnt signalling. Conversely, recombinant Notum could be considered as a biologic to prevent excess Wnt signalling such as in Wnt-driven cancers.</p>

A stable S2 line expressing V5-tagged dNotum (S2 act-Notum-V5) was generated by transfection of S2 cells with pAct-Notum-V5 and pCoHygro (Invitrogen) followed by drug selection. Wingless was expressed from pTub-Wg, which was prepared by inserting the Wg cDNA from pKS-Wg <sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> into pTubulin. HA-tagged Dally was expressed from pAct-Dally-HA, prepared by inserting Dally-HA excised from pMTDally-HA (from Stephen Cohen) into pActin. To conveniently manipulate Dlpâs coding sequence, three nucleotides (GTC) were inserted at position 2100-2102 (Nucleotide numbering with the A of first codon at position 1) to introduce a Sal I site in KS-Dlp. This was used to insert DNA encoding an HA tag flanked by Glycine (GYPYDVPDYAG) and thus generate pKS-Dlp-HA. The Dlp-HA was then inserted into pTubulin to make pTub-Dlp-HA.</p>

After the crystal structure was solved in crystal forms I and II (see below) and the folded region identified, a shorter construct hNotum<sub>core</sub> comprising S81-T451, C330S, was found to provide higher expression levels, thanks in part to the removal of the non-conserved C330 which provides a free, surface-exposed sulfhydryl.

GPC3 constructs (see below) or sulfated GAGs were coupled to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip via a biotin label and purified Notum proteins were used as analyte. Biotinylated GAGs were produced as described <sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>. To produce biotinylated GPC3 we proceeded as follows. The cDNA encoding human GPC3 (full length except for the lack of endogenous signal sequence, P31-N538) or GPC3<sub>ÎGAG</sub> (lacking C-terminal stretch that normally contains the GAG attachment sites, P31-F493) was cloned into a variant of the pHLsec vector, which introduces a recognition sequence for the <italic>E. coli</italic> BirA enzyme at the C-terminus.

The synthetic BirA gene was codon-optimized and carried a C-terminal KDEL-tag for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. The BirA plasmid was used at 20% of total DNA. The expression medium was supplemented with 100Î¼M of sterile biotin prepared as a 2mM stock in PBS. After three days, the CM was cleared from cell debris and repeatedly buffer-exchanged to remove free biotin. The chip surface was precoupled with approximately 10000 resonance units (RU) of streptavidin. Approx. 500 RU of GPC3 was immobilized. The amount of immobilized GAGs could not be measured. After each injection of analyte the chip surface was regenerated with 1M NaCl, 10mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5 to return to baseline levels.

If, based on the crystal structure, the hydrophobic part of the side chain (<italic>e.g.</italic> Arg, Lys, His) was estimated to be of no structural importance, then the residue was mutated to serine.

Substrate stocks in DMSO were adjusted to concentrations between 20 mM (pNP16) and 2 M (pNP2) and diluted into reaction buffer. In tests using the short and soluble substrates pNP2 and pNP4, the final DMSO concentration was only 0.1%. In tests using longer pNP substrates or in comparative studies the final DMSO and Triton concentration was kept constant at 2.5% (v/v) and 0.5% (w/v) respectively. The required amount of a 20mM substrate stock was first mixed 1:1 with a 20% (w/v) solution of Triton X-100 in reaction buffer. The resulting emulsion was then diluted with reaction buffer and vigorously agitated to avoid precipitation. Reactions were started by addition of 5-10Î¼l of protein at concentrations between 0.1 and 4 mg/ml.

The extinction coefficient of <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol in reaction buffer was established to be 4070 M<sup>â1</sup>cm<sup>â1</sup>. Although Triton X-100 was required to maintain the solubility of long ester substrates and fatty acids, it was itself an inhibitor of Notum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8a and b</xref>). We assume that the hydrophobic region of Triton X-100 has a propensity to bind to the active site pocket. This notion is supported by the observation that the much larger sterol-based detergent CHAPS evokes no inhibition. Based on this assumption of competitive inhibition by Triton X-100 we determined its inhibition constant to be 466Î¼M and used it to calculate a corrected Michaelis constant for pNP8 turnover.</p>

In the views shown here, the hNotum structure has been rotated by 90Â° around the x-axis relative to the structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>. <bold>b,</bold> Rootless phylogenetic tree of animal Notum proteins (red) and plant pectinacetylesterases (PAE, green). Extent of sequence identity to hNotum is shown next to species name. Percentages between branches indicate sequence identity between neighbours.</p>

          <p id="P74"><bold>a,</bold> Inhibition of hNotum activity on pNP-butyrate (pNP4) by PMSF (30 min preincubation with 2 mM) as well as by Triton X-100 and CHAPS (0.5%). Presence of 20mM sucrose octasulfate (SOS) and 50mg/l Heparin results in a minor increase of esterase activity. Values represent each the activity relative to the mean of four control samples lacking the additives. <bold>b,</bold> Saturable inhibition of hNotum by Triton X-100. Triton X-100 inhibits many esterases due to binding to the acyl binding pocket through its hydrophobic group. <bold>c,</bold> Lack of inhibition of Norrin-mediated Î²-catenin stabilization by Notum. Recombinant Norrin was pretreated with hNotum<sub>core</sub> at a concentration sufficient to suppress Wnt3a-mediated signalling. <bold>d, e,</bold> Saturation kinetics of hNotumâs action on pNP-octanoate (pNP8, d) and pNP -butyrate (pNP4, e). The activity was normalized to the <italic>A</italic><sub>max</sub> calculated for hNotum<sub>core</sub>. The activity values for the larger, full length protein were adjusted to compensate for the increased mass. Apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values in (d) were corrected for the inhibition caused by Triton X-100. <bold>f,</bold> Saturation inhibition kinetics with myristoleic and palmitoleic acid. pNP8 was used at a concentration of 1mM and 250Î¼M, respectively.</p>

Irrespective of the nature of the label (grey indicates light label and black, heavy label), hNotum<sub>core</sub> triggered an increase in peak area of the delipidated Wnt3A tryptic peptide. <bold>c, d,</bold> Two control Wnt3A cysteine-containing peptides from the same dataset were not affected by hNotum<sub>core</sub>. <bold>e,</bold> Activity of hNotum<sub>core</sub> and its S232A variant on a synthetic disulphide bonded Wnt3A peptide (CHGLSGSCEVK) palmitoleoylated on the first Serine. Both lipidated and unlipidated peptide could be detected by MALDI-TOF. Incubation with hNotum<sub>core</sub>, but not its S232A variant, caused significant delipidation (peak corresponding to delipidated peptide is marked by asterisk). Quantification of duplicate such experiments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>. <bold>f,</bold> MALDI-TOF analysis shows that neither hNotum<sub>core</sub> nor its S232A variant delipidated a synthetic Sonic Hedgehog peptide (CGPGRGFGKRR) palmitoylated on its amino terminal Cysteine. Quantification of duplicate such experiments is shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref> (peak corresponding to lipidated peptide is marked by black triangle). <bold>g</bold>, 2D active site schematic relating to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>. Additional hydrogen bonds and electron pair movements thought to occur during hydrolysis by the wild type are shown in grey. <bold>h,</bold> Close-up view on the myristoleate active site complex of hNotum<sub>core</sub> (crystal form I).

        <title>Notum specifically inhibits Wnt signalling</title>
        <p><bold>a-c,</bold> Overexpression of V5-tagged dNotum with the <italic>apterous-gal4</italic> driver, which is expressed in the dorsal compartment prevents expression of Senseless (Sens) but not that of Patched (Ptc) (b). Loss of <italic>notum</italic> activity, achieved by generating large patches of <italic>notum<sup>KO</sup></italic> tissue (See Methods), marked by the loss of GFP, leads to broadening of Senseless expression but does not affect Patched expression. As in all subsequent confocal images, 3<sup>rd</sup> instar wing imaginal discs are shown with posterior to the right and dorsal up. <bold>d</bold>, Senseless is expressed seemingly normally in large patches of <italic>dlp dally</italic> mutant cells (GFP negative) <bold>e</bold>, Western blot (co-stained with anti-V5 and anti-HA) of phase separated extracts of S2 cells transfected with a plasmid expressing haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Dlp. In control extracts, Dlp (arrowhead) is found equally in the detergent (d) and aqueous (a) phases. Coexpression of dNotum-V5 (asterisk) had no impact while treatment with PIPLC shifted Dlp to the aqueous phase.</p>

        <title>Notum requires the GAGs of glypicans to inhibit Wingless signalling</title>
        <p><bold>a-c,</bold> Ectopically expressed dNotum-V5 does not suppress Senseless expression in the absence of <italic>dlp</italic> (b) or <italic>dally</italic> (c). Although dNotum is only expressed in a vertical band along the A-P boundary, it spreads along the whole A-P axis. <bold>d,</bold> Ectopic dNotum represses Senseless expression in <italic>dlp</italic> mutants that express Dlp-CD8 (<italic>tubulin</italic> promoter). <bold>e</bold>, Expression of an RNAi transgene against <italic>sulfateless</italic> in the posterior compartment prevents dNotum-V5 (expressed from <italic>dpp-lexA lex-op-notum-V5)</italic> from being retained at the cell surface and from suppressing Senseless expression. Wingless signalling is still suppressed in the anterior compartment. <bold>f,</bold> Accumulation of dNotum-V5 is reduced at the surface of <italic>dlp dally</italic> double mutant tissue (GFP-negative).</p>

Î²-strands are numbered and Î±-helices are labelled alphabetically from N to C terminus. Disulfides are shown in orange, catalytic triad residues as sticks and the active site pocket shaded grey. N96 is glycosylated (also in dNotum). <bold>c,</bold> Heparin-mimicking ligands from three different structures are plotted onto a surface representation coloured by electrostatic potential from red (â8<italic>k</italic><sub>b</sub>T/<italic>e</italic><sub>c</sub>) to blue (-8<italic>k</italic><sub>b</sub>T/<italic>e</italic><sub>c</sub>). Close-up views of binding sites are shown on the right with experimental omit electron density contoured at 2.0Ï. <bold>d,</bold> SPR assay measuring hNotum<sub>core</sub> variant binding to immobilized heparin. Mutation of the heparin disaccharide binding site (R115S; hNotum<sub>ÎHep.unit</sub>) had little effect while mutations in the sulfate binding site 1 (R409Q H412N R416Q; hNotum<sub>ÎSulfate1</sub>) strongly reduced binding. For SPR (a, d), each data point is the mean result of two replicates.</p>
