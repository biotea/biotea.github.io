        <p>Lamin A mutations cause many diseases, including cardiomyopathies and Progeria Syndrome. The covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) polypeptides regulates the function of many proteins. Until now, no examples of human disease-causing mutations that occur within a sumoylation consensus sequence and alter sumoylation were known. We show that lamin A is sumoylated at lysine 201 and that two lamin A mutants associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy, E203G and E203K, exhibit decreased sumoylation. E203 occupies the conserved +2 position in the sumoylation consensus Î¨KXE. Lamin A mutants E203G, E203K, and K201R all exhibit a similar aberrant subcellular localization and are associated with increased cell death. Fibroblasts from an individual with the E203K lamin A mutation also exhibit decreased lamin A sumoylation and increased cell death. These results suggest that SUMO modification is important for normal lamin A function and implicate an involvement for altered sumoylation in the E203G/E203K lamin A cardiomyopathies.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The lamin A protein plays an important role in the structure and function of the nucleus, and mutations in the lamin A gene cause a large number of different human diseases, including cardiomyopathies, muscular dystrophies, and Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Broers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Capell and Collins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Mattout et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Parnaik and Manju, 2006</xref>). Covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to lysine residues in target proteins, or sumoylation, is an important regulator of protein functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bossis and Melchior, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>). SUMO proteins are covalently attached to target lysine residues by the SUMO E2 enzyme ubc9, and these substrate lysines are typically found within the consensus sequence Î¨KXE (Î¨ represents hydrophobic amino acids; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Desterro et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Johnson and Blobel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Rodriguez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sampson et al., 2001</xref>). Cells express three major SUMO paralogues, SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3, with SUMO-2 and -3 being much more similar to each other than to SUMO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bossis and Melchior, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, a previous study identified an interaction between lamin A and ubc9, the SUMO E2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>). Based on this interaction, we hypothesized that the lamin A protein could be a target of sumoylation. The purpose of the experiments in this present study was to determine whether lamin A is indeed sumoylated in cells and, if so, what role this modification plays in regulating the function of this lamin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>First, we sought to test for sumoylation of endogenous lamin A by performing immunoprecipitation of HeLa cell extracts using lamin A antibodies, followed by Western using antibodies against SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/SUMO-3 (because of the similarity of SUMO-2 and -3, it is likely that both of these SUMO proteins are recognized by this antibody). The results suggest that lamin A is SUMO modified and that it is preferentially modified by SUMO-2 compared with SUMO-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The results in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> indicate that lamin A protein in extracts of mouse heart is also sumoylated and that, like lamin A that is present in HeLa cell extracts, SUMO-2 appears to be the predominant SUMO protein attached to this protein.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Endogenous lamin A is sumoylated.</bold> (A) Extracts of HeLa cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antiâlamin A antibodies followed by Western blot assays using antibodies against SUMO-2, SUMO-1, or lamin A (different from those used for immunoprecipitation).

To test whether sumoylation of the lamin A is occurring at lysine 201, HeLa cells were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids encoding GFP fusion constructs of wild-type lamin A and lamin A in which this lysine was changed to a nonsumoylatable arginine (K201R), along with expression constructs encoding HA-tagged SUMO-1 or -2. Extracts of the transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies followed by anti-HA Western blot. The results of this experiment, in agreement with the results obtained for endogenous lamin A, indicated that the wild-type lamin A protein is covalently modified by SUMO-2 but not as efficiently sumoylated by SUMO-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, bottom). The results also show that the modification by SUMO-2 is not observed for the K201R lamin A mutant protein, suggesting that lysine 201 is the site of SUMO-2 attachment in this protein.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Lamin A is sumoylated at lysine 201 by SUMO-2, and E203G and E203K mutant lamin A proteins exhibit decreased sumoylation.</bold> (A) The top shows the location of a match (MKEE) to the sumoylation site consensus sequence (Î¨KXE) surrounding lysine 201 in the rod-containing domain of lamin A. In the bottom, extracts of HeLa cells transfected with GFP fusion constructs of wild-type lamin A or K201R mutant lamin A and HA-tagged SUMO-1 or -2 plasmids were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP antibodies followed by anti-HA Western blot. Western blots of the lysates using anti-GFP and anti-HA antibodies show levels of GFPâlamin A proteins and HAâSUMO-1/HAâSUMO-2 proteins (incorporated into major sumoylated proteins), respectively. (B) The top shows the location of the E203G and E203K mutations in lamin A associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy at the conserved glutamic acid residue of the sumoylation site consensus sequence (Î¨KXE) surrounding lysine 201. In the bottom, extracts of HeLa cells transfected with GFP fusion constructs of wild-type lamin A, E203G mutant lamin A, or E203K mutant lamin A along with HA-tagged SUMO-2 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies followed by anti-HA Western blot. Levels of transfected GFPâlamin A proteins in the cell lysates were determined by Western blot using anti-GFP antibody.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820035f02"/></fig><p>The glutamic acid residue at the fourth position in the sumoylation consensus sequence Î¨KXE is known to be important for the efficiency of SUMO addition to the nearby lysine in this sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Rodriguez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sampson et al., 2001</xref>). Relevant to this, two different disease-associated mutations of the human lamin A gene have been identified that change the glutamic acid at this position (E203) in the sumoylation consensus sequence of this protein to a different amino acid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fatkin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jakobs et al., 2001</xref>). In one of these mutants, glutamic acid 203 is changed to glycine (E203G), whereas in the other, it is changed to lysine (E203K). Both the E203G and E203K mutations of lamin A are associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fatkin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jakobs et al., 2001</xref>), but the underlying molecular mechanism by which these mutations alter lamin A function is not known. Based on the results in the previous paragraph demonstrating that sumoylation of the lamin A protein occurs at lysine 201 and on previous results indicating the importance of glutamic acid for sumoylation at the preceding lysine of the Î¨KXE sumoylation consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Rodriguez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sampson et al., 2001</xref>), we hypothesized that the E203G and E203K mutations could possibly mediate their deleterious effects by resulting in decreased sumoylation of the lamin A protein. To test the feasibility of this hypothesis, we performed a transfection immunoprecipitation experiment similar to that shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, except that here the sumoylation of wild-type GFPâlamin A was compared with that of GFPâlamin A constructs containing the E203G or E203K mutations. The results of this experiment, shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> (bottom), indicate that both the E203G and E203K mutant lamin A proteins exhibit decreased sumoylation compared with the wild-type lamin A protein.</p><p>Sumoylation plays an important role in regulating the functional properties of target proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bossis and Melchior, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>). The wild-type lamin A protein exhibits a characteristic pattern of localization at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Broers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Capell and Collins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Mattout et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Parnaik and Manju, 2006</xref>). We hypothesized that sumoylation of lamin A at lysine 201 may be important for this localization pattern. To test this hypothesis, HeLa cells were transfected with the wild-type or K201R lamin A GFP fusion expression plasmids and then examined by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, the wild-type lamin A GFP fusion protein exhibits the typical pattern of relatively continuous nuclear peripheral localization. However, the K201R lamin A GFP fusion protein shows an altered localization pattern, with the mutant protein appearing to concentrate into foci. These results suggest that sumoylation of lamin A is important for the normal pattern of subcellular localization of this protein. Analysis of the subcellular localization of GFP fusion constructs of the E203G or E203K mutant lamin A proteins by fluorescence microscopy reveals that both of these mutant proteins exhibit altered localization patterns similar to that of the K201R mutant lamin A, in which these proteins are concentrated in foci, in contrast to the more continuous appearance of the wild-type lamin A at the nuclear periphery (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The pattern we observed for the E203G lamin A is similar to that observed by a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lloyd et al., 2002</xref>). To our knowledge, the localization of the E203K lamin A has not previously been reported. The percentages of cells exhibiting abnormal localization of the wild-type and mutant GFPâlamin A proteins are shown in Table S1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712124/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712124/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>SUMO site K201R mutant lamin A and cardiomyopathy-associated E203G and E203K mutant lamin A proteins exhibit similar patterns of aberrant localization.</bold> (A and B) Wild-type, K201R, E203G, and E203K lamin A GFP fusion expression plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells (A) or mouse embryonic cardiomyocytes (B), and the subcellular localization of the GFPâlamin A proteins was examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

The results, shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, indicate that the K201R, E203G, and E203K lamin A mutants all exhibit aberrant localization patterns in the cardiomyocytes (compared with wild-type lamin A) that are similar to those observed in HeLa cells. Percentages of cells exhibiting abnormal localization of wild-type and mutant GFPâlamin A are shown in Table S1.</p><p>In light of the defective sumoylation and aberrant localization patterns of the K201R, E203G, and E203K lamin A mutant proteins, we hypothesized that expression of these lamin A mutant proteins could result in decreased cell viability. The results shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref> indicate that this appears to be the case, as all three of these mutant lamin A proteins are associated with increased cell death.</p><p>In the final set of experiments, we examined skin fibroblasts obtained from a patient that is heterozygous for the E203K lamin A mutation, which, as already described, is associated with cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jakobs et al., 2001</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of lamin A from these cells followed by SUMO-2 Western blot indicates that, as expected, levels of sumoylation of lamin A are reduced in cells from this individual compared with cells of a normal individual (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). This individual is heterozygous for the E203K lamin A mutation, thus we expect that lamin A sumoylation was decreased but not eliminated. Further, immunofluorescence analysis of lamin A indicated more cells showing abnormal lamin A localization and nuclear morphology for the E203K fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The percentages of normal and E203K fibroblasts exhibiting abnormal lamin A localization/nuclear morphology are shown in Table S1.

The results of these experiments also show that lamin A sumoylation is decreased in transfected mutant E203G and E203K lamin A proteins that cause familial dilated cardiomyopathies and in lamin A of fibroblasts of individuals with the E203K mutation.

Further, cells transfected with the E203G and E203K lamin A proteins and skin fibroblasts of individuals with the E203K mutation exhibit higher levels of cell death compared with cells transfected with wild-type lamin A or normal skin fibroblasts, respectively.

Human skin fibroblasts (provided by R. Hershberger, University of Miami, Miami, FL) were cultured in the same media supplemented with 2 mM glutamine. Transfection of HeLa cells was performed using Effectene transfection reagent (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitation analysis and fluorescence microscopy were performed 48 h after the transfection. The GFPâlamin A plasmid was constructed from the pcDNA3.1-LMNA plasmid (gift of N.

Cell lysis was performed by sonication, after which the sample was incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4Â°C for 10 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and 20 Î¼l of the whole cell lysate was removed for analysis of the level of transfected GFPâlamin A. 300 Î¼l of 50% protein GâSepharose slurry (GE Healthcare) was washed three times with PBS and resuspended in RIPA buffer to make a 50% slurry. The cell lysate was precleared by mixing it with 150 Î¼l of this slurry and 5 Î¼g of goat IgG and incubating at 4Â°C for 60 min. After centrifugation at 4,000 rpm at 4Â°C for 1 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and mixed with 5 Î¼g of anti-GFP antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) or antiâlamin A antibody (BD Biosciences). After incubation at 4Â°C for 60 min, 150 Î¼l of 50% protein GâSepharose slurry was added and incubated at 4Â°C for 60 min.

After brief centrifugation, the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot using the antibodies described in the next section.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis and antibodies</title><p>SDS-PAGE and Western blot were performed according to standard procedures. The antibodies and dilutions used to probe the Western blots were as follows. Goat anti-GFP antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) was used at 1:2,000, mouse anti-HA antibody (gift from D. Andres laboratory, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY) was used at 1:2,000, goat antiâSUMO-1 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) was used at 1:1,000, rabbit antiâSUMO-2 antibody (Abgent) was used at 1:500, and rabbit antiâlamin A antibody (Abcam) was used at 1:500.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence and immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Cells were seeded on coverslips. At 48 h after transfection with the wild-type or point mutant GFPâlamin A expression constructs, HOECHST 33342 and verapamil were added to the medium to final concentrations of 5 and 50 Î¼g/ml, respectively. After incubation at 37Â°C for 30 min, the coverslips were washed twice with PBS and then incubated in 3.7% PFA at room temperature for 20 min. After two washes with PBS and a wash with distilled water, the coverslips were wicked on a kimwipe to partially dry and then mounted onto a slide spotted with 15 Î¼l of VectorShield (Vector Laboratories). For immunostaining, after two washes with PBS, the coverslips were incubated in PBS containing 3% BSA at 37Â°C for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit antiâlamin A antibody (1:1,000) at 37Â°C for 30 min. After the coverslip was washed twice with PBS, it was incubated with Fluorescein antiârabbit IgG (1:200) at 37Â°C for 30 min. After two washes with PBS and a brief wash with distilled water, the coverslip was mounted onto a slide spotted with 15 Î¼l of VectorShield. Excess fluid was wicked from the coverslips, and the edges of the coverslip were sealed with fingernail polish. The fluorescence was then visualized using a confocal (TCS SP5; Leica) or fluorescent (Nikon) microscope with a Spotcam digital-imaging camera (Nikon). Figures were made from the images using Photoshop (Adobe).</p></sec><sec><title>Trypan blue cell viability assay</title><p>Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 min at 4Â°C, and the pellet was washed twice with PBS. The cell pellet was then resuspended in PBS to a concentration of â¼10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. A one to one dilution of the suspension was prepared using a solution containing 0.4% trypan blue stain (Invitrogen), and the suspension was then loaded into the counting chamber of a hemacytometer. The number of stained cells, as well as the total number of cells, was counted, and the percentage of stained cells was taken to represent the percentage of cell death. Three datasets were analyzed for each experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was determined using Student's <italic>t</italic> test. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of cardiomyocytes</title><p>These cells were provided by W. Lester and J. Satin (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). All animals and animal procedures used in this study were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. E16 mouse (ICR outbred strain; Harlan) hearts were dissected free of connective tissues, and ventricles were separated from conotruncus and sinus venosus or atria. Cells were enzymatically dispersed and cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cribbs et al., 2001</xref>). In brief, 10â40 embryos were minced and quickly transferred to nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free digestion buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (type II; Worthington) and 1 mg/ml pancreatin for two 15-min cycles. Digested tissue yielded a large fraction of single spontaneously beating cells in culture media consisting of DME containing 10% FBS.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Table S1 contains quantitation analysis for the experiments in Fig. 3 (A and B) and Fig. 4 B. This table shows the percentages of HeLa cells or cardiomyocytes transfected with GFP lamin A wild-type, K201R, E203G, or E203K mutants that exhibit abnormal lamin A localization and the percentages of normal versus E203K lamin A fibroblasts showing abnormal lamin A localization/nuclear morphology.
