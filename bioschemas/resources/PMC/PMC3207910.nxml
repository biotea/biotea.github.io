      <abstract>
        <p>Many signaling proteins including G protein-coupled receptors localize to primary cilia, regulating cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis. Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) proteins are involved in maintaining ciliary function by mediating protein trafficking to the cilia. However, the mechanisms governing ciliary trafficking by BBS proteins are not well understood. Here, we show that a novel protein, Leucine-zipper transcription factor-like 1 (LZTFL1), interacts with a BBS protein complex known as the BBSome and regulates ciliary trafficking of this complex. We also show that all BBSome subunits and BBS3 (also known as ARL6) are required for BBSome ciliary entry and that reduction of LZTFL1 restores BBSome trafficking to cilia in BBS3 and BBS5 depleted cells. Finally, we found that BBS proteins and LZTFL1 regulate ciliary trafficking of hedgehog signal transducer, Smoothened. Our findings suggest that LZTFL1 is an important regulator of BBSome ciliary trafficking and hedgehog signaling.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Primary cilia are considered to be a signaling hub coordinating multiple signaling pathways. Impairment of ciliary function results in developmental defects in vertebrates and also underlies many human disorders including obesity, polycystic kidney disease, and retinopathy. BBS is a prototypical human genetic disorder associated with ciliary dysfunction. Among the known BBS proteins, seven form a complex, the BBSome, which was recently defined as a coat complex transporting membrane proteins between plasma and ciliary membranes. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling BBSome trafficking and the cargos transported by the BBSome are not well understood. In this work, we performed tandem affinity purification using transgenic mice expressing one of the BBSome subunits and identified a novel protein, LZTFL1, as a BBSome interacting protein. We determined that LZTLF1 negatively regulates BBSome ciliary trafficking and that reduction of LZTFL1 activity can compensate for loss of certain BBS proteins and restores BBSome ciliary trafficking. Furthermore, we discovered that BBSome and LZTFL1 regulate ciliary trafficking of Smoothened, a 7-transmembrane Hedgehog signal transducer. Our findings identify an important player in cilia biology and provide novel insights into the regulation of Hedgehog signaling, a crucial signaling pathway for organizing the body plan, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Primary cilia are microtubule-based subcellular organelles projecting from the surface of cells. Studies during the last decade have shown that primary cilia play essential roles in regulating cell cycle, embryonic development, and tissue homeostasis by acting as a cellular antenna transducing extracellular signals into the cells <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Singla1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Goetz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Loss of cilia or ciliary dysfunction has been linked to a series of related genetic disorders in humans <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Quinlan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Badano1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies, share common features such as cystic kidney disease, retinal degeneration, and polydactyly.</p>
      <p>Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is one of the human genetic disorders associated with ciliary dysfunction. Patients with BBS display obesity, polydactyly, retinal degeneration, renal abnormalities, diabetes, hypertension, hypogenitalism, and cognitive impairment. To date, as many as 16 genes have been reported to be involved in BBS <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Zaghloul1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Otto1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> (and references therein) and molecular functions of BBS proteins have begun to emerge. Among the known BBS proteins, seven proteins (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, BBS9) and BBIP10 form a stable complex, the BBSome, which mediates protein trafficking to the ciliary membrane <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Nachury1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Loktev1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. BBS3 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and controls BBSome recruitment to the membrane and BBSome ciliary entry <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Of the remaining, three BBS proteins (BBS6, BBS10, BBS12) form another complex with the CCT/TRiC family of group II chaperonins and mediate BBSome assembly <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Many receptor proteins and signaling molecules localize to cilia, and the BBSome is involved in transporting at least some of these proteins. For example, several G-protein coupled receptors such as MCHR1, SSTR3, and Dopamine receptor 1 (D1) fail to localize to or abnormally accumulate within the neuronal cilia in <italic>Bbs2</italic> and <italic>Bbs4</italic> null brains <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Domire1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Berbari1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In <italic>Chlamydomonas bbs4</italic> mutants, several proteins aberrantly accumulate within flagella <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Lechtreck1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, most of the BBSome cargos are currently unknown in mammalian cells. Also unknown is how the trafficking activity of the BBSome is regulated.</p>
      <p>In an effort to understand how BBSome function is regulated, we initiated studies to identify BBSome interacting proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this work, we show that LZTFL1 interacts with the BBSome and negatively regulates its trafficking activity to the cilia. We also provide evidence that the BBSome and LZTFL1 are part of the transport mechanism of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signal transducer, Smoothened (SMO), that localizes to cilia <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Corbit1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Transgenic LAP-BBS4 is functionally equivalent to endogenous Bbs4</title>
        <p>To isolate BBSome interacting proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a transgenic mouse line expressing <italic>LAP-BBS4</italic>, which allows localization studies and tandem affinity purification using GFP and S tags, under the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter. We used mouse testis, where BBS genes are the most abundantly expressed. Expression of <italic>LAP-BBS4</italic> in the testis is approximately 2â3 fold higher than that of endogenous <italic>Bbs4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). We first tested whether the recombinant LAP-BBS4 protein is functionally equivalent to endogenous Bbs4. We tested this by three criteria: 1) whether LAP-BBS4 physically associates with other BBSome subunits and is incorporated into the BBSome, 2) whether LAP-BBS4 properly localizes and reproduces the endogenous Bbs4 localization pattern, and 3) whether LAP-BBS4 can functionally rescue the BBS phenotype caused by loss of Bbs4. To confirm the incorporation of LAP-BBS4 into the BBSome, extracts from wild-type, <italic>Bbs4<sup>â/â</sup></italic>, and <italic>LAP-BBS4</italic> transgenic mouse testes were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) with anti-GFP antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s001">Figure S1B</xref>, pull-down of LAP-BBS4 efficiently co-precipitated all BBSome subunits tested (BBS1, BBS2 and BBS7). In spermatozoa, endogenous Bbs4 is found in the middle piece and the principle piece of the flagella (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Within the principle piece, Bbs4 staining is more intense at the proximal end and gradually decreases toward the distal end of the flagellum. LAP-BBS4 detected by GFP antibody shows a similar localization pattern. Finally, introduction of the <italic>LAP-BBS4</italic> transgene into <italic>Bbs4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice restores sperm flagella, which are lost in <italic>Bbs4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s001">Figure S1D</xref>), and fertility to <italic>Bbs4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice; all four transgenic <italic>Bbs4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> males mated with wild-type females produced pups, while <italic>Bbs4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> males without the transgene did not produce any pups. Based on these criteria, we concluded that LAP-BBS4 is functionally equivalent to endogenous Bbs4.</p>

        <title>Identification of Lztfl1 as a BBSome-interacting protein</title>
        <p>Protein extracts from wild-type and <italic>LAP-BBS4</italic> transgenic testes were subjected to tandem affinity purification. In <italic>LAP-BBS4</italic> transgenic testis, all BBSome subunits (Bbs1, Bbs2, Bbs5, Bbs7, Bbs8, and Bbs9) were co-purified with LAP-BBS4, while no BBS proteins were purified when wild-type testes were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s009">Table S1</xref>). In the LAP-BBS4 transgenic sample, one prominent additional protein was co-purified with BBSome subunits. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that this protein is Leucine zipper transcription factor-like 1 (Lztfl1). To confirm the interaction and to identify other LZTFL1 interacting proteins, we generated a stable cell line expressing LZTFL1 with FLAG and S tags (FS-LZTFL1) and conducted tandem affinity purification. In this experiment, at least three BBSome subunits (BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9) were co-purified with FS-LZTFL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s010">Table S2</xref>). In addition, we found endogenous LZTFL1 proteins were co-purified, indicating that LZTFL1 forms homo-oligomers. Homo-oligomerization of LZTFL1 was confirmed by co-IP and <italic>in vitro</italic> crosslinking experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s002">Figure S2D and S2E</xref>). We also found two additional, smaller isoforms of LZTFL1. Although it is unclear whether these smaller forms are <italic>bona fide</italic> LZTFL1 isoforms or cleavage products derived from the over-expressed FS-LZTFL1, EST database searches revealed the presence of smaller isoforms of LZTFL1 (AK093705 and AK303416) with predicted molecular weights approximately the same as the isoforms observed by us.</p>

            <p>(A) Co-purification of Lztfl1 as a BBSome-interacting protein from LAP-BBS4 transgenic mouse testis. Lysates from WT and Tg testes were subjected to TAP and purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. Protein size markers (M) were loaded in the left lane. (B) FS-LZTFL1 (blue arrowhead) and its associated proteins were isolated by TAP from HEK293T cells and visualized by silver staining. Parental cells were used as a control. Red arrowhead indicates endogenous LZTFL1, and asterisk, two smaller forms of LZTFL1. (C) LZTFL1 interacts with BBS9 within the BBSome. Each subunit of the BBSome (HA-tagged) was co-transfected with Myc-tagged LZTFL1 into HEK293T cells and lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-HA antibodies. Bottom panel shows immunoprecipitated BBS proteins and middle, Myc-LZTFL1 in the lysates. The top panel shows Myc-LZTFL1 precipitated by anti-HA antibodies. (D) BBS9 binds to the C-terminal half of LZTFL1. Full-length and several deletion mutant variants of Myc-LZTFL1 were co-transfected with HA-BBS9 in HEK293T cells. Myc-GFP was used as a negative control and anti-Myc antibody was used for IP. Numbers indicate expressed portions of LZTFL1 in amino acid positions. (E) The vast majority of Lztfl1 is not associated with the BBSome. Lysates from WT mouse testis and eye were subjected to size exclusion chromatography using Superose-6 10/300 GL column.

        <p>To determine the LZTFL1-interacting subunit of the BBSome, each individual subunit of the BBSome was co-transfected with LZTFL1 and analyzed for co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In this experiment, we found that BBS9 is the LZTFL1-interacting subunit of the BBSome. Based on interaction domain mapping studies, the C-terminal half of LZTFL1 (amino acid (aa) 145â299) was found to interact with BBS9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Within BBS9, the fragment containing aa 685â765 interacted with LZTFL1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s002">Figure S2F</xref>), which is a part of the Î±-helix domain at the C-terminus after the Î±/Î² platform domain <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In size exclusion chromatography, the peak of LZTFL1 was separated from that of the BBSome, suggesting that LZTFL1 is not a constitutive component of the BBSome and only a subset of LZTFL1 is associated with the BBSome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

A leucine-zipper domain is present as part of the coiled-coil domain. InterPro Domain Scan analysis indicates that aa 212â295 of LZTFL1 has sequence homology to the t-SNARE domain (IPR010989).

        <title>LZTFL1 is a specific regulator of BBSome ciliary trafficking</title>
        <p>Next, we sought to determine the biological functions of LZTFL1. Since the BBSome is involved in protein trafficking to the ciliary membrane and LZTFL1 interacts with the BBSome, we investigated whether LZTFL1 has any cilia related functions. To this end, we examined whether LZTFL1 is involved in cilia formation, cilia stability, or cilia length. We found no differences in cilia formation after serum withdrawal, cilia stability upon serum treatment, or the length of cilia in LZTFL1 depleted hTERT-RPE1 cells (data not shown). We next examined whether LZTFL1 is involved in BBSome assembly, BBS protein stability, or BBSome trafficking. We found no defects in BBSome assembly or BBS protein stability in LZTFL1 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and data not shown). However, we noticed a dramatic alteration in BBSome localization when we ablated LZTFL1. Normally, BBS proteins localize either within cilia or around centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In our experimental conditions, some 42% of control siRNA transfected cells show ciliary localization of BBS9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g002">Figure 2D, 2F</xref>). However, when LZTFL1 was depleted by RNA interference (RNAi), we observed a consistent and striking increase of BBS9 within the cilia with a concomitant decrease in the centriolar satellite pool of BBS9. In contrast, over-expression of wild-type LZTFL1 inhibited ciliary localization of BBS9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g002">Figure 2E, 2F</xref>). Interestingly, over-expression of an LZTFL1 deletion mutant, which lacks the N-terminal 70 amino acids, behaved as a dominant negative form and increased ciliary localization of BBS9. Substitution of two highly conserved basic amino acids (KR) within that region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) was sufficient to cause the same increase in BBS9 ciliary localization. Similar results were observed for BBS4 and BBS8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s004">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that LZTFL1 regulates ciliary localization of the entire BBSome rather than merely BBS9. Combined with the LZTFL1 localization and <italic>in situ</italic> PLA results, our data indicate that LZTFL1 binds to the BBSome in the cytoplasm and inhibits BBSome ciliary entry. Alternatively, LZTFL1 may promote ciliary exit of the BBSome. Our data also suggest that LZTFL1 has bipartite functional domains; the C-terminal half of LZTFL1 is responsible for BBSome binding and the N-terminal half is for regulating BBSome trafficking activity.</p>

More importantly, over-expression of wild-type or mutant variants of LZTFL1 had no impact on ciliary localization of IFT proteins.

        <title>Requirement of all BBSome subunits for BBSome ciliary localization</title>
        <p>Previously, several BBSome subunits have been shown to be essential for BBSome ciliary localization in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1002358-Lechtreck1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Ou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, it has not been systematically investigated which BBSome subunits are essential for BBSome ciliary localization and which are dispensable. To address this, we transfected siRNAs against each BBSome subunit and BBS3, which is involved in BBSome ciliary trafficking <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, into hTERT-RPE1 cells and probed localization of BBS8 and BBS9. Quantitative real-time PCR results confirmed efficient knock-down of each BBS gene expression after siRNA transfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s006">Figure S6</xref>). By using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that all BBSome subunits and BBS3 are required for BBSome ciliary localization and loss of any single BBSome subunit precluded ciliary entry of the BBSome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Interestingly, however, the localization pattern of BBS9 (and BBS8) was distinct depending on which BBSome subunit was depleted, suggesting differences in their roles within the BBSome. For example, in BBS1 depleted cells, both BBS8 and BBS9 showed concentric enrichment around the centrosomes with a great increase in the staining intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). This suggests that BBSome components may form aggregates near the centrosomes in the absence of BBS1. Alternatively, BBS1 may be required to return the BBSome back to the cytoplasm. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation results are more consistent with the second possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In BBS2 depleted cells, overall staining intensity of BBS9 was greatly decreased. When we measured BBS9 protein level in BBS2 depleted cells, the amount of BBS9 was significantly reduced compared to control siRNA or other BBS gene siRNA transfected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). In addition, we found BBS2 protein level was also significantly decreased in BBS9 depleted cells, suggesting that BBS2 and BBS9 are dependent on each other for stable expression. Together, these data indicate that only the intact BBSome can enter the cilia.</p>
        <p>To gain insight into the molecular basis of this requirement of each BBSome subunit for BBSome ciliary entry, we investigated the status of BBSome assembly after individual BBSome subunit depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To this end, hTERT-PRE1 cells were transfected with siRNAs against control and each BBS gene, and cell lysates were analyzed by 10â40% sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Consistent with the previous result and formation of the BBSome <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Nachury1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, BBS4 and BBS9 were found in the same fraction in control siRNA transfected cells. However, in BBS1 depleted cells, BBS4 and BBS9 were found in separate and lower molecular weight fractions, indicating that BBS4 and BBS9 were not associated in the absence of BBS1. Similarly, depletion of BBS2 and BBS9 also caused disintegration of the BBSome with a significant reduction in BBS9 levels. In BBS4 and BBS8 depleted cells, although there was some disassembly of the BBSome, a significant proportion of the BBSome was still found to be intact. In BBS7 depleted cells, BBS4 and BBS9 were found in the same fractions but the peak was significantly shifted from that of control cells, suggesting that at least one additional subunit is missing from the BBSome in the absence of BBS7. Of note are BBS3 and BBS5 depleted cells. In these cells, the vast majority of the BBSome remained intact, suggesting that BBS3 and BBS5 are not required for BBSome assembly. LZTFL1 depletion or over-expression did not cause any change in BBSome assembly, suggesting that LZTFL1 does not function by modulating BBSome assembly. IFT88, a component of the IFT-B subcomplex, was found in separate fractions from the BBSome and none of the BBS or LZTFL1 perturbations caused any change in IFT88 migration. Together, these data suggest that BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9, all of which have Î²-propeller domains, are required for BBSome assembly (e.g. forming a core scaffold and required for recruitment of at least one additional BBSome subunit), while BBS4, BBS5, and BBS8 have relatively minor or no impact on BBSome assembly and are likely to be in the periphery of the BBSome.</p>

        <title>Depletion of LZTFL1 restores BBSome ciliary localization in BBS3 and BBS5 depleted cells</title>
        <p>Since LZTFL1 is a negative regulator of BBSome ciliary entry, we tested whether LZTFL1 depletion can rescue the BBSome mislocalization phenotype caused by loss of BBSome subunits. We ablated <italic>LZTFL1</italic> expression together with each of the BBSome subunits by RNAi and probed localization of BBS8 and BBS9. Indeed, LZTFL1 knock-down significantly increased ciliary localization of BBS8 in most cells, particularly in BBS3 and BBS5 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Ciliary localization of BBS9 was also rescued by LZTFL1 knock-down in all cases except for BBS1 and BBS4 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s007">Figure S7</xref>). It is unclear whether the more efficient rescue of BBS9 ciliary localization compared to BBS8 is due to the higher sensitivity of anti-BBS9 antibody or whether it represents features of partial BBSome complexes lacking some BBSome subunits (such as BBS8). Whichever is the case, it is clear that LZTFL1 knock-down can restore ciliary localization of the BBSome at least in BBS3 and BBS5 depleted cells. It is noteworthy that BBS3 and BBS5 are the BBS proteins that have minimal impact on BBSome assembly. Therefore, as long as the BBSome forms, reducing LZTFL1 activity can restore BBSome trafficking to cilia.</p>

        <title>BBSome and LZTFL1 regulate SMO ciliary trafficking</title>
        <p>Since polydactyly is one of the cardinal features of BBS and a hallmark phenotype of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling defect, we examined roles of BBSome and LZTFL1 in the SHH pathway. We first examined the requirement of LZTFL1 for SMO ciliary localization in hTERT-RPE1 cells, which express SMO endogenously. In control siRNA transfected cells, SMO localizes to the cilia in response to SMO agonist (SAG) but not in SAG-untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, in LZTFL1 depleted cells, ciliary localization of SMO was found in a significant number of cells even without SAG treatment and further increased by SAG treatment. For BBS genes, we tested BBS1, BBS3, and BBS5: two genes (BBS3 and BSB5) that LZTFL1 depletion can restore ciliary trafficking of the BBSome, and one gene (BBS1) that cannot be restored with LZTFL1 depletion. In contrast to LZTFL1 depleted cells, ciliary localization of SMO was significantly decreased in BBS depleted, SAG-treated cells. Consistent with the restoration of BBSome trafficking to cilia in LZTFL1 depleted cells, ablation of LZTFL1 expression in BBS3 and BBS5, but not in BBS1, depleted cells restored ciliary localization of SMO. These data indicate that BBSome function facilitates ciliary localization of SMO and that LZTFL1 suppresses SMO localization to cilia.</p>

        <p>Although we were not able to detect physical interactions between the endogenous BBSome and SMO in hTERT-RPE1 cells, presumably due to the transient nature of the interaction and the difficulty of extracting membrane proteins without disrupting protein-protein interactions, we found that several BBS proteins can associate with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail domain of SMO (aa 542â793) in transiently transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Previously, two amino acids (WR; aa 549â550) immediately downstream of the 7th transmembrane domain of SMO were shown to be essential for SMO ciliary localization <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Corbit1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Deletion of this WR motif from the cytoplasmic tail of SMO abolished interaction between BBS proteins and SMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002358-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). These data suggest that the BBSome may directly interact with SMO and mediates SMO ciliary localization.</p>
        <p>Finally, we investigated whether downstream HH target gene expression is affected by loss of BBSome and LZTFL1 function. In hTERT-RPE1 cells, HH target gene <italic>GLI1</italic> expression was relatively mildly induced by SAG treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). Depletion of BBS1, BBS3, and BBS5 modestly but consistently reduced <italic>GLI1</italic> expression. We also used mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, which show robust responsiveness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002358.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). Consistent with the results from hTERT-PRE1 cells, knock-down of BBS gene expression significantly reduced <italic>Gli1</italic> expression in MEF cells. Although statistically not significant compared with BBS3 and BBS5 single knockdowns, reduction of Lztfl1 activity tends to restore <italic>Gli1</italic> expression in Bbs3 and Bbs5 depleted cells. Interestingly, while LZTFL1 depletion resulted in ciliary translocation of SMO even in SAG-untreated cells, <italic>GLI1</italic> expression did not increase in LZTFL1 depleted cells, suggesting that SMO accumulated within the cilia in LZTFL1 depleted cells is not activated. This is consistent with the idea that Smo is constantly transported in and out of the cilia even in the inactive state <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Ocbina1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and the recent finding of the 2-step model of SMO activation <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Rohatgi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

      <p>BBSome functions as a coat complex to transport membrane proteins between plasma and ciliary membranes <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In this work, we identify LZTFL1 as a negative regulator of BBSome trafficking to the ciliary membrane. Our data indicate that LZTFL1 associates with the BBSome within the cytoplasm and inhibits ciliary entry of the BBSome. Alternatively, LZTFL1 may promote the exit of BBSomes from the cilia. Although we cannot completely rule out the second possibility, currently available data favor the entry inhibition model over the exit promotion model. First, LZTFL1 does not show any enrichment around the basal body or within the cilia either by immunological methods or by GFP-fused recombinant protein. Many proteins involved in vesicle trafficking commonly show some degree of enrichment around the donor compartment. BBSomes also show enrichment around the basal body and within the cilia with a gradual increase toward the ciliary base, which is consistent with the model that the BBSome is recruited to the plasma membrane near the basal body for ciliary entry and to the ciliary membrane at the ciliary base for exit. However, LZTFL1 does not show this localization pattern. Second, although BBSomes show enrichment around the basal body and within the cilia, LZTFL1-associated BBSomes are found scattered throughout the cytoplasm, which is consistent with the idea that LZTFL1 associates with the BBSome within the cytoplasm and limits ciliary access of the BBSome. These observations strongly favor the BBSome ciliary entry inhibition model. Localization of LZTFL1 to the cytoplasm with cilia-related function is similar to the recently characterized seahorse/Lrrc6, which also localizes to the cytoplasm and regulates cilia-mediated processes <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Kishimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our findings indicate that every BBS gene tested so far is required for ciliary entry of the BBSome and loss of any single BBS protein commonly results in a failure of BBSome ciliary trafficking. This is not limited to BBSome subunits but also found with depletion of other BBS proteins that are not part of the BBSome including BBS3, BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12 (this study and S.S. and V.C.S. unpublished results). These findings suggest that a failure of BBSome ciliary trafficking is a common cellular feature of BBS and support the idea that BBS results from a trafficking defect to the cilia membrane. However, the precise mechanism leading to BBSome mis-localization is different depending on the missing BBS proteins. For example, BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9, which commonly contain Î²-propeller domains, are likely to form the scaffold/core of the BBSome and required to recruit other BBSome subunits. BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12 were previously shown to be required for BBSome assembly by interacting with these Î²-propeller domain containing BBS proteins <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. BBS4, BBS5, and BBS8 are likely to be at the periphery of the BBSome and have limited impact on BBSome assembly. However, BBS4 interacts with p150<sup>glued</sup> subunit of the cytoplasmic dynein machinery and may link the BBSome to the cytoplasmic dynein motor protein <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. BBS5 was shown to interact with PIPs and may be involved in the association of the BBSome to the membrane <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Nachury1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The function of BBS8 is currently unknown and requires further characterization. Despite these functional differences, all BBS proteins are essential for BBSome assembly or ciliary trafficking and only the holo-BBSome enters the cilia. BBSome mis-localization may be used as a cell-based assay to evaluate BBS candidate genes. Remarkably, reducing LZTFL1 activity restores BBSome trafficking to the cilia at least in BBS3 and BBS5 depleted cells. It appears that decreased LZTFL1 activity can compensate for the loss of certain BBS proteins, which are required for BBSome ciliary entry, as long as the BBSome is formed. This implies that certain BBS subtypes may be treated by modulating LZTFL1 activities.</p>
      <p>Polydactyly is one of the cardinal features of BBS found in the vast majority of human BBS patients <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Quinlan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and also a hallmark phenotype of disrupted SHH signaling or IFT function <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Goetz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Haycraft1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Several additional features including mid-facial defects and neural crest cell migration defects found in BBS mutant animals are also linked to SHH signaling defects <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Tobin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, it is speculated that BBS proteins may be involved in SHH signaling. In this work, we show that BBS proteins are involved in ciliary trafficking of SMO. We found that the SMO cytoplasmic tail domain physical interacts with the BBSome at least in overexpressed conditions, while ciliary localization defective mutant SMO does not. Furthermore, ablation of LZTFL1 increases SMO ciliary localization. These data indicate that BBS proteins and LZTFL1 are at least part of the SMO ciliary trafficking mechanism. It remains to be shown that ciliary transport of Smo occurs together with the BBSome (e.g. by live cell imaging) and in a directly BBSome-dependent manner.</p>
      <p>Our data also suggest the presence of alternative ciliary trafficking mechanisms for SMO. For example, although ciliary localization of SMO is significantly reduced by BBSome depletion, it is not completely abolished, while ciliary localization of BBS8 and BBS9 is severely reduced. HH target gene <italic>GLI1</italic> expression is also relatively mildly affected by BBS protein depletion. This suggests that the BBSome is only part of the transport mechanism and that there is likely to be another mechanism by which SMO is transported to the cilia. Currently, it is unknown whether IFT proteins can directly mediate SMO ciliary trafficking or are involved indirectly. These findings suggest that although BBS proteins are involved in Smo ciliary trafficking, the presence of alternative mechanisms is sufficient to support normal development of neural tubes and survival in BBS mutants. In addition, while polydactyly is very common in human BBS patients, none of the BBS mouse models generated so far display polydactyly as is seen in Smo or Shh mutants <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Goetz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, implying a potential species-specific requirement of BBS proteins or differential threshold in SHH signaling in the limb bud.</p>
      <p>While BBS and IFT proteins are part of the transport machinery (like a train) to deliver cargos to and from the cilia, NPHP, MKS, and Tectonic proteins localize to the transition zone and function like a station (or immigration official) to control the entry and exit of the ciliary proteins. For example, Garcia-Gonzalo, <italic>et al</italic>. recently showed that the Tectonic complex, which consists of Tctn1, Tctn2, Tctn3, Mks1, Mks2, Mks3, Cc2d2a, B9d1, and Cep290, localizes to the transition zone of cilia and controls ciliary membrane composition <xref rid="pgen.1002358-GarciaGonzalo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. NPHP1, NPHP4, and NPHP8 form another complex at the transition zone and functions as a âgate keeperâ together with other NPHP and MKS proteins <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Sang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002358-Craige1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These NPHP, MKS, and Tctn protein functions also appear to be partly redundant. In this model, one can envisage certain ciliary proteins transported by the BBSome and allowed to enter the cilia by the Tectonic complex. Some other proteins may be transported by a non-BBSomal mechanism and granted access to cilia by the Tectonic complex or by NPHP1â4â8 complex. LZTFL1 is a specific regulator of BBSome ciliary trafficking activity. Some other proteins may regulate activities of IFT complex or specific transition zone complexes. Obtaining a complete picture of ciliary protein transport will be the focus of future studies to understand the precise mechanisms of cilia-related disorders.</p>

          <p>Reduction of LZTFL1 activity restores BBSome ciliary trafficking in BBS3 and BBS5 depleted cells. (A) Localization of BBS8 was probed by immunofluorescence after transfecting indicated siRNAs into hTERT-RPE1 cells. Cilia are labeled with antibodies for acetylated tubulin and Î³-tubulin (green) and BBS8 is in red. (B) RPE1 cells were transfected with indicated BBS and LZTFL1 (Lz) siRNAs and BBS8 localization (red) was examined. (C) BBS9 localization (red) was examined after depleting BBS genes and LZTFL1. Note that some panels are also shown in Figure 6. Scale bar, 10 Âµm. (D,E) Summary of BBSome ciliary localization. Graphs represent average percentages of BBS8 (D) and BBS9 (E) positive cilia from at least two independent experiments with minimum 100 cells counted in each experiment.
