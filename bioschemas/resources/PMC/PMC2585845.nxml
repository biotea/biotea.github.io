      <abstract>
        <p>Primary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare syndrome characterized by accumulation of surfactant in the lungs that is presumed to be mediated by disruption of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling based on studies in genetically modified mice. The effects of GM-CSF are mediated by heterologous receptors composed of GM-CSF binding (GM-CSF-RÎ±) and nonbinding affinity-enhancing (GM-CSF-RÎ²) subunits. We describe PAP, failure to thrive, and increased GM-CSF levels in two sisters aged 6 and 8 yr with abnormalities of both GM-CSF-RÎ±âencoding alleles (<italic>CSF2RA</italic>). One was a 1.6-Mb deletion in the pseudoautosomal region of one maternal X chromosome encompassing <italic>CSF2RA</italic>. The other, a point mutation in the paternal X chromosome allele encoding a G174R substitution, altered an N-linked glycosylation site within the cytokine binding domain and glycosylation of GM-CSF-RÎ±, severely reducing GM-CSF binding, receptor signaling, and GM-CSFâdependent functions in primary myeloid cells. Transfection of cloned cDNAs faithfully reproduced the signaling defect at physiological GM-CSF concentrations. Interestingly, at high GM-CSF concentrations similar to those observed in the index patient, signaling was partially rescued, thereby providing a molecular explanation for the slow progression of disease in these children. These results establish that GM-CSF signaling is critical for surfactant homeostasis in humans and demonstrate that mutations in <italic>CSF2RA</italic> cause familial PAP.</p>

  <body><p>Pulmonary surfactant homeostasis is maintained by the balanced production of surfactant by alveolar epithelium and its clearance by pulmonary alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). GM-CSF is a critical regulator of surfactant homeostasis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). GM-CSF, via heterologous cell surface receptors comprised of Î± and Î² glycoprotein subunits (GM-CSF-RÎ± and GM-CSF-RÎ², respectively), activates STAT5 and other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). N-linked glycosylation of the Î± subunit is required for GM-CSF binding and receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In mice, deficiency of GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) or its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) impairs multiple functions of alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), including surfactant catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), which results in progressive surfactant accumulation.</p><p>Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a syndrome characterized by respiratory failure caused by pulmonary surfactant accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), which can be grouped into distinct categories based on clinical, histopathologic, biochemical, and genetic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Primary PAP occurs when GM-CSF signaling is disrupted, for example in individuals with high levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies, which are presumed to mediate pathogenesis by neutralizing GM-CSF and reducing surfactant catabolism by alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). This form, referred to as autoimmune PAP, comprises 90% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Primary PAP has also been associated with reduced detection of GM-CSF-RÎ² on myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), but definitive studies demonstrating heritable deficiency of either GM-CSF or its receptors as the cause of PAP in humans are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Secondary PAP occurs as a consequence of an underlying disease presumed to impair surfactant clearance by reducing either the numbers or functions of alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Hereditary disorders of surfactant production, for example, because of mutations in the genes encoding surfactant protein (SP)âB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), SP-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), or ABCA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), exhibit disordered surfactant homeostasis to varying degrees but are distinguished from PAP by their surfactant dysfunction, disruption of alveolar wall architecture, and clinical course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). In this paper, we describe a family in which two children developed primary PAP in association with loss of GM-CSF responsiveness caused by mutations in the gene encoding GM-CSF-RÎ±.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Clinical presentation and phenotype</title><p>The index patient presented at age six with a 2-yr history of progressive tachypnea and failure to thrive (height and weight were third percentile for age [Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080990/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080990/DC1</ext-link>]). Gestation, delivery, birth weight (3.66 kg, 50th percentile), and development were all normal, but weight gain slowed by 6â9 mo as did height by 2â3 yr. There was no history of cough, fever, chest pain, pneumonia or other pulmonary disease, environmental exposure, or drug use. Both parents were well-developed and healthy with no history of lung disease. Examination revealed moderate tachypnea, mild tachycardia, and inspiratory crackles but was otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary function testing revealed severe restrictive impairment. Oxygen saturation was 88% while breathing room air and decreased while talking or walking a short distance. A diagnosis of PAP was suspected based on chest radiography (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and established by histopathologic examination of lung tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). A serum GM-CSF autoantibody test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) was negative on two occasions. The patient was transferred to Cincinnati Children's Hospital and underwent whole lung lavage therapy with marked symptomatic and radiographical improvement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). MCP-1 and M-CSF levels in the lavage were increased compared with healthy controls (supplemental text, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080990/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080990/DC1</ext-link>), which is similar to findings in autoimmune PAP patients and GM-CSF KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotypic characterization of patients with familial PAP.</bold> (A) Chest radiograph (top) and high-resolution computed tomogram of the chest (bottom) of the index patient at presentation. (B) Histopathologic appearance of the open lung biopsy from the index patient after staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) or immunostaining for SP-A, mature SP-B, ProâSP-C, SP-D, and ABCA3.

(D) Serum SP-D levels in affected siblings, parents, and a control. The mean Â± SD serum SP-D concentration in 67 healthy controls was 63.5 Â± 39 ng/ml (hatched region) and in 12 patients with autoimmune PAP was 174 Â± 83 ng/ml (not indicated). (E) High-resolution computed tomogram showing diffuse patchy ground glass opacities representing mild PAP in the affected sister.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052703f01"/></fig><p>An inherited defect in GM-CSF receptor function was suspected based on the constellation of histopathology showing well-preserved alveolar wall architecture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), the absence of GM-CSF autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), and an abnormal CD11b stimulation index test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Therefore, all immediate family members were evaluated. Because SP is in serum in PAP and levels reflect lung disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), serum SP-D was measured and found to be increased in the patient compared with her parents and controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Unexpectedly, the patient's 8-yr-old sister, who was previously thought to be healthy, had increased serum SP-D. Subsequent clinical evaluation revealed that the sister had poor growth (height and weight, 10th percentile for age; Fig. S1B), a diffusion capacity for carbon dioxide of 57% that predicted, and mild patchy ground glass opacities throughout both lungs, which are consistent with a diagnosis of PAP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Structure and function of the GM-CSF receptor</title><p>Flow cytometry indicated that GM-CSF-RÎ± and GM-CSF-RÎ² were present on blood leukocytes in all family members (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Western blotting revealed an abnormal electrophoretic pattern for GM-CSF-RÎ± in the patient and her sister with predominantly lower molecular mass forms compared with the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The father was heterozygous for normal and lower molecular mass forms. Unexpectedly, the mother exhibited only a normal pattern. To evaluate cell-mediated clearance of GM-CSF, blood mononuclear cells from the patient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) and her sister (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080990/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080990/DC1</ext-link>) were incubated with GM-CSF, and both failed to clear GM-CSF in contrast to control and parental leukocytes. The concentration of GM-CSF in lung lavage was markedly increased in the patient compared with healthy controls, in whom it was undetectable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). The in vivo concentration of pulmonary GM-CSF in the epithelial lining fluid of the lungs was estimated to be 6.9 and 27 ng/ml (right and left lungs, respectively) using the urea dilution method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Pulmonary GM-CSF was also increased in <italic>CSF2RB</italic>-deficient mice (Fig. S3), confirming the relationship between GM-CSF receptor dysfunction and increased pulmonary GM-CSF levels. Serum GM-CSF was increased in both affected siblings and undetectable in both parents and control, indicating that the abnormality was systemic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). GM-CSF receptor function was impaired in both affected siblings, as shown by reduced GM-CSFâstimulated phosphorylation of STAT5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>) and failure of GM-CSF to increase CD11b levels on leukocytes from the patient compared with controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Structural and functional analysis of GM-CSF receptor defects.</bold> (A) Flow cytometry demonstrating GM-CSF-RÎ± and GM-CSF-RÎ² on the cell surface of peripheral blood leukocytes in all family members. (B) Western blots of PBMC lysates using antibodies to detect GM-CSF-RÎ± or actin as indicated. (C) GM-CSF clearance assay. Blood leukocytes from the patient were unable to remove exogenous GM-CSF added to culture medium at time zero in contrast to leukocytes from two controls that rapidly bound and cleared GM-CSF. Error bars show the means Â± SE. (D and E) Measurement of GM-CSF concentration by ELISA. GM-CSF was readily detected in lavage from the patient but was not detected (ND) in lung lavage from nine healthy controls (D). GM-CSF was detected in the serum of affected siblings but not their parents or a control (E). (F) Blood leukocytes isolated from the indicated family members were incubated for 15 min in the absence (â) or presence (+) of 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, followed by Western blotting of cell lysates to detect total STAT5 (STAT5), phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5), or actin. (G) Measurement of the GM-CSFâstimulated increase in CD11b levels on leukocytes in whole blood.

The relative fluorescence of fluorescently labeled DNA from the patient (open circles) compared with a same-sex reference DNA (filled circles) after hybridization to various BAC clones on the SignatureSelect V2 chip representing the Xp22.33 region is shown. Reduced hybridization to several BAC clones (clones B and C) is indicated by the lower fluorescence of the patient's DNA compared with the reference DNA for these BAC clones. The telomeric breakpoint is mapped to between clones A and B and the centromeric breakpoint is mapped to between clones C and D.

Treatment of transduced cell lysates with Peptide: N-Glycosidase F, an amidase that cleaves between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose oligosaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), resulted in a similar electrophoretic pattern for normal and G174R GM-CSF-RÎ±. This confirmed the G174R mutation alters N-linked glycosylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) by disrupting a functional N-linked glycosylation site and that glycosylation is responsible for the smaller molecular forms from this allele. GM-CSF-RÎ² was expressed in <italic>CSF2RB</italic>-transfected cells but was undetectable in nontransfected cells (unpublished data). GM-CSF binding studies demonstrated that cells expressing <italic>CSF2RA</italic><sup>WT</sup> and <italic>CSF2RB</italic> rapidly bound GM-CSF and removed it from the media, whereas cells expressing <italic>CSF2RA</italic><sup>G174R</sup> and <italic>CSF2RB</italic> or <italic>CSF2RB</italic> alone did not clear GM-CSF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

These are the first results to demonstrate familial primary PAP in humans and that GM-CSF-RÎ± is critical for surfactant homeostasis. They extend previous findings that PAP is caused by the absence of GM-CSF or GM-CSF-RÎ² in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) or is specifically associated with the presence of neutralizing GM-CSF autoantibodies or a reduction in alveolar macrophage numbers or function in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). The allelic frequency of these mutations has not been determined but may be rare given that autoantibodies against GM-CSF account for most individuals with PAP.</p><p>Both affected siblings had impaired pulmonary function and failure to thrive, supporting the conclusion that prolonged respiratory insufficiency in children retards growth. Important to this conclusion is the observation that Xp22.33 deletion did not include the <italic>SHOX</italic> (<italic>short stature homeobox</italic>) gene, the deletion of which impairs growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Further, heterozygous loss of <italic>CSF2RA</italic> in the mother did not impair growth. Early results suggest that whole lung lavage therapy was followed by an increase in growth acceleration in the index patient.</p><p>This study highlights the usefulness of several novel biomarkers in the diagnostic evaluation of PAP. The combination of a negative GM-CSF autoantibody test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) and an abnormal CD11b stimulation index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) predicted the GM-CSF receptor dysfunction, which was confirmed by the lack of GM-CSF binding and defective GM-CSF receptor signaling. GM-CSF levels were increased in lung lavage from the patient and, in serum from the patient and her sister, compared with family members and healthy controls. Because primary PAP is presumed to be caused by a defect in GM-CSF regulation of alveolar macrophage surfactant catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), an elevated serum GM-CSF level may be useful as a biomarker to distinguish primary PAP caused by GM-CSF autoantibodies (90% of all cases of PAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>) from PAP caused by GM-CSF receptor dysfunction (this study; references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) and PAP caused by GM-CSF deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) (not yet reported in humans). Finally, an increased serum SP-D level predicted the occurrence of PAP in the sister, which was confirmed by subsequent clinical and radiographical evaluation.</p><p>The slow progression and differences in severity of the lung disease between affected siblings with the same <italic>CSF2RA</italic> mutations and GM-CSF-RÎ± dysfunction indicates that penetrance is important in familial PAP because of GM-CSF receptor defects. The increased levels of GM-CSF likely reflect impaired clearance but are also consistent with interruption of a negative-feedback regulatory loop. Results strongly suggest that the high levels of pulmonary GM-CSF present in epithelial lining fluid result in a reduced but not abrogated receptor signaling and provide a molecular explanation the slow progression of PAP in both affected siblings. It is currently unclear if the level of increased pulmonary GM-CSF correlates with disease severity. They also suggest that aerosolized delivery of GM-CSF to the lungs may be therapeutic because this approach could theoretically achieve pulmonary GM-CSF levels several thousandâfold higher than endogenous levels measured in the patient and 20-fold higher than levels that appeared to completely restore GM-CSF receptor signaling in the transfection experiments. BM transplantation and <italic>CSF2RA</italic> gene transfer represent other potentially therapeutic approaches.</p><p>The identification of mild PAP in the older sister provides a unique and important opportunity to observe PAP at a very early stage of disease development. Finally, this case exemplifies the utility of a collaborative approach to the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with very rare diseases involving geographically disparate clinical centers and the benefit derived from integrating basic science, clinical medicine, and translational research.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Participants.</title><p>The institutional review board of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center approved the study, and all participants gave written informed consent or assent.
