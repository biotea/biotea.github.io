        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>NIPBL is required to load the cohesin complex on to DNA. While the canonical role of cohesin is to couple replicated sister chromatids together until the onset of mitosis, it also promotes tolerance to DNA damage. Here, we show that NIPBL is recruited to DNA damage throughout the cell cycle via independent mechanisms, influenced by type of damage. First, the heterochromatin protein HP1Î³ (also known as CBX3) recruits NIPBL to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through the corresponding HP1-binding motif within the N-terminus. By contrast, the C-terminal HEAT repeat domain is unable to recruit NIPBL to DSBs but independently targets NIPBL to laser microirradiation-induced DNA damage. Each mechanism is dependent on the RNF8 and RNF168 ubiquitylation pathway, while the recruitment of the HEAT repeat domain requires further ATM or ATR activity. Thus, NIPBL has evolved a sophisticated response to damaged DNA that is influenced by the form of damage, suggesting a highly dynamic role for NIPBL in maintaining genomic stability.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The cohesin complex is fundamental to the maintenance of genomic integrity, and ensures proper segregation of the paired sister chromatids during mitosis. The core cohesin complex consists of four constituents, with Smc1 family proteins, Smc3 and RAD21 (Scc1 in budding yeast) forming a heterotrimeric ring structure, which then associates with either of the SA1 or SA2 stromal antigen proteins (STAG1 or STAG2; Scc3 in budding yeast) (<xref rid="JCS197236C28" ref-type="bibr">Nasmyth and Haering, 2005</xref>). In mammalian cells, the initial association of cohesin with DNA occurs during telophase, and is facilitated by a separate âloaderâ complex comprising of the NIPBL and MAU2 heterodimer (Scc2 and Scc4 in budding yeast) (<xref rid="JCS197236C8" ref-type="bibr">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C41" ref-type="bibr">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C49" ref-type="bibr">Watrin et al., 2006</xref>). Beyond the canonical role of cohesin in ensuring faithful chromosome segregation, it also promotes the correct repair of damaged DNA (<xref rid="JCS197236C36" ref-type="bibr">Sjogren and Nasmyth, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C48" ref-type="bibr">Watrin and Peters, 2009</xref>). Recently it has also been shown that the loss of the core RAD21 or the sororin accessory protein (also known as CDCA5) leads to aberrant non-homologous end-joining of distant DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), resulting in large chromosomal rearrangements (<xref rid="JCS197236C16" ref-type="bibr">Gelot et al., 2016</xref>). How cohesin participates in DNA repair is presently unclear, although it can be distinguished from its role in sister chromatid cohesion. For example, in response to DNA damage, cohesin is sumoylated by the MMS21 SUMO ligase (also known as NSMCE2) component of the cohesin-related SMC5âSMC6 complex (hereafter denoted SMC5/6). While this sumoylation is required for repair of DSBs by sister chromatid homologous recombination, it is dispensable for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion (<xref rid="JCS197236C50" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>As well as post-translational modification of existing cohesin, additional cohesin complexes also appear to be recruited at sites of DNA damage. In budding yeast, analysis of regions flanking endonuclease-derived DSBs revealed a local enrichment of cohesin, in a manner dependent on the NIPBLâMAU2 loader complex (<xref rid="JCS197236C40" ref-type="bibr">Strom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C45" ref-type="bibr">Unal et al., 2004</xref>). Early components of the DNA damage response (DDR) are also required for the accumulation of cohesin at DSBs, since in the absence of Î³H2AX and Mre11 (Mre11a in mammals; part of the MRN complex), this recruitment is abolished. However, the nature of cohesin recruitment to DNA damage in human cells remains controversial, and the purpose of loading additional cohesin in DNA repair is enigmatic. Consistent with studies in budding yeast, an enrichment of human cohesin could be detected at various genomic sites of endonuclease derived DSBs by ChIP-qPCR (<xref rid="JCS197236C6" ref-type="bibr">Caron et al., 2012</xref>). Here, the cohesin recruitment was only moderate, but consistently detected throughout the cell cycle, and featured equal enrichment of the cohesin complex bound to either of the SA1 or SA2 associated factors. In addition, accumulation of both the NIPBL loader protein and cohesin could also be observed by fluorescence microscopy at I-PpoI endonuclease-derived DSB sites, which occur predominantly within the ribosomal DNA (<xref rid="JCS197236C23" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C29" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2011</xref>). However, at these I-PpoI sites, the accumulation of cohesin was only observed in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, and was specifically enriched for the SA2 associated factor (<xref rid="JCS197236C23" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). The recruitment of NIPBL and cohesinâSA2 to DNA damage during the S and G2 phase of the cell cycle has also been observed upon inflicting DNA damage by laser microirradiation (<xref rid="JCS197236C21" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C23" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2014</xref>), although in another study using a laser optimised for DSB generation, no enrichment of cohesin was observed in immunofluorescence analyses (<xref rid="JCS197236C3" ref-type="bibr">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that other forms of DNA damage may also recruit cohesin. To better understand the basis for cohesin loading at sites of DNA damage in human cells, we have examined the recruitment of the human NIPBL cohesin loader protein to various types of damaged DNA. By exploiting stable cell lines inducibly expressing GFP-tagged NIPBL, we show that NIPBL contains at least two domains that can independently facilitate its recruitment to DNA lesions and that the type of DNA damage influences their relative contribution.</p>

        <title>NIPBL and MAU2 are recruited to DNA damage</title>
        <p>Higher eukaryotes express two protein isoforms of NIPBL (<xref rid="JCS197236C39" ref-type="bibr">Strachan, 2005</xref>), and although the mammalian variants are derived from alternative splicing of the 3â² end of the gene, it is notable that fish, birds, and reptiles possess two discrete NIPBL gene paralogs (Ensemble database), suggestive of isoform-specific functions. Thus, we first set out to determine which human NIPBL variant is recruited to DNA damage. In humans, the canonical A-isoform (denoted NIPBL<sup>A</sup>) is a 316âkDa protein, while 3â² alternative splicing results in the slightly smaller 304âkDa B-isoform (denoted NIPBL<sup>B</sup>). We cloned the coding sequences for both NIPBL isoforms and fused each to GFP. Owing to the considerable size and low transfection efficiency of NIPBL, we opted to generate stable HEK293 cell lines regulated by the tetracycline repressor system to ensure that the transgenes were properly expressed. To examine MAU2 localization in relation to DNA damage, we also generated a MAU2âGFP fusion cell line. Western blot analysis confirmed proper full-length expression of the fusion proteins for each cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>A). The expression level of ectopic GFPâNIPBL<sup>A</sup>, as shown on the western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>B, was quantified through correlation of the GFPâNIPBL and endogenous NIPBL bands, using two different anti-NIPBL antibodies (<xref rid="JCS197236C13" ref-type="bibr">Enervald et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C51" ref-type="bibr">Zuin et al., 2014</xref>), to their common loading control, and then compensating for the fact that only 18â20% of the cells in the population are expressing GFPâNIPBL, as determined by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>B; data not shown). The average level of GFPâNIPBL expression was found to be four times higher than that of endogenous NIPBL after 48âh in the presence of doxycycline. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the GFPâNIPBL fusions localized predominantly to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>C). The MAU2 fusion often appeared dispersed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, as described previously for ectopic MAU2 (<xref rid="JCS197236C35" ref-type="bibr">Seitan et al., 2006</xref>). Potentially this dispersal is due to the limited availability of physiological NIPBL that could be required to convey MAU2 to the nucleus, as <italic>in silico</italic> analyses failed to identify any high-probability nuclear localization signal sequences within MAU2.

(B) Western blots of endogenous NIPBL and GFPâNIPBL<sup>A</sup> from the stable NIPBL<sup>A</sup> cell line induced with doxycycline for 48âh. The expression level of ectopic GFPâNIPBL<sup>A</sup>, was quantified through comparison of the endogenous NIPBL and GFPâNIPBL bands, using two different anti-NIPBL antibodies (I and II), to their common loading control. These values were adjusted to compensate for GFPâNIPBL<sup>A</sup> only being expressed in 18â20% of the cells as determined by FACS analysis (data not shown). The graph shows the meanÂ±

        <p>To assess the response of the two NIPBL isoforms towards DNA damage, we first applied 365ânm UV-A laser microirradiation (<xref rid="JCS197236C25" ref-type="bibr">Lukas et al., 2004</xref>) to each stable cell line. Both isoforms clearly accumulated at the resulting track lines, as defined by the DNA damage marker histone Î³H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>D). In parallel, we inflicted an alternative source of DNA damage by utilizing an engineered U2OS cell line in which DSBs can be enzymatically induced at an integrated LacO array by the FokI nuclease (<xref rid="JCS197236C42" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Following transient transfection of the expression plasmids, we found that both isoforms of NIPBL accumulated at DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>E). Next, we investigated whether MAU2 was recruited to DNA damage. Laser microirradiation of the MAU2âGFP cell line resulted in the accumulation of MAU2 at DNA damage tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>F), revealing that both components of the NIPBLâMAU2 heterodimer are recruited to damaged DNA. We were unable to assess localization of MAU2 to FokI-inflicted DSBs since transient overexpression of MAU2 only resulted in cytoplasmic protein aggregates.</p>

        <p>To explore the regulation of NIPBL in DNA repair further, we set out to determine how NIPBL is recruited to DNA damage. Since both NIPBL isoforms are recruited to DNA damage, the following experiments were based on the canonical NIPBL<sup>A</sup> isoform. Interestingly, MAU2 is not required for cohesin loading <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="JCS197236C27" ref-type="bibr">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>), although it is essential for the <italic>in vivo</italic> loading of cohesin required for faithful chromosome segregation (<xref rid="JCS197236C8" ref-type="bibr">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C35" ref-type="bibr">Seitan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C49" ref-type="bibr">Watrin et al., 2006</xref>), and for effective DNA repair in budding yeast (<xref rid="JCS197236C40" ref-type="bibr">Strom et al., 2004</xref>). While the function of MAU2 is currently unknown, it has recently been suggested that MAU2 may act <italic>in vivo</italic> as a chromatin adapter that targets NIPBL to specific chromosomal protein receptor sites (<xref rid="JCS197236C7" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2015</xref>). To explore whether this occurs in respect to damaged chromatin, we disrupted the MAU2-binding site of NIPBL and then examined the ability of NIPBL to accumulate at DNA damage. A single NIPBL missense mutation, derived from a Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) patient, prevents a 300-amino-acid NIPBL fragment from binding MAU2 (<xref rid="JCS197236C5" ref-type="bibr">Braunholz et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, to precisely disrupt the NIPBLâMAU2 association without affecting overall NIPBL protein structure, we introduced this mutation (G15R) into full-length GFPâNIPBL, and constructed a stable cell line. Co-immunoprecipitation of native MAU2 from GFPâNIPBL versus GFPâNIPBL<sup>G15R</sup> cell lines validated the disruption of MAU2 binding only towards the mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>A). Therefore, the single G15R mutation is sufficient to disrupt the binding of MAU2 to full-length NIPBL in human cells. However, despite the de-coupling of MAU2 from GFPâNIPBL<sup>G15R</sup>, we still observed the accumulation of GFPâNIPBL<sup>G15R</sup> at FokI-induced damage foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>B) and at laser damage tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>C), suggesting that MAU2 is not absolutely required as a chromatin adapter for NIPBL at damaged DNA. Thus, moderately overexpressed ectopic full-length NIPBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>B) is recruited to damaged DNA independently of MAU2.

        <title>Multiple protein domains recruit NIPBL to DNA damage</title>
        <p>Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) represents another candidate for NIPBL recruitment to sites of DNA damage. Previously it was shown that the expression of a small NIPBL fragment featuring the HP1-binding domain generated a protein product that could recognise damaged DNA and that upon mutation of the HP1 motif from PxVxL to PxAxA, which abolished HP1 binding, this property was lost (<xref rid="JCS197236C29" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore investigated whether the same phenotype occurred when the identical mutation was introduced into full-length NIPBL and expressed in a stable cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>D). We observed no enrichment of GFPâNIPBL<sup>PxAxA</sup> at FokI nuclease-mediated DNA damage foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>E), a result consistent with the study performed using the protein fragment (<xref rid="JCS197236C29" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, however, we found that the GFPâNIPBL<sup>PxAxA</sup> still accumulated at laser damage tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>F), which indicated the presence of a second HP1-independent recruitment mechanism for NIPBL.</p>
        <p>To explore this further, we constructed a series of GFPâNIPBL truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>A), and generated stable cell lines for expression of each fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>B). Further truncation of the N-terminus was limited by the position of the central nuclear localization signal (NLS), which we delineated to be between amino acids 1037â1166, while milder C-terminal truncations resulted in unstable fusion proteins. In line with the recruitment pattern of the NIPBL<sup>PxAxA</sup> mutant, only truncations possessing the HP1-binding motif were recruited to FokI damage foci. The minimal C-terminal NIPBL fragment (NIPBL<sup>C</sup>), lacking the HP1 domain, was never observed at FokI damage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>C). In contrast, all truncated forms of NIPBL, including the minimal C-terminal fragment, accumulated at laser damage tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>D). This suggested the presence of a second protein domain within the C-terminal part that separately recruits NIPBL to laser damage. Notably, a fragment consisting of the NLS-rich domain shared by both the minimal N-terminal and C-terminal fragments was not recruited to laser-based DNA damage, excluding the possibility that this domain facilitated the accrual of both fragments (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S1A,B</uri>). It was also possible that the C-terminal-based mechanism could be isoform specific. We therefore transiently transfected the minimal C-terminal fragment of NIPBL<sup>B</sup> and inflicted laser irradiation. We observed a clear recruitment of the B-variant to laser damage tracks, but, as expected, not to FokI nuclease sites (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S1C,D</uri>). Taken together, this demonstrates that the C-terminal recruitment mechanism functions through the large domain containing the multiple HEAT repeat motif common to both isoforms, situated downstream of the NLS. Furthermore, this also reveals that NIPBL features separate DNA damage recruitment domains, where the NIPBL<sup>PxAxA</sup> mutant phenotype was masked by the capacity of the HEAT repeat domain of NIPBL<sup>C</sup> to independently target DNA damage.

        <p>Since two distinct protein domains could recruit NIPBL to DNA laser damage, we exploited our stable cell lines expressing the smallest N-terminal fragment (NIPBL<sup>N</sup>) and the minimal C-terminal fragment (NIPBL<sup>C</sup>) to study each domain separately. Flow cytometry analysis showed that both NIPBL<sup>N</sup> and NIPBL<sup>C</sup> cell lines display normal cell cycle DNA content profiles, and that expression of each NIPBL fragment is consistent throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>A). With our laser microirradiation system, we observed accumulation of NIPBL<sup>N</sup> and NIPBL<sup>C</sup> at Î³H2AX-labeled DNA damage tracks in cells expressing cyclin B1, an S- and G2-phase-specific marker, and in cells that did not display cyclin B1, indicating those cells that have not entered S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>B). Indeed, the clear majority of cells targeted for laser damage display NIPBL<sup>N</sup> and NIPBL<sup>C</sup> recruitment to Î³H2AX-labeled damage lines, regardless of cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>C).

        <title>Independent mechanisms recruit NIPBL to DNA damage</title>
        <p>With it being established that NIPBL<sup>N</sup> and NIPBL<sup>C</sup> would normally be recruited by laser microirradiation in HEK293 cells, we began to further dissect the underlying mechanisms. Our data suggest that the HP1-binding motif is required for recruiting NIPBL<sup>N</sup> to laser microirradiation and FokI nuclease-based DNA damage, as reported for a smaller fragment which can recognize PpoI nuclease and UV-C-based microirradiation DNA damage (<xref rid="JCS197236C29" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2011</xref>). However, given the potential for the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>C</sup> to mask the contribution of NIPBL<sup>N</sup>, it was also feasible that MAU2 could still influence the recruitment of the NIPBL<sup>N</sup> fragment to laser damage. To formally examine this, we introduced the mutations that disrupted HP1 or MAU2 binding into the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>A), forming NIPBL<sup>N-PxAxA</sup> and NIPBL<sup>N-G15R</sup> expression plasmids. To ensure that the PxAxA mutation disrupted the interaction between NIPBL<sup>N</sup> and HP1, we assessed HP1 binding to NIPBL by co-immunoprecipitation, which confirmed that HP1 did not interact with the truncated PxAxA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>B). As expected, NIPBL<sup>N-G15R</sup> accumulated at laser damage sites, in an analogous manner to its full-length counterpart. However, the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>N-PxAxA</sup> to damage lines was severely diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>C,E). Similar results were obtained using the FokI nuclease system, where NIPBL<sup>N-G15R</sup> accumulated at damage foci, while the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>N-PxAxA</sup> to nuclease sites was never observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>D,E). Thus, MAU2 likely plays no role in assisting the HP1-mediated recruitment mechanism. An absence of a second HP1-binding motif in the C-terminal indicated that two independent mechanisms recruit NIPBL to DNA damage: the first via the N-terminal HP1 motif, and the second by the C-terminal HEAT repeat domain. Thus, depletion of HP1 should only inhibit the accumulation of NIPBL<sup>N</sup> and not impede the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>C</sup>. Of the three mammalian HP1 isoforms (HP1Î±, Î² and Î³; also known as CBX5, CBX1 and CBX3, respectively), only HP1Î³ appears to retain the HP1-binding NIPBL fragment at DNA damage (<xref rid="JCS197236C29" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore depleted HP1Î³ in our stable cell lines and compared the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>N</sup> and NIPBL<sup>C</sup>. In agreement with our hypothesis, upon RNAi-mediated depletion of HP1Î³, the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>N</sup> was severely diminished, while the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>C</sup> remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>FâH). Therefore, two separate mechanisms are involved in recruiting NIPBL to DNA damage.

(B) Disruption of HP1 binding to NIPBL<sup>N</sup>, via the PxAxA mutation, was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (I.P.) of stable wild-type NIPBL<sup>N</sup> or NIPBL<sup>N-PxAxA</sup>, with GFPâSepharose beads and detection of co-immunoprecipitated HP1Î³ protein by western blotting.

        <p>We then set out to determine factors that are required for the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>C</sup> to laser damage. Protein sequence analysis indicated that while the NIPBL<sup>N</sup> region featuring the HP1-binding motif is mostly absent from lower eukaryotic orthologs, there appears to be a degree of conservation of NIPBL<sup>C</sup> throughout the Eukaryota. Therefore, since the loading of cohesin at sites of DNA damage appears to be evolutionarily conserved between yeast and humans, and is abolished by deletion of ATM and ATR in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>
<italic>cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="JCS197236C21" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C44" ref-type="bibr">Tittel-Elmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C45" ref-type="bibr">Unal et al., 2004</xref>), we investigated whether these factors would influence the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>C</sup>. Highly specific inhibitors for ATM (KU-60019) and ATR (AZD6738) can be used to distinguish the activity of these kinases from the many other members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family (<xref rid="JCS197236C17" ref-type="bibr">Golding et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C46" ref-type="bibr">Vendetti et al., 2015</xref>). The effectiveness of the inhibitors was validated by western blotting for typical biomarkers (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S2</uri>). Interestingly, while chemical inhibition of ATM or ATR did not prevent NIPBL<sup>N</sup> or NIPBL<sup>C</sup> from being recruited to laser microirradiation, dual inhibition of ATM and ATR abolished the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>C</sup> almost completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F6">Fig.Â 6</xref>, left and central panels, respectively). In contrast, the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>N</sup> remained following combined ATM and ATR inhibition, again confirming that independent mechanisms recruit NIPBL to DNA damage. That inhibition of ATM alone had no effect on the recruitment of the NIPBL cohesin loader protein is also consistent with the observation that cohesin is recruited to sites of laser microirradiation in ATM-deficient A-T cells (<xref rid="JCS197236C21" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). We then tested two DNA damage signaling components absent from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>: the DNA damage sensitive kinase DNA-PK and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP1. Wortmannin selectively blocks DNA-PK activity, although at higher concentrations it can also inhibit ATM (but not ATR) (<xref rid="JCS197236C34" ref-type="bibr">Sarkaria et al., 1998</xref>), while KU0058948 inhibits PARP1 activity (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S2</uri>). We found that neither inhibition of DNA-PK nor PARP1 prevented NIPBL<sup>N</sup> or NIPBL<sup>C</sup> from being recruited to DNA damage. We then investigated whether the combined inhibition of ATM and ATR would influence the recruitment of full-length NIPBL to laser damage. We found that the recruitment was reduced, but not completely abolished, with 40% of cells displaying NIPBL accumulation at laser tracks in the presence of both inhibitors. As for the N- and C-terminal NIPBL fragments, PARP or DNA-PK inhibition had no effect on recruitment of full-length NIPBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F6">Fig.Â 6</xref>, right panel). Thus, analogous to the requirements for cohesin loading in budding yeast, redundant ATM or ATR signaling influences the recruitment of the NIPBL protein to DNA damage.

All inhibitors were functionally validated to ensure expected activity (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S3</uri>).

        <title>Both DNA damage recruitment mechanisms require RNF8 and RNF168 ubiquitin ligases</title>
        <p>Previously it has been shown that the recruitment of full-length NIPBL to DNA damage required the presence of the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase (<xref rid="JCS197236C29" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2011</xref>), implying that RNF168 influences both DNA damage recruitment mechanisms. RNF168 is usually associated with the DNA damage-dependent RNF8 and RNF168 signaling cascade, whereby the sensor protein MDC1 first recruits RNF8 to ubiquitylated histone H1 (<xref rid="JCS197236C43" ref-type="bibr">Thorslund et al., 2015</xref>), which consequently recruits RNF168, and leads to polyubiquitylated histone H2A (<xref rid="JCS197236C12" ref-type="bibr">Doil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C37" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>). Polyubiquitylated H2A then recruits downstream factors including 53BP1, BRCA1 and intriguingly the cohesin-related SMC5/6 complex (<xref rid="JCS197236C20" ref-type="bibr">Huen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C22" ref-type="bibr">Kolas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C26" ref-type="bibr">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C32" ref-type="bibr">Raschle et al., 2015</xref>). However, RNF168 can also act independently from RNF8 to directly ubiquitylate 53BP1 (<xref rid="JCS197236C4" ref-type="bibr">Bohgaki et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore set out to further examine the role of ubiquitin in the recruitment of NIPBL to DNA damage. The nuclear pool of ubiquitin available for DNA damage signaling can be reduced via perturbation of proteasome activity with compound MG132 (<xref rid="JCS197236C11" ref-type="bibr">Dantuma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C26" ref-type="bibr">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>). With MG132 pre-treated cells, we observed a discernible effect on the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>N</sup> and NIPBL<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>A), supporting a role for ubiquitin in the recruitment of both NIPBL fragments to DNA damage. We therefore examined a possible role for the ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168, which are critical for the induction of DNA damage-induced ubiquitylation at sites of DNA damage. Following depletion of RNF8 and RNF168 (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S3A</uri>), we observed that NIPBL<sup>N</sup> and NIPBL<sup>C</sup> no longer accumulated at laser microirradiation-based DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>B,C), indicating that DNA damage-induced ubiquitylation promotes the recruitment of NIPBL. Interestingly, this feature is shared by each of the DNA damage recruitment mechanisms. It has previously been shown that the formation of Î³H2AX and the recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA damage can occur in the absence of ATM due to the functional redundancy of ATM with DNA-PK (<xref rid="JCS197236C38" ref-type="bibr">Stiff et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with a role for DNA-PK in activating the RNF168 pathway, we still observed the recruitment of RNF168 to DNA damage when both ATM and ATR were inhibited (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S3B</uri>). Therefore the contribution of RNF8 and RNF168 in recruiting NIPBL<sup>C</sup> to DNA damage is most likely a distinct aspect of the recruitment pathway from the requirement for ATM or ATR activity.

        <p>Since the SMC5/6 complex is also recruited to laser-based DNA damage via the RNF8 and RNF168 cascade, and does not form foci at DSBs (<xref rid="JCS197236C31" ref-type="bibr">Potts and Yu, 2007</xref>), similar to NIPBL<sup>C</sup>, it was possible that the recruitment mechanisms for NIPBL<sup>C</sup> and SMC5/6 are related. As RAD18 acts as an adapter between RNF168-mediated H2A ubiquitin chains and SMC5/6 recruitment (<xref rid="JCS197236C32" ref-type="bibr">Raschle et al., 2015</xref>), we depleted RAD18 in our DNA damage assays. However, both NIPBL<sup>N</sup> and NIPBL<sup>C</sup> were recruited to laser-induced DNA damage in the absence of RAD18 (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S4AâC</uri>), demonstrating that, in response to laser microirradiation, NIPBL and SMC5/6 are recruited by distinct branches of the RNF8 and RNF168 cascade. Enticingly, the same recent proteomics screen that identified the recruitment of SMC5/6 to psoralen-induced DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) also revealed both NIPBL and MAU2 as proteins that accumulate at these lesions (<xref rid="JCS197236C32" ref-type="bibr">Raschle et al., 2015</xref>). This prompted us to investigate whether psoralen-induced ICLs would lead to the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>C</sup>. The pre-sensitization of cells with BrdU prior to laser microirradiation not only generates DSBs, but also causes the formation of base lesions and various photo-adducts (<xref rid="JCS197236C33" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>). To promote the formation of ICLs, we instead pre-sensitized cells with trimethylpsoralen (TMP), which predominantly forms ICLs via activation upon UV exposure (<xref rid="JCS197236C19" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). In response to UV laser microirradiation, we observed an accumulation of NIPBL<sup>C</sup> at Î³H2AX damage tracks, suggesting that NIPBL<sup>C</sup> is recruited to ICL damage (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S4D</uri>). In contrast, NIPBL<sup>C</sup> was not observed at sites of local UV damage directly (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S4E</uri>), while it did accumulate at DNA damage in a BrdU pre-sensitized cell-line deficient for the UV damage sensor XPC (XP4PA cells) (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.197236.supplemental">Fig.Â S3F</uri>). Taken together, this indicates that NIPBL<sup>C</sup> is recruited to psoralen induced ICLs in a manner dependent on RNF8- and RNF168-mediated ubiquitylation, as well as ATM and ATR activity.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>To facilitate the study of human NIPBL, we have developed stable cell lines for the inducible expression of full-length GFPâNIPBL fusion proteins. By describing two separate DDR pathways for NIPBL, we have demonstrated that independent mechanisms recruit NIPBL to sites of DNA damage, which can be distinguished by the type of inflicted DNA damage, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS197236F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>. The first mechanism can target NIPBL to DSBs generated by endonucleases tethered to a repetitive LacO array, and requires an intact HP1-binding motif within NIPBL as well as the presence of HP1Î³, RNF8 and RNF168. This suggests that the recruitment of NIPBL to DSBs is directly mediated via HP1Î³ acting as a chromatin adapter, whereby the chromodomain of HP1Î³ binds tri-methylated H3K9 (H3K9me<sub>3</sub>) and the opposing chromoshadow domain binds the PxVxL motif of NIPBL. However, as H3K9me<sub>3</sub> and HP1Î³ are pre-existing epigenetic features of undamaged chromatin, RNF8- and RNF168-mediated ubiquitylation of chromatin could form the specific epigenetic marks that allow NIPBL to recognize DSBs, leading to NIPBL interacting with both H3K9me<sub>3</sub>âHP1Î³ and ubiquitylated chromatin in combination. This type of bivalent interaction would be analogous to the retention of 53BP1 by di-methylated H4K20 (H4K20me<sub>2</sub>) and RNF168-mediated H2A K15 ubiquitylation (<xref rid="JCS197236C15" ref-type="bibr">Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013</xref>), and may precisely define the chromatin locus that recruits NIPBL in response to a DSB. Alternatively, RNF8 and RNF168 activity may lead to a change in the local chromatin structure, facilitating the access of a pre-assembled HP1Î³âNIPBL complex directly to H3K9me<sub>3</sub> sites. Intriguingly, we did not observe NIPBL at microirradiation-induced DSB foci (C.B., unpublished data, <xref rid="JCS197236C29" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2011</xref>), which predominantly occur at sites of euchromatin (<xref rid="JCS197236C9" ref-type="bibr">Cowell et al., 2007</xref>). This raises the possibility that the HP1-mediated recruitment of NIPBL is targeted to H3K9me<sub>3</sub> regions more typical of heterochromatic DNA. In contrast, the evolutionarily conserved HEAT repeat domain of NIPBL was not observed at DSBs, and the accumulation at sites of laser microirradiation did not require HP1Î³. Instead the laser damage recruitment of the HEAT repeat domain was dependent on RNF8 and RNF168, as well as ATM and ATR activity. Interestingly, the contribution of ATM and ATR activity appeared to be a separate aspect of the recruitment pathway from the RNF8 and RNF168 signaling cascade. This indicates that ubiquitylation of chromatin is not sufficient for the recruitment of NIPBL via the HEAT repeat domain, mirroring the ubiquitylation-dependent DSB response of NIPBL coupled to HP1Î³. Thus, another bivalent mechanism may regulate the recruitment of NIPBL<sup>C</sup> to DNA damage. Alternatively, the additional requirement for ATM and ATR activity may reflect the different type of damaged DNA that recruits NIPBL<sup>C</sup>, where potentially ATM and ATR activity is required to properly elicit the response to ICLs prior to NIPBL recruitment.
<fig id="JCS197236F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p><bold>A simplified model for recruitment of NIPBL to different types of DNA damage.</bold> Illustrated is a summary of the factors found in this study to be important for the recruitment of NIPBL to different types of DNA damage via two independent pathways. NIPBL is recruited to DNA damage via interaction with HP1Î³ at the N-terminus, and via the ATM and ATR pathway through the C-terminal HEAT-repeat-rich domain. Upon induction of DNA damage via UV microirradiation (laser damage) different types of damaged lesions are induced, such as DSBs and ICLs. Recruitment of NIPBL to laser tracks is therefore seen both in the absence of HP1, and ATM and ATR, since the two independent pathways demonstrated here, act in a compensatory manner. FokI, by contrast, only induces DSBs, and recruitment to those is strictly dependent on HP1Î³. A C-terminal fragment of NIPBL lacking the HP1-binding motif is therefore not recruited. Both pathways depend on ubiquitin and the RNF8 and RNF168 pathway. Me, methylation; Ub, ubiquitin; P, phosphorylation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="joces-130-197236-g8"/></fig></p>
      <p>Following the recruitment of NIPBL to various types of DNA damage, it remains to be determined for each mechanism, whether NIPBL loads additional cohesin at sites of damaged DNA, re-locates existing chromatin-bound cohesin to damage regions, or even has a novel role at damaged DNA that is distinct from cohesin loading. However, our findings may help explain the apparent discrepancies between the relatively low levels of cohesin that accumulates adjacent to single nuclease generated DSB lesions randomly dispersed throughout the genome (<xref rid="JCS197236C6" ref-type="bibr">Caron et al., 2012</xref>), and the greater enrichment of cohesinâSA2 at nuclease-derived DSB sites concentrated within the ribosomal DNA. The accumulation of cohesin at the ribosomal DNA region may reflect a concentrated recruitment of NIPBL to DSBs within these domains via the HP1Î³ and RNF8âRNF168 DDR pathway, since many inactive ribosomal genes are embedded within heterochromatin enriched for H3K9me<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="JCS197236C18" ref-type="bibr">Grummt and Pikaard, 2003</xref>). In addition, the significant accumulation of cohesin to DNA damage induced by the 532ânm ND:YAG laser (<xref rid="JCS197236C23" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2014</xref>) may reflect the recruitment of NIPBL via the HEAT repeat domain to alternative forms of DNA damage that are generated by this type of laser, potentially recruiting cohesin to DNA interstrand cross-links. Indeed, if only moderate levels of cohesin are typically recruited to random genomic DSBs, as indicated by ChIP-qPCR (<xref rid="JCS197236C6" ref-type="bibr">Caron et al., 2012</xref>), this may also explain the apparent lack of cohesin accumulation observed via the less-sensitive immuno-fluorescence analysis when using a laser set-up optimized specifically for the generation of DSBs (<xref rid="JCS197236C3" ref-type="bibr">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our study raises a fundamental question: why should a protein have multiple mechanisms for DNA damage recruitment? Parallel DNA damage recruitment processes are now emerging for a selection of DDR proteins including 53BP1, the SLX4 nuclease scaffold protein and the CHD4 chromatin remodeler (<xref rid="JCS197236C10" ref-type="bibr">Dantuma and van Attikum, 2016</xref>). Parallel recruitment pathways may provide a higher degree of specificity for the DDR in terms of both the timing and the precise sites of recruitment of individual proteins. It may also allow the DNA damage response to be tailored towards the type of inflicted DNA damage. For example, SLX4 appears differentially recruited to DNA replication intermediates via SUMO binding, and to psoralen-induced ICLs via ubiquitin binding (<xref rid="JCS197236C24" ref-type="bibr">Lachaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="JCS197236C30" ref-type="bibr">Ouyang et al., 2015</xref>). This modularity is reminiscent of NIPBL, whereby recruitment to DSBs is mediated via HP1Î³, while recruitment to ICLs can be mediated via the C-terminal HEAT repeat domain. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the multiple DDR mechanisms of NIPBL regulate the specific sites and timing of cohesin loading in relation to the type of DNA damage that requires resolving. Appreciating that NIPBL can be recruited to alternative forms of DNA lesions via independent mechanisms represents a significant step forward in our understanding of the highly dynamic roles that NIPBL performs in maintaining genomic stability.</p>
