      <abstract>
        <p>Cylindromas are benign adnexal skin tumors caused by germline mutations in the CYLD gene. In most cases the second wild-type allele is lost in tumor tissue, suggesting that CYLD functions as tumor suppressor. CYLD is a protein of 956 amino acids harboring a functional deubiquitinating domain at the COOH-terminal end. To shed more light on the function of CYLD, we have performed a yeast two hybrid screen using an HaCaT cDNA library that identified the RING finger protein TRIP (TRAF-interacting protein) as interactor with full-length CYLD. Mapping of the interacting domains revealed that the central domain of CYLD binds to the COOH-terminal end of TRIP. Far Western analysis and coimmunoprecipitations in mammalian cells confirmed that full-length CYLD binds to the COOH-terminal domain of TRIP. Because TRIP is an inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB activation by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), the effect of CYLD on NF-ÎºB activation was investigated in HeLa cells. The results established that CYLD down-regulates NF-ÎºB activation by TNF-Î±. The inhibition by CYLD depends on the presence of the central domain interacting with TRIP and its deubiquitinating activity. These findings indicate that cylindromas arise through constitutive NF-ÎºB activation leading to hyperproliferation and tumor growth.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cylindromas are benign adnexal tumors that most likely arise from the eccrine or apocrine cells of the skin (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). They emerge in the second or third decade of life in hairy areas of the body, but never on the palms and soles where apocrine glands are absent (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). They accumulate in number and grow slowly throughout life, sometimes forming a confluent disfiguring mass on the scalp (turban tumor syndrome). The familial form of cylindromatosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant predisposition to multiple adnexal skin tumors which has been mapped to chromosome 16q12-13 by genetic linkage analysis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Mutational analysis in genes localized to the candidate interval revealed mutations in a single gene, CYLD, in both the germline of 21 cylindromatosis families and sporadic cylindromatosis cases (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Most of the mutations are premature stop codons leading to proteins truncated in the second half of the protein. Genetic data indicate that CYLD is a tumor suppressor gene (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). There are no indications that CYLD inactivation leads to chromosomal instability (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Abrogation of CYLD alleles could promote neoplastic transformation by promoting cell proliferation and/or inhibition of apoptosis.</p>
      <p>The CYLD gene is expressed ubiquitously, which seems to be difficult to reconcile with the localized body distribution of cylindromas. The protein encoded by the CYLD gene comprises 956 amino acids (aa; reference <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Protein motif searches (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) of CYLD revealed three regions in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal half exhibiting weak homology to a glycine-rich region found in some cytoskeleton-associated proteins (CAP-Gly domain; reference <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The COOH-terminal part of CYLD displays partial homology to the active sites of ubiquitin-specific proteases (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This enzymatic activity of CYLD was confirmed by a chemistry-based approach (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), indicating that CYLD could deubiquitinate target proteins.</p>
      <p>To elucidate the functional role of CYLD at the molecular and cellular level in adnexal tumor suppression, we sought to determine molecular partners of CYLD. This identified TRIP (TRAF-interacting protein) as a CYLD interactor, and reporter assays demonstrated an inhibitory role of CYLD in TNF-Î±âmediated nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB activation. This suggests that loss of CYLD leads to deregulation of NF-ÎºB signaling giving rise to neoplasia in epidermal adnexal tissue.</p>

        <title>CYLD Interacts with the COOH-terminal Domain of TRIP.</title>
        <p>To determine the signal transduction pathways in which CYLD participates, we performed a yeast two hybrid screen using full-length CYLD cDNA as bait and an HaCaT cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) as prey. Multiple cDNA clones representing different proteins were isolated and characterized by sequencing. One of them, clone pACT2-17, encoded aa 211â469 of TRIP (TRAF-interacting protein; reference <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal half of TRIP contains a RING finger domain, coiled coil region, and a leucine zipper, and interacts with the TRAF domain of TRAF1 and TRAF2 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
        <p>To map interacting domains of TRIP and CYLD and assess their binding strength we measured Î±-galactosidase activities. The combination of full-length CYLD with either pACT2-17 or full-length TRIP had similar Î±-galactosidase activities, indicating that only the COOH-terminal part (aa 211â469) of TRIP is required for interacting with CYLD. To define more precisely the region of TRIP binding to CYLD, we constructed pGADT7 expression vectors for TRIP-N (aa 1â289) and TRIP-C (aa 290â469). Only TRIP-C interacted positively with full-length CYLD, suggesting that the last 179 aa of TRIP carry the CYLD binding site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) . Furthermore, only the central domain (aa 106â593) but neither N-(aa 1â132) nor C-(aa 558â956) terminal domains of CYLD interacted with full-length TRIP. These results were confirmed by analyzing colony formation and blue color of the different combinations of domains on high stringency plates.</p>

TRIP-N corresponds to aa 1â289, TRIP-C to aa 290â469, and pACT2â17 to aa 211â469, respectively.

        <p>To confirm the CYLDâTRIP interaction in mammalian cells we performed Far Western analysis with GST-TRIP fusion proteins and cell extracts of 293T cells transfected with HA-tagged full-length CYLD. Consistent with the findings in yeast, CYLD bound to GST-TRIP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A) and GST-TRIP-C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B), but not to GST-TRIP-N or GST. HA-lacZ did not bind to GST-TRIP-C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B), indicating that CYLD binding to TRIP-C is specific. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated that HA-TRIP-C interacted with FLAG-CYLD, whereas TRIP-C was not precipitated in the absence of FLAG-CYLD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). Whether full-length TRIP is immunoprecipitated by CYLD could not be tested because most of the overexpressed TRIP was not soluble in the RIPA buffer used for coimmunoprecipitations. Collectively, these experiments established the interaction of the central domain of CYLD with the COOH-terminal portion of TRIP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>CYLD Inhibits TNF-Î±âmediated NF-ÎºB Activation.</title>
        <p>The identification of TRIP, which down-regulates TNF-Î±âinduced NF-ÎºB activity (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), as CYLD interactor, prompted us to study the effect of CYLD on NF-ÎºB activation. NF-ÎºB reporter assays in HeLa cells transiently transfected with pCruzCYLD1 or pHATRIP showed that CYLD inhibited in a dose-dependent manner TNF-Î±âmediated activation of the NF-ÎºB reporter gene similar to TRIP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). In contrast, transfection of COOH-terminal truncated CYLD mutants TT14 (aa 1â481) and TT19 (aa 1â558; reference <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), as well as the mutant del153â536, where most of the central portion of CYLD was deleted, showed no effect on TNF-Î± up-regulation of NF-ÎºB activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). This provides evidence that both the deubiquitinating activity and the central domain, which interacts with TRIP, are required for CYLD repression of NF-ÎºB activation.</p>

        <p>Recently, it has been reported that CYLD inhibits the activation of NF-ÎºB by IL-1Î² in 293T cells (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, earlier reports indicated that TRIP does not regulate the activation of NF-ÎºB by IL-1Î² in 293 cells (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Experiments to reinvestigate whether TRIP affected the IL-1Î² activation of NF-ÎºB clearly showed that TRIP repressed NF-ÎºB activation in 293T and HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C and unpublished data). We conclude that CYLD and TRIP probably cooperate in the regulation of the IL-1Î² pathway in some but not all cell lines. Because CYLD is not interacting with TRAF6 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), it will be interesting to explore whether TRIP interacts with TRAF6.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, CYLD interacts with NEMO (IKKÎ³; references <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and TRAF2 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), both of which are recruited to the TNF receptor upon ligand binding. Furthermore, CYLD inhibits NF-ÎºB activation by TNF and TLR/IL-1 family members (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Mechanistically, CYLD removes lysine-63âlinked ubiquitin chains from TRAF2, TRAF6, and NEMO, whereas lysine-48âlinked ubiquitin chains are not degraded by CYLD (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This deubiquitinating activity is required for CYLD inhibition of NF-ÎºB activation (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and is likely affected by mutations found in cylindroma patients. The removal of the ubiquitin moieties by CYLD presumably prevents the assembly of a multiprotein complex activating IKK and subsequently NF-ÎºB.</p>
        <p>The COOH-terminal domain of TRIP interacts with CYLD, whereas the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region binds to TRAF2 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This argues for the presence of a ternary complex of CYLD, TRIP, and TRAF2, which would block NF-ÎºB activation by sequestering TRAF2 away from the TNF receptor. Physiologically there might be a finely tuned balance between TRIP and TRAF2 levels deciding whether there is an excess of TRAF2 and activation of NF-ÎºB or an excess of TRIP and no activation. Although it has not been formally shown that TRIP is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome upon receptor activation, the RING domain of TRAF2 could ubiquitinate TRIP. CYLD could stabilize TRIP by removing the ubiquitins and thereby blocking NF-ÎºB activation. This model is supported by reporter assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B) demonstrating a requirement for the TRIP-interacting and ubiquitin-specific protease domain of CYLD to down-regulate NF-ÎºB.</p>
        <p>How do these findings explain cylindroma formation and the tissue-specific predisposition of this adnexal tumor despite the ubiquitous tissue expression of CYLD? Inactivation of the CYLD gene should result in persistent activation of NF-ÎºB in targeted cells. Although up-regulated NF-ÎºB activity leads to cancer in other tissues (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the situation in skin is more complex. Sustained NF-ÎºB activity in the basal cell layer decreased cell proliferation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and mice where NF-ÎºB activity is permanently inhibited by overexpressing degradation-resistant IÎºBÎ± develop squamous cell carcinomas (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) or hyperplastic epithelium (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Furthermore, coexpression of an oncogenic Ras mutant and the mutant IÎºBÎ± cooperated to form highly invasive squamous cell carcinomas in human epidermal keratinocyte grafts (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These data imply that inhibition not activation of NF-ÎºB can lead to epidermal proliferation and neoplastic transformation. However, expression of IÎºBÎ± super-repressor in hair follicles and epidermal appendages and results from transgenic mice expressing Î²-galactosidase under the control of NF-ÎºB are consistent with a requirement for NF-ÎºB activation in hair follicle and eccrine gland formation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The complex epidermal phenotype displayed by IÎºBÎ± repressor mice is almost identical to those of tabby, downless, and crinkled mice carrying mutations in the genes for EDA, EDAR, and EDARADD, suggesting that NF-ÎºB activity is required for EDA/EDAR signaling in hair follicle and epidermal appendage formation (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In humans, congenital deficiencies of sweat glands and hair are known in patients suffering from hypo- or anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia, which are caused by mutations in EDAR or EDA genes (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). CYLD depresses NF-ÎºB activity induced by EDAR and XEDAR (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), suggesting that loss of CYLD function leads to increased NF-ÎºB signaling, cell proliferation, and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors in apocrine cells of the skin where cylindromas arise (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Furthermore, TRIP together with CYLD could negatively regulate EDA/EDAR/EDARADD signaling because EDARADD interacts with TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Preliminary data from RT-PCR demonstrated that TRIP is expressed in scalp skin, human foreskin, and epidermis.</p>
        <p>In summary, we have identified TRIP as interactor of CYLD and show that CYLD inhibits NF-ÎºB activation by TNF-Î±. The implication of the interacting pair CYLDâTRIP in NF-ÎºB signaling adds more players to the already highly complex regulation of NF-ÎºB activity influencing proliferation and differentiation of epidermis and skin appendages.</p>
