      <abstract>
        <p>Enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EHEC and EPEC) can cause severe and potentially life-threatening infections. Their pathogenicity is mediated by at least 40 effector proteins which they inject into their host cells by a type-III secretion system leading to the subversion of several cellular pathways. However, the molecular function of several effectors remains unknown, even though they contribute to virulence. Here we show that one of them, NleF, binds to caspase-4, -8, and -9 in yeast two-hybrid, LUMIER, and direct interaction assays. NleF inhibits the catalytic activity of the caspases <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cell lysate and prevents apoptosis in HeLa and Caco-2 cells. We have solved the crystal structure of the caspase-9/NleF complex which shows that NleF uses a novel mode of caspase inhibition, involving the insertion of the carboxy-terminus of NleF into the active site of the protease. In conformance with our structural model, mutagenized NleF with truncated or elongated carboxy-termini revealed a complete loss in caspase binding and apoptosis inhibition. Evasion of apoptosis helps pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> and other pathogens to take over the host cell by counteracting the cellâs ability to self-destruct upon infection. Recently, two other effector proteins, namely NleD and NleH, were shown to interfere with apoptosis. Even though NleF is not the only effector protein capable of apoptosis inhibition, direct inhibition of caspases by bacterial effectors has not been reported to date. Also unique so far is its mode of inhibition that resembles the one obtained for synthetic peptide-type inhibitors and as such deviates substantially from previously reported caspase-9 inhibitors such as the BIR3 domain of XIAP.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pathogenic bacteria that cause infectious diarrhoea are a major health problem worldwide. Among them, EHEC and EPEC are especially virulent <xref rid="pone.0058937-CDC1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058937-Charatan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Like many other pathogenic gram negative bacteria, they possess a type III secretion system (T3SS), a syringe-like apparatus composed of more than 20 proteins, which permits injection of bacterial effector proteins directly into mammalian host cells. EHEC strain O157:H7 (Sakai) encodes for 62 putative effectors, of which 39 are verifiably translocated into the host cell <xref rid="pone.0058937-Tobe1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These proteins, many of which are shared by EPEC, are responsible for the subversion of cellular antagonistic responses and the establishment of an environment suitable for pathogen proliferation. The precise function of many of these effectors is unknown, even though some, including NleF, have been implicated in virulence <xref rid="pone.0058937-Echtenkamp1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Eukaryotic cells recognise invading pathogens by pattern recognition receptors, which stimulate the secretion of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1Î², IL-6, TNFÎ± and interferons to combat the infection. In some cases, the response concludes in the induction of apoptotic cell death to remove the invading pathogen along with its host cell <xref rid="pone.0058937-Behar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Central to the execution of apoptosis are the caspases, a family of intracellular aspartate proteases <xref rid="pone.0058937-Elmore1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> that become activated upon initiation of apoptosis. To counteract this response, many viruses express proteins which inhibit the induction of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0058937-Callus1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Some anti-apoptotic viral proteins act as decoys for cellular pro-apoptotic factors, such as viral inhibitors of apoptosis (vIAPs) <xref rid="pone.0058937-Vucic1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, whereas others, such as the baculoviral p35 protein, directly bind to caspases to inhibit their proteolytic activity <xref rid="pone.0058937-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058937-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. An example of a bacterial effector protein counteracting an apoptotic response has recently been reported: The EHEC and EPEC effector NleH inhibits apoptosis of host cells by targeting BI-1 (Bax inhibitor 1), a cellular inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic protein Bax <xref rid="pone.0058937-Hemrajani1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, direct inhibition of caspases by bacterial effectors has not been reported to date.</p>

        <title>NleF Binds to Caspases</title>
        <p>In a systematic effort to elucidate the cellular targets of EHEC effector proteins, we identified caspase-9 as a binding partner of NleF. Caspase-9 was the predominant hit identified in screens of NleF against amino- and carboxy-terminally tagged yeast two-hybrid libraries (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">
<bold>Methods</bold>
</xref> for details). LUMIER assays with caspase-9 and NleF in HEK-293T cells confirmed the interaction<bold>.</bold> A test for interaction of NleF with caspases-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10 and -14 led to the identification of caspase-4 and caspase-8 as additional binding partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058937-g001">
<bold>Fig. 1A</bold>
</xref>). We determined the dissociation constant of the Caspase9-NleF interaction by surface acoustic wave resonance (SAW) to be â¼39 nM, a value which is well in the range of known viral inhibitors of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0058937-Callus1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, indicating biological significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058937-g001">

        <title>Structural Basis of Caspase Inhibition by NleF</title>
        <p>To determine how NleF inhibits caspase-9, we co-crystallized the protein complex and determined its structure at a resolution of 3.49 Ã (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0058937.s008">Table S2</xref></bold>). Bound to NleF, caspase-9 shows the typical fold of a mostly parallel six-stranded Î²-sheet sandwiched between two layers of Î±-helices and forms a dimer arranged in a similar geometry to that described for unbound caspase-9 <xref rid="pone.0058937-Renatus1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. NleF folds into a four-helix bundle connected by a two-stranded Î²-sheet between Î±-helices 2 and 3 as well as extended loop regions between the Î±-helices. A Dali search <xref rid="pone.0058937-Holm1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> for closest structural neighbours of NleF produces results with a Z-score of 6.4 or lower, indicative of only limited topological similarity to PDB-deposited protein structures. Each caspase monomer bears one NleF molecule bound via multiple interactions of the substrate recognition site of the caspase to the effector protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058937-g004">
<bold>Fig. 4A</bold>
</xref>
<bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0058937.s004">Fig. S4</xref></bold>). The interaction interface between caspase-9 and NleF comprises 902 and 1017Ã<sup>2</sup> of the two proteins, respectively. Despite moderate crystallographic resolution, the omit Fo-Fc difference electron density map allows for an unambiguous interpretation of the NleF interaction mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058937-g004">
<bold>Fig. 4B</bold>
</xref>). In contrast to the published structure of a caspase-9 dimer, with one active and one inactivated protease monomer <xref rid="pone.0058937-Renatus1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> per asymmetric unit, in the NleF-bound state, both caspase molecules are trapped in a binding-competent (but proteolytically inactive) state with well-established subpockets. The C-terminal amino acids Gly189, Cys188, Gln187 and Leu186 of NleF anchor the effector protein to the S1, S2, S3, and S4 pocket of the protease, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058937-g004">
<bold>Fig. 4C</bold>
</xref>). The S1 pocket that typically recognizes the P1 aspartate residue harbours Gly189 of NleF while the C-terminal main chain carboxylate group of this moiety partly mimics the interactions of the Asp side chain carboxylate. The side chains of Arg179 and Arg341 are involved in electrostatic interactions/salt bridges to NleF Gly189, whereas Cys188 occupies the S2 pocket of the protease, which mainly consists of the space between the aromatic side chains of Trp340 and His237. This pocket typically tolerates only amino acid side chains of small and aliphatic nature such as Ala and Val <xref rid="pone.0058937-FuentesPrior1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. NleF Gln187 occupies the protease S3 pocket and mainly interacts with the Arg341 peptide NH group via its main chain carbonyl oxygen and forms a charge-assisted H-bond from the Gln side chain carbonyl to the positively charged Arg177 side chain. The S4 pocket is occupied by NleF Leu186 which establishes van der Waals contacts to the aromatic side chains of Trp340 and Trp348 of caspase-9.</p>

        <p>The inhibition mode of NleF to some extent resembles the one obtained for synthetic peptide-type inhibitors such as Z-EVD-Dcbmk<sup>12</sup>, where the modified Asp, Val and Glu occupy the caspase-9 S1, S2, and S3 pockets while the benzyloxy-carbonyl moiety is partly solvent-exposed and occupies the S4 pocket.However, the latter inhibitor seems to establish a more efficient salt bridge between its Asp to Arg179 and Arg341, which becomes only partly mimicked by the NleF-Gly189 C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058937-g004">
<bold>Fig. 4D</bold>
</xref>). This inhibition mode observed for NleF deviates substantially from previously reported caspase-9 inhibitors such as the BIR3 domain of XIAP <xref rid="pone.0058937-Shiozaki1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, which occupies the dimerisation interface of two caspase-9 molecules thereby inducing a catalytically non-productive conformation of the protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058937-g004">

<bold>Fig. 4F</bold>

Thus, with respect to the caspases, the two crystal structures mainly differ in the conformation of the loop beginning with Ala284 bearing the active site Cys285, which becomes undefined after Gly287 in the previously reported structure and is defined to Ser298 in the NleF-bound complex. In addition, consistent with this active conformation the loop region Ser332âSer347 between strand 7 and helix E deviates between the two structures and contributes in active state to the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058937-g004">

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The elimination of infected cells via apoptosis is an evolutionary conserved defence mechanism of multicellular organisms that is commonly used against viruses, pathogenic bacteria and other parasites. To counteract this mechanism, many pathogens, such as cytomegaloviruses, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> have evolved mechanisms to prevent apoptosis of their host cells <xref rid="pone.0058937-Behar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058937-Brune1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058937-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The need for this countermeasure may be all the more crucial to pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> as the bundle-forming pili and effectors expressed by EPEC and/or EHEC, e.g. EspF and Map, have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in host cells <xref rid="pone.0058937-AbulMilh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058937-Nougayrede1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058937-BarnettFoster1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058937-Nougayrede2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058937-Papatheodorou1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Despite the presence of these proapoptotic factors, a decrease in normal apoptotic rates was observed upon infection of rabbits with a related REPEC O103 strain <xref rid="pone.0058937-Heczko1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. EPEC and EHEC inject into host cells a large number of effector proteins that can influence apoptosis including pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. In the context of this large repertoire of effectors, loss of NleF did not significantly change EPEC induced apoptosis, a result consistent with the low levels of NleF expressed <xref rid="pone.0058937-Echtenkamp1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, complementation of the <italic>nleF</italic> deletion mutant with wild type and mutant <italic>nleF</italic> alleles resulted in slightly higher levels of expression, even though the genes were inserted into the chromosome in single copy. Hence, NleF indeed plays a role in inhibiting apoptosis as expression of NleF variants unable to bind caspase-9 resulted in increased levels of caspase 3/7 cleavage.</p>
      <p>With caspase-9, NleF targets a bottleneck in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and is able to counteract apoptosis even at a point when pro-apoptotic proteins have already been released from mitochondria (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0058937.s001">Fig. S1</xref>)</bold>. Most somatic cells, including enterocytes (the relevant host cells for EHEC and EPEC), depend on mitochondrially induced caspase-9 activation for induction of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0058937-Ozoren1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058937-Jost1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058937-Petersen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition to caspase-9, NleF binds to and inhibits caspase-8, the initiator caspase triggering the extrinsic apoptotic pathway <xref rid="pone.0058937-Hitomi1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. NleF also blocks caspase-4, which has recently been reported to be required for the activation of the inflammasome <xref rid="pone.0058937-Sollberger1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Inhibition of caspase-4 by NleF might thus also inhibit the inflammation response. Targeting these caspases allows NleF to block apoptotic as well as immune response signals before they reach the downstream executioner caspases 3/7 and thus prevent the host cells from erasing themselves and thereby the invading pathogen. We conclude that NleFâs interference with these cascades contributes to the preservation of the biological niche of EHEC, EPEC and possibly other pathogens that express homologous effector proteins.</p>

        <p>The method was performed as previously described <xref rid="pone.0058937-Tahoun1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Proteins were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells as hybrid proteins with the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> protein A tag or with the <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> luciferase ORF fused to their amino termini. 20 ng of each expression construct were transfected into 10,000 HEK293 cells using 0.05 Âµl of lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 96 well plates. After 40 hours, medium was removed and cells were lysed on ice in 10 Âµl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 1% TritonX-100, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), Benzonase (Novagen) 0,0125 units per Âµl final concentration) containing sheep-anti-rabbit IgG-coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Dynabeads M280, 2 mg/ml final concentration). Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 minutes. 100 Âµl of washing buffer (PBS, 1 mM DTT) were added per well, and 10% of the diluted lysate was removed to determine the luciferase activity present in each sample before washing. The rest of the sample was washed 6 times in washing buffer in a Tecan Hydroflex plate washer. Luciferase activity was measured in the lysate as well as in washed beads. Negative controls had been transfected with the plasmid expressing the luciferase fusion protein and a vector expressing a dimer of protein A. For each sample, four values were measured: the luciferase present in 10% of the sample before washing (âinputâ), the luciferase activity present on the beads after washing (âboundâ), and the same values for the negative controls (âinput ncâ, and âbound ncâ). Normalised signal to background ratios are calculated as follows: Generate âsignals normalised for expression levelsâ by calculating âboundâ/âinputâ for both the interaction test (X-protein A+ Y-luciferase) and the negative control (protein A alone+Y luciferase [âbound ncâ/âinput ncâ]). Divide the âsignals normalised for expression levelsâ of the interaction test by the âsignals normalised for expression levelsâ of negative control to derive signal to background ratios.</p>
