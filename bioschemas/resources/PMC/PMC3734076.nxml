        <p>Inclusion of IST1 into the ESCRT complex allows recruitment of the microtubule-severing protein spastin to promote fission of recycling tubules from the endosome.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Mechanisms coordinating endosomal degradation and recycling are poorly understood, as are the cellular roles of microtubule (MT) severing. We show that cells lacking the MT-severing protein spastin had increased tubulation of and defective receptor sorting through endosomal tubular recycling compartments. Spastin required the ability to sever MTs and to interact with ESCRT-III (a complex controlling cargo degradation) proteins to regulate endosomal tubulation. Cells lacking IST1 (increased sodium tolerance 1), an endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) component to which spastin binds, also had increased endosomal tubulation. Our results suggest that inclusion of IST1 into the ESCRT complex allows recruitment of spastin to promote fission of recycling tubules from the endosome. Thus, we reveal a novel cellular role for MT severing and identify a mechanism by which endosomal recycling can be coordinated with the degradative machinery. <italic>Spastin</italic> is mutated in the axonopathy hereditary spastic paraplegia. Zebrafish spinal motor axons depleted of spastin or IST1 also had abnormal endosomal tubulation, so we propose this phenotype is important for axonal degeneration.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Endosomal sorting decisions control plasma membrane receptor concentrations, which in turn are critical in determining the cellular response to the extracellular environment. Key decisions occur in peripheral early endosomes, where receptors destined for recycling are sorted into tubular compartments for traffic away from the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of the degradative late endosomal/lysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maxfield and McGraw, 2004</xref>). Endosomal tubulation is coordinated with degradation, as it predominantly occurs at the transition between the early and late endosome, but the mechanisms underlying this coordination are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Weering et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The formation of tubules at early sorting endosomes is important in both the recycling and endosome to Golgi pathways. In the recycling pathway, tubules traffic cargo from the peripheral sorting endosome to the plasma membrane directly or indirectly via a perinuclear endosomal compartment. The sorting of nutrient receptors, such as the transferrin (Tfn) receptor (TfnR), involves these tubules and is thought to occur via iterative geometric sorting. In this process, the high surface to volume ratio of the tubule favors bulk flow of the receptor into the tubule, and repeated rounds of tubulation achieve efficient sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maxfield and McGraw, 2004</xref>). In contrast, certain receptors possessing a specific sorting signal are recycled to the plasma membrane via a less dynamic set of endosomal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lauffer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Temkin et al., 2011</xref>), whereas in the endosome to Golgi pathway, cargoes are sorted into tubules by the retromer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seaman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonifacino and Hurley, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The machinery controlling formation and fission of endosomal tubules is being elucidated. Tubule formation is driven by proteins that contain BAR (BinâAmphiphysinâRvs) domains, banana-shaped domains that sense or induce membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frost et al., 2009</xref>). These proteins include SNX1 (sorting nexin 1) at several pathways, including the endosome to Golgi pathway, and SNX4 at the recycling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nisar et al., 2010</xref>). Tubule extension and fission from the endosome is believed to be accomplished by the combined action of an actin-dependent pushing force, a microtubule (MT)-dependent pulling force generated by dynein motors, and membrane scission by dynamin. The actin network implicated in this process is generated by the WiskottâAldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue (WASH) complex, which contains strumpellin, a protein involved in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derivery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez and Billadeau, 2009</xref>). In addition, domains that induce membrane curvature by insertion of shallow hydrophobic wedges into one leaflet of the membrane bilayer can directly promote tubule fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of key proteins involved in tubule formation can result in mistrafficking of receptors, including the TfnR, that are normally sorted via the relevant tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traer et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Inward budding of endosomal membrane to form the ILVs of the late endosome/multivesicular body (MVB) exposes receptor cargo to lysosomal enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Piper and Katzmann, 2007</xref>). Sorting of cargoes into, together with formation of, the internal vesicles is accomplished by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)â0, âI, âII, and âIII complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babst et al., 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hurley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henne et al., 2011</xref>). The ESCRT-III complex carries out the final membrane scission step in this process, in which the internal vesicle is released from the limiting membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wollert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henne et al., 2012</xref>). In mammals, ESCRT-III comprises 11 related charged MVB proteins and IST1 (increased sodium tolerance 1), a divergent charged MVB protein that is also able to bind ESCRT-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajorek et al., 2009a</xref>). The endosomal role of mammalian IST1 is not clear, as it is dispensable for sorting of cargo to the degradative compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agromayor et al., 2009</xref>). Cytosolic ESCRT-III proteins, including IST1, are monomeric and autoinhibited, being activated by a conformational change that enables incorporation into the ESCRT complex and assembly at membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zamborlini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bajorek et al., 2009b</xref>). This conformational change also allows recruitment of accessory proteins to the complex, as it exposes C-terminal sequences termed MT-interacting and -trafficking (MIT) domainâinteracting motifs, which bind to MIT domains. MIT domainâcontaining proteins include the MT-severing ATPase spastin and VPS4 (vacuolar protein sorting 4), an ATPase that catalyzes removal of the ESCRT-III complex from endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hurley and Yang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). The MIT domain of spastin binds only to CHMP1B and IST1 among the ESCRT-III proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reid et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agromayor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">RenvoisÃ© et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in the <italic>spastin</italic> gene cause autosomal dominant HSP, in which there is progressive axonal degeneration of the longest axons of the corticospinal tracts. Functional analysis of spastin is therefore important in elucidating cell biological processes critical for axonal health, as well as in understanding the cellular roles of MT severing, in which internal breaks are made in MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hazan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackstone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lumb et al., 2012</xref>). Spastin has two main isoforms, a 616âamino acid full-length form (M1 spastin) and a form (M87 spastin) that lacks the N-terminal 86 amino acids of the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Claudiani et al., 2005</xref>). Both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, although in all cell types M87 spastin is much more abundant than M1 spastin. To accomplish MT severing, these spastin monomers must hexamerize and hydrolyze ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roll-Mecak and Vale, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lumb et al., 2012</xref>). The M1 unique sequence of spastin contains a hairpin membrane domain that is believed to act as a hydrophobic wedge by inserting into one leaflet of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2010</xref>). At steady-state, M1 spastin predominantly localizes to the ER, where it is involved, with several other hairpin loop domain proteins implicated in HSP, in ER morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanderson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montenegro et al., 2012</xref>). The function of MT severing in this process is unknown. Some M1 spastin may also transit endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connell et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, M87 spastin exists in a cytosolic pool that can be recruited to endosomes or to the cytokinetic midbody in an MIT domainâdependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connell et al., 2009</xref>). At the midbody, membrane scission by ESCRT-III is coordinated with a spastin-mediated MT breakage event required to complete abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guizetti et al., 2011</xref>). However, the function of spastin at endosomes is unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that cells lacking spastin have increased tubulation of early endosomal compartments and defective endosomal sorting of recycling cargo through these compartments and away from degradation, consistent with a defect in tubule fission. This phenotype was rescued by both M1 and M87 spastin but not by forms of spastin unable to sever MTs or bind to CHMP1B and IST1. Because cells lacking IST1 also had increased endosomal tubulation and defective sorting of recycling cargo, our results suggest a model in which inclusion of IST1 into the ESCRT complex triggers recruitment of spastin to promote fission of recycling tubules from the endosome. Thus, in addition to identifying novel endosomal functions of spastin and IST1, we elucidate a mechanism by which endosomal recycling can be coordinated with the degradative machinery. As we found that zebrafish spinal motor axon growth cones depleted of spastin or IST1 also had increased endosomal tubulation, we propose that this phenotype is directly linked to the axonal degeneration of HSP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Spastin regulates tubulation of early endosomal compartments</title><p>Because spastin participates in membrane modeling events at the ER and midbody, we hypothesized that endosomal spastin might also be involved in membrane modeling. Spastin depletion does not affect EGF receptor degradation and so is unlikely to influence ILV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connell et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore examined the effect of spastin depletion on endosomal tubulation, analyzing endogenous SNX1 and epitope-tagged SNX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traer et al., 2007</xref>). In HeLa cells, depletion of all spastin isoforms using an siRNA pool caused an increase in the number and length of tubules labeled with these markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, aâe</xref>). A similar increase in tubulation was found using three individual siRNA oligonucleotides, indicating that the increased tubulation was not an off-target effect (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201211045/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). In addition, we saw colocalization between SNX1 and SNX4-GFP on the same tubules in spastin-depleted cells (Fig. S1). Cells lacking spastin also had an increased number of complex structures, in which three or more tubules arose from a central punctum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, f and g</xref>). Consistent with this, live-cell imaging showed that cells lacking spastin had a more obvious and complex network of SNX4-mCherryâpositive tubules than control cells. These tubules were often static (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201211045/DC1" id="supp2">Videos 1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201211045/DC1" id="supp3">2</ext-link>), but when they moved, they often did so with the SNX4 puncta to which they were connected, suggesting that fission of tubules from the endosome was defective (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201211045/DC1" id="supp4">Video 3</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Spastin regulates endosomal tubulation.</bold> (a and b) HeLa cells were subject to mock transfection or transfection with a spastin siRNA pool (spastin knockdown [KD]) and labeled versus endogenous SNX1 (a) or transfected SNX4-mCherry (b).

Although convincing steady-state colocalization of spastin with endogenous markers of endosomes has not been demonstrated, endogenous spastin, transiently expressed M87 spastin, and to a lesser extent transiently expressed M1 spastin are all recruited to endosomes expressing a dominant-negative form of VPS4 (VPS4-E235Q) that traps ESCRT-III and associated proteins on the endosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connell et al., 2009</xref>). To verify these results in a more physiological system, we generated stable cell lines expressing siRNA-resistant transcripts encoding M1 or M87 spastin. As some M87 spastin is produced by alternative translation from a second start codon (corresponding to methionine 87) in M1 spastin, the M1 construct was mutagenized (M87A) so that it would only encode the full-length isoform. Both of the stably expressed proteins were strongly recruited to endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, a and b</xref>).

Neither protein was necessary for this, although CHMP1B depletion caused a partial reduction in spastin recruitment (Fig. S4). The recruitment of spastin after depletion of these proteins individually is probably a result of redundancy between them, compounded by the effect of VPS4-EQ in concentrating ESCRT proteins at the endosome; for example, concentration of CHMP1B at the endosome could compensate for lack of IST1. We could not determine whether depletion of both proteins together prevented spastinâs recruitment to VPS4-EQ endosomes, as it was highly toxic.

We examined TfnR, a well-characterized receptor trafficked via the tubular recycling compartment. After endocytosis, TfnR is trafficked back to the plasma membrane via the SNX4-positive tubular compartment arising from early sorting endosomes. SNX4 depletion inhibits this traffic, probably because endosomal tubule formation is inefficient, and over repeated rounds of endocytosis and recycling this cause missorting of TfnR to the degradative compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traer et al., 2007</xref>). We predicted that if depletion of spastin caused defective tubular fission, it should affect TfnR traffic in a similar fashion.</p><p>We examined TfnR concentration in cells depleted of spastin and found by immunoblotting that total cellular TfnR was reduced by &gt;50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, a and b</xref>). This reduction was partially rescued by treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, c and d</xref>). Consistent with this rescue by bafilomycin, immunofluorescence microscopy showed that vesicular TfnR signal remaining in cells lacking spastin was much more extensively colocalized with the late endosomal marker mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) than in wild-type cells, indicating that it had been mistrafficked to the degradative compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, eâg</xref>). In addition, we saw significant tubulation of a subset of the remaining TfnR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201211045/DC1" id="supp11">Fig. S5</ext-link>); these TfnR-positive tubules partially colocalized with SNX4-GFP and endogenous SNX1 (Fig. S5). In contrast, we saw no tubulation of M6PR. As M6PR traffics from endosomes to Golgi in a SNX1-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlton et al., 2004</xref>), this suggests that spastin depletion causes tubulation of only a subset of SNX1 pathways. In keeping with the observed effects on TfnR concentration and traffic, using a FACS-based assay, we found that cell surface TfnR was significantly reduced in spastin-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 h</xref>) and that Tfn uptake was reduced by â¼50% at 20 min after incubation with fluorescently labeled Tfn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, iâk</xref>). In contrast, the rate of loss of cell-associated labeled Tfn after an uptake pulse, conventionally taken to represent recycling of internalized Tfn back to the cell surface, was not affected by spastin depletion. This is consistent with the loss of TfnR in cells lacking spastin being a gradual process that occurs over many rounds of endocytosis and recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, l and m</xref>).

Cells lacking spastin had increased endosomal tubulation in at least two pathways, marked by SNX1 and SNX4, which mediate sorting away from early endosomes. The increased tubulation correlated with defective sorting and increased degradation of TfnR, which normally recycles away from the degradative compartment via SNX4 tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traer et al., 2007</xref>). The effects of spastin depletion on TfnR sorting were strikingly similar to those of loss of SNX4, in which the defective sorting is attributed to inefficient tubule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traer et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, in spastin-depleted cells, the combination of increased tubulation and blocked sorting strongly suggests that there is inefficient fission of endosomal tubules. Consistent with this, the tubules in spastin-depleted cells were frequently connected to a central spherical endosome, and under live-cell microscopy, connected tubules and punctate structures often moved together. Similar observations have been made in living cells lacking other proteins involved in endosomal tubule fission, such as WASH complex components or dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derivery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez and Billadeau, 2009</xref>). We conclude that spastin promotes tubule fission.</p><p>How could spastin regulate tubule fission? Our rescue experiments showed that MT severing is critical for spastin to regulate endosomal tubulation. Each MT severing event has the potential to generate a new MT plus end, and indeed, spastin regulates the number of MT plus ends in neurite extensions or axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fassier et al., 2013</xref>). MT plus-end proteins play a role in endosomal tubulation. Depletion of the p150 glued component of the dyneinâlinker complex dynactin, which has a prominent localization at MT plus ends, causes increased endosomal tubulation attributed to a reduction in the dynein pulling force required for tubule fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wassmer et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, in <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, dynein is loaded at MT plus ends, and in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> and mammalian cells, the plus-end protein Lis1 has a role in dynein motility of cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lenz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore suggest that recruitment of spastin to a tubulating endosomal membrane domain provides the capacity to generate new MT plus ends that promote dynein-based traction, increasing the pulling force driving tubule fission. Interestingly, as well as M87 spastin, M1 spastin was also recruited to endosomes and could rescue the endosomal tubulation seen in cells lacking endogenous spastin. Hairpin membrane domains, as found in M1 spastin, can sense or induce high membrane curvature, and so, we suggest that incorporation of M1 spastin protomers could help appropriately localize the spastin hexamer to the highly curved membrane of the endosomal tubule. Furthermore, as domains that cause membrane curvature by shallow hydrophobic insertion may themselves cause membrane fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>), this domain could directly contribute to tubule fission. It remains to be seen whether other hairpin membrane domainâcontaining proteins, perhaps even including those associated with HSP and which interact with M1 spastin, are also involved in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montenegro et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Spastin required the capacity to interact with ESCRT proteins to regulate endosomal tubulation, as F124D spastin, which can sever MTs but cannot interact with CHMP1B or IST1, was unable to rescue the endosomal tubulation seen in cells lacking endogenous spastin. Consistent with this, the effect of IST1 depletion on endosomal tubulation and TfnR trafficking was very similar to that of spastin depletion. Endosomal tubulation is coordinated with endosomal maturation, for example, SNX1 tubules are most frequent on endosomes that are at the transition point between early and late endosomes but are not present on mature late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Weering et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, as well as identifying a novel endosomal function for IST1, our observations provide a mechanistic explanation for this coordination. They suggest a model in which the activating conformational change that occurs on recruitment of IST1 to the forming ESCRT complexes provides a spatial and temporal switch to allow interaction with spastin and to promote tubule fission and receptor recycling before the endosome becomes committed to the degradative compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zamborlini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bajorek et al., 2009b</xref>). As IST1 can interact with ESCRT-I as well as ESCRT-III, this recruitment could begin early in the formation of the ESCRT complexes, an idea supported by the close association seen under immunofluorescence microscopy between endogenous IST1 and SNX1 or the early endosomal marker EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agromayor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajorek et al., 2009a</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of the activity of IST1 and spastin in endosomal tubulation would provide a means to control the balance between receptor degradation and recycling and so could provide a point of control in physiological situations in which this balance is important. Interestingly, IST1 protein concentration in yeast is nutrition sensitive. In yeast, amino acid starvation causes up-regulation of the MVB pathway and increased receptor degradation to produce amino acids for reuse. IST1 protein concentration falls during amino acid starvation, and a consequence of this is activation of the MVB pathway via a mechanism proposed to involve enhancement of VPS4 activity in recycling ESCRT-III components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). As our results show that reduced activity of the IST1-spastin machinery also inhibits sorting of receptors away from the degradative pathway, reductions in IST1 could therefore coordinate several endosomal processes to increase amino acid production during starvation.</p><p>Increased endosomal tubulation was seen in the axonal growth cones of spinal motor neurons derived from spastin- and IST1- depleted embryos, indicating that this system regulates endosomal tubulation across vertebrate species and in the axons of a cell type relevant to HSP. As spinal motor neurons lacking spastin had axonal abnormalities in vivo and as many spastin mutations are splice site, nonsense, or frameshift mutations that result in loss of function and so are appropriately modeled by spastin depletion, we propose that the enhanced endosomal tubulation phenotype is directly related to the axonopathy of HSP. Furthermore, M87 spastin incorporating the disease-associated K388R substitution failed to rescue the endosomal tubulation phenotype in HeLa cells lacking endogenous spastin, further supporting the relevance of endosomal tubulation to the human disease. Finally, in view of the identical cellular and axonal phenotypes of spastin and IST1 depletion, we propose that <italic>IST1</italic> is also a strong candidate gene for HSP.</p><p>Another HSP protein, strumpellin, has a role in fission of endosomal tubules. Strumpellin is a component of the WASH complex, the actin-regulating complex required for efficient endosomal tubule fission, and cells lacking strumpellin exhibit a similar endosomal tubulation phenotype to that seen on spastin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harbour et al., 2010</xref>). More circumstantially, the HSP protein spartin binds to IST1 and so could influence the role of IST1 in endosomal tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">RenvoisÃ© et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore suggest that dysregulation of endosomal tubulation could be a common pathogenic mechanism that leads to HSP by causing abnormal traffic of receptors important for axonal signaling. A strong candidate to be involved is the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. Several HSP proteins, including spastin and spartin, are inhibitors of BMP signaling, and up-regulated BMP signaling is a cause of axonal abnormalities in fly and zebrafish models of HSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fassier et al., 2010</xref>). This hypothesis will be a focus of our future research.</p><p>In summary, our work identifies a new endosomal role for spastin that is relevant to motor axons, identifies a mechanism coordinating endosomal degradation and recycling via a novel function of IST1, and reveals the involvement of MT-severing machinery in membrane fission events. It will form the foundation of future work aimed at further understanding the mechanisms of endosomal sorting and tubule fission, the cellular roles of MT severing, and the molecular and cellular pathogenic mechanisms leading to HSP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal anti-spastin86â340 (available from EMD Millipore) was raised against maltose binding protein fused to amino acids 86â340 of M1 spastin, rabbit polyclonal anti-M6PR was raised to GST fused to a portion of the cytoplasmic tail of rat M6PR equivalent to amino acids 2,347â2,487 of the human M6PR sequence, and rabbit polyclonal anti-SNX1 was raised against a GST-mouse SNX1 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reaves et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seaman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connell et al., 2009</xref>).
