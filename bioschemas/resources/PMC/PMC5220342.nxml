      <abstract>
        <p>CFTR is a transmembrane protein that reaches the cell surface via the conventional Golgi mediated secretion pathway. Interestingly, ER-to-Golgi blockade or ER stress induces alternative GRASP-mediated, Golgi-bypassing unconventional trafficking of wild-type CFTR and the disease-causing ÎF508-CFTR, which has folding and trafficking defects. Here, we show that Sec16A, the key regulator of conventional ER-to-Golgi transport, plays a critical role in the ER exit of protein cargos during unconventional secretion. In an initial gene silencing screen, Sec16A knockdown abolished the unconventional secretion of wild-type and ÎF508-CFTR induced by ER-to-Golgi blockade, whereas the knockdown of other COPII-related components did not. Notably, during unconventional secretion, Sec16A was redistributed to cell periphery and associated with GRASP55 in mammalian cells. Molecular and morphological analyses revealed that IRE1Î±-mediated signaling is an upstream regulator of Sec16A during ER-to-Golgi blockade or ER stress associated unconventional secretion. These findings highlight a novel function of Sec16A as an essential mediator of ER stress-associated unconventional secretion.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an N-glycosylated transmembrane protein with anion channel activity that permeates chloride and bicarbonate at the apical surface of secretory epithelia of the airways, intestine, pancreas, and exocrine glands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Loss-of-function mutations in CFTR are associated with CF and several other human diseases of the epithelial organs, such as bronchiectasis and chronic pancreatitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. CFTR is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the cell surface via the conventional Golgi-mediated secretion pathway. Thus, the Golgi-matured, fully N-glycosylated CFTR is expressed at the cell surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The most common disease-causing mutation of CFTR, a phenylalanine deletion at position 508 (ÎF508), results in protein misfolding and retention in the ER, leading to defects in the cell-surface expression of CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. As a result, negligible amounts of ÎF508-CFTR reach the plasma membrane, and ÎF508-CFTR remains in a core-glycosylated immature form within the ER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, under ER-to-Golgi blockade or ER-stress conditions, core-glycosylated wild-type and ÎF508 CFTR in the ER can travel to the cell surface through an unconventional Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP)-dependent pathway that bypasses the Golgi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Furthermore, augmentation of this unconventional secretion pathway via GRASP55 overexpression has been shown to rescue the defects caused by ÎF508-CFTR in a murine CF model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the rescue, and especially the export of the ER-retained, core-glycosylated CFTR from the ER, remain elusive.</p>
    <p>Under normal conditions, the export of secretory proteins from the ER is mediated by coat protein complex (COP) II-coated vesicles that bud from specific locations on the ER membrane called ER exit sites (ERES) or transitional ER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. COPII assembly begins with the Sec12-catalyzed activation of the small GTPase Sar1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, followed by the sequential recruitment of Sec23â24 dimer and Sec13â31 dimer lattice assembly to form the inner and outer layers of the COPII coat, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In addition to these core COPII molecules, Sec16 plays an essential role in the COPII-mediated exit of protein cargos from the ER in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. Sec16 is a large, peripheral membrane protein that is tightly associated with ERES and is proposed to mediate ERES biogenesis and act as a scaffold for COPII assembly by interacting with multiple COPII components (Sec23, Sec24, Sec13, and Sec31), as well as with Sar1-GTPase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Two orthologous genes encode the human Sec16 (Sec16A and Sec16B), and among them Sec16A appears to be the primary ortholog, because it is the most similar to the Sec16 proteins of other species (~240 KDa, in size).</p>
    <p>Several cellular signals regulate COPII-mediated protein transport and generation of ERES via modulating Sec16. For example, ERK-2 regulates the number of ERES by modulating Sec16 phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In addition, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a transducer of ER stress signals and the unfolded protein response (UPR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, was shown to regulate Sec16A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. During protein overload in the ER lumen, the number of ERES increases together with the Sec16A levels in response to the increased cargo load<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Notably, the IRE1-mediated signaling is also required for the unconventional, ER stress-associated secretion of CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The blockade of ER-to-Golgi transport, either direct via the inhibition of COPII-mediated vesicular transport (e.g., transfection with the dominant-negative form of Sar1), or indirect via the inhibition of COPI-mediated transport (e.g., transfection with the dominant-negative form of Arf1), triggers the activation of ER stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and evokes the unconventional secretion of core-glycosylated CFTR via the GRASP-dependent mechanism in mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
    <p>In an initial RNA interference (RNAi) screen of COPII-associated components, we found that Sec16A knockdown abolished the unconventional secretion of wild-type and ÎF508 CFTR induced by ER-to-Golgi blockade, whereas the knockdown of other COPII-related components did not. We then examined the role of Sec16A in the unconventional secretion pathway and found that Sec16A is a critical component in the ER stress-associated, GRASP-mediated unconventional secretion of core-glycosylated CFTR. In addition, we found that IRE1-mediated signaling is an upstream regulator of Sec16A during ER stress-induced unconventional secretion. Our results provide new insights into the global role of Sec16A as a common mediator of both the conventional and the unconventional export of secretory cargos from the ER.</p>

        <title>Sec16A is required for both conventional and unconventional secretion of CFTR</title>
        <p>Wild-type CFTR undergoes Golgi-mediated complex glycosylation, and the complex-glycosylated CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, band C) was expressed at the plasma membrane in a surface biotinylation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). As reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, the induction of ER-to-Golgi blockade by the dominant-negative Arf1-Q71L mutant induced the cell-surface expression of ER core-glycosylated wild-type CFTR and also the folding-deficient ÎF508-CFTR via unconventional protein secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1aâd</xref>, lane 3). To exclude the possibility that these results were caused by a nonspecific inhibition of membrane protein internalization, we repeated the experiments with the inhibitor of dynamins (dynasore) or the dominant-negative dynamin mutant (dynamin2-K44A) that had been shown to inhibit the internalization of plasma membrane proteins, such as transferrin receptor and CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>, although these treatments increased the cell-surface expression of transferrin receptor and complex-glycosylated wild-type CFTR by 40â80% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1a,b</xref>), dynasore and dynamin2-K44A neither affected Arf1-Q71L-mediated cell-surface expression of core-glycosylated CFTR nor induced cell-surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1bâd</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then explored the role of COPII-associated components in unconventional ER secretion using an RNAi screen in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>). Notably, depletion of Sec16A abolished the cell-surface expression of CFTR mediated by both the conventional and the unconventional secretion pathways. Sec16A silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the surface expression of complex-glycosylated CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> lane 2). Moreover, Sec16A depletion strongly diminished the unconventional cell-surface expression of wild-type CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>, lane 4) and also interfered with the cell-surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR induced by Arf1-Q71L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>, lane 4). However, depletion of Sec16B and core COPII components, such as Sec23, Sec24, Sec13, and Sec31, did not affect the unconventional cell-surface transport of ÎF508-CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>). Immunoblotting and mRNA quantitation confirmed the effects of RNAi on the depletion of Sec16 and core COPII components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>The effects of Sec16A depletion on the cell-surface expression of CFTR were further examined using immunostaining in mammalian cells. HeLa cells were used instead of HEK293 cells for morphological analyses, because they attach more firmly to coverslips, which prevents the loss of cells and the derangement of cell shapes during immunofluorescence procedures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. HeLa cells were transfected with extracellular HA-tagged wild-type or ÎF508 CFTR in order to identify cell-surface CFTR under non-permeabilized conditions. Some cells were cotransfected with the GDP-restricted Sar1-T39N mutant to block COPII-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In control cells, the wild-type CFTR was abundantly expressed on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), while the folding-deficient ÎF508-CFTR failed to reach the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The blockade of ER-to-Golgi transport by Sar1-T39N evoked the cell-surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Notably, depletion of Sec16A abolished the unconventional cell-surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR induced by Sar1-T39N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Taken together, the results indicate that Sec16A, but not core COPII components, is required for the unconventional secretion of CFTR.</p>
        <p>Given the finding that GRASP55 overexpression alone was sufficient to activate the surface transport of ÎF508-CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, we asked whether Sec16A is involved in the GRASP overexpression-induced unconventional secretion pathway. We cotransfected HEK293 cells with three different plasmids expressing GRASP55 (Myc-GRASP55, Myc-tagging at the N-terminus of GRASP55; GRASP55-Myc, Myc-tagging at the C-terminus of GRASP55; and GRASP55 without any tag), which were shown to rescue the cell-surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Sec16A depletion by siRNA significantly reduced the ÎF508-CFTR surface trafficking induced by the overexpression of all three forms of GRASP55 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that Sec16A is required for GRASP-mediated unconventional secretion of ÎF508-CFTR.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Sec16A colocalizes and associates with GRASP during ER stress-associated unconventional secretion</title>
        <p>We next investigated the relationship between Sec16A and cell-surface CFTR expression induced by ER-to-Golgi blockade to further identify the role of Sec16A in unconventional secretion. The blockade of ER-to-Golgi transport by Arf1-Q71L induced the cell-surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Interestingly, Arf1-Q71L altered the intracellular localization of Sec16A. In control cells, Sec16A displayed typical ERES localization, in which Sec16A puncta were mostly concentrated in the juxtanuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and HA-negative cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>; arrowheads). However, when the ER-to-Golgi transport was blocked by Arf1-Q71L, Sec16A dispersed into more peripheral regions and the Sec16A puncta appeared in &gt;80% of the cytoplasmic area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3bâd</xref>, arrows). These results are comparable to a recent finding that ER relocalization of GRASP is a requisite for unconventional secretion of CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p>
        <p>Therefore, to investigate the relationship between Sec16A and GRASP55, we examined the cellular localization of GRASP55 and Sec16A. Endogenous GRASP55 and a low level of GRASP55-Myc, which does not induce unconventional secretion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S5a</xref>), were expressed at the typical perinuclear Golgi apparatus, and Sec16A-positive ERES were enriched around that region to facilitate ER-to-Golgi transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>,b). Notably, in HeLa cells with a high level of GRASP55-Myc expression, which does induce unconventional ÎF508-CFTR secretion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S5b</xref>), the Sec16A puncta and GRASP55 were significantly redistributed to the entire cellular area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, arrows). Subsequent immunofluorescence colocalization analyses assessing both the percentage of overlapping area and the pixel colocalization correlation between Sec16A and ER markers revealed that the relocalized Sec16A puncta were highly colocalized with the ER-marker proteins, suggesting that Sec16A relocalized to the peripheral ER area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). The peripheral localization of Sec16A increased Mandersâ Colocalization Coefficient (MCC) due to an increment in the co-incident coefficient between the fractions of Sec16A and ER marker proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,g</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because Sec16A and GRASP55 showed similar cellular localization, we further examined their subcellular localization after the induction of unconventional secretion. The endogenous GRASP55 and Sec16A in HeLa cells were labeled with fluorophore-tagged antibodies. In control cells, although both GRASP55 and Sec16A were enriched in the juxtanuclear regions, analyses at higher magnifications revealed that the GRASP55 and Sec16A were mostly located in separate regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). In addition, Sec16A puncta located in the cell periphery were completely devoid of GRASP55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Stimuli that induce unconventional secretion, such as ER stress and ER-to-Golgi blockade, significantly redistributed and colocalized the Sec16A and GRASP55. Treatment with thapsigargin, which induces ER stress by depleting Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in the ER lumen, and coexpression with Arf1-Q71L or Sar1-T39N, which induces ER-to-Golgi blockade, redistributed GRASP55 from the juxtanuclear region to entire cellular area, significantly increasing the overall colocalization of GRASP55 with Sec16A puncta, especially in the peripheral regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6bâe</xref>). Electron microscopy further supported the finding that Arf1-Q71L-induced ER-to-Golgi blockade redistributed the Golgi protein GRASP55 from the Golgi to the ER, where Sec16A is localized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
        <p>To elucidate the platform role of Sec16A in the GRASP-mediated unconventional trafficking pathway, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay to assess the protein-protein interaction between GRASP55 and Sec16A. In HEK293 cells transfected with mock plasmids, the interaction between endogenous GRASP55 and Sec16A was minimal under control conditions. Notably, the interaction became much stronger, when ER-to-Golgi blockade was induced by Arf1-Q71L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f,g</xref>). Taken together, the results suggest that ER stress and ER-to-Golgi blockade facilitate the assembly of large complexes containing GRASP55 and Sec16A.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>ER-to-Golgi blockade and GRASP55 overexpression do not relocalize Sec31A, a core COPII component</title>
        <p>To determine whether Sec16A relocalization by GRASP overexpression or ER-to-Golgi blockade is a generalized phenomenon of the COPII machinery, we examined the subcellular localization of Sec31A, a representative subunit of COPII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Again, a high level of GRASP55 expression or ER-to-Golgi blockade by Sar1-T39N relocalized the Sec16A puncta into &gt;80% of the whole cellular area in HeLa cells, whereas only ~20% of the cellular area was Sec16A-positive in control cells. In contrast, neither GRASP55 expression nor ER-to-Golgi blockade by Arf1 and Sar1 mutants significantly altered the Sec31A distribution. Morphometric quantification indicated that Sec31A remained in ~15% of the whole cellular area of cells with GRASP55 overexpression or Sar1-T39N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Interestingly, the cellular distribution of Sec31A seemed to be contracted by the ER-to-Golgi blockade, especially by Sar1-T39N, although the change was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7câe</xref>). Coimmunostaining with Î³-tubulin revealed that Sec31A became highly concentrated at the minus ends of the microtubules, known as the centrosome or the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S7</xref>). In addition, the distribution of Sec24, another core component of COPII, was also not affected by ER-to-Golgi blockade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S8</xref>). Collectively, the results suggest that the formation of GRASP-mediated unconventional vesicles is accompanied by the assistance of the ERES organizer/regulator protein Sec16A, but is independent of the core COPII components.</p>

        <title>IRE1Î± regulates unconventional secretion of ÎF508-CFTR via Sec16A modulation</title>
        <p>IRE1-mediated signaling, which is required for ER stress-mediated and GRASP-mediated unconventional secretion of ÎF508-CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, has been shown to induce the neo-generation of Sec16A and increase both the number and the size of ERES to relieve the protein burden in the ER during a chronic overload of secretory cargo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Therefore, we next investigated the role of IRE1 in Sec16A-mediated unconventional secretion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a,b</xref>, the depletion of IRE1Î± by siRNA strongly inhibited Arf1-Q71L-induced surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR in HEK293 cells, but supplementation with exogenous Sec16A rescued the effect of mutant Arf1 that induced the cell-surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR. Furthermore, consistent with the mutant Arf1 results, GRASP55-induced ÎF508-CFTR rescue was inhibited by IRE1 silencing and recovered by Sec16A replenishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c,d</xref>). Immunocytochemistry results further supported the notion that IRE1 is an upstream regulator of Sec16A expression and localization during unconventional secretion. IRE1Î± depletion reduced the overall Sec16A expression levels in HeLa cells, and the increased Sec16A-positive area resulting from Arf1-Q71L or GRASP55 overexpression was diminished from 91% to 19% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Most membrane and secretory proteins exit the ER through cargo sorting and COPII-coated vesicle formation at specific locations on the ER membrane called ERES, and target to the Golgi complex and subsequently to the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In addition to this well-defined conventional trafficking pathway, recent evidence suggests that many cytosolic, nuclear, secretory, and membrane proteins reach the cell surface by unconventional secretion pathways that bypass the Golgi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In general, unconventional secretion events are not constitutive, but are instead stress induced. Cellular stress signals such as inflammation, starvation, mechanical stress during development, and ER stress can induce the unconventional secretion of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. However, the mechanisms and molecular components of the unconventional pathways, and particularly, how the secretory cargos leave the ER are still not fully understood. Here, we provide evidence that Sec16A is involved in the ER exit of the cargos during ER stress-associated unconventional secretion in mammalian cells.</p>
      <p>The requirement of Sec16A for the unconventional surface expression of CFTR is rather surprising, because Sec16A is regarded as one of the critical molecules in conventional ER-to-Golgi transport, and the inhibition of ER-to-Golgi transport in general activates unconventional secretion. Sec16A in mammals is a large hydrophilic protein that is tightly associated with ERES and makes an indispensable contribution to the organization of ERES<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and COPII-mediated ER export<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The inhibition of COPII function by Sar1-T39N induces, rather than inhibits, unconventional CFTR secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast to that of Sar1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) and core COPII components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>), the silencing of Sec16A inhibited the unconventional secretion of CFTR induced by ER-to-Golgi blockade or GRASP55 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figures S2 and S4</xref>). These results indicate that Sec16A is a global organizer or regulator of ER export with a role that is not restricted to the conventional COPII-mediated transport pathway.</p>
      <p>Sec16 was initially identified as a potentiating factor in COPII vesicle budding in yeasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Subsequently, Sec16 analogs were found in other species and shown to be involved in the COPII-mediated ER exit of cargo proteins in those organisms. However, the specific and precise role of Sec16 in COPII-mediated transport is still not fully established. For example, Stephens <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that Sec16 is a central organizer of COPII vesicles that defines ERES localization and recruits core COPII components in a stoichiometric fashion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In contrast, Glick <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that Sec16A regulates COPII turnover and consequently influences the stability of ERES instead of organizing COPII vesicle formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Although there is some debate about whether Sec16 recruits COPII to ERES or the other way around<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, it is generally agreed that Sec16 associates with core COPII components and is required for export-site assembly and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Our results indicate that Sec16 is also required for the COPII-independent ER exit of secretory cargos. Considering the scaffolding role of Sec16, it will be intriguing to identify the binding partners of Sec16A during ER stress or ER-to-Golgi blockade. Such investigations should aid our understanding of the molecular components and the big picture of ERES for unconventional protein secretion.</p>
      <p>A notable finding of the present study is the relocalization of Sec16A. In Drosophila larval muscle cells, it has been reported that parts of dGRASP colocalize with Sec16 and participate in the ER exit of the integrin subunit Î±PS2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. However, it is unclear as to whether dGRASP and Sec16 mediate unconventional secretion of Î±PS2 in Drosophila. Furthermore, dGRASP and Sec16 are enriched around the nucleus in Drosophila muscle cells during Î±PS2 secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In contrast, GRASP55 and Sec16A relocalize to the cell periphery and mediate unconventional secretion of CFTR upon ER stress or ER-to-Golgi blockade in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">9</xref>). Notably, the core COPII component Sec31 did not relocalize under those conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Instead of dispersing Sec31, Sar1-T39N seemed to cause Sec31 to move to a more central distribution relative to the MTOC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S7</xref>), suggesting the possibility that there is a signal that induces the relocalization of Sec31 into the minus end of microtubules during strong ER-to-Golgi blockade. The ER-Golgi interface and ERES are concentrated in the juxtanuclear region adjacent to the MTOC. The COPII vesicles that depart ERES initially travel towards the minus ends of the microtubules, which transport cargo proteins to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and eventually to the Golgi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. After being processed in the Golgi, the secretory cargos leave the trans-Golgi network and travel towards the plus ends of the microtubules via vesicular trafficking to reach the cell surface. The peripheral movement of Sec16 puncta raises the possibility that ER stress signals separate Sec16A from the core COPII components by transporting Sec16A towards the plus ends of the microtubules. The unconventional secretion of CFTR induced by ER stress and ER-to-Golgi blockade is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and nocodazole<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, indicating that it requires vesicular trafficking via microtubules. The peripheral localization of Sec16A and ERES for unconventional secretion might facilitate the direct trafficking of secretory vesicles to the cell surface via short-distance, plus-end trafficking on microtubules that bypasses the Golgi.</p>
      <p>In the present study, inhibition of ER-to-Golgi transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>) or upregulation of GRASP55 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S4</xref>) induced cell-surface expression of core-glycosylated CFTR. An alternative explanation of this finding would be that Arf1-Q71L or other potentially cytotoxic treatments may nonspecifically increase cell-surface expression of membrane proteins by inhibiting internalization of surface proteins rather than activation of a secretion event. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>, the inhibition of membrane-protein internalization by dynasore and dynamin2-K44A did not evoke the cell-surface expression of core-glycosylated CFTR, suggesting that inhibition of protein internalization cannot account for the cell-surface expression of core-glycosylated CFTR during ER stress and ER-to-Golgi blockade. An interesting finding to note is that the inhibition of cell surface-protein internalization did not significantly affect CFTR transported unconventionally to the cell surface by Arf1-Q71L (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1bâd</xref>), while it did increase the cell-surface expression of conventionally transported membrane proteins by 40â80% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1a,b</xref>). These results suggest that Arf1-Q71L inhibited the internalization of surface proteins. Considering that the folding-deficient membrane proteins that are transported to the cell surface remain under the control of peripheral protein quality control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, the inhibition of internalization would be an additional benefit that increases their retention time at the plasma membrane, although the inhibition of internalization alone is not capable of inducing the cell-surface expression.</p>
      <p>In vertebrate models, GRASPs were shown to be involved in the unconventional surface transport of CFTR and the thrombopoietin receptor Mpl (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene), in which ER core-glycosylated forms of membrane proteins are directly transported to the cell surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Sec16A was also required for the GRASP55 overexpression-induced cell-surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S4</xref>), and Sec16A colocalized and associated with GRASP55 during ER stress-induced unconventional secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). As a scaffold for organizing ERES<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, the Sec16A that is dispersed peripherally by ER stress signals may recruit GRASP55, which can then bring CFTR to newly established ERES for unconventional secretion. The reverse also seems possible, however, because the overexpression of GRASP55, which induces unconventional trafficking of ÎF508-CFTR but not ER stress signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, evoked Sec16A colocalization and peripheral dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). In any case, the association between Sec16A, an organizer of ERES, and GRASP, a cargo-recruiting factor, will be a critical event for the initiation of unconventional secretion of CFTR.</p>
      <p>Another important finding of our study is that IRE1Î± regulates unconventional secretion by modulating Sec16A. To maintain homeostasis in the ER lumen, the ER responds to an excess of unfolded proteins and relieves ER stress by triggering UPR signaling pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Generally, UPRs reduce the protein load in the ER by decreasing the transcription and translation of secretory proteins, and by directing misfolded proteins into the ER-associated degradation pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In addition, UPRs may activate the secretion of misfolded proteins via the unconventional route to relieve ER burden<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. IRE1, one of the three major branches of UPR signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, was shown to be responsible for the generation of new ERES and the upregulation of Sec16A during chronic overload of a secretory cargo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. IRE1 was also shown previously to mediate ER stress-induced unconventional secretion of CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Our current findings suggest that the IRE1-mediated UPR is a major upstream signal that regulates the generation and anchoring of Sec16A at the ERES involved in ER stress-induced and GRASP overexpression-mediated unconventional secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
      <p>IRE1Î± depletion reduced the overall expression of Sec16A and seemingly inhibited the peripheral dispersion of Sec16A puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). It is possible, however, that a simple reduction in Sec16A levels by IRE1 knockdown, rather than by true inhibition of Sec16A redistribution, would lower the Sec16A in immunofluorescence to subthreshold levels more profoundly in the peripheral regions than in the perinuclear region. Although we analyzed the immunofluorescence images with an increased laser gain to minimize the problem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>), our results cannot completely rule out this possibility. In any case, profound reductions in peripheral Sec16A levels are associated with decreases in unconventional secretion of CFTR. Considering that peripheral redistribution of GRASP55 is critical for the unconventional secretion of CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, and that GRASP55 associates with Sec16A during ER-to-Golgi blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), peripherally localized Sec16A would play an important role in the ER exit of cargos during ER-to-Golgi blockade. Therefore, accumulated evidence suggests that 1) GRASP is redistributed from the Golgi to the ER during ER stress and recognizes some cargos subjected for unconventional secretion, particularly membrane proteins such as CFTR that have a PDZ-binding motif at their C-terminus, and 2) GRASP associates with the Sec16A-containing protein complex, which delivers the cargos to the vesicles that depart from the ER membrane during unconventional secretion.</p>
      <p>ER stress signals induce the phosphorylation of the GRASP55 C-terminus, which is essential for ER stress-induced unconventional secretion of ÎF508-CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, and several kinases are known to regulate Sec16A function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Recently, Joo <italic>et al</italic>. reported that ATG1/ULK-mediated phosphorylation at the Ser846 residue of Sec16A is essential for the COPII-mediated ER-to-Golgi trafficking under basal physiologic conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Considering the finding that ATG1 is also involved in the ER stress-induced, unconventional trafficking of CFTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, it will be an interesting task to investigate whether phosphorylation(s) at specific Sec16A loci is required for unconventional secretion. Increasing evidence indicates that autophagy components are involved in various kinds of unconventional trafficking. For instance, coronaviruses use nonlipidated, ATG8/LC3-positive vesicles for replication, which emerge from the ER by a COPII-independent mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. However, this pathway is not dependent on ATG7<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, whereas the ER stress-induced, unconventional trafficking of CFTR is dependent on both ATG7 and ATG8<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Therefore, it appears that diverse cargos, from viral particles to mammalian membrane proteins, employ several combinations of autophagy components for their travel to the cell surface after ER exit.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we demonstrated the role of Sec16A in ER exit during unconventional secretion. In addition, we showed that IRE1Î± acts as an upstream signal for ER stress-associated unconventional secretion by modulating Sec16A. These results provide new insights into the global role of Sec16A as a common mediator of ER export. Furthermore, the identification of Sec16A as a platform for the exit of folding-deficient proteins from the ER will contribute to therapeutic strategies for diseases resulting from defects in the transport of misfolded proteins.</p>

        <p>Purified RNA samples from HEK293 cells were reverse-transcribed using RNA to cDNA EcoDry Premixes (Takara Bio Inc.). The total reaction volume was adjusted to 20âÎ¼L with RNase-free water after mixing with 100âng cDNA, 2âÎ¼L primer sets, 10âÎ¼L 2Ã SYBR premix Ex Taq, and 0.4âÎ¼L 50Ã ROX reference dye (Takara Bio Inc.). Amplification was performed under the following cycling conditions: 95âÂ°C for 15âmin, followed by 40 cycles of 95âÂ°C for 15âs, and 60âÂ°C for 40âs. Analyses were performed in triplicate for each cDNA. The relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (C<sub>t</sub>) method with GAPDH as a control, as follows: ÎC<sub>t</sub>â=âC<sub>t</sub> (GAPDH)âââC<sub>t</sub> (target gene). The fold-change in gene expression normalized to GAPDH and relative to the control sample was calculated as 2<sup>âÎÎCt</sup>.</p>

HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type (WT) (<bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>) or ÎF508 CFTR (<bold>c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>), and a surface biotinylation assay was performed 24âh after transfection. Some cells were cotransfected with the Arf1-Q71L plasmid to induce ER-to-Golgi blockade. The cells were pretreated with scrambled or Sec16A-specific siRNAs (100ânM) 24âh before plasmid transfection. Cell surface-specific labeling of proteins was confirmed by the absence of the cytosolic protein aldolase A in the biotinylated fraction. Representative surface biotinylation assays are shown (<bold>a</bold>,<bold>c</bold>), and the results of multiple experiments (nâ=â4) are summarized (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>d</bold>). Sec16A knockdown abolished both the conventional cell-surface trafficking of the Golgi complex-glycosylated WT-CFTR (band C) and the unconventional cell-surface trafficking of the ER core-glycosylated WT, as well as ÎF508 CFTRs (band B) induced by Arf1-Q71L.

        <title>IRE1Î± depletion inhibits unconventional ÎF508-CFTR secretion by down-regulating Sec16A.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a,c</bold>) Surface biotinylation of CFTR was performed in HEK293 cells after the induction of unconventional ÎF508-CFTR secretion by Arf1-Q71L (<bold>a</bold>) or by GRASP55 overexpression. (<bold>c</bold>) The cells were pretreated with scrambled or IRE1Î±-specific siRNAs (100ânM) 24âh before plasmid transfection. (<bold>b,d</bold>) The results of multiple experiments (nâ=â3) are summarized. IRE1Î± depletion by siRNA inhibited the Arf1-Q71L-induced or GRASP55-induced surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR. Supplementation with exogenous Sec16A rescued the effects of Arf1-Q71L and GRASP55, which induced the cell-surface expression of ÎF508-CFTR. **<italic>P</italic>â&lt;â0.01.</p>

        <title>IRE1Î± depletion inhibits Sec16A redistribution.</title>
        <p>(<bold>aâd</bold>) The cellular localization of Sec16A was analyzed using immunocytochemistry in control HeLa cells (<bold>a,b</bold>) and in cells after the induction of unconventional ÎF508-CFTR secretion by Arf1-Q71L (<bold>c,d</bold>). The cells were pretreated with scrambled or IRE1Î±-specific siRNAs (100ânM) 24âh before plasmid transfection. The intracellular distribution of Sec16A in IRE1Î±-depleted cells was analyzed using confocal images taken with five times higher acquisition gain (Gain X5) because IRE1Î± depletion reduced the overall Sec16A expression levels (<bold>b,d</bold>). (<bold>e</bold>) The results of multiple experiments (nââ¥â5, each comprising analyses of 5â10 cells) are summarized. IRE1Î± depletion inhibited the Arf1-Q71L-induced redistribution of Sec16A. Scale bar: 10âÎ¼m, **<italic>P</italic>â&lt;â0.01: difference from control.</p>
