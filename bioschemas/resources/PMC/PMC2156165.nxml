      <abstract>
        <p>The role of the centrosomes in microtubule nucleation remains largely unknown at the molecular level. Î³-Tubulin and the two associated proteins h103p (hGCP2) and h104p (hGCP3) are essential. These proteins are also present in soluble complexes containing additional polypeptides. Partial sequencing of a 76- kD polypeptide band from these complexes allowed the isolation of a cDNA encoding for a new protein (h76p = hGCP4) expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues. Orthologues of h76p have been characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in the higher plant <italic>Medicago</italic>. Several pieces of evidence indicate that h76p is involved in microtubule nucleation. (1) h76p is localized at the centrosome as demonstrated by immunofluorescence. (2) h76p and Î³-tubulin are associated in the Î³-tubulin complexes. (3) Î³-tubulin complexes containing h76p bind to microtubules. (4) h76p is recruited to the spindle poles and to <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm basal bodies. (5) h76p is necessary for aster nucleation by sperm basal bodies and recombinant h76p partially replaces endogenous 76p in oocyte extracts. Surprisingly, h76p shares partial sequence identity with human centrosomal proteins h103p and h104p, suggesting a common protein core. Hence, human Î³-tubulin appears associated with at least three evolutionary related centrosomal proteins, raising new questions about their functions at the molecular level.</p>

  <body>
    <p>M<sc>ost</sc> of the microtubules of the cytoskeleton are nucleated on specialized organelles called microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). These centers show distinct morphological appearances in evolutionary distant organisms, but it is not yet clear whether these various aspects reflect intrinsic biochemical differences or result from the different organization of evolutionary conserved proteins.</p>
    <p>The spindle pole body (SPB) of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> has been analyzed extensively at the functional and structural levels. Included in the nuclear envelope ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="ByersandGoetsch1975">Byers and Goetsch 1975</xref>), it contains several layers composed of a small number of distinct proteins ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Bullittetal1997">Bullitt et al. 1997</xref>). As for all MTOCs, the SPB contains a Î³-tubulinârelated protein (Tub4p) ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Marschalletal1996">Marschall et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Spangetal1996">Spang et al. 1996</xref>). Î³-Tubulin is present at the minus extremities of the microtubules, but does not participate in the overall structure of the microtubule walls ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stearnsetal1991">Stearns et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Melkietal1993">Melki et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="LiandJoshi1995">Li and Joshi 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>). Several experimental results demonstrate that Î³-tubulin is required for the nucleation process ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="OakleyandOakley1989">Oakley and Oakley 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oakleyetal1990">Oakley et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Horioetal1991">Horio et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stearnsetal1991">Stearns et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Joshietal1992">Joshi et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35924f0">FÃ©lix et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="StearnsandKirschner1994">Stearns and Kirschner 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="ShuandJoshi1995">Shu and Joshi 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>), but the mechanism of nucleation and of determination of the number of microtubule protofilaments are still unknown ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="EricksonandStoffler1996">Erickson and Stoffler 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1997">Zheng et al. 1997</xref>). In the SPB, Tub4p interacts with two other proteins called Spc97p and Spc98p ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Geissleretal1996">Geissler et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Knopetal1997">Knop et al. 1997</xref>). These three proteins are also present in a 6S soluble complex composed of at least two molecules of Tub4p, one molecule of Spc97p, and one molecule of Spc98p ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Knopetal1997">Knop et al. 1997</xref>). The nucleation of the intranuclear and cytoplasmic microtubules involves the interaction of this complex with the proteins Spc110p and Spc72p, which are strictly localized to the inner and the outer plaques of the SPB, respectively ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="KnopandSchiebel1997">Knop and Schiebel 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="KnopandSchiebel1998">Knop and Schiebel 1998</xref>). Hence the 6S Î³-tubulin complex appears to be a precursor of the material involved in the nucleation of both intranuclear and cytoplasmic microtubules ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pereiraetal1998">Pereira et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
    <p>The knowledge of the overall composition and structure of the centrosome is less advanced than in the case of the yeast SPB ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>). Interestingly, a protein cross-reacting with antiâSpc110p antibodies ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tassinetal1997">Tassin et al. 1997</xref>) and two proteins that exhibit a significant amino acid similarity with Spc97p and Spc98p are present in the centrosomes and in Î³-tubulin cytoplasmic complexes of vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Martinetal1998">Martin et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Murphyetal1998">Murphy et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tassinetal1998">Tassin et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oegemaetal1999">Oegema et al. 1999</xref>). In contrast to the yeast 6S Î³-tubulin complex, the largest complexes obtained from vertebrate and <italic>Drosophila</italic> involve more than three proteins ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35923d0">DÃ©traves et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oegemaetal1999">Oegema et al. 1999</xref>). They present a sedimentation coefficient of 32S and a ring and/or spiral appearance under the electron microscope (Î³-TuRC or Î³-tubulin ring complex) ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oegemaetal1999">Oegema et al. 1999</xref>). These complexes bind to the microtubule minus ends and promote the assembly of the Î±/Î²-tubulin heterodimers ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oegemaetal1999">Oegema et al. 1999</xref>). Tomographic analysis of the images obtained by electron immunolocalization of Î³-tubulin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> centrosomes suggests that the Î³-tubulin ring complexes constitute the microtubule nucleation sites of the pericentriolar material ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Moritzetal1995">Moritz et al. 1995</xref>). In somatic mammalian cells, the Î³-tubulin complexes exhibit a large size heterogeneity ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Debecetal1995">Debec et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Moudjouetal1996">Moudjou et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35923d0">DÃ©traves et al. 1997</xref>), but show the same overall composition as <italic>Xenopus</italic> Î³-TuRC ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35923d0">DÃ©traves et al. 1997</xref>). Besides Î³-tubulin, these complexes contain other polypeptide chains with apparent molecular masses of 50, 76, 105, 135, and 195 kD in denaturing electrophoretic conditions ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35923d0">DÃ©traves et al. 1997</xref>). The Î±/Î²-tubulin heterodimer (50 kD) is present in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> Î³-TuRC and in the complexes isolated from mammalian brain ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35923d0">DÃ©traves et al. 1997</xref>), but is absent in the complexes isolated from cultured cells ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Murphyetal1998">Murphy et al. 1998</xref>). The 100-kD polypeptide band has been recently shown to contain the two Spc97p (h103p = hGCP2) and Spc98p (h104p = hGCP3) vertebrate homologues ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Martinetal1998">Martin et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Murphyetal1998">Murphy et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tassinetal1998">Tassin et al. 1998</xref>). At least a doublet was observed in the 76-kD band from <italic>Xenopus</italic> Î³-TuRCs ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>), but the proteins have not been characterized. The partial microsequencing of the 76-kD band from pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes allowed us to characterize a ubiquitous centrosomal protein in human (h76p), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (d75p), and <italic>Medicago</italic> (m85p), which is a new member of the yeast and vertebrate Spc97p and Spc98p family.</p>

        <p>Proteins from pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes were separated by one dimensional gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, blotted onto PVDF membrane (Problott, Perkin-Elmer), and visualized by Ponceau S (Sigma Chemical Co.). The sequence analysis of the 76-kD band, carried out using a gasâliquid sequencer (model 467A; Applied Biosystems), allowed the determination of the first 20 amino acids of a single protein. In addition, the 76-kD band was excised from Coomassie blueâstained gels, digested by porcine trypsin, and the resulting peptides were purified and sequenced as described ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Saglioccoetal1996">Sagliocco et al. 1996</xref>).</p>

        <title>Cloning and Sequencing of the cDNA of Human 76p and of its Drosophila and Medicago Orthologues</title>
        <p>The first 20âamino-terminal amino acids of the 75-kD band from pig Î³-tubulin complexes were encoded by a human expressed sequence tag (EST) (AA115 396). The 5â² and 3â² sequences of this clone were used to obtain a full-length cDNA from a human neuroblastoma bank using a PCR approach. This cDNA was sequenced (big dye terminator on 373 DNA sequencer with internal nucleotides). The deduced 2-kb open reading frame (ORF) showed perfect matches with the peptide sequences obtained from purified 75- kD band. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> EST (accession number AA694820) that showed a significant similarity to h76p, allowed by genome walking the successive identification of one genomic (nucleotides 73101â75475; ACC005113) and three additional EST (accession numbers AA536481, AA540317, and AA536269) clones coding for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue (d75p) of h76p. Sequences obtained from the previously identified EST and genomic clones, together with additional sequences experimentally obtained from the AA540317 (full-length) and AA694820 cDNA clones, allowed us to generate a full-length coding sequence for d75p. The gene coding for the d75p (AC005113) contains seven introns and eight exons (73101â73169, 73227â73371, 73430â73715, 73777â73936, 73997â74503, 74568â74940, 74997â75270, and 75337â75475). The full-length cDNA clone from <italic>Medicago</italic> was isolated by library screening using a radioactive probe corresponding to the 850-bp EcoRI insert fragment of the EST 660560 that encoded a polypeptide showing high homology with the h76p and d75p proteins. The probe was hybridized against 8 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> plaque-forming units of a <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> root tip cDNA library (Dr. A. Niebl and Dr. P. Gamas, LBRPM, UMR CNRS 215, Castanet-Tolosan, France). Phage plaques were plated onto nitrocellulose membranes (Optitran BA-S-85; Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washings were performed according to <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sambrooketal1989">Sambrook et al. 1989</xref>. 30 positive clones were detected after initial screening. Four clones containing a presumably full-length 2.8-kb cDNA insert were retained for further characterization and one of them was sequenced.</p>

        <title>Recombinant h76p</title>
        <p>The 2-kb ORF of the h76p (AA115396) was amplified by PCR using the 5â² primer, 5â² GCGCGCGAGCTCATCCACGAACTGCTCTTGGCT 3â², and the 3â² primer, 5â² GCGCGCAAGCTTTCACATCCCGAAACTGCCCAG 3â². The PCR fragment was digested with the restriction enzymes SacI and HindIII and inserted into the plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen) resulting in a plasmid (pQE30-p76) coding for a h76p tagged with 6-His at the amino terminus. The bacterial vector pQE30-p76 was introduced in the M15(pREP4) <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> host strain and protein expression was induced by 1 mM isopropyl-Î²-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 37Â°C. The insoluble fusion protein was purified either as inclusion bodies ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sambrooketal1989">Sambrook et al. 1989</xref>) and used for the purification of antibodies, or solubilized in 8 M urea, purified on a nickel agarose column (QIAexpressionist; Qiagen) and used for immunizations and quantifications. Alternatively, after induction by 0.1 mM IPTG for 3 h at 25Â°C, and centrifugation of the bacterial extract at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> for 45 min, soluble h76p was recovered in the supernatant where it represented â10% of the proteins.

        <title>Transient Expression of GFP-h76p Fusion Protein in Mammalian Cells</title>
        <p>The 2-kb h76p-ORF was amplified by PCR using the 5â² primer, 5â² GCGCGCAAGCTTATCCACGAACTGCTCTTGGCT 3â², and the 3â² primer, 5â² GCGCGCAAGCTTTCACATCCCGAAACTGCCCAG 3â². The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme HindIII and inserted into the plasmid pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH Laboratories). The resulting plasmid (pEGFP-C3-p76) expressed the h76p with the enhanced green fluorescent protein coding sequence fused at the amino terminus (GFP-h76p). Monkey kidney COS cells, cultured in DME (GIBCO BRL) with 7% FBS (Sigma Chemical Co.) in plastic flaskets (9 cm<sup>2</sup>) were transfected (50% efficiency) with 1 Î¼g of plasmid pEGFP-C3-p76 using the DEAE dextran/chloroquine procedure ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Corbanietal1995">Corbani et al. 1995</xref>). COS cells overexpressing the GFP-h76p (103 kD) exhibited a single polypeptide of apparent molecular mass of â100 kD, recognized by antiâh76p and antiâGFP antibodies ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, top). Comparison of the immunolabeling with a standard curve raised with recombinant h76p showed that the GFP-h76p represented â0.4% of total proteins ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, top), whereas the endogenous 76p remained below the detection limit, i.e., &lt;0.003% of total proteins in control COS cells. Since the percentage of transfection was â50%, transfection resulted in an average expression â200-fold above the basal level. Alternatively, HeLa cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sambrooketal1989">Sambrook et al. 1989</xref>) and observed 65 h after transfection.</p>

The antibodies R72 were obtained against the peptide KQLRELQSLRLIEEEN corresponding to the region 233â248 of h76p, the antibodies R801 against the peptide RQEDTFAAELHRGGC that contains 10 amino acids corresponding to the region 304â313 of h76p, and the antibodies R190 against the peptide YNKYYTQAGGTLGSFG corresponding to the carboxy-terminal region 651â666 of h76p. Antibodies specific to h76p were purified on recombinant h76p as described ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lajoie-Mazencetal1994">Lajoie-Mazenc et al. 1994</xref>). Specificity was checked by preincubation with the immunizing peptide (50 Î¼g per ml). Antibodies against Î³-tubulin were raised, either in rabbits (R74, R75) or in guinea pigs (C3), against a 19âamino acid peptide corresponding to the carboxy-terminal region of human Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Julianetal1993">Julian et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lajoie-Mazencetal1994">Lajoie-Mazenc et al. 1994</xref>) and purified on recombinant Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lajoie-Mazencetal1994">Lajoie-Mazenc et al. 1994</xref>).

        <p>The immunolocalization of h76p in PtK2 cells ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Julianetal1993">Julian et al. 1993</xref>) was performed after a 6-min fixation in cold (â20Â°C) methanol. Double immunofluorescence staining of h76p and Î³-tubulin was performed with rabbit antibodies (R801) and guinea pig antibodies (C3), respectively. Staining of Î³-tubulin (R75) or microtubules (YL1/2) in COS cells overexpressing fluorescent GFP-h76p was performed after a 1-min permeabilization in a microtubule stabilizing medium and fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lajoie-Mazencetal1994">Lajoie-Mazenc et al. 1994</xref>). The staining was revealed with FITC and TRITC goat antibodies (Immunotech), whereas nuclei and chromosomes were stained with 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI: 0.2 Î¼g per ml). Preparations were dried, mounted in Mowiol ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="RodriguezandDeinhardt1960">Rodriguez and Deinhardt 1960</xref>), sealed, and observed by epifluorescence with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with 40Ã (NA 1.30) plan-neofluar objectives, a 2Ã Optovar, a 4Ã TV camera, and a stabilized excitation beam. Images, recorded in the linear dynamic range by a Nocticon camera (LH 4015; Lhesa), were digitized (100 frames averaging) with an image processing system (Sapphire from Quantel) and recalculated using a linear function (Stretch program). The specific maximal fluorescence raised by h76p antibodies over the centrosome was determined (Luminance program) as the difference between the maximal fluorescence of the centrosome and the background fluorescence measured at the immediate proximity of the centrosome.</p>

        <title>In Vitro Assembly of Xenopus Sperm Asters</title>
        <p>Extracts were prepared using <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes arrested in the metaphase of the second meiotic division ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="MurrayandKirschner1989">Murray and Kirschner 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Morinetal1994">Morin et al. 1994</xref>). Beads of protein AâSepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Sverige) carrying h76p (R801) and Î³-tubulin (R74) rabbit antibodies were used for depletion experiments. Schematically, 50 Î¼l of protein AâSepharose beads were saturated for 2 h at 4Â°C with 2 ml of a solution of casein at the concentration of 5 mg/ml. They were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with 150 Î¼l of rabbit serum (R801, R74) diluted fourfold in PBS, and washed successively in PBS, PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS, and acetate buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 2.5 mM magnesium acetate, pH 7.2). The oocyte extract (50 Î¼l, 60â80 mg/ml), diluted with 1 vol of acetate buffer containing an ATP-regenerating system and protease inhibitors, was centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 <italic>g</italic>, mixed with the protein AâSepharose beads, and incubated for 1 h at 4Â°C. After bead removal by centrifugation, the supernatant was used for microtubule assembly in the presence of permeabilized <italic>Xenopus</italic> spermatozoa ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="BlowandLaskey1986">Blow and Laskey 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35924f0">FÃ©lix et al. 1994</xref>). Probing the supernatant of oocyte extracts treated with beads carrying 76p (R801) antibodies, showed that these beads effectively removed x76p from extracts diluted to 12 mg/ml, but only partially depleted extracts diluted to 25 mg/ml. The nucleation experiment was performed at 22Â°C by incubating 15,000 sperm nuclei (1 Î¼l) in 20 Î¼l of oocyte extract (25 mg/ml) and 0.5 Î¼l of rhodamine-labeled tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hymanetal1991">Hyman et al. 1991</xref>). At 5-min intervals, 2-Î¼l samples mixed with 6 Î¼l of Hoechst 33258 (1 Î¼g/ml) were observed by fluorescence microscopy, and the percentage of sperm heads with an aster was determined. A sperm aster was defined by the nucleation of 15â60 microtubules at the extremity of the sperm nucleus ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35924f0">FÃ©lix et al. 1994</xref>). Alternatively, 75,000 permeabilized spermatozoa (5 Î¼l) were incubated with 5 Î¼M nocodazole for 20 min in 50 Î¼l of oocyte extract, and then fixed with 200 Î¼l of 3.7% paraformaldehyde in 80 mM Pipes pH 6.8, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

The recruitment of 76p on permeabilized spermatozoa was quantified in the same conditions as before in the presence of 5 Î¼M nocodazole.

        <title>The 76-kD Polypeptide Band of the Î³-Tubulin Complexes Isolated from Mammalian Brain Contains a New Evolutionary Conserved Protein</title>
        <p>Î³-Tubulin complexes were purified from mammalian brain by affinity chromatography with Î³-tubulin antibodies ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35923d0">DÃ©traves et al. 1997</xref>). Besides Î³-tubulin and the Î±/Î²-tubulin heterodimer, the Î³-tubulin protein complexes obtained from pig and sheep brain contain four polypeptide bands (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A). The band migrating at 76 kD in pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes was isolated by SDS-PAGE, blotted and submitted to microsequencing. The terminal amino acid sequence xIHELLLALSGYPGSIFTxN was identified in a putative ORF at the 5â² end of a human EST (accession number AA115395). The corresponding cDNA was obtained by PCR from a human neuroblastoma cDNA library and entirely sequenced. It contains a single ORF (h76p = hGCP4) coding for a polypeptide of 667 amino acids with a calculated mass of 76,090 and a pI of 6.14 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This ORF also contains the two sequences, xxEDTFAAExHR and xEILPTY, previously obtained from the tryptic digests of the 76-kD polypeptides from pig (sequence 1) and sheep (sequences 1 and 2).</p>
        <p>Searches in databases also identified ESTs coding for apparented proteins in evolutionary distant organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> (accession number AA694820), the moss <italic>Physcomytrella</italic> (accession number EJ225509), and the higher plant <italic>Medicago</italic> (accession number AA660560). A full-length cDNA sequence was first obtained for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue. The corresponding <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene contains eight exons coding for a protein of 650 amino acids (d75p). This protein exhibits â33% sequence identity with h76p, and shows comparable calculated mass (74,900) and pI (5.12). The presence of an orthologue of h76p in <italic>Medicago</italic> (m85p) was confirmed by the isolation and sequencing of the corresponding full length cDNA. It codes for a protein of 739 amino acids, with a calculated mass of 85,300 (m85p) and a pI of 6.23. m85p exhibits â34 and 31% sequence identity with its human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterparts, respectively. Several common amino acid motifs were identified between the three protein orthologues, particularly the conserved amino-terminal sequence ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The identity of the h76p with the major protein of the 76-kD band of pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes was further assessed by antibodies raised against recombinant h76p (R7629/30) and several peptide motifs of h76p: 233â248 (R72), 303â313 (R801), and the carboxy-terminal amino acids 651â666 (R190) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A). The labeling specificity was checked by competition with the immunizing peptides. Moreover, h76p antibodies (R801) specifically immunoprecipitated Î³-tubulin from pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes in agreement with the presence of both proteins in the same complexes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B). The 76p was specifically recognized by R190 antibodies in mammalian cell extracts (PtK2 cells) in which it represents, similarly to Î³-tubulin, â0.02% wt/wt of the cellular proteins ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C). Antibodies R801 and R190 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D) specifically labeled a single band at 76 kD in oocyte extracts (x76p), suggesting that the sequence of this protein was conserved in vertebrates. Moreover, x76p and Î³-tubulin were present in similar amounts and represented â0.02% wt/wt of the proteins of the oocyte extract ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D).</p>

        <title>The 76p Is a Minor Protein of the Purified Î³-TuRCs</title>
        <p>Since h76p was associated to Î³-tubulin in mammalian protein complexes, it could be assumed that it was present in the fairly homogeneous Î³-TuRCs from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stearnsetal1991">Stearns et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>). An oocyte extract was sedimented on a sucrose gradient and both 76p and Î³-tubulin were revealed by immunoblotting. The distribution of x76p (R801 antibodies) was coincidental with the peak of Î³-tubulin (C3 antibodies). Both proteins were exclusively recovered in complexes larger than 19 S ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A) corresponding to the Î³-TuRCs as defined by <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>. Immunoprecipitation of the fractions of the sucrose gradient corresponding to the Î³-TuRCs by h76p antibodies (R190) and immunoblotting with Î³-tubulin antibodies (C3) further demonstrated that both proteins were present in the same complexes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B). However, this experiment did not exclude the possibility that a fraction of x76p assembled in complexes devoid of Î³-tubulin and cosedimented with the Î³-TuRCs. To check this possibility, Î³-tubulin from an oocyte extract (7 mg/ml) was immunoprecipitated with rabbit antibodies (R74). Despite the inability to analyze the immunoprecipitate with rabbit 76p antibodies, the experiment showed the disappearance of both Î³-tubulin (C3 antibodies) and x76p (R190 antibodies) from the supernatant (not shown). Hence, in oocyte extracts, most Î³-tubulin and x76p are expected to be present in Î³-TuRCs in an apparent ratio of â1 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D). In contrast, stoichiometry determinations based on Coomassie staining suggested that the 76-kD polypeptide band corresponded to a minor protein both in <italic>Xenopus</italic> ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>) and mammalian brain purified Î³-tubulin complexes ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35923d0">DÃ©traves et al. 1997</xref>). Using defined amounts of Î³-tubulin complexes and recombinant h76p as an internal standard, we confirmed that 76p was approximately fivefold less abundant than Î³-tubulin in preparations of pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> C). Loss of 76p in some Î³-tubulin complexes and/or selective loss of some Î³-tubulin complexes during purification is a likely possibility. To assess whether all purified Î³-tubulin complexes contained h76p, mammalian Î³-tubulin complexes were sedimented and the resuspended pellet was repeatedly subjected to immunoprecipitation either with R801 or with R190 antibodies. In each case, the first cycle of 76p depletion removed some Î³-tubulin from the preparation, but further cycles failed to strongly deplete the supernatant from Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> D, M + R801 and M + R190). However, a similar result was obtained with the native Î³-TuRCs directly immunoprecipitated from a crude <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte extract ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> D, X + R190). Hence, both purified and native Î³-tubulin complexes are likely to be heterogeneous. The inaccessibility of the 76p in some Î³-tubulin complexes could account for these observations although two antibodies raised against distinct regions of 76p were used. Alternatively, the average stoichiometry of 76p in Î³-TuRCs could be different from the actual stoichiometry in individual Î³-TuRC.</p>
        <p>Most of the purified Î³-tubulin complexes bind to microtubule minus extremities ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35923d0">DÃ©traves et al. 1997</xref>). Since 76p is present in a fraction of Î³-tubulin complexes, we investigated whether 76p could bind to microtubules. After incubation of pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes (â100 ng of Î³-tubulin) with taxol-stabilized microtubules (450 Î¼g), free and bound Î³-tubulin complexes were readily separated by differential sedimentation (at 62,000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with Î³-tubulin (C3) and 76p (R801) antibodies ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35923d0">DÃ©traves et al. 1997</xref>). At 0 and 37Â°C in the absence of tubulin, the Î³-tubulin complexes failed to sediment and both 76p and Î³-tubulin remained in the supernatant. The same result was observed when Î³-tubulin complexes were mixed with pure tubulin unable to assemble both at 0 and 37Â°C. In contrast, a definite amount of 76p and Î³-tubulin sedimented in the presence of microtubules assembled in the presence of taxol (not shown). These observations suggested the following: (1) 76p could bind directly or indirectly to microtubules; and (2) 76p neither acts as an inhibitor of the fixation of Î³-tubulin to microtubules nor is released from the complexes during their binding to microtubule.</p>

        <title>The 76-kD Protein Is Localized to the Centrosome and Spindle Poles</title>
        <p>The centrosomal localization of 76p was assessed by immunofluorescence staining with three polyclonal antibodies (R801, R190, and R629/30) using cold methanol-fixed PtK2 cells. In all cases, 76p colocalized with Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A) to the centrosome, which appeared as a diplosome during interphase ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B), and to the spindle poles at the different stages of mitosis ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, EâJ and L). Both in interphase and mitosis, the labeling raised by h76p antibodies was specific as shown by the absence of staining when the antibodies were preincubated with the immunizing peptide ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> C). Observation of the immunofluorescent figures showed that the amount of 76p to the centrosome transiently increased during mitosis. The difficulty to exactly determine centrosome limits prevented the accurate determination of the overall fluorescence (average fluorescence Ã area), and led us to choose the maximal centrosomal fluorescence as a quantitative parameter ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, bottom). The maximal fluorescence, which did not vary significantly in interphase, increased â6-fold from prophase to prometaphase/metaphase and decreased thereafter to its interphase level in late telophase. A similar variation has been previously reported for Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lajoie-Mazencetal1994">Lajoie-Mazenc et al. 1994</xref>). As was the case for Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Marschalletal1996">Marschall et al. 1996</xref>), h103p and h104p ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Murphyetal1998">Murphy et al. 1998</xref>), treatment with colcemid (2 Î¼M for 2 h) did not modify the presence of 76p in the interphase centrosome ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> D) and its recruitment during mitosis ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> H).</p>
        <p>As for Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lajoie-Mazencetal1994">Lajoie-Mazenc et al. 1994</xref>), 76p was not only a centrosomal protein, but also relocalized during mitosis. Antibodies R190 directed against the carboxy-terminal region of h76p showed that some 76p was present in the metaphase spindle (not shown), although this localization was not observed with antibodies R801 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> G), in the midzone between the two separating chromosomal masses in anaphase ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> I, arrow) and in telophase ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> J, arrows) as previously observed with Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lajoie-Mazencetal1994">Lajoie-Mazenc et al. 1994</xref>). In contrast to Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Julianetal1993">Julian et al. 1993</xref>) and h104p ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tassinetal1998">Tassin et al. 1998</xref>), which are transiently present in the two regions corresponding to the minus ends of the microtubules constituting the midbody ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> K, arrows), in no case the various antibodies against h76p revealed the presence of this protein ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> L).</p>
        <p>The subcellular localization of 76p was observed in methanol-fixed cells, but no specific immunostaining was obtained using other fixation procedures. Neither formaldehyde- and glutaraldehyde-fixed PtK2 cells nor permeabilized cells with and without formaldehyde fixation showed a centrosomal staining when probed with the different h76p antibodies, whereas in all cases Î³-tubulin antibodies decorated the centrosome. To confirm the centrosomal localization of h76p, a fusion protein between GFP and h76p (GFP-h76p) was transiently overexpressed in COS cells. The 103-kD fusion protein was specifically detected in protein extracts from transfected cells by immunoblotting with both h76p (R801) and GFP antibodies ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). Since 50% of the cells were transfected, the average overexpression was â200-fold as judged with a range of recombinant h76p. In interphase cells, the GFP-h76p was present at the centrosome where it colocalized with Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> D), whereas in mitotic cells the GFP-h76p localized at the spindle poles and was absent from the mitotic spindle ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. C</xref>). Hence, the presence of the GFP moiety at the amino terminus of h76p did not modify its localization to the interphase and mitotic centrosomes. Since the transfection method used in PtK2 cells induced multipolar mitoses ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), we repeated these experiments applying another method to HeLa cells. Overexpression of h76p in HeLa cells (not shown) confirmed its immunolocalization and also failed to induce evident modifications of the microtubule cytoskeleton morphology. However, 72 h after transfection, 80% of HeLa cells expressing GFP-h76p exhibited a nuclear fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. F</xref>), whereas only 12% were observed in cells expressing GFP. This suggests that h76p overexpression could be deleterious to cells by analogy with toxic effects due to Spc97p and Spc98p overexpression in yeast ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Geissleretal1996">Geissler et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Knopetal1997">Knop et al. 1997</xref>).</p>

        <p>It has been previously demonstrated that the Î³-TuRCs present in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte extracts ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stearnsetal1991">Stearns et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>) are recruited by sperm basal bodies, where they are necessary for the nucleation of microtubule asters ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35924f0">FÃ©lix et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="StearnsandKirschner1994">Stearns and Kirschner 1994</xref>). In agreement with its centrosomal localization, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that 76p was present in the basal bodies of permeabilized <italic>Xenopus</italic> spermatozoa incubated in an oocyte extract ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A). The 76p was present at the extremities of the elongated sperm nuclei where it colocalized with Î³-tubulin. The function of 76p ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, left) was compared with Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, right) using permeabilized spermatozoa incubated at 22Â°C in an oocyte extract and challenged for their ability to nucleate microtubule asters. About 85â90% of spermatozoa nucleated a microtubule aster when incubated in a competent oocyte extract ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, diamond). When the extract was partially depleted with antibodies against either Î³-tubulin (R74) or h76p (R801), only 17â19% and 0â10% of the basal bodies assembled a microtubule aster, respectively ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, open circle). These inhibitions were specific since they did not occur when the immunodepletion was conducted in the presence of the respective immunizing peptides (â76 and 83%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, open triangle), preimmune antibodies (â84 and 72%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, closed circle) or antibodies that are unrelated to <italic>Xenopus</italic> centrosomal proteins (â79%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, closed inverted triangle). Moreover, addition of mammalian Î³-tubulin complexes to Î³-tubulinâ or 76p-depleted oocyte extracts restored their capacity to induce asters on sperm basal bodies (â77 and 78%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, square).</p>
        <p>It was likely that 76p and Î³-tubulin were recruited by the sperm basal bodies. The recruitment kinetics of these two proteins, followed in the presence of 5 Î¼M nocodazole during a 20-min incubation period ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> C), paralleled the assembly of microtubule asters ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B). The specificity of the recruitment of Î³-tubulin and 76p was further studied after a 20-min incubation period ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> D). Barely detectable in permeabilized spermatozoa (Sp) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> D, lane 1), both Î³-tubulin and 76p were revealed when the spermatozoa were incubated in a crude oocyte extract ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> D, lane 2, Sp + E). The same amounts of Î³-tubulin and 76p were observed in spermatozoa incubated in an oocyte extract treated either with h76p antibodies (R801) incubated in the presence of the immunizing peptide or with R801 preimmune antibodies ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> D, lanes 4 and 5). Partial immunodepletion of the oocyte extract with h76p antibodies (R801) appeared highly efficient, and resulted in a severe drop in the accumulation of 76p and to a less extent of Î³-tubulin in incubated spermatozoa ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> D, lane 3). These observations demonstrated that 76p, like Î³-tubulin, was recruited to the sperm basal bodies and that the recruitment was independent of the presence of microtubules as observed during mitosis. The quantity of 76p in permeabilized spermatozoa and spermatozoa incubated in an oocyte extract was quantified by immunoblotting by comparison with a range of recombinant h76p ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> E) â0.45 ng (Â± 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 4) and â4 ng (Â±0.5, <italic>n</italic> = 4) of 76p were observed per 10<sup>6</sup> spermatozoa before and after incubation in an oocyte extract, respectively. This â9-fold increase of 76p in nucleation-competent spermatozoa strongly suggests that this protein participates to the maturation of the basal bodies as previously suggested for Î³-tubulin and the <italic>Xenopus</italic> orthologue (Xgrip109) of h104p ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35924f0">FÃ©lix et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="StearnsandKirschner1994">Stearns and Kirschner 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Martinetal1998">Martin et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since the stoichiometry of 76p in native Î³-TuRCs could be variable, 76p could act as a limiting factor in the nucleation of asters especially after its immunodepletion. This hypothesis was strengthened by addition of recombinant h76p to a partially x76p-depleted extract ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, closed triangle). Although the 76p-depleted extract promoted the assembly of â0â10% asters, addition of recombinant h76p partially restored their formation to â50%. In contrast, addition of recombinant h76p to a partially Î³-tubulinâdepleted extract failed to restore the capacity of the basal bodies to nucleate asters: â19 and 21% without and with recombinant h76p, respectively. These observations suggested that recombinant h76p could complement a 76p-depleted extract, but not a Î³-tubulinâdepleted extract. Therefore, it is likely that 76p does not act directly in aster nucleation, but participates in the assembly of active centrosomes. It is possible that recombinant h76p could bind to the Î³-TuRCs still present in the partially x76p-depleted <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract and, thus, restore the nucleating activity. But the capacity of recombinant h76p to restore aster nucleation in a partially x76p-depleted extract (â50%) was lower than the capacity of mammalian Î³-tubulin complexes (â78%) although the amount of recombinant h76p was â4,000-fold higher than the amount of 76p added when mammalian Î³-tubulin complexes were used. The presence of inactive recombinant h76p in the preparation could account for this difference. Alternatively, some other limiting factors from the 76p-depleted extract could be necessary to recover complete nucleation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Soluble Î³-tubulin complexes are expected to constitute the functional unit of the MTOCs ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>). The characterization of their constituents is an essential step towards the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of microtubule nucleation. We report the identification of the h76p protein, which is a new evolutionary conserved centrosomal constituent associated with Î³-tubulin. The h76p was initially characterized by microsequencing from mammalian brain Î³-tubulin complexes. The amino-terminal and internal amino acid sequences as well as the mass distribution of the peptides resulting from tryptic digestion (not shown) revealed only the 76p in the electrophoretic band of the pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes migrating at 76 kD. The multiple polypeptide bands observed in the 76-kD range in <italic>Xenopus</italic> Î³-tubulin complexes ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>) could result from posttranslational modifications of a highly predominant constituent. Alternatively, it is not possible to exclude the presence of other proteins since we detected the light neurofilament protein in the 76-kD band of sheep brain Î³-tubulin complexes both by microsequencing and immunoblot (not shown).</p>
      <p>Identification of numerous human and murine ESTs homologous to 76p (accession numbers AA790714, T33250, AA190050, AA352362, W27984, AA115395, A1025270, and AA893682) reveals that 76p mRNA is present in various tissues (skin, mammary glands, liver, heart, retina, colon, testis, and placenta) and could be ubiquitously expressed in animal cells, as are Î³-tubulin and the two other Î³-tubulinâassociated proteins, h103p (hGCP2) and h104p (hGCP3). In somatic cells, 76p, like Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stearnsetal1991">Stearns et al. 1991</xref>), represents â0.02% of the total cellular proteins. It is not only present in soluble <italic>Xenopus</italic> Î³-TuRCs and heterogeneous mammalian Î³-tubulin complexes, but like Î³-tubulin, h103p and h104p, is a bona fide centrosomal protein. This is demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining of 76p in PtK2 cells and mature <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm basal bodies, and the localization of GFP-h76p fusion protein in COS cells. Moreover, like Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stearnsetal1991">Stearns et al. 1991</xref>), h103p and h104p ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Murphyetal1998">Murphy et al. 1998</xref>), 76p is associated with the centrosome independently of the presence of microtubules. An average of â4 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> molecules of 76p per centrosome was present in sperm basal bodies incubated in an oocyte extract, a value similar to the number of molecules of Î³-tubulin per <italic>Xenopus</italic> centrosome ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stearnsetal1991">Stearns et al. 1991</xref>). Moreover, 76p is not only an integral centrosomal protein, but relocalized in the mitotic apparatus like Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Julianetal1993">Julian et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lajoie-Mazencetal1994">Lajoie-Mazenc et al. 1994</xref>) and h104p ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tassinetal1998">Tassin et al. 1998</xref>), although the localization of these proteins can differ as observed in the midbody.</p>
      <p>Besides its centrosomal location, 76p associates in vitro with a microtubule similar to Î³-tubulin, h103p, and h104p ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Murphyetal1998">Murphy et al. 1998</xref>). Hence, 76p does not act as an inhibitor of the interaction between Î³-tubulin and the Î±/Î²-tubulin heterodimers and neither dissociates before the binding of the Î³-tubulin complexes to the centrosome nor inhibits their binding. The amounts of 76p (this report), Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stearnsetal1991">Stearns et al. 1991</xref>), h103p, h104p ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Murphyetal1998">Murphy et al. 1998</xref>), and pericentrin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Doxseyetal1994">Doxsey et al. 1994</xref>) on the centrosome increase concomitantly in early mitosis. The involvement of 76p in microtubule nucleation processes is further demonstrated by the failure of <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm basal bodies to assemble asters when incubated in 76p-depleted oocyte extracts and the recovery of the capacity to assemble asters after addition of mammalian Î³-tubulin complexes or recombinant h76p. This observation confirmed that, in addition to Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35924f0">FÃ©lix et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="StearnsandKirschner1994">Stearns and Kirschner 1994</xref>), other proteins of the Î³-TuRC, 76p (this report) and the <italic>Xenopus</italic> orthologue (Xgrip109) of h104p ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Martinetal1998">Martin et al. 1998</xref>) are necessary for the nucleation process.</p>
      <p>In purified Î³-tubulin complexes, 76p is at least fivefold less abundant than Î³-tubulin, in agreement with previous quantifications of the 76-kD band by Coomassie staining ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhengetal1995">Zheng et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2c13f70N0x35923d0">DÃ©traves et al. 1997</xref>). The loss of 76p and/or the loss of some Î³-tubulin complexes during purification could account for this observation since equivalent quantities of Î³-tubulin and 76p are observed in the native Î³-TuRCs present in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte extracts. But the number of 76p in Î³-tubulin complexes could be also heterogeneous as suggested by several observations. First, using two different antibodies, we failed to immunoprecipitate all Î³-tubulin in preparations of mammalian Î³-tubulin complexes and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte extracts. Second, addition of recombinant h76p to an x76p-depleted <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte extract partially restored the capacity of basal bodies to nucleate asters.</p>
      <p>Orthologues to human 76p were cloned from insects (d75p) and angiosperms (m85p) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), and are likely present in mosses (EST, AJ225509). The identity between the three sequenced orthologue proteins varies from â31 to 34%. Therefore, the 76p proteins seem to generally occur in eukaryotic cells. The identification of a 76p orthologue in higher plants is particularly of note. The exact nature of the MTOCs remains poorly understood in plants. However, Î³-tubulin has been identified in a variety of plants and found to localize at numerous microtubule nucleation sites ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1994">Liu et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="JoshiandPavelitz1996">Joshi and Pavelitz 1996</xref>). The isolation of the m85p gives additional support to an evolutionary conservation of the constituents of the MTOCs. Sequence alignments based on the entire sequence of h76p, d75p, and m85p, or on highly conserved sequences between these three proteins failed to identify a 76p orthologue in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> genomes. Although it could be argued that the yeast spindle pole body could differ from the centrosome and that the 76p has been lost during the course of evolution, this view would not apply to the typical centrosome of nematodes. Rather, the inability to detect a orthologue in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> could result from a rapid divergence of 76p as previously observed for Î³-tubulin ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Burns1995">Burns 1995</xref>).</p>
      <p>Alignments based on sequence homologies and on hydrophobic cluster analysis ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Callebautetal1997">Callebaut et al. 1997</xref>) showed that the protein 76p exhibits significant sequence similarities with the two related centrosomal human h103p and h104p ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>) and their <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Dgrip84 and Dgrip91) and yeast orthologues (Spc97p and Spc98p) that are associated with Î³-tubulin in common protein complexes ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Geissleretal1996">Geissler et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Knopetal1997">Knop et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Martinetal1998">Martin et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Murphyetal1998">Murphy et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tassinetal1998">Tassin et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oegemaetal1999">Oegema et al. 1999</xref>). The amino-terminal regions of h103p (hGCP2) and h104p (hGCP3) are absent from 76p orthologues ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> A), and the homologies are distributed throughout the complete sequence of 76p ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> B). In the common region between these proteins, the identities between h76p and h103p (â23%) or h104p (â27%) were comparable with the identity observed between h103p and h104p (â33%), suggesting that this region corresponds to the core of these three Î³-tubulinâassociated proteins ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Hence, it is likely that these proteins originate from a unique gene family that diverged early in the evolution of eukaryotic cells. Identities between h76p, h103p, and h104p could possibly imply some common functional properties such as the positioning of Î³-tubulin at the MTOCs ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Geissleretal1996">Geissler et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="KnopandSchiebel1997">Knop and Schiebel 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="KnopandSchiebel1998">Knop and Schiebel 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Knopetal1997">Knop et al. 1997</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that h76p, h97p, and h98p could orient the binding of Î³-tubulin through specific interactions with different docking proteins and possibly specify the nucleation of different microtubule arrays as observed for Spc98p at the inner plaque of the yeast spindle pole body ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Nguyenetal1998">Nguyen et al. 1998</xref>). The mode of interaction between h76p and the other components of the human Î³-tubulin complexes together with the analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> d75p mutants could shed some light on the function of h76p, and are currently under investigation.</p>

        <p>Characterization of 76p in the Î³-tubulin complexes and in cell extracts. (A) Antibodies against h76p labeled the 76-kD polypeptide band. Pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes submitted to SDS-PAGE were either stained with Coomassie blue (15 Î¼g of Î³-tubulin) or immunoblotted (50 ng of Î³-tubulin) with antibodies R72, R801, R190, and R29/30. All antibodies labeled the polypeptide at â76 kD. The specificity of the labeling was controlled by preincubation with the immunizing peptide (+P). (B) Presence of 76p and Î³-tubulin in the same protein complexes. Pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes (250 ng of Î³-tubulin) were immunoprecipitated with immune or preimmune h76p antibodies (R801). The immunoprecipitates (protein AâSepharose beads, lanes b) and the corresponding supernatants (lanes s, one fifth of the initial volume) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with Î³-tubulin antibodies (C3).

        <p>Biochemical properties of 76p. (A) 76p cosediment with Î³-tubulin in <italic>Xenopus</italic> Î³-TuRCs. An oocyte extract (1 mg of protein) was submitted to a sedimentation in a 5-ml linear 5â40% sucrose gradient (160,000 <italic>g</italic> for 4 h and 15 min at 0Â°C). The fractions (0.5 ml) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with Î³-tubulin (C3) and 76p (R801) antibodies. Both proteins cosediment with an apparent mass corresponding to the Î³-TuRCs (the arrow corresponds to the sedimentation of thyroglobulin at 669 kD or 19 S). (B) Presence of 76p in <italic>Xenopus</italic> Î³-TuRCs. The presence of 76p in Î³-TuRCs was assessed by the immunoprecipitation of Î³-tubulin with x76p. Fractions 4â7 of the sucrose gradient (A) corresponding to Î³-TuRCs were immunoprecipitated by immune or preimmune 76p antibodies (R190). The protein AâSepharose beads (b) and a fraction of the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with Î³-tubulin antibodies (C3). Protein AâSepharose beads carrying preimmune antibodies failed to immunoprecipitate Î³-tubulin, while a small fraction of Î³-tubulin was recovered linked to the beads carrying the immune antibodies. (C) Determination of the amount of 76p in purified mammalian Î³-tubulin complexes. Pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes, submitted to SDS-PAGE, were immunoblotted with h76p antibodies (R801), and the amount of 76p was determined by comparison with a range of recombinant h76p. (D) Immunodepletion of a small fraction of Î³-tubulin complexes by h76p antibodies. High molecular masses purified pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes (M), obtained by centrifugation through a 40% sucrose cushion (â500 ng of Î³-tubulin) and a <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte extract (X, â2 mg of protein), were submitted to three successive cycles of immunodepletion with h76p antibodies (beads with R801 and R190 for purified mammalian Î³-tubulin complexes and beads with R190 for <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract).

(A) Presence of GFP-h76p in COS-transfected cells. In control (C) cell extracts (20 Î¼g), no polypeptide bands were detected both by antiâGFP (GFP) and antiâ76p antibodies (R801). In transfected cells (T) both antibodies labeled the 103-kD fusion protein. The average expression of GFP-h76p in transfected cell extract (T cells) was determined with R801 antibodies by comparison with a range of recombinant h76p. (BâD) Centrosomal localization of GFP-h76p in COS-transfected cells. In mitotic cells, the GFP-h76p (B and C, upper row) localized at the spindle poles as shown by a coimmunofluorescent staining with Î±-tubulin antibodies (B, lower row), and Î³-tubulin antibodies (C, lower row). In interphase cells, the GFP-h76p (D, upper row) colocalized with Î³-tubulin (D, lower row) although the fluorescence raised by GFP-h76p appeared broader than the Î³-tubulin staining. The transformed cells exhibited numerous multipolar spindles and showed frequently two diplosomes localized in close proximity in interphase, but controls performed with the vector expressing GFP alone suggested that the increase in centrosome number was a consequence of the transfection treatment rather than because of h76p overexpression.

(diamond) Control, spermatozoa incubated in an untreated <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte extract; (open circle) spermatozoa incubated in extract depleted with h76p (R801) or Î³-tubulin (R74) antibodies; (open triangle) spermatozoa incubated in extract depleted with h76p or Î³-tubulin antibodies in the presence of the corresponding immunizing peptide (500 Î¼g/ml); (closed circle) spermatozoa incubated in extract depleted with h76p and Î³-tubulin preimmune antibodies; (inverted triangle) spermatozoa incubated with antibodies unrelated to <italic>Xenopus</italic> centrosomal proteins (R82 directed against the carboxy-terminal region of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Î³-tubulin); (square) spermatozoa incubated in h76p- or Î³-tubulinâdepleted extract further complemented with purified pig brain Î³-tubulin complexes (corresponding to 2 ng of Î³-tubulin and 0.4 ng of 76p), and (closed triangle) spermatozoa incubated in a 76p- or Î³-tubulinâdepleted extract complemented with an extract containing recombinant h76p (1.5 Î¼g of recombinant h76p). No effects were observed when an extract devoid of recombinant protein was used (not shown). (C) Recruitment kinetics of 76p and Î³-tubulin to the sperm basal bodies. Spermatozoa (Sp, 40 Î¼g) were incubated in the oocyte extract in the presence of 5 Î¼M nocodazole. Samples (Sp + E) taken at various times were centrifuged at 4Â°C for 5 min. 76p and Î³-tubulin, recruited to spermatozoa, were revealed after SDS-PAGE by immunoblotting (R801 and R74 antibodies, respectively) and compared with untreated spermatozoa (Sp). (D) Specificity of the recruitment of the 76p and Î³-tubulin to the sperm basal bodies. Î³-tubulin and 76p were detected by immunoblotting with R74 and R801 antibodies, whereas the polypeptide band at 33 kD, observed after Coomassie blue staining, was used as a standard to check the recovery of sperm heads.

        <p>Comparison of the amino acid sequences of human 76p, 103p (h97p) and 104p (h98p). (A) Regions of homology of the three proteins (shaded area). (B) Sequence comparison in the regions of homology. Identical and homologue amino acids are shown by bold letters and by shaded areas, respectively. Consensus amino acids between h76p, h103p and h104p are underlined. Comparison between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> shows that the consensus amino acids between h76p, d75p, and m85p and the consensus amino acids between h76p, h103p, and h104p are 18% identical. The alignments have been performed using both the similarities of sequences and the conservation of the expected structural motifs ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Callebautetal1997">Callebaut et al. 1997</xref>).</p>
