        <p>Perilipins are lipid droplet surface proteins that contribute to fat metabolism by controlling the access of lipids to lipolytic enzymes. Perilipins have been identified in organisms as diverse as metazoa, fungi, and amoebas but strikingly not in nematodes. Here we identify the protein encoded by the <italic>W01A8.1</italic> gene in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as the closest homologue and likely orthologue of metazoan perilipin. We demonstrate that nematode <italic>W01A8.1</italic> is a cytoplasmic protein residing on lipid droplets similarly as human perilipins 1 and 2. Downregulation or elimination of <italic>W01A8.1</italic> affects the appearance of lipid droplets resulting in the formation of large lipid droplets localized around the dividing nucleus during the early zygotic divisions. Visualization of lipid containing structures by CARS microscopy <italic>in vivo</italic> showed that lipid-containing structures become gradually enlarged during oogenesis and relocate during the first zygotic division around the dividing nucleus. In mutant embryos, the lipid containing structures show defective intracellular distribution in subsequent embryonic divisions and become gradually smaller during further development. In contrast to embryos, lipid-containing structures in enterocytes and in epidermal cells of adult animals are smaller in mutants than in wild type animals. Our results demonstrate the existence of a perilipin-related regulation of fat metabolism in nematodes and provide new possibilities for functional studies of lipid metabolism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Perilipins are regulatory proteins targeted to the surface of fat storage organelles called lipid dropplets (LDs) where they contribute to the regulation of lipid metabolism (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Brasaemle, 2007</xref>). Functional perilipins (PLIN proteins encoded by the <italic>PLIN</italic> genes) (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2001</xref>) have been identified in very diverse organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Teixeira et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2013</xref>) and fungi (<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Wang &amp; St Leger, 2007</xref>) and protein databases list clear orthologues in diverse, non-plant eukaryota, including the simplest metazoan <italic>Trichoplax adherens</italic>, sponges, crustaceans, and choanoflagelates (UniProt proteins B3RRM2, I1GA14, G5DCP6, F2UJD9, respectively). In humans and other mammals, the PLIN family consists of five members (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Kimmel et al., 2010</xref>) (Perilipin 1â5) with diverse tissue distribution, specificity, and partially redundant functions. Strikingly, no perilipin othologue has been identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that nematode-specific lipid regulatory pathways might exist in this phylum and perhaps in others as well.</p>
      <p>This unusual evolutionary gap in the perilipins prompted us to re-examine the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome for a gene related to mammalian perilipin. We identify <italic>W01A8.1</italic> as the likely <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of mammalian perilipin genes. We show that W01A8.1 is the previously unrecognized <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue of vertebrate perilipins that possesses all functional domains characteristic for perilipins and functions in lipid metabolism at the level of lipid droplets.</p>
      <p>The protein encoded by W01A8.1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is identified as Me<underline>d</underline>ia<underline>t</underline>or Complex subunit 28 (MDT-28) in many protein databases (e.g., Pfam, UniProt, PIR, WormPep) (accessed on March 14, 2015), but the bioinformatics analysis reveals that this is a misannotation. We observe that protein isoforms expressed from <italic>W01A8.1</italic> are cytoplasmic proteins, residing predominantly on membranous structures of enterocytes and epidermal cells that have the characteristics of lipid droplets. We also show that transgene-encoded GFP fusion proteins of human Perilipins 1 and 2 localize in <italic>C. elegans</italic> similarly as W01A8.1::GFP on vesicular structures that are positive for lipid content. Furthermore, down regulation of <italic>W01A8.1</italic> by RNAi or its elimination lead to an altered appearance and behavior of lipid droplets prominently observed in the germline and in early embryos. Our results indicate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> can compensate for the loss of <italic>W01A8.1</italic> in all developmental stages except early embryos likely by additional fat degradation mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Our data demonstrates that the perilipin-related regulation of fat metabolism is conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and provides a novel insight into early embryonic lipid management. This discovery offers promising possibilities for functional studies of lipid metabolism in a nematode model system.</p>

        <title>Strains, transgenic lines and genome editing</title>
        <p>Wild type animals, N2 (var. Bristol), were used unless otherwise noted and all strains were maintained as described (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Brenner, 1974</xref>). Transgenic lines were prepared using microinjections into gonads of young adult N2 hermaphrodites as described (<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Tabara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Timmons, Court &amp; Fire, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Vohanka et al., 2010</xref>). All injections also included mCherry co-injection markers: pCFJ90, pCJ104 and pGH8 (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Dickinson et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
        <p>To create mutants, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 system as described (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Dickinson et al., 2013</xref>). The following plasmids were constructed: pCK001 targeting the sgRNA (+323) to the second exon of the <italic>W01A8.1</italic> gene (forward primer #7992), and pCK023 targeting the sgRNA (+1,372) to the sixth exon (forward primer #8078). The reverse primer was #7993. A scheme of known expressed isoforms listed in WormBase WS246 and the strategy for the disruption of <italic>W01A8.1</italic> gene is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Figs.

        <p>The following transgenic lines regulated by <italic>W01A8.1</italic> natural promoter were prepared: <italic>W01A8.1a/c::gfp</italic> and <italic>W01A8.1b::gfp</italic> (containing the whole coding sequence of isoforms a and b). <italic>W01A8.1</italic> isoforms a and c have identical 3â² ends which both could be expressed from <italic>W01A8.1a/c::gfp</italic>. This construct also includes complete untagged isoform b. The GFP-tagged isoform a (plasmid pCK28 {<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>W01A8.1</italic></sub>::<italic>W01A8.1(a)synth::gfp::unc-54 3</italic>â² <italic>UTR</italic>}) was constructed by synthesizing the <italic>W01A8.1a</italic> sequence with modified codons to allow protection from CRISPR/Cas9 targeted sgRNA and prepared as a GeneArt<sup>Â®</sup> Stringsâ¢ DNA Fragment from Invitrogen (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and cloned using GeneArt<sup>Â®</sup> Seamless Cloning System (Invitrogen) into pPD95.75(NeoR).

<italic>in vitro</italic> Transcription Systems; Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) from opposing promoters and subsequent annealing of each single stranded RNA (ssRNA) product prior to injection. For RNAi directed against <italic>W01A8.1</italic>, BamHI or ApaI linearized pCK014 plasmid preparations were used in separate reactions to generate complementary ssRNA. After linearization, the DNA was phenol-chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. BamHI linearized DNA was transcribed using T7 RNA Polymerase while ApaI linearized DNA with SP6 RNA Polymerase. After <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (â¼2 h), equal volumes of sense and antisense RNA were incubated at 75 Â°C for 10 min and then cooled at room temperature for 30 min. Control RNAi was prepared from the promoter region of <italic>nhr-60</italic> as previously described (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Simeckova et al., 2007</xref>).

        <title>Fecundity and brood size assay</title>
        <p>Fecundity measurement following RNAi (injection method) was conducted using a total of 50 young adult worms (25 control and 25 inhibited by RNAi specific for <italic>W01A8.1</italic>). Progeny was counted 24 h and again 48 h after injections. Brood size assay was performed for W01A8.1 disrupted animals and controls (<italic>n</italic> = 15 for each group). The progeny was determined during 6 days. The experiments were conducted at room temperature â¼22 Â°C.</p>
        <p>Fecundity measurement after RNAi using feeding protocol was performed over two generations to maximize the effect of knockdown. For this, a semi-synchronized population was isolated using standard WormBook (<uri xlink:href="http://www.wormbook.org/">http://www.wormbook.org/</uri>) bleaching protocol. Hatched L1 stage worms were placed on NGM agar RNAi (<italic>W01A8.1</italic> specific and control) plates at â¼22 Â°C. Small, synchronized populations, of parents (P0) were transferred to fresh RNAi plates and allowed to lay progeny (F1). F1 generation animals were transferred to new RNAi plates and F2 generation was scored for a total of 21 F1 parents in each group. The experiment was repeated twice to confirm the results.</p>

A HC PL IRAPO 40x water immersion objective was used for the imaging and CARS signal was detected with a non-descanned photon multiplier tube detector at the transmitted light side. For imaging of CH<sub>2</sub> vibration with Raman shift of 2,868 cm<sup>â1</sup> pump wavelength of 815.5 nm was used. The CARS signal was selected with a CARS2000 filter cube placed in front of the detector. Adult animals and embryos were completely scanned and recorded as stacks of focal planes.

        <title>Identification of a perilipin orthologue in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
        <p>We performed BLASTp searches with individual protein sequences of human perilipins that generated no significant hits to Nematoda sequences in the UniProt database, consistent with previous efforts that failed to identify a perilipin-related protein in this phylum. However, when a sequence alignment of chordate perilipins 2 and 3 (OMA database) was submitted as query in PSI-BLAST, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein W01A8.1a (Q23095_CAEEL) was identified as a highly significant hit (<italic>E</italic> = 3 Ã 10<sup>â13</sup>). A reciprocal PSI-BLAST search with the aligned closest nematode homologues of W01A8.1a identified chordate perilipins as strong hits with human Perilipin 2 (significance score <italic>E</italic> = 10<sup>â53</sup>) appearing in the second iteration of the search. Similarly, HHpred profile-to-profile searches with human perilipin sequences as a query of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteome identified proteins coded by W01A8.1 (a, b or c) and reciprocally W01A8.1a showed profile homology to all human perilipins and the corresponding Pfam (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Punta et al., 2012</xref>) perilipin profile (PF03036). Each available nematode proteome contained only a single such perilipin-related sequence, in stark contrast to the insect and chordate proteomes that had 2â5 perilipin paralogues. A sequence alignment of Plin2 and 3 from two selected vertebrates is compared with their nematode homologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). Although the sequence-to sequence comparisons are not sufficient to unravel the sequence homology between vertebrate and nematode Plins, the similarity appear clearly in the profile-to sequence (PSI-BLAST) and profile-to-profile (HHpred) searches. We conclude that vertebrate Plins and nematode W01A8.1 are statistically highly significant homologues.</p>

            <title>Identification of <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein W01A8.1a as a close homologue of vertebrate perilipin.</title>
            <p><italic>C. elegans</italic> protein W01A8.1a is compared with nematode homologues of pairwise sequence identity lower then 70% and with Plin2 and 3 from two diverse vertebrates. The three perilipin specific domains (indicated in red) were identified through homology with human Plin3. The six 11-mer repeats in W01A8.1a (positions 126â136, 137â147, 148â158, 159â169, 170â180 and 181â191) were established with HHrepID algorithm (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Biegert &amp; Soding, 2008</xref>). The N-terminal PAT domain is thought to interact with HSL. The central domain consisting of imperfect 11-mer repeats forming amphipathic helices is responsible for the main affinity to LDs and the C-terminal domain containing an apolipoprotein-like 4-helix bundle probably plays an additional role in the affinity to LDs and is known to interact with ABHD5 in mammalian Plin1 and 3 (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Brasaemle, 2007</xref>). Alignment was done using T-coffee alignment of all available nematode sequences aligned with vertebrate Plin2 and 3 sequences in three iterations using ProfileAlign routine in MyHits suite (myhits.isb-sib.ch). Selected sequences from top to bottom: (Species, database identifier): <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, Q23095; <italic>Strongyloides ratti</italic>, CACX01001972.1; <italic>Loa loa</italic>, E1G5Y0 and ADBU02007219.1; <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic>, CDJ80228.1; <italic>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</italic>, CADV01008520.1; <italic>Heterorhabditis bacteriophora</italic>, ES742365.1 and ACKM01001830.1; <italic>Ascaris suum</italic>, U1NU60; <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> 2, PLIN2_HUMAN; <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> 3, PLIN3_HUMAN; <italic>Latimeria chalumnae</italic> 2, H3AYC0; <italic>Latimeria chalumnae</italic> 3, GAAA01019375.1.

        <p>The alignment encompasses a substantial part of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human sequences (e.g., 90% of W01A8.1 and 87% of Perilipin 2) and covers all three domains characteristic for perilipins (N-terminal PAT, imperfect amphiphilic 11-mer repeat (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Brasaemle, 2007</xref>) and C-terminal four-helix bundle (<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Hickenbottom et al., 2004</xref>)) covering approximately amino acids 10â100, 125â190 and 220â380 respectively in W01A8.1a. As W01A8.1 and human perilipins appear to be the best mutual reciprocal PSI-BLAST and HHpred hits, W01A8.1 is a very good candidate for a <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of perilipin.</p>
        <p>Protein databases annotate W01A8.1 as Mediator Complex subunit 28, hence the official protein name assignment of MDT-28 in WormBase (WS246). Pfam database (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Punta et al., 2012</xref>) based the Mediator 28 Hidden Markov model profile on a seed alignment of bovine and mosquito Mediator 28 sequences with W01A8.1. This very profile was probably used subsequently in all automatic annotations of the nematode sequences. However, no substantial homology between W01A8.1 and Mediator 28 exists as shown in the above searches. Since using the WormBase name of W01A8.1 (MDT-28) would be misleading, the gene is referred here by the cosmid name <italic>W01A8.1</italic>, which gives rise to at least three protein isoforms designated W01A8.1a, W01A8.1b, and W01A8.1c from at least seven different transcripts (<italic>W01A8.1a.1</italic>, <italic>W01A8.1a.2</italic>, <italic>W01A8.1b.1</italic>, <italic>W01A8.1b.2</italic>, <italic>W01A8.1b.3</italic>, <italic>W01A8.1c.1</italic>, <italic>W01A8.1c.2</italic>). The three protein isoforms are 415, 385, and 418 amino acid residues in length for isoform a, b, and c, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Fig. S1</xref>). According to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nomenclature, we suggest to rename <italic>W01A8.1</italic> as <italic>Cel-plin-1</italic> (isoform a, b, and c) and proteins Cel-PLIN-1 (isoform a, b, and c).</p>

        <title><italic>W01A8.1</italic> protein products are cytoplasmic and reside primarily on lipid droplets</title>
        <p>If the proteins encoded by <italic>W01A8.1</italic> act as perilipins, they would be expected to be associated with lipid droplets (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Kozusko et al., 2015</xref>). To test this, we created translational reporter transgenes regulated by the putative endogenous promoter expressing isoform b and lines in which the genomic locus was tagged by an in-frame C-terminal GFP cassette. The second transgene, <italic>W01A8.1a/c::gfp</italic>, is likely to express not only high levels of a and c tagged isoforms, but also the native isoform b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Fig. S1</xref>). The translational fusion constructs resulted in high levels of cytoplasmic proteins present in intestinal and epidermal cells on vesicular structures with the characteristic appearance of lipid droplets. This pattern of expression and cellular distribution was observed beginning at the three-fold embryonic stage and continued throughout development to adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). To confirm that the observed GFP-associated vesicular structures were indeed lipid droplets, transgenic animals were stained with the lipophilic reagent LipidTox as previously described (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">OâRourke et al., 2009</xref>). The translational GFP fusion protein reporters were localized at the periphery of fat droplets that were LipidTox positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Targeted disruption of <italic>W01A8.1</italic> results in early embryonic defects but not lethality</title>
        <p>In order to eliminate the W01A8.1 function completely, we designed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing approach to eliminate almost the entire coding region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Fig. S2</xref>). We also included a rescuing plasmid consisting of isoform a that was prepared as cDNA synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> using synonymous codons (<italic>W01A8.1(a)synth::gfp</italic>) that is protected against CRISPR/Cas9 targeted editing but allows the production of the wild type isoform a at the protein level. Lines that expressed the GFP fusion transgene were morphologically normal and W01A8.1(a)synth::GFP was found on lipid droplet-like structures as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Figs. 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">4G</xref>) that also stained positive by LipidTox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Figs. 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">4G</xref>). This transgenic strain yielded lines either carrying or losing the rescuing transgene in the background of a disrupted endogenous <italic>W01A8.1</italic>. The elimination of W01A8.1 was easily monitored by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3">Fig. S3</xref>). Surprisingly, animals with the deleted <italic>W01A8.1</italic> locus that lost the extra-chromosomal rescuing array were able to reproduce normally. From several lines that had a confirmed disruption of <italic>W01A8.1</italic> and a confirmed loss of the extrachromosomal array, the line CK123 (KV001) was selected and used for subsequent analyses. As was observed in <italic>W01A8.1</italic> RNAi embryos, loss of <italic>W01A8.1</italic> activity resulted in the formation of large LipidTox-positive structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Figs. 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">4I</xref>) that were clearly bigger than droplets observed in control embryos using the same protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Figs. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">4D</xref>). These large lipid-containing structures were observable in live mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4J</xref>) but not in wild type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4K</xref>) using Nomarski optics. Viewing through multiple focal planes in live, developing embryos lacking <italic>W01A8.1</italic> showed that these large lipid droplets are present in embryos during the early mitotic divisions and were localized around the nucleus. Staining with LipidTox (after fixation) confirmed the lipid content in the vesicular structures arranged around dividing nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Figs. 4L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">4M</xref>). These large vesicles persist through the two-cell stage, disappearing in most embryos with more than 6 cells. On fixed embryos stained with LipidTox, larger than wild type lipid droplets are visible until late embryonic stages, including three fold embryos.</p>
        <p>In order to visualize lipid-containing structures in <italic>W01A8.1</italic> null mutants and in controls <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used CARS microscopy (done with kind help from Dr. Zhongxiang Jiang, Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). The CARS systems allow visualization of lipids of specific categories by tuning into symmetric CH<sub>2</sub> vibrations of specific fat composing molecules (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Zumbusch, Langbein &amp; Borri, 2013</xref>). CARS microscopy clearly confirmed the formation of large lipid containing vesicles in early embryos and allowed detailed analysis of the <italic>W01A8.1</italic> null phenotype. CARS microscopy also confirmed the gradual increase of the size of lipid containing structures during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figs. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5B</xref>), the sudden re-localization of these structures to the periphery of the dividing nucleus in the first embryonic division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5E</xref>), and the propagation of this phenotype, although with gradually diminishing appearance, throughout embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figs. 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5H</xref>). CARS microscopy detected this phenomenon also in wild type animals, although the size of lipid containing structures was smaller making the phenomenon of the sudden re-localization of lipid containing structures less obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figs. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5G</xref>) than in <italic>W01A8.1</italic> null embryos. In contrast to embryos, lipid-containing structures in intestinal and epidermal cells of adult <italic>W01A8.1</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figs. 5J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5L</xref>) were smaller than lipid-containing structures in control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figs. 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5K</xref>).</p>

            <p>CARS microscopy was performed using constant magnification and intensity settings (20% laser intensity) with the exception of control embryos (C and G) that were examined at 30% laser intensity since the lipid content was lower in wild type. The brightness of the entire figure was digitally enhanced using Adobe Photoshop brightness setting (+150 units) for better visibility of structures. Arrows indicate lipid containing structures in paired panels. (A) The germline of a wild type adult hermaphrodite animal with small lipid containing structures in oocytes and an increase in their number and size during oogenesis. (B) The germline of a mutant hermaphrodite animal. Lipid containing structures are bigger compared to the control animal yet distributed evenly in mutant oocytes. (C) Lipid containing structures localize around the nucleus in one cell wild type embryos. This tendency of the association of the lipid containing structures with nuclear periphery can be seen also during later developmental stages in wild type embryos (D). (E, F) and (H) Enlarged lipid containing structures arranged around the nuclei in mutant embryos. (F) The formation of clusters of lipid containing structures on the periphery of nuclei. (G) Shows a wild type embryo at later stage of the development. (H) The lipid containing structures progressively diminish in size in mutant embryos during later stages of embryonic development (arrowhead). (I) and (J) Lipid containing structures in enterocytes of wild type (I) and mutant (J) animals. In contrast to embryos, which exhibit higher CARS signal and bigger lipid containing structures in mutant animals, gut cells in adult animals show the opposite, that is, a reduced fat-related CARS signal and smaller lipid containing structures in mutant animals. Similarly, lipid containing structures in epidermal cells (K and L) are bigger in wild type animals as shown in the (K) and smaller in mutant animals (L). Bars represent 50 Âµm.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Lipolysis is a tightly regulated cellular process in which triacylglycerol fatty acids (TAG) are degraded into free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol (G) with intermediates of diacylglycerol (DAG) and monoacylglycerol (MAG). The function and regulation of three key lipases (adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and monoglyceride lipase (MGL) have been studied in great detail in mammalian adipocytes (reviewed in <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Lass et al., 2011</xref>). Multidomain and multifunctional LD coating proteins, the perilipins, mediate the access of ATGL and HSL to LDs. Briefly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">Fig. 7</xref>), the phosphorylated N-terminal domain PAT in perilipin interacts with HSL and brings it in contact with lipid droplets (LDs) (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2009</xref>). At the same time, the C-terminal phosphorylation (controlled by the kinase PKA) releases a specific activator of ATGL named ABHD5 without which ATGL remains inactive in the cytoplasm. The final step of the glycolysis is catalyzed by MGL. Conversely, unphosphorylated perilipin blocks lipolysis in the basal fed state by blocking the access of lipolytic enzymes to the fat stored in LDs. Both HSL and ATGL are the rate-limiting enzymes needed for fatty acids mobilization (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Schweiger et al., 2006</xref>). A variation of this regulatory process, although less well understood in detail, exists in other cells and organisms. Most organisms so far studied contain several perilipin genes, complicating the analysis of complete perilipin loss-of-function.</p>

          <p>Mammalian proteins are indicated above the arrows and their <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologues (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>) below. Triacylglycerol (TAG) is progressively hydrolysed to diacylglycerol (DAG), monoacylglycerol (MAG) and glycerol (G) by lipases specific for each of these steps: adipose triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and finally monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL). LID-1 and C37H5.3 were proposed to be orthologues of ABHD5/CGI58 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Xie &amp; Roy, 2015</xref>). HSL also shows some activity in the first and third step. The access of ATGL and HSL to lipid droplets is regulated by perilipin, which is under the control of protein kinase A (PKA). W01A8.1 is proposed to be a perilipin orthologue in the present work.</p>

      <p>Clear orthologues of ATGL, HSL, MGL, ABHD5 and catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA have been identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (ATGL-1, HOSL-1, LID-1, KIN-1, KIN-2 respectively (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Xie &amp; Roy, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">Fig. 7</xref>). The MGL orthologue remains to be identified but several un-annotated homologous proteins exist (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Birsoy, Festuccia &amp; Laplante, 2013</xref>). A recent careful and elegant study of ATGL function and regulation (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>) revealed that the process in <italic>C. elegans</italic> was almost identical to that found in mammalian adipocytes. Even the degradation of ABHD5 in the proteasome (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2013</xref>) is mirrored in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). The glaring difference in fat storage and metabolism seemed to be the absence of perilipin in nematode genomes.</p>
      <p>Here we have established that <italic>C. elegans</italic> possesses a close homologue of perilipin that is intimately involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Although the sequence alignment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human homologues of perilipin does not appear visually very informative, the underlying evolutionary conserved homology is statistically very significant. Perilipin is a scaffolding protein allowing co-evolution of interacting domains and divergence of non-docking sequences, thus the function can be conserved even with limited amino acid conservation across species. This evolutionary plasticity was already apparent in the alignment of the human perilipin paralogues where only the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure enabled observations of the similarities in the C-terminal domains (<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Hickenbottom et al., 2004</xref>). The nematode sequences have diverged beyond the point where pairwise comparisons used in routine searches can reveal homology, hence the difficulty in identifying the nematode orthologues. Only rigorous statistical analysis of the hidden Markov profiles of a great number of diverse sequences made it possible to identify the conserved domain composition.</p>
      <p>The nematode perilipin-related protein W01A8.1 contains all three major perilipin features: N-terminal PAT domain, amphipathic region composed of imperfect helical repeats and C-terminal apolipoprotein-like four-helix bundle. In mammals, the first two domains are known to be responsible for the interaction with HSL and LDs respectively and the ATGL interaction region resides in the C-terminus following the bundle. The function of the bundle is still unclear but its stability probably fine-tunes the solubility and the affinity to LDs (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Brasaemle, 2007</xref>). All these functions will have to be investigated in the isoforms of W01A8.1 in the future. The repeats are confirmed by analysis of internal homology using the HHrepID algorithm and the helical composition by secondary structure prediction. The bundle appears not to be stabilized by <italic>Î²</italic>-sheets as in human Perilipin 3 as revealed by the absence of the homology in the C-terminal region; the <italic>Î²</italic>-sheets are similarly absent in Perilipin 1.</p>
      <p>Our findings are consistent with a proteomic study that found that W01A8.1b is among the most abundant proteins associated with LDs (<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, perilipins are abundant proteins on mammalian LDs, although the distribution and proportion of the individual isoforms changes depending on the cell type and metabolic state (<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Brasaemle et al., 2004</xref>). Perilipins are widely used as general markers of LDs and it seems that W01A8.1a or b can be exploited for the same purposes; human PLIN1 was recently proposed as a marker for LDs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, in laboratory conditions <italic>C. elegans</italic> can overcome the complete loss of the perilipin-related protein W01A8.1, presumably by activating perilipin-independent lipid degradation. Previous work has shown that an additional lipid degradation pathway, autophagy, was important for lipid metabolism in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>), mammals (<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2009</xref>) as well as in yeast (<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Van Zutphen et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which has two perilipins (<italic>plin1</italic> and <italic>plin2</italic>), the double mutants are viable but have small lipid droplets. This suggests that perilipins are required for growth or maintenance of lipid droplets, but are dispensable for lipolysis (<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Beller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Bi et al., 2012</xref>). The abnormal LD behavior, but viability, of <italic>W01A8.1</italic> null animals strongly suggests a regulatory role for the nematode perilipin-related protein in the regulation of fat metabolism that is similar to perilipins in other phyla. Taking in account the opposing phenotypes of <italic>Drosophila plin1</italic> and <italic>plin2</italic> loss of function regarding to lipid droplet size, it is intriguing to speculate that individual W01A8.1 splice forms may support distinct functions as well. It is also possible that some functions of W01A8.1 protein forms may be related to a proposed ancestral protein acting differently than mammalian perilipins as was suggested by <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Beller et al. (2010)</xref>. A possibility of the existence of an ancestor protein with wider, less specific functionality may be also considered if such a parallel to enzymatic activities of ancestral proteins (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hujova et al., 2005</xref>) is taken in account.</p>
      <p>CARS microscopy allowed a detailed analysis of lipid containing structures in wild type and in mutant animals <italic>in vivo</italic>. Detection of lipids <italic>in vivo</italic> showed that the lack of the perilipin homologue affects the intracellular distribution of lipid droplets, which is in agreement with the role of perilipin homologue LSD2 (PLIN2) in movement of lipid droplets in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Welte et al., 2005</xref>). Analysis of lipid-containing structures in developing embryos and in adult tissues suggested that W01A8.1 protein forms are likely to act differently in embryos than in adult tissues and lipid-containing structures in embryos are likely to differ from those of adult tissues. The characteristic aggregation of lipid-containing structures around the embryonic nuclei clearly detected in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos by CARS microscopy are reminiscent of lipid droplets recently reported to be a characteristic feature of cancer stem cells in colorectal carcinomas (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Tirinato et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our results suggest that the previously accepted view of a perilipin-independent nematode fatty acid flux of LDs needs to be revisited. Clearly we see evidence for perilipin-like LD regulation that is evolutionarily conserved. Based on the results reported here, <italic>W01A8.1</italic> is renamed with permission from WormBase as <italic>plin-1</italic> (<italic>Cel-plin-1</italic> with species identifier). With only a single gene and a toolbox of forward and reverse genetic approaches at hand, <italic>C. elegans</italic> offers an opportunity to explore the exact role of perlipin-related factors in fat regulation throughout development of many different somatic and germline cells. Exploitation of these opportunities will likely reveal new levels of regulation and novel players in the complex and vital regulation of fat in all organisms.</p>

          <p>Three different protein isoforms are expressed from the <italic>W01A8.1</italic> gene. The gene and the expressed proteins are denominated as W01A8.1 a, b and c (as accessed in Wormbase WS 246 on March 14, 2015).

The transgene based on the first construct (covering the upper two isoforms a and c) may lead to the expression of both isoforms a or c fused to GFP dependent on the cellular context and is likely to lead also to overexpression of untagged isoform b from the extra-chromosomal array. The genomic map was designed using SnapGene software (from GSL Biotech; available at snapgene.com).</p>

          <p>The graph shows knockdown effect of <italic>W01A8.1</italic> gene on the amount of progeny compared to controls. Wild type animals were treated with RNAi (dsRNA feeding) directed against <italic>W01A8.1</italic> for two generations and the amount of progeny was determined during a 24-hour period per one parent animal (21 parent animals were scored in both categories). The data presented here shows (<italic>y</italic>-axis) the average number of progeny per parent, <italic>n</italic> = 1,278 and <italic>n</italic> = 1,813, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.
