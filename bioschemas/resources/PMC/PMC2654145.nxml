      <abstract>
        <p>The Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway plays essential roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, and deregulated Î²-catenin protein levels lead to many types of human cancers. On activation by Wnt, the Wnt co-receptor LDL receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) is phosphorylated at multiple conserved intracellular PPPSPXS motifs by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and casein kinase 1 (CK1), resulting in recruitment of the scaffolding protein Axin to LRP6. As a result, Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 is inhibited and Î²-catenin protein is stabilized. However, how LRP6 phosphorylation and the ensuing LRP6-Axin interaction lead to the inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 is not fully understood. In this study, we reconstituted Axin-dependent Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 and CK1 in vitro using recombinant proteins, and found that the phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptides directly inhibit Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 in a sequence and phosphorylation-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs is direct and specific for GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 but not for CK1 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin at Ser45, and is independent of Axin function. We also show that a phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide is able to activate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and to induce axis duplication in Xenopus embryos, presumably by inhibition of GSK3 in vivo. Based on these observations, we propose a working model that Axin recruitment to the phosphorylated LRP6 places GSK3 in the vicinity of multiple phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs, which directly inhibit GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin. This model provides a possible mechanism to account, in part, for inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation by Wnt-activated LRP6.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Wnt/Î²-catenin signal transduction pathway plays central roles in many aspects of cell proliferation and differentiation, such as segment polarity determination in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, dorsal-ventral axis formation in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and homeostasis of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract <xref rid="pone.0004926-Logan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004926-vanEs1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The onco-protein Î²-catenin is a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Its protein level inside the cell is tightly regulated by phosphorylation-dependent and ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and deregulated Î²-catenin protein level leads to many types of human cancers, such as colorectal carcinoma and melanoma <xref rid="pone.0004926-Polakis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In the absence of secreted Wnt ligands, cytosolic Î²-catenin is phosphorylated at Ser45 by the priming kinase casein kinase 1 (CK1). Consequently, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), in complex with Axin and <italic>adenomatous polyposis coli</italic> (APC), phosphorylates Î²-catenin at Thr41, Ser37, and Ser33 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004926-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Ser33 and Ser37 doubly-phosphorylated Î²-catenin is specifically recognized by Î²-TrCP <xref rid="pone.0004926-Winston1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004926-Wu3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, a subunit of the SCF<sup>Î²-TrCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The SCF<sup>Î²-TrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase poly-ubiquitinates Î²-catenin, leading to Î²-catenin degradation via the proteosome pathway <xref rid="pone.0004926-Aberle1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Orford1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In the presence of Wnt ligands, the activation of the Wnt pathway results in inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33 and Ser37 (and Thr41) by GSK3, thereby preventing Î²-catenin ubiquitination and degradation. Stabilized Î²-catenin translocates into the nucleus and complexes with members of the T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) family of transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0004926-Behrens2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004926-Molenaar1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, leading to the activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin responsive genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 <xref rid="pone.0004926-He1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tetsu1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Therefore, inhibition of amino-terminal phosphorylation of Î²-catenin by GSK3 is a central step in Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling.</p>
      <p>Wnt activates the Î²-catenin pathway via two distinct classes of receptors on the cell surface: one is a member of the Frizzled family of seven-transmembrane receptors, and the other is a single transmembrane receptor referred to as LDL receptor related protein 6 (LRP6), or its relative LRP5. Wnt may induce a Frizzled-LRP6 coreceptor complex <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004926-He2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, which in turn triggers the phosphorylation of LRP6 intracellular domain at five conserved PPP(S/T)PX(S/T) motifs (referred to as PPPSPXS for simplicity) <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif provides an optimal binding site for Axin <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, thereby recruiting Axin and likely associated proteins to the Frizzled-LRP6 receptor complex <xref rid="pone.0004926-He2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and leading to the inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation. Importantly the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif represents a key and minimal functional module of the Wnt receptor complex, since it is sufficient to trigger Î²-catenin signaling when transferred to a heterologous receptor <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. PPPSPXS phosphorylation is carried out sequentially by GSK3 and CK1 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and is under the control by Frizzled and its downstream partner Dishevelled protein <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Bilic1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>How PPPSPXS phosphorylation and its recruitment of Axin result in inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation remains a critical question. To address this issue we established an in vitro Î²-catenin phosphorylation system using recombinant Axin, GSK3 and CK1. We found that each of the multiple phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptides inhibits the phosphorylation of Î²-catenin at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 in a sequence and phosphorylation-dependent manner. This inhibition is specific for GSK3, as these phospho-peptides do not affect Î²-catenin Ser45 phosphorylation by CK1, and occurs regardless of the presence or absence of Axin. We also found that a phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide is able to activate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and to induce axis duplication in Xenopus embryos, presumably via inhibition of GSK3 in vivo. These results suggest a potential mechanism to account, in part, for the inhibition GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin by the activated LRP6. While this manuscript was in previous review processes, Cselenyi <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the LRP6 intracellular domain directly inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin in a PPPSPXS-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0004926-Cselenyi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Our results based on studying individual phospho-PPPSPXS peptides are consistent with their main conclusion. However, while Cselenyi <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that LRP6 specifically inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin but not of other substrates <xref rid="pone.0004926-Cselenyi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, our data suggest that the phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide behaves as a general GSK3 inhibitor.</p>

        <p>To study how Î²-catenin phosphorylation is regulated by upstream components of the Wnt pathway, we reconstituted an in vitro kinase assay for Î²-catenin amino-terminal phosphorylation using purified proteins. We overexpressed recombinant Î²-catenin, Axin, CK1Î², and GSK3Î² proteins in either <italic>E. coli</italic> or baculovirus-infected insect cells, and purified these proteins to over 90% homogeneity by affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We incubated purified Î²-catenin with Axin, CK1, and GSK3 protein in the presence of ATP and MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 37Â°C for 3 hours. Î²-catenin phopshorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for Ser45-phosphorylation (by CK1) or an antibody specific for Ser33/Ser37/Thr41-phosphorylation (by GSK3).</p>

For Axin-dependent Î²-catenin phosphorylation in this and other figures, 0.43 ÂµM of GSK3, 0.54 ÂµM of CK1Î±, 0.21 ÂµM of Axin, and 0.73 ÂµM of Î²-catenin were used in each assay. The phosphorylation reaction products were analyzed by western blotting using an anti-phospho-Ser45 Î²-catenin antibody and an anti-phospho-Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 Î²-catenin antibody.</p>

        <p>When CK1 was present in the kinase reaction, Î²-catenin was strongly phosphorylated at Ser45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). When CK1, Axin and GSK3 were all present in the kinase reaction, Î²-catenin was potently phosphorylated at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g001">Figure 1C, lane 4</xref>). Phosphorylation of Î²-catenin at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 fully depended on GSK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g001">Figure 1C, lane 2</xref>), and also required the presence of Axin and the priming phosphorylation by CK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g001">Figure 1C, lanes 3 and 5</xref>). These results are consistent with an earlier report <xref rid="pone.0004926-Dajani1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, and importantly, recapitulate the in vivo requirement of Î²-catenin phosphorylation. Therefore we have reconstituted an in vitro kinase assay for Axin-dependent Î²-catenin amino-terminal phosphorylation by CK1 and GSK3 using purified proteins.</p>

        <title>Design of phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif peptides</title>

In order to investigate whether these PPPSPXS motifs might regulate Î²-catenin amino-terminal phosphorylation in our in vitro assay, we employed 4 phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptides corresponding to A, C, D, and E motifs of LRP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), referred to as Phos-A, Phos-C, Phos-D, and Phos-E, respectively, in which the two Ser/Thr residues in the PPPSPXS motifs were phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Although motif B behaves similarly to the other PPPSPXS motifs when tested in isolation in mammalian cells, motif B appears to be the least critical one in the wild type LRP6 <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We therefore did not synthesize and test motif B. As controls, we also synthesized an HA peptide, a dually phosphorylated 14-3-3 binding peptide (14-3-3BP), and a mutant motif A peptide (A-mut), which harbors alanine replacement of the two phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and which has been shown to be completely inactive in Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in vivo <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p>

The A-mut peptide failed to inhibit Î²-catenin phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g003">Figure 3A, right panel</xref>). As additional controls, neither the HA peptide nor the unrelated and dually phosphorylated peptide, 14-3-3BP, affected Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>). Furthermore, when the amount of peptides used in the phosphorylation assay was titrated, Phos-A, Phos-C and Phos-E peptides inhibited Î²-catenin phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g003">Figure 3B, 3D, 3E</xref>), whereas Phos-D was significantly less active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g003">Figure 3D, 3E</xref>).

        <title>The phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif inhibits Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 but not by CK1 via an Axin-independent manner</title>
        <p>Since Axin is a scaffolding protein critical for GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin and binds to the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, we considered the possibility whether inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation by the phosphorylated PPPSPXP motif involves the binding between Axin and the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif. To this end we first employed an Axin mutant, AxinÎDIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>), which lacks the so-called DIX domain required for Axin-binding to LRP5/6 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and therefore does not associate with phosphorylated LRP6 or the PPPSPXP motif (H. H and X. H., unpublished results). Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 in vitro was promoted by AxinÎDIX as effectively as the wild type Axin; but unexpectedly, this reaction was inhibited by Phos-A in a similar dose-dependent manner in the presence of either the wild type Axin or AxinÎDIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This result implies that Phos-A inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 may not involve its binding to Axin. To address this issue further, we tested another Axin fragment, Axin(351-701) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>), which contains only the Î²-catenin- and GSK3-binding domains of Axin and promote Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Dajani1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Indeed Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 was promoted by Axin(351-701) similarly to that by the wild type Axin, and importantly, was inhibited by Phos-A in a dose-dependent manner regardless of the presence of Axin or Axin(351-701) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). These results suggest that phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide inhibited Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 via a manner that is independent of PPPSPXS-binding to Axin, perhaps by inhibiting GSK3 directly.</p>

        <p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g001">Figure 1</xref>, Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 in vitro was greatly enhanced by the presence of Axin <xref rid="pone.0004926-Ikeda1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Dajani1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

Taking advantage of this property, we found that Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 in the absence of Axin was also inhibited by the Phos-A peptide in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). As in the presence of Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), the A-mut peptide had little or no effect on Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 in the absence of Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). These results suggest that phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif directly inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin.</p>
        <p>CK1 phosphorylates Î²-catenin at Ser45, which is the priming site for Î²-catenin Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 phosphorylation by GSK3 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In addition, CK1 also phosphorylates LRP6 at the second Ser residue in the PPPSPX<underline>S</underline> motif <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Therefore we tested whether the dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide had any effect on Î²-catenin Ser45 phosphorylation by CK1. Although the Phos-A peptide inhibited Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3, it had no effect on Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser45 by CK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). The A-mut peptide had little or no effect on Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 or at Ser45 by CK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). These results together suggest that the dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif can inhibit Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 independent of Axin, but it does not affect Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser45 by CK1.</p>

        <p>Since the dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide directly inhibited Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 independent of Axin, we tested whether this inhibition was specific for Î²-catenin or was broad for other GSK3 substrates, such as glycogen synthase (GS) and the Tau protein <xref rid="pone.0004926-Doble1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

When CK2 and GSK3 were both present, mGS-CTD was strongly phosphorylated at Ser641 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g005">Figure 5B, lanes 1 and 6</xref>).

In addition, when Phos-A peptide was titrated in the phosphorylation assay performed side-by-side for Tau and Î²-catenin (without Axin but with CK1 priming phosphorylation), indistinguishable dose-dependent inhibition of GSK3 by Phos-A was reproducibly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g005">Figure 5F and 5G</xref>).

        <p>As the dually phosphorylated Phos-A peptide inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin in vitro, we examined whether Phos-A could inhibit GSK3 and activate Î²-catenin signaling in vivo. It has been well established that inhibition of GSK3, such as via a dominant-negative GSK3 mutant, activates Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and induces axis duplication in Xenopus embryos <xref rid="pone.0004926-He3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Dominguez1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Pierce1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.

Although the activity of the injected Phos-A peptide was significantly weaker compared to that of injected Xwnt8 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g006">Figure 6</xref>), this was not unexpected since the phospho-peptide was likely subjected to dilution, proteolysis and/or dephosphorylation by proteases and/or phosphatases in the embryo in the absence of de novo synthesis. Importantly the A-mut peptide had no axis- or Xnr3-inducing activity in Xenopus embryos. These experiments demonstrate that the dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide is able to activate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in embryos, presumably via inhibition of GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin in vivo.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although it is known that the activated Wnt/Frizzled/LRP6 receptor complex results in inhibition of Î²-catenin degradation, the underlying molecular mechanism has remained unclear. One critical initiating event is Wnt-induced LRP6 phosphorylation at multiple PPPSPXS motifs <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The phosphorylation of the PPPSPXS motif is sequentially carried out by GSK3 and CK1 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and is under the control of the Frizzled receptor and its downstream partner Dishevelled protein <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Bilic1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif in turn provides a docking site for Axin <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, thereby recruiting Axin and likely associated proteins to the Frizzled-LRP6 receptor complex <xref rid="pone.0004926-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. But how these events lead to inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation by the Axin-GSK3 complex has been poorly understood.</p>
      <p>We attempted to address this question via a Î²-catenin phosphorylation assay reconstituted in vitro using recombinant Î²-catenin, GSK3, CK1, and Axin. This in vitro system recapitulated key features of Î²-catenin phosphorylation in vivo, such that GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 is greatly enhanced by the presence of Axin and by priming phosphoryaltion of Î²-catenin at Ser45 by CK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Given that a single PPPSPXS motif upon phosphorylation is sufficient to activate Î²-catenin signaling in both mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, we tested whether phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs from LRP6 had any effect on Î²-catenin phosphorylation in this in vitro assay. We found that each of four dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptides we examined, motifs A, C, D and E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g002">Figure 2</xref>), exhibits inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We speculate that motif B may exhibit the same property, although we have not synthesized and tested a motif B peptide in our assay. Several aspects of this inhibition appear to correlate well with the properties of Wnt/LRP6 regulation of Î²-catenin phosphorylation in vivo: (i) a corresponding mutant peptide, PPPAPXA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g002">Figure 2</xref>), has little, if any, inhibitory effect on Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 under the identical experimental condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This correlates well with the fact that the dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif upon transferred to a heterologous receptor is sufficient to activate Î²-catenin signaling in vivo, whereas the PPPAPXA mutant is completely inactive <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In addition, other control peptides including HA and 14-3-3BP (a dually phosphorylated peptide) do not have any inhibitory activity in the Î²-catenin phosphorylation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g003">Figure 3</xref>); (ii) the ability of dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptides to inhibit Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 correlates well with their differential ability to activate Î²-catenin signaling tested in vivo <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus the Phos-D peptide, which has an atypical <underline>C</underline>PPSPXS motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g002">Figure 2</xref>), has the weakest ability to inhibit Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and also the least ability to activate Î²-catenin signaling in vivo when it is transferred to a heterologous receptor <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Further, this result is also in line with that from scanning mutagenesis of the PPPSPXS motif, which has demonstrated a critical role of the first proline in the <underline>P</underline>PPSPXS motif such that its replacement by alanine or cysteine drastically diminished the signaling activity of the motif in vivo <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>; (iii) the dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif inhibits Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 but not Ser45 phosphorylation by CK1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This correlates with the fact that Wnt signaling primarily inhibits Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 but not Ser45 phosphorylation by CK1 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Doble2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>; (iv) finally we found that injection of a phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide, but not the mutant PPPAPXA peptide, into Xenopus embryos is able to induce axis duplication and the expression of Xnr3, a Wnt/Î²-catenin target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g006">Figure 6</xref>), consistent with the notion that phosphorylated PPPSPXS inhibits GSK3 in vivo. These results together suggest that our in vitro observations with the PPPSPXS peptides likely reflect, at least in part, the function of these motifs in activated LRP6 in vivo.</p>
      <p>Although Axin is required for Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and Axin interacts with phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, we were surprised to find that inhibition of GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin by the phoshorylated PPPSPXS peptide is independent of Axin function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Two different Axin mutants, AxinÎDIX and Axin(351-701), are each fully capable of promoting Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3, and this phosphorylation is inhibited by the phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide to the extent similar to that in the presence of the wild type Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Neither of these Axin mutants is expected to bind to the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif because the DIX domain, which is deleted in both Axin mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4</xref>), is required for such binding <xref rid="pone.0004926-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[36; H. H. and X. H., unpublished results]</xref>. This point was best illustrated by Axin(351-701), which harbors only the GSK3- and Î²-catenin-binding domains of Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These results led us to suspect that GSK3 is directly inhibited by the dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide. Indeed, when a higher concentration of GSK3 is applied in vitro together with CK1 for priming phosphorylation, Î²-catenin is phosphorylated at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 (albeit less effectively) in the absence of Axin as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0004926-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and this Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 is inhibited by the phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g004">Figure 4</xref>), indicating a direct inhibition of GSK3 without the involvement of Axin.</p>
      <p>Cselenyi <italic>et al</italic> recently reported that the recombinant LRP6 intracellular domain directly inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin in Xenopus egg extracts and in a reconstituted in vitro kinase assay similar to the one employed in this study <xref rid="pone.0004926-Cselenyi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. They found that the inhibition of GSK3 by the LRP6 intracellular domain is direct and Axin-independent, and requires the intact PPPSPXS motifs <xref rid="pone.0004926-Cselenyi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. While Cselenyi <italic>et al</italic> tested the LRP6 intracellular domain at a single concentration, our experiments examined each individual phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif, which represents the minimal signaling module as our previous studies have suggested <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and we demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of GSK3 by these phospho-PPPSPXS peptides at multiple concentrations. Overall our results are in good agreement with the main conclusions by Cselenyi <italic>et al</italic>. However, one noticeable difference exists between the results by Cselenyi <italic>et al</italic> and ours regarding the inherent (or the lack of) specificity of phospho-LRP6 inhibition of GSK3 phosphorylation. Cselenyi <italic>et al</italic> reported that the LRP6 intracellular domain specifically inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin, but not of Tau <xref rid="pone.0004926-Cselenyi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. By contrast, we found that the phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide also inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation of Tau and glycogen synthase (GS, with priming phosphorylation by CK2), and indeed GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin and Tau appears to be similarly inhibited by different concentrations of the phospho-PPPSPXS peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Our results suggest a general inhibition of GSK3 activity by the phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide, and are consistent with an earlier study demonstrating that the LRP6 intracellular domain can inhibit GSK3 phosphorylation of both Î²-catenin and Tau <xref rid="pone.0004926-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. We note that our findings are fully compatible with specific inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation by Wnt signaling (see below).</p>
      <p>One potential mechanism for the observed inhibition of GSK3 by the phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide is substrate competition, given that the PPPSPXS motif is a substrate for GSK3 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, and may compete with Î²-catenin for GSK3. However this mechanism does not easily explain why the phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide has no inhibitory effect on Î²-catenin phosphorylation at Ser45 by CK1, considering the fact that PPPSPXS is also a substrate for CK1 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Another potential mechanism, which is not mutually exclusive with the substrate competition model, is that the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif may directly bind to GSK3 (but not CK1) and inhibit GSK3 kinase activity. Indeed GSK3 has been identified as an LRP6-binding protein <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and vice versa <xref rid="pone.0004926-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> from yeast two-hybrid screens and can be co-precipitated with LRP6 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, and GSK3 associated with LRP6 exhibits reduced kinase activity <xref rid="pone.0004926-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. We note that each LRP6 molecule has five phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs and that LRP6 upon Wnt activation may multimerize <xref rid="pone.0004926-Bilic1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Therefore a high local concentration of phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs likely exists and their proximity to GSK3 via LRP6-Axin association may provide significant binding and inhibition to GSK3 in vivo even if the interaction between each phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif and GSK3 may not be particularly strong. We also note that the molar concentration of phospho-PPPSPXS peptides used in our GSK3 inhibition assays in vitro were at 0.4-, 1.5-, 6-, and 24-fold of that of GSK3, and that interestingly the phospho-peptides at 6-fold concentration relative to that of GSK3 exhibits significant inhibition towards GSK3, correlating remarkably with the five PPPSPXS motifs in each LRP6 protein. Therefore it seems that the relative concentrations of phospho-PPPSPXS peptides and GSK3 in our in vitro assays may be within a range conceivable in vivo.</p>
      <p>In summary, we propose a working model to link LRP6 activation and the inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation. When activated by Wnt, PPPSPXS motifs in LRP6 intracellular domain are phosphorylated by GSK3 and CK1, and they act together to recruit Axin-GSK3 into the Wnt receptor complex. When Axin is bound to one of the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs, other phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs in the vicinity of the Axin-GSK3 complex directly inhibit GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Several considerations suggest the feasibility of this model. First, although each phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif can bind to Axin <xref rid="pone.0004926-Tamai2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, it is unlikely that these five PPPSPXS motifs clustered within a 120-residue region of LRP6 intracellular domain bind simultaneously to five molecules of Axin, which has 863 amino acids. Rather, these five PPPSPXS motifs together may provide a high local concentration of docking sites for a single Axin molecule, thereby ensuring a tight association between LRP6 and Axin. In this scenario multiple phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs in each LRP6 are available for direct inhibition of GSK3. This model implies that the five PPPSPXS motifs when fully phosphorylated may have two major functions, i.e., to ensure the binding of Axin to LRP6 and to carry out inhibition of GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin. This notion is consistent with the finding by others and us that the coorperativity of the five PPPSPXS motifs are critical for LRP6 signaling function <xref rid="pone.0004926-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004926-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Secondly, this model explains LRP6 signaling specificity in the inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation, since GSK3 phosphorylation of other substrates such as GS and Tau occurs outside the Axin complex and is not in the proximity to LRP6 upon Wnt stimulation, and therefore will not be affected by the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif under the physiological condition. Thirdly, direct inhibition of GSK3 by phospho-PPPSPXS motifs within LRP6 is consistent with a recent observation that upon Wnt stimulation dephosphorylated Î²-catenin is observed at the plasma membrane together with the activated LRP6 <xref rid="pone.0004926-Hendriksen1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p>

          <p>While one of the five phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs of LRP6 physically interacts with Axin, other phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs may directly inhibit GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin in the Axin complex.

      <p>We note that our above model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004926-g007">Figure 7</xref>) does not exclude the possibility that there also exist other mechanisms by which activated Wnt-Frizzled-LRP6 signaling leads to the inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3. For example, dissociation of GSK3 from the Axin complex upon Wnt signaling has been suggested to be one such mechanism <xref rid="pone.0004926-Liu3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. These parallel mechanisms may operate together to ensure prevention of GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin upon Wnt stimulation. This may be analogous to parallel mechanisms that promote GSK3 phosphorylation of Î²-catenin in the absence of Wnt stimulation, such as by GSK3 and CK1 phosphorylation of Axin and APC <xref rid="pone.0004926-Kimelman1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While this manuscript was being revised for publication Piao et al reported that a dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide (essentially identical to Phos-A in our study) inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation of both Î²-catenin and Axin in vitro, and a LRP6 intracellular fragment containing a single PPPSPXS motif inhibits GS phosphorylation when overexpressed in the cytoplasm <xref rid="pone.0004926-Piao1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Consistent with our findings, Piao et al propose that phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif is a general inhibitor of GSK3 activity.</p>
