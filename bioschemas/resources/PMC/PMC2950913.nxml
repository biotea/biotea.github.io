      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Homologous recombination mediated by the RAD51 recombinase helps eliminate chromosomal lesions, such as DNA double-stranded breaks induced by radiation or arising from injured DNA replication forks. The tumor suppressors BRCA2 and PALB2 act together to deliver RAD51 to chromosomal lesions to initiate repair. Here we document a new function of PALB2 in the enhancement of RAD51's ability to form the D-loop. We show that PALB2 binds DNA and physically interacts with RAD51. Importantly, while PALB2 alone stimulates D-loop formation, a co-operative effect is seen with RAD51AP1, an enhancer of RAD51. This stimulation stems from PALB2's ability to function with RAD51 and RAD51AP1 to assemble the synaptic complex. Our results help unveil a multi-faceted role of PALB2 in chromosome damage repair. Since PALB2 mutations can cause breast and other tumors or lead to Fanconi anemia, our findings are important for understanding the mechanism of tumor suppression in humans.</p>

    <p id="P2">BRCA2 protein plays a key role in mediating homologous recombination (HR) and the repair of damaged chromosomes via HR<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> in humans. BRCA2 fulfills these biological roles by regulating the function of the RAD51 recombinase protein<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Recently, a novel protein called PALB2 (<underline>Pa</underline>rtner and <underline>L</underline>ocalizer of <underline>B</underline>RCA<underline>2</underline>) was found to associate with BRCA2. Importantly, BRCA2 and PALB2 mutations lead to destabilization of the genome<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and engender cancer risk. While monoallelic mutations predispose affected individuals to breast, pancreatic and other cancers<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, biallellic mutations cause Fanconi anemia subtypes -N and -D1 respectively<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. PALB2 is thought to stabilize BRCA2 by promoting its chromatin association. Recent studies have also demonstrated an architectural function of PALB2 in linking BRCA2 with the BRCA1 tumor suppressor<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P3">To better understand the biological functions of PALB2, we have purified full length PALB2 and several PALB2 fragments and subjected them to a series of biochemical analysis. We demonstrate that PALB2 binds DNA and associates with the RAD51 recombinase in a species-specific fashion. Importantly, PALB2 exerts a stimulatory effect on the ability of RAD51 to make D-loops. Moreover, PALB2 physically interacts with RAD51AP1, a key accessory factor of RAD51<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, and functionally co-operates with RAD51AP1 in the enhancement of RAD51's recombinase attribute. These results help define the multi-faceted role that PALB2 protein fulfills in HR and chromosome damage repair.</p>

        <title>Purification of PALB2 and protein fragments</title>
        <p id="P4">To obtain highly purified PALB2 and protein fragments for functional analyses, full-length GST-tagged PALB2 and PALB2 fragments were expressed in insect cells with the use of recombinant bacculoviruses or in the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</italic>. All the PALB2 species were found to be soluble, and multi-step procedures were devised for purifying them to near homogeneity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Demonstration of PALB2's DNA binding function</title>
        <p id="P5">Since PALB2 mediates the chromatin association of BRCA2 in cells<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, we were interested in testing whether it has DNA binding activity. A DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled ssDNA, dsDNA, or D-loop as substrate (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) was therefore used to test various purified PALB2 species. Full length PALB2 bound all three species of DNA with the following preference: D-loop &gt; dsDNA &gt; ssDNA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Importantly, while the PALB2 amino-terminal fragment encompassing residues 1-579 also bound DNA with the same preference and a similar affinity as the full length protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), the PALB2 fragment that harbors residues 611-764 or the C-terminal region (residue 850-1186) did not shift any of the DNA substrates tested (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref> and data not shown).</p>
        <p id="P6">In order to establish the DNA binding specificity of PALB2 more definitively, we conducted a series of competition experiments wherein a preformed nucleoprotein complex of either full length PALB2 or PALB2 1-579 with radiolabeled dsDNA was challenged with increasing amounts of unlabeled ssDNA, dsDNA, or D-loop. The results revealed that, with either PALB2 species, the D-loop was the most effective competitor, followed by dsDNA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). By contrast, ssDNA was less able to reduce the level of the preformed radiolabeled nucleoprotein complex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">Taken together, the results from the experiments documented herein have helped establish that (1) PALB2 is a DNA binding protein, (2) the N-terminal half of PALB2 harbors a DNA binding domain, and (3) both full length PALB2 and the isolated N-terminal DNA binding domain bind the D-loop avidly. PALB2 clearly also binds dsDNA, and we note that results reported by Jean Yves Masson's group (Buisson et al; personal communication) suggest that PALB2 has high affinity for certain sequences or secondary structures in ssDNA as well.</p>

        <title>Association of purified PALB2 with RAD51</title>
        <p id="P8">Since PALB2 affects RAD51-mediated chromosome damage repair in cells<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, we employed an affinity pulldown assay to query whether PALB2 directly interacts with RAD51. For this, purified PALB2 and RAD51 were incubated together, followed by the capture of the assembled protein complex via the GST tag on PALB2 using glutathione Sepharose beads, elution of proteins by SDS treatment, and SDS-PAGE analysis. The results clearly showed an association of RAD51 with PALB2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, (i)</xref>). As expected, RAD51 did not associate with purified GST (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, (i)</xref>). Importantly, no interaction of PALB2 with the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rad51 (<italic>Sc</italic>Rad51) was observed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, (ii)</xref>), indicating that the PALB2-RAD51 complex is species-specific. By testing purified GST-tagged fragments of PALB2 that encompass different portions of the protein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, (ii)</xref>), we were able to map the RAD51 interaction domain to residues 101-184 of PALB2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, (iii)</xref>). Again, no interaction of the PALB2 1-184 fragment with <italic>Sc</italic>Rad51 was seen (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, (iii)</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="S5">
        <title>Enhancement of RAD51 activity by PALB2 and RAD51AP1</title>
        <p id="P9">We noted that the DNA binding properties of PALB2 are reminiscent of RAD51AP1<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, which interacts with and enhances the ability of RAD51 to make D-loops<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Given this, and the fact that PALB2 associates with RAD51, we wanted to test whether PALB2, alone or in combination with RAD51AP1, would enhance the recombinase function of RAD51. A well-established D-loop assay (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, (i)</xref>) was used for this purpose. The addition of PALB2 alone to the D-loop reaction increased the level of product several fold, from a barely detectable amount in PALB2's absence to â¼5-8% of D-loop with PALB2 being present (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, (ii) and (iii)</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). The increase in D-loop formation stemmed from a stimulation of the RAD51 recombinase activity by PALB2, as PALB2 alone was not capable of D-loop formation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, (ii) and (iii)</xref>). As expected<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, the efficiency of the D-loop reaction could be enhanced by RAD51AP1 alone (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, (ii) and (iii)</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). We then conducted an extensive series of experiments in which we tested a wide range of reactant concentrations to ask whether PALB2 and RAD51AP1 would synergize in the promotion of D-loop formation. Importantly, at PALB2 and RAD51AP1 concentrations that are suboptimal on their own, a clear synergy was seen (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, (ii) and (iii)</xref>). ATP was always required for D-loop formation, regardless of whether PALB2, RAD51AP1, or the combination of these two recombinase co-factors was used (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, (ii) and (iii)</xref>, and data not shown). We note that the stimulatory effect of PALB2 and RAD51AP1 on RAD51 is specific, as we did not find any enhancement of the D-loop reaction catalyzed by <italic>Sc</italic>Rad51 by PALB2 or RAD51AP1 alone or the two factors in combination (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="S6">
        <title>Interactions of PALB2 with RAD51AP1</title>
        <p id="P10">Based on the observed synergy between PALB2 and RAD51AP1 in the D-loop reaction (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), we wished to determine whether these two HR factors physically interact. With the aid of affinity pulldown using either the GST-tag on PALB2 and glutathione resin, or the MBP-tag on RAD51AP1 and amylose resin, we were able to show a direct interaction of PALB2 with RAD51AP1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). The PALB2-RAD51AP1 complex is destabilized by KCl concentrations above 100 mM (data not shown). To further map this interaction, we used an N-terminally truncated variant of RAD51AP1, NÎ120 that lacks the first 120 residues of the protein. With the aid of MBP-pulldown by amylose resin, we observed that MBP-tagged RAD51AP1 NÎ120 is deficient in PALB2 interaction (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a, (i)</xref>). We note that, since the RAD51 interaction domain resides within the extreme C-terminus of RAD51AP1<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, the RAD51AP1 NÎ120 variant retains the ability to interact with RAD51 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a, (ii)</xref>). Importantly, while RAD51AP1 NÎ120 could enhance the RAD51-mediated D-loop reaction, it failed to synergize with PALB2 in this regard (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Thus, it appears that the interaction between PALB2 and RAD51AP1 is required for their functional synergy in the enhancement of the D-loop reaction.</p>
        <p id="P11">To investigate the functional relationship between PALB2 and RAD51AP1 in vivo, we analyzed protein foci formation in HeLa and U2OS cells after DNA damaging treatment. Whereas mock-treated cells showed dispersed nuclear staining of RAD51AP1 and PALB2 but no significant co-localization (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b and i,j</xref>), exposure to ionizing radiation induced distinct PALB2 and RAD51AP1 foci in both HeLa (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5e,f</xref>) and U2OS cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5m,n</xref>) that frequently co-localized (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5g,o</xref>, for HeLa and U2OS cells respectively). Similar results were obtained in U2OS cells with mitomycin C (MMC) treatment (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that even though PALB2 deficient fibroblasts express RAD51AP1 protein (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), they are unable to assemble RAD51AP1 foci upon treatment with MMC (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). As expected, complementation of these cells with PALB2 restored the ability to form RAD51AP1 foci in response to MMC (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), and siRNA treatment against RAD51AP1 could diminish these foci (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4b,c</xref>). These results indicate that PALB2, either directly or through an intermediary, such as RAD51, plays a key role in the recruitment of RAD51AP1 to DNA damage.</p>
        <p id="P12">In co-immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-PALB2 and anti-RAD51AP1 antibodies, only a negligible amount of PALB2 and RAD51AP1 could be co-precipitated from cell extracts before and after treatment of cells with camptothecin (data not shown). Considering that the PALB2-RAD51 complex is salt-sensitive, the failure to co-immunoprecipitate these proteins could stem from the relatively high concentration of salt (120 mM) and extensive washing steps designed to reduce non-specific protein binding to the anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG resin. Alternatively, or in addition, the antibodies used might have a destabilizing effect on any PALB2-RAD51AP1 complex present in the extracts.</p>

        <title>Enhancement of synaptic complex assembly by PALB2-RAD51AP1</title>
        <p id="P13">In the RAD51-mediated D-loop reaction, the presynaptic filament captures the duplex DNA partner, followed by a DNA homology search process that leads to the formation of a nucleoprotein intermediate, the synaptic complex, in which the DNA molecules are homologously aligned and base switching has occurred<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P14">We employed two separate assay systems to verify whether PALB2 and RAD51AP1 promote the formation of the synaptic complex with the RAD51 presynaptic filament. First, the duplex capture step (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, (i)</xref>) was examined by mixing the RAD51 presynaptic filaments assembled on ssDNA linked to magnetic beads with a radiolabeled duplex in the presence of PALB2, RAD51AP1, or both of these recombinase cofactors. As had been reported before, the RAD51 presynaptic filament alone exhibited only a weak ability to engage dsDNA<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. PALB2 alone enhanced the ability of the presynaptic filament to capture duplex DNA (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, (ii)</xref>). RAD51AP1 also worked with the RAD51 presynaptic filament in duplex capture (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, (ii)</xref>). Then, we tested PALB2 and RAD51AP1 together to see if they would act synergistically in the duplex capture reaction. Numerous reactant concentrations were examined in this endeavor. As in the D-loop reaction, at certain PALB2 and RAD51AP1 concentrations, these two factors clearly synergized in duplex capture in a manner that required the RAD51 presynaptic filament and ATP (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, (ii)</xref>). As expected, no dsDNA capture occurred when magnetic beads without ssDNA were first incubated with RAD51, PALB2, and RAD51AP1 and then with the radiolabeled dsDNA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Importantly, the combination of PALB2, RAD51AP1, and the RAD51 presynaptic filament failed to capture ssDNA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P15">We next used protection of linear dsDNA against digestion by the restriction enzyme SspI (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b, (i)</xref>) to directly examine synaptic complex formation<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. The results from testing numerous reactant concentrations again provided clear evidence for an enhancement of RAD51-dependent synaptic complex formation by PALB2 and RAD51AP1 individually, and for a co-operative action of these recombinase co-factors (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b, (ii)</xref>). Again, the reaction mediated by PALB2 and RAD51AP1 in conjunction with the RAD51 presynaptic filament showed a strict dependence on ATP (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b, (ii)</xref>).</p>

      <p id="P16">In cells, ssDNA arising from the nucleolytic processing of DSBs and other chromosomal lesions is first bound by RPA. The utilization of the RPA-bound ssDNA as substrate for HR necessitates RPA's replacement by RAD51, which is promoted by the BRCA2 protein<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. This attribute of the BRCA2 protein qualifies it as a recombination mediator<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Recent work<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> has shown that the proper localization of BRCA2 and the targeting of BRCA2 to damaged chromosomes are dependent on PALB2. Thus, in PALB2-deficient cells, as in BRCA2-deficient cells<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, the assembly of DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci is impaired<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Based on these properties of PALB2, it has been generally assumed that its primary function is to help promote the delivery of RAD51 to DNA lesions via BRCA2<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Here, our biochemical studies and those reported by Buisson et al (personal communication) have revealed a direct interaction of PALB2 with RAD51 and the RAD51 presynaptic filament. Importantly, our results have shown that PALB2 binds D-loop and also dsDNA, and the results of Buisson et al (personal communication) suggest that PALB2 also has high affinity for certain sequences or secondary structures in ssDNA. These DNA binding properties distinguish PALB2 from the isolated DNA binding domain of the human or mouse BRCA2 protein described until now, which appear to have little affinity for dsDNA<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. We have carried out biochemical analyses to test the hypothesis that PALB2 functions with RAD51 after presynaptic filament assembly. The results have provided evidence for an ability of PALB2 to synergize with the RAD51AP1 protein in the promotion of D-loop formation by RAD51 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>). In addition to facilitating the assembly of the synaptic complex, given the affinity of PALB2 (personal communication from Buisson et al and this work) and RAD51AP1<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> for the D-loop structure, they could also stabilize the nascent D-loop made by RAD51. We note that since RAD51AP1 plays little or no role in the assembly of DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci in cells<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, its function in HR is probably limited to the DNA strand invasion stage of the HR reaction.</p>
      <p id="P17">Like BRCA2, PALB2 is indispensable for genome maintenance and cancer suppression in humans<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.
