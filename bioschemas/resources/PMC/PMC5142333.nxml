          <p>Here, we report the first structural characterisation of LITAF using biochemical, cell biological, biophysical and NMR spectroscopic approaches. Our structural model demonstrates that LITAF is a monotopic zinc-binding membrane protein that embeds into intracellular membranes via a predicted hydrophobic, in-plane, helical anchor located within the LITAF domain. We show that specific residues within the LITAF domain interact with phosphoethanolamine (PE) head groups, and that the introduction of the V144M CMT1C-associated pathogenic mutation leads to protein aggregation in the presence of PE.</p>

          <p>In addition to the structural characterisation of LITAF, these data lead us to propose that an aberrant LITAF-PE interaction on the surface of intracellular membranes contributes to the molecular pathogenesis that underlies this currently incurable disease.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>The Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases (CMT) are among the most common inherited neurological disorders, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2500 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. CMT is associated with progressive degeneration of peripheral nerves, leading to muscle wasting and weakness, sensory deficits and limb deformities causing significant morbidity across populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Peripheral nerves are composed of two main functional anatomical structures: axons and Schwann cells. Axons convey electrical signals to and from the central nervous system and peripheries, while Schwann cells are neural crest-derived cells that engulf peripheral axons providing structural and trophic support. Furthermore, Schwann cells can also be stimulated to wrap multiple layers of plasma membrane around larger axons to form the insulating myelin sheath, a process known as myelination. Consistent with this anatomical and functional dichotomy, CMT can additionally be classified into âaxonalâ and âdemyelinatingâ forms, reflecting the main sites of cellular dysfunction as the axon or Schwann cell, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>With the advent of next-generation DNA sequencing, mutations in more than 80 genes have now been shown to be associated with CMT, highlighting key genes essential for peripheral nerve function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Of the genes associated with demyelinating CMT, where Schwann cell dysfunction is thought to be the primary underlying pathology, the encoded proteins can be classified into three main groups: structural proteins of the myelin sheath, transcription factors that activate the myelination programme and, interestingly, proteins that are known or predicted to function in intracellular membrane traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While Schwann cell-specific expression of CMT-associated proteins explains particular subtypes of demyelinating CMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], most CMT-associated genes with known or predicted roles in membrane traffic are widely expressed across diverse tissues and species. Therefore, understanding why mutations in these widely expressed genes lead to isolated demyelinating peripheral neuropathies requires further study at the molecular level.</p>
      <p>CMT type 1C (CMT1C) is an autosomal dominant demyelinating peripheral neuropathy associated with mutations in <italic>LITAF</italic> (Lipopolysaccharide-induced tumour necrosis factor-Î± factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. <italic>LITAF</italic>, which is also known as <italic>SIMPLE</italic>, encodes a 17Â kDa protein that targets endocytic structures and contains an N-terminal proline-rich region predicted to modulate protein-protein interactions, and a C-terminal region predicted to encode a âLITAF domainâ (sometimes also referred to as a âSIMPLE-like domainâ) consisting of conserved cysteine residues separated by a 22 residue hydrophobic region (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. LITAF domains are conserved in eukaryotes. Initial reports had proposed that LITAF functions as a transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; however, a consensus has now emerged that LITAF targets to intracellular membranes and is therefore likely to play a role in endocytic membrane trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, LITAF has been shown to interact with proteins involved in receptor trafficking and degradation in tissue cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Despite the evolutionary conservation and widespread tissue expression, no structural data currently exist concerning the LITAF domain. On the contrary, conflicting models regarding the topology and fold of this domain have been proposed, without supporting experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The domain organisation of LITAF. Schematic diagram to illustrate the domain organisation of the LITAF protein. The N-terminus is characterised by a proline-rich region which is followed by a LITAF domain at the C-terminus. The LITAF domain consists of two pairs of cysteine residues (indicated with <italic>arrows</italic> and coloured <italic>red</italic>) either side of a hydrophobic region. The amino acid sequences of selected LITAF domains taken from a variety of eukaryotes are shown to highlight the high degree of conservation of critical amino acid residues across species. Residues are numbered according to the human LITAF sequence and coloured according to the Clustalx scheme as implemented in the Jalview program to highlight conserved amino acid properties. Shading indicates the degree of conservation. The position of known CMT1C-associated pathogenic mutations are shown below the alignment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12915_2016_332_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>Here, we present the membrane topology, metal binding and structural features of the human LITAF protein. The biophysical and cell biological effects of the recruitment of interacting proteins to LITAF are then reported, demonstrating the importance of short peptide sequence motifs in the N-terminal proline-rich region for LITAFâs intracellular localisation. Finally, we show that distinct residues contained within the LITAF domain interact with phosphoethanolamine (PE) head groups and that the alteration of these interactions leads to protein aggregation in the presence of a pathogenic CMT1C mutation, providing molecular insights into the underlying pathogenesis of a subtype of this currently incurable, common, inherited disease.</p>

        <title>LITAF domains are evolutionarily conserved</title>
        <p>LITAF domains are found throughout the eukaryotes, suggesting ancient conserved functions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1), with multiple instances of expansion, especially in the metazoa. Of relevance to the current study, one particular duplication appears to have occurred in the common ancestor of the jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), leading to the eventual existence of two LITAF domain-containing genes in humans: the so-far uncharacterised <italic>CDIP1</italic> gene, and the CMT1C-associated gene, <italic>LITAF</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). Intriguingly, and despite the large lineage-specific expansions seen in the LITAF domain gene family as described, the canonical domain architecture â that is, a proline-rich domain at the N-terminus followed by a C-terminal LITAF domain â is conserved across eukaryotes (with the exception of the apicomplexans), highlighting the likely requirement for both regions to be present for correct intracellular protein function (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4a).</p>
        <p>With the aim of identifying key conserved features that are likely to be of critical functional importance, we gathered a cohort of broadly representative LITAF domain sequences from which a comprehensive sequence alignment was derived. This alignment revealed that two pairs of cysteines, located either side of a predicted hydrophobic helix with amphipathic properties, are strictly conserved (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4b, c). These cysteine pairs, in the absence of the intervening helix, are reminiscent of metal-ion coordinating residues found in zinc-finger-like structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Six additional cysteine residues are present in the predicted hydrophobic helical region of the human LITAF domain, but are less well conserved across our alignment. As their sequence positions are not consistent with the typical known cysteine-containing metal coordinating motifs (e.g. CxxC/HxxC), it appears unlikely that these additional cysteine residues are involved in coordinating a metal ion.</p>
        <p>Given that the luminal, transmembrane and cytosolic domains of proteins are conserved to a different extent in evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the absolute conservation of these residues in tandem led us to hypothesise that the N- and C-termini of the LITAF domain are very unlikely to be separated by a phospholipid bilayer-traversing transmembrane domain as has been previously postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, most CMT1C-associated pathogenic mutations fall at conserved residues in this pan-eukaryotic alignment of LITAF domains, again highlighting key residues likely to play critical roles in maintaining the function of this ancient domain.</p>
        <p>With these points in mind, we set out to re-examine the role of the LITAF domain in targeting the protein to membranes and to experimentally characterise the topology of the human LITAF protein.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>LITAF targets to membranes via the hydrophobic helical region</title>
        <p>The targeting of LITAF to membranes has previously been shown to be via the C-terminal LITAF domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Consistent with previous reports, we found that LITAF predominantly targeted endocytic vesicles, colocalising with marker proteins of both early and late endosomes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S5). This endosomal targeting and association with membrane can be prevented by either deleting the predicted hydrophobic helical region within the LITAF domain (HA-LITAF Î114â139) or by mutating eight hydrophobic residues contained therein (HA-LITAF N-helix) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2aâc</xref>). These eight hydrophobic residues mutated in the N-helix construct are found on one side of the predicted helix according to our helical wheel analysis, consistent with an amphipathic character (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4c, d). By mutating only eight hydrophobic residues to arginine in generating the N-helix construct, the predicted helical nature of this region is preserved, leading us to hypothesise that, while the protein is rendered more soluble, the overall folding and architecture of the expressed molecule is maintained and remains similar to wild type. Endogenously expressed LITAF also possesses the biochemical properties of an integral membrane protein, as shown by the differential extraction of the protein with the detergent TX114 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that LITAF is targeted and anchored to membranes via pivotal hydrophobic residues found within the predicted central hydrophobic helical region of the C-terminal LITAF domain.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>LITAF is anchored to membranes via hydrophobic residues contained within the LITAF domain. <bold>a</bold> Amino acid sequences of the hydrophobic regions present in the protein constructs used to determine membrane insertion. Residues are numbered according to the full length human LITAF sequence. Hydrophobic residues are coloured red, while acidic residues are coloured blue. Residues retained in all three constructs are indicated by asterisks below the sequence. The grey box denotes the serineâglycine linker added in place of the predicted helix in the Î114â139 construct. <bold>b</bold> The HA-tagged LITAF constructs were transiently expressed in HeLa cells and the localisation determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. The endosomal targeting of endogenously expressed VPS26 is shown in the left panels for comparison. The middle panels show that the endosomal membrane targeting of LITAF is dependent on key hydrophobic residues within the hydrophobic region. Scale bar denotes 20Â Î¼m. <bold>c</bold> Membrane fractionation from HeLa cells expressing endogenous LITAF and transiently expressed HA-tagged LITAF constructs. While both endogenous and HA-tagged wild type LITAF is found in the membrane pellets (P), the LITAF constructs harbouring hydrophilic mutations (N-helix) and a deletion in the vicinity of the hydrophobic region (Î114â139) are found in the soluble fraction (S). Calnexin and tubulin were used as integral membrane and soluble protein controls, respectively. <bold>d</bold> Wild type LITAF displays the characteristics of an integral membrane protein as determined by the extraction of the endogenous protein from HeLa cells using TX114. The integral membrane protein, Calnexin, and VPS26, which associates with, but does not insert into membranes, were used as controls</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12915_2016_332_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

        <p>By analysing the sequences of LITAF domains from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Ponting et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] first postulated that the predicted hydrophobic helical region probably inserted into, but did not traverse, membranes. However, Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] later assumed that this hydrophobic region within the LITAF domain was a transmembrane helix, thereby concluding that LITAF must be C-terminally inserted into membranes. Importantly, neither hypothesis was supported by experimental data. We therefore used two complementary experimental approaches to determine the membrane topology of LITAF.</p>
        <p>Firstly, we used a cellular semi-permeabilisation assay to determine whether the N- and C-termini of LITAF were located on the cytosolic or luminal membrane surfaces of endosomes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To do this, we generated HeLa cells stably expressing LITAF epitope-tagged with HA on the N-terminus and myc on the C-terminus (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Following selective permeabilisation of plasma membranes with 20Â Î¼M digitonin, both N-terminal HA and C-terminal myc epitope tags were detected by indirect immunofluorescence, concurrently with the cytosolic surface endosomal marker protein VPS26. In contrast, the LAMP1 epitope, found on the luminal side of endosomes and lysosomes, was not detected, confirming the maintained integrity of endocytic compartment membranes under these conditions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>). On the contrary, higher concentrations of digitonin (100Â Î¼M) permeabilised both plasma membranes and intracellular organelles/vesicles, exposing epitopes found on both the cytosolic and luminal surfaces of endosomes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the hydrophobic region of the LITAF domain does not traverse membranes, meaning that both the N- and C-termini face the cytosol.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Membrane topology determination of LITAF. <bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram illustrating the LITAF protein tagged with HA at the N-terminus and myc at the C-terminus used in the experiments to determine the membrane topology. <bold>b</bold> Selective permeabilisation of the plasma membranes of HeLa cells stably expressing HA-LITAF-myc was achieved using 20Â Î¼M digitonin. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed following incubation of the digitonin-permeabilised cells with antibodies towards HA and myc in addition to the control proteins, VPS26 and LAMP1, located on the cytosolic and luminal sides of endosomal membranes, respectively. The representative images show that both the N-terminal HA and C-terminal myc epitopes were detected concurrently with VPS26, indicating that both termini of LITAF are located on the cytosolic surface of membranes. In contrast, LAMP1 was not detected under these conditions. Permeabilsation of both plasma membrane and endosomal membranes was achieved at higher concentrations of digitonin as seen in the lower panel. <bold>c</bold> Representative graphs of a selective permeabilisation experiment illustrating the proportion of cells staining positive for HA (<italic>top panel</italic>) and myc (<italic>bottom panel</italic>) compared to VSP26 and LAMP1 (co-labelling and counting 400 cells) at increasing concentrations of digitonin. Note that all cells staining positive for HA were also positive for myc and that even at 100Â Î¼M digitonin, not all cells stained positive for LAMP1, indicating incomplete permeabilisation of endocytic vesicle membranes under these conditions. <bold>d</bold> HA-LITAF-myc was expressed using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate expression system in the presence of microsomal membranes to allow membrane insertion. A protease protection assay was then performed using proteinase K to determine the topology of the LITAF protein. In the presence of proteinase K, both N-terminal HA and C-terminal myc tags were digested, indicating that these epitopes are present on the surface of microsomal membranes (<italic>bottom panel</italic>). Î²-lactamase, containing a signal peptide that allows the translocation of a processed form to the interior of microsomal membranes, and hence protection from proteinase K digestion, was used as a control (<italic>top panel</italic>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12915_2016_332_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>
</p>
        <p>Secondly, to verify our findings from the cellular semi-permeabilisation assay, we used a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free system to express HA-LITAF-myc in the presence of microsomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Once incorporated into microsomal membranes, the susceptibility of both the N- and C-terminal HA and myc epitope tags to protease digestion was ascertained. Using the protection of the processed form of Î²-lactamase within the microsomal lumen as control, we observed that both the HA and myc tags of LITAF were degraded following incubation with proteinase K (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). These data are therefore consistent with the semi-permeabilisation assay, and are strongly supportive of the hypothesis that both the N- and C- termini of LITAF are found on the cytosolic surface of membranes, and that the LITAF domain is embedded into membranes via the predicted hydrophobic helical region adopting an in-plane membrane anchor configuration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

        <title>The LITAF domain coordinates zinc</title>
        <p>With the two well-conserved cysteine-containing âknucklesâ either side of the hydrophobic helical anchor (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4), reminiscent of intracellular zinc-binding motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we next asked whether LITAF is indeed a zinc-interacting protein. To address this question unequivocally, we performed microPIXE (proton-induced X-ray emission) analysis to determine the metal binding characteristics of LITAF protein constructs expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. These experiments showed that wild type LITAF, LITAF N-helix and LITAF Î114â139 contained 1.05âÂ±â0.21 [1.41, 1.05, 0.998], 1.55âÂ±â0.12 [1.42, 1.71, 1.51] and 0.90âÂ±â0.11 [0.86, 0.80, 1.05] zinc atoms/protein molecule (meanâÂ±âSD, nâ=â3, different points collected from the same sample of each protein), respectively (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Notably, LITAF constructs where one or more of the conserved cysteine residues had been replaced with alanine were all insoluble when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and also appeared as large puncta and could not be solubilised with TX100 when transiently expressed in HeLa cells, consistent with them being proteins prone to aggregation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S6). When not playing a direct functional or catalytic role, metal ions (most commonly zinc) often stabilise very small protein domains, enabling them to interact with other proteins or biomolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These data therefore strongly suggest that the correct folding of the LITAF domain is dependent on the coordination of a zinc atom.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>MicroPIXE analysis of LITAF Î114â139.

        <title>The LITAF domain consists of cysteine-containing Î²-hairpins either side of the predicted hydrophobic helical anchor</title>
        <p>We next set out to determine the structural characteristics of LITAF. The first NMR experiments of wild type LITAF in an extensive range of membrane-mimicking detergent environments highlighted the crucial importance of the correct choice of solubilising conditions. Under all conditions tested, we observed no signals that we would associate with a structured protein domain. Based on the assumption that these structured residues would be in close association with the membrane, and the high tendency of these samples to form oligomers and aggregate (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S7), we refocused on the LITAF Î114â139 construct, where the hydrophobic anchor had been removed, thereby rendering this construct soluble in the absence of detergents. <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N-labelled LITAF Î114â139 protein was straightforwardly expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> with an estimated molecular weight of 17Â kDa, as determined using a 1D proton transverse relaxation experiment, consistent with a monomeric species in solution.</p>
        <p>Initially, we performed standard NMR triple resonance backbone experiments to assign and analyse the individual amino acid residues within the LITAF Î114â139 protein. The BEST-TROSY experiments focus on the backbone NH bonds of the protein, with each cross peak displayed corresponding to a specific assigned amino acid (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). As mentioned above, the N-terminal region of LITAF contains multiple proline residues (which lack a backbone NH bond), and therefore the assignment of these amino acids also required the use of supplementary experiments (as outlined in Methods). Using these approaches, and despite missing assignments for the glycine-serine linker that replaces the hydrophobic region in the LITAF Î114â139 construct, an 89% assignment (including the assignment of 20 out of 23 proline residues) was achieved.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Assignment of the <sup>15</sup>N BEST-TROSY of the LITAF Î114â139 construct. Cross-peaks assigned to the structured LITAF domain have a wide proton distribution (~7.5 to 9.6Â ppm) consistent with the secondary structure of Î²-strands. In contrast, cross-peaks assigned to the unstructured N-terminal proline-rich arm occupy the narrower random coil central region of the spectrum (7.8 to 8.4Â ppm)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12915_2016_332_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig>
</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, the LITAF N-helix construct also remained soluble in the absence of detergent. However, similarly to wild type LITAF, the assignment experiments on this construct were also unsuccessful, likely due to the tendency for the N-helix construct to form higher molecular weight oligomers (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S7). Nevertheless, considerable overlap was evident between the N-helix and Î114â139 constructs in the BEST-TROSY experiments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S8), suggesting that both LITAF constructs contain very similar secondary structure elements, implying that further interpretation of the Î114â139 construct would enable key structural motifs of the wild type LITAF protein to be defined.</p>
        <p>Building on the near complete assignment of the protein, we proceeded to determine which secondary structural elements are present in the LITAF Î114â139 construct. This particular approach exploits the exquisite sensitivity of the backbone amino acid chemical shifts to their related secondary structure environment. By using the chemical shift analysis program, TALOS+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], we established that the LITAF domain of the Î114â139 construct is composed of 5 Î²-strands: 3Â N-terminally to the Î114â139 deletion site (where the predicted hydrophobic helix would usually reside) and two forming a Î²-hairpin at the C terminus (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S9a). Supporting these data, the residues assigned to the LITAF domain displayed greater <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift distributions (~7.4 to 9.6Â ppm), typical of Î²-sheet residues (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), compared to the residues assigned to the N-terminal proline-rich region, which, in contrast, displayed a narrower <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift pattern (between 7.8 and 8.4Â ppm), suggesting the adoption of a random coil character.</p>
        <p>The dynamic qualities of the LITAF Î114â139 construct were next analysed by performing heteronuclear NOE (hetNOE) experiments. These experiments measure the motion of each assigned residue on a picosecond time scale. Positive hetNOE values close to the value of 1.0 represent slow picosecond motion, which is typically seen when protein domains adopt rigid secondary structure motifs, while small, or even negative, hetNOE values result from fast picosecond motion as seen in unstructured loops and at the flexible termini of proteins. The hetNOE analysis of the Î114â139 construct, illustrated in (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S9b), demonstrated that four of the five Î²-strands within the LITAF domain are rigid in the picosecond time scale, while in comparison, the first, most N-terminal Î²-strand, showed increased motion, and hence flexibility. In contrast, the proline-rich N-terminus showed mainly fast picosecond motion reminiscent of an unstructured protein domain. Interestingly, these analyses also revealed an area of reduced flexibility between residues 22 and 34, a region known to recruit interacting proteins to the LITAF molecule (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>

        <title>NMR-based structural model</title>
        <p>In order to further characterise the structure of the LITAF domain, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectral data were collected. These experiments probe the proximity of amino acids through space, thereby providing indicative data concerning the tertiary structure of the protein. We used Rosetta, the protein structure prediction suite of programs, to produce a structural model of the LITAF domain as only a limited number of NOESY cross-peaks were collected. Although Rosetta can be used in its most basic form to predict a protein structure based only on its primary sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], more advanced Rosetta applications allow additional restraint information to be applied during the model calculations, making it possible to build a structural model that satisfies all our experimental data, including metal coordination, secondary structure boundaries, topology and NOE restraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. After fragment selection for the model calculation, completed using Rosetta-CS and the NMR-defined secondary structure boundaries, Rosetta metalloprotein relax protocols were implemented as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], where the four conserved cysteine residues fixed for zinc coordination were C96, C99, C148 and C151 (full length residue numbering).

        <p>The NMR-based model of the LITAF Î114â139 construct (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), generated from the experimentally determined restraints, illustrate the five Î²-strands of the LITAF domain: three in an antiparallel orientation at the N-terminus and a Î²-hairpin at the C-terminus. The conserved cysteine residues, which reside within loops located between Î²-strands 2 and 3, and between Î²-strands 4 and 5, are shown to coordinate a zinc atom. Although the five Î²-strands do not form a continuous sheet, they are in close proximity and are part of an overall compact domain. The glycine/serine linker, that has replaced the predicted hydrophobic in-plane membrane anchor in the LITAF Î114â139 construct, has been modelled as a short helix by Rosetta. The secondary structure elements are again maintained in the wild type model of the LITAF domain (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), with the predicted hydrophobic in-plane membrane anchor modelled as a single helix by Rosetta. As the coordination of the zinc atom has been maintained, this structure is not as compact as the LITAF Î114â139 construct, and results in the Î²-strands lying parallel to the predicted membrane-anchoring helix. The critical coordination of the zinc atom by two pairs of cysteine residues, as shown in both models, is consistent with the rubredoxin, or âzinc Î²-ribbonâ family of zinc finger structural motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Efforts to crystallize the LITAF constructs for further structural analysis were unsuccessful.</p>

        <title>Recruitment of proteins to the N-terminal proline-rich region directs LITAF to specific endosomal structures</title>
        <p>Specific protein domains are known to interact with particular sequence motifs present in the LITAF N-terminal proline-rich region (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4a). Thus, the PPXY motif can bind the WW domains of the ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], while the overlapping P(S/T)AP motif is predicted to interact with the UEV domain of the ESCRT-I component, TSG101 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Our hetNOE data suggest that the N-terminal region of LITAF is mostly flexible, in contrast to the relatively rigid C-terminal membrane-anchoring LITAF domain.

</p>
        <p>Based on the near complete (89%) assignment of the LITAF Î114â139 construct, we probed the local interaction of LITAF with the WW domains of NEDD4. A comparison of the BEST-TROSY spectra of the <sup>15</sup>N-labelled LITAF Î114â139 in the presence and absence of recombinantly-expressed NEDD4 596â944 (containing the four WW domains) revealed the loss of a subset of amide cross peaks (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>), most often caused by line broadening as a result of micromolar binding affinities. The missing signals correspond to residues 22â29 of the LITAF protein, which contain the PPSY motif known to interact with the WW domains of NEDD4, and are within a region of the N-terminal domain found to be less flexible in the hetNOE experiments. Of note, a second region between residues 57 and 72 of LITAF, which contains a second PPSY motif, showed peak broadening representing a potential additional NEDD4-WW domain interacting site. However, the functional significance of this second PPSY motif is uncertain, since it could not compensate for the loss of the first N-terminal PPSY motif in our pull-down experiments of endogenous NEDD4 from cellular lysates (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Significantly, we did not detect any consequent structural changes to the C-terminal LITAF domain upon binding of NEDD4 to the N-terminal proline-rich region, showing that these regions of LITAF are structurally independent.</p>
        <p>With no apparent structural effect on the C-terminal LITAF domain, we next asked whether the intracellular localisation of LITAF is influenced by the potential recruitment of proteins in vivo. HA-tagged LITAF constructs harbouring mutations that disrupt the PPSY motifs (Y23,61A) were expressed in retinal pigmented epithelial cells (where no endogenously expressed LITAF can be detected) and analysed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). We found that disruption of the PPSY motifs led to significantly greater colocalisation of LITAF with the plasma membrane marker, wheat germ agglutinin, compared to the wild type protein (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). These data lead us to speculate that, while LITAF domains function as membrane anchors, the specific intracellular localisation is potentially influenced by the recruitment of interacting proteins to the relatively flexible and cytosol-facing N-terminal poly-proline arm.</p>

We therefore asked whether particular residues contained within the LITAF domain are able to interact with phospholipid head groups in solution.

        <title>The V144M CMT1C-associated mutation leads to subtle changes in the LITAF Î114â139 construct and disrupts the interaction with PE</title>
        <p>All known CMT1C-associated pathogenic mutations in LITAF are found in the C-terminal LITAF domain. Most mutations reside within the predicted hydrophobic anchor region and are predicted to disrupt the helical propensity of this specific part of the protein (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Figure S12a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, as stated above, experimental study by NMR spectroscopy of constructs containing the predicted hydrophobic helical region were not possible. Nevertheless, the LITAF Î114â139 construct used to generate the structural model does contain valine at position 144, a residue that, when mutated to a methionine (V144M), is known to cause CMT1C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The V144M mutation does not affect membrane association and its punctate staining pattern by immunofluorescence microscopy is consistent with retained endosomal targeting (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Figure S12b, c). We therefore set out to characterise the effects of this pathogenic mutation by solution NMR spectroscopy. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Figure S11b shows the chemical shift perturbations that are manifested by the V144M mutation in the Î114â139 construct when compared to the wild type counterpart. If the amino acid substitution had little effect on the construct, we would expect that only signals corresponding to residues in close proximity to the site of mutation would be perturbed. However, dispersed chemical shift perturbations were seen as a result of this CMT1C mutation, including within the region of the N-terminal Î²-sheets on the opposite side of the deleted hydrophobic anchor. These data therefore suggest that the V144M pathogenic mutation causes subtle biochemical and biophysical changes whilst maintaining the overall secondary structure of the LITAF domain, pointing towards an additional factor that must lead to clinical disease.</p>
        <p>By analysing the residues that show the greatest chemical shift perturbations following the introduction of the V144M mutation, we noted that these residues correspond to those that interact with PE head groups (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a, b</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Figure S11b). We therefore asked whether the interaction of the LITAF domain with PE is altered by the introduction of the V144M mutation. Indeed, we found that LITAF Î114â139 V144M interacts with PE at lower head group concentrations (1:250 molar ratio) than the wild type construct whilst utilising the same specific residues (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Figure S13). However, while the V144M construct â similarly to the LITAF Î114â139 WT protein â remained soluble and un-degraded for periods of many months when stored in isolation, this mutant construct became rapidly insoluble when incubated with PE at 1:1000 molar ratio, leading to the disappearance of the assigned peaks from the NMR spectra and visible precipitation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Figure S13). In contrast, wild type LITAF Î114â139 remained consistently soluble and folded at these concentrations of PE. To determine the effect of the V144M mutation on the stability of LITAF in vivo, we performed cycloheximide chase experiments in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells stably expressing either wild type HA-LITAF or HA-LITAF V144M. In keeping with our in vitro findings, HA-LITAF harbouring the V144M mutation was degraded more rapidly compared to the wild type construct (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). These data therefore suggest that the V144M pathogenic mutation alters the interaction between the LITAF domain and PE head groups, pointing towards an acquired misfolded state on the surface of membranes, and potentially deleterious effects on intracellular membranes involved in endocytic traffic.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Despite the extensive architectural conservation of LITAF domains across eukaryotes, our report is the first to characterise this ancient domain structurally. In contrast to the assertion made by Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] that LITAF domains are C-terminally inserted into membranes, our data show that the hydrophobic region does not traverse membranes, demonstrating that both the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the LITAF domain reside on the cytosolic surface of membranes, in agreement with an earlier proposal made by Ponting et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] in 2002 and the recent publication by Qin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The LITAF domain consists of five Î²-sheets, three N-terminal and two C-terminal to the predicted hydrophobic anchor region, and is stabilised by the coordination of a zinc atom by two pairs of evolutionarily-conserved cysteine residues. In contrast, the N-terminal proline-rich region is mostly unstructured and behaves independently of the C-terminal LITAF domain. We show that, far from being an inert component of the full length protein, the ability of the proline-rich region to bind to other cytosolic proteins appears to have a significant influence on intracellular targeting. These data therefore support the notion that, while LITAF domains serve as intracellular membrane anchors, the precise function and localisation is determined by the proteins that interact with the proline-rich N-terminal arm. This last point might help explain the many contradictory data that currently exist concerning the specific intracellular localisation of LITAF-domain-containing proteins in a variety of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Consistent with a protein domain that resides in close proximity to membranes, we also show that specific residues within the LITAF domain interact with PE head groups. PE is the second most abundant phospholipid (behind PC) in mammalian cells, accounting for, on average, approximately 25% of cellular phospholipids. PE is found across all intracellular membranes and, as a consequence of its cone-shape, has been proposed to play an essential role in membrane fusion and curvature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. By accommodating and interacting with PE head groups, it is tempting to speculate that LITAF domains might therefore play further roles in the regulation of membrane invagination and tubulation, which are essential for the sorting and recycling of membranous cargoes on endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our data are consistent with LITAF being a monotopic membrane protein anchored to membranes via an in-plane helical membrane anchor, present within the LITAF domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, efforts to analyse the full length LITAF protein, or the predicted hydrophobic helical anchor region in isolation, either by solution NMR or crystallography, were unsuccessful, likely due to the inability of the tested detergent and lipid micelles to mimic the membrane environment found intracellularly. Furthermore, the molecular weight of LITAF remains too small for current cryo-EM techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This again highlights the general issue in structural biology that, despite the fact that membrane proteins make up approximately 30% of all eukaryotic cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and constitute around 60% of current drug targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], membrane proteins still account for less than 1% of structures in the Protein Data Bank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Moreover, none of these current membrane protein structures contained within the database demonstrate in-plane membrane anchoring domains as we propose for LITAF. In the absence of a predicted helix-loop-helix âhairpinâ motif that inserts into the lipid bilayer as postulated for other integral membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], we can therefore only speculate at present on how precisely the predicted hydrophobic helical anchor associates with membranes. However, our data regarding the loss of membrane association following the substitution of eight hydrophobic amino acids within the predicted helix, in conjunction with our structural data, lead us to speculate that this anchoring-region embeds into the cytosolic-facing monolayer of the membrane bilayer by adopting an amphipathic character [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p>
      <p>Schwann cells are predicted to be the principal site of pathology in the demyelinating subtypes of CMT. Due to the significant number of genes associated with demyelinating CMT that are predicted or known to encode proteins that function on endocytic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the critical importance of intracellular membrane trafficking in maintaining peripheral nerve myelination by Schwann cells has been brought to the fore. Most mutations in these demyelinating CMT genes associated with membrane trafficking cause disease in an autosomal recessive manner, pointing towards loss of cellular function as the underlying pathogenic mechanism in these instances. In contrast, CMT1C associated with mutations in <italic>LITAF</italic> is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Previous reports have confirmed that the expression of LITAF is not critical for peripheral nerve myelination in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], making the âdominant-negativeâ hypothesis, due to the possible formation of non-functional LITAF hetero-oligomers (containing wild type and mutant species), less likely. On the contrary, a more probable pathogenic mechanism involves a âtoxic gain-of-functionâ resulting from the altered molecular and cellular properties of mutant LITAF when expressed in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Significantly, the LITAF protein is known to be widely expressed across tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], suggesting that, while compensatory mechanisms must exist in most cell types, the intracellular membrane trafficking pathways in Schwann cells must be distinctly susceptible to the presence of a mutant copy of LITAF.</p>
      <p>But how do CMT1C point mutations cause toxicity? Thus far, all proven CMT1C-associated pathogenic mutations in LITAF are found in the C-terminal LITAF domain and previous reports have suggested that these mutations might disrupt the association of LITAF with membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], although the precise mechanism remained unclear. Here, we show that the CMT1C-associated pathogenic V144M mutation in LITAF leads to chemical shift perturbations across the LITAF domain that sits in close approximation to the surface of membranes, whilst maintaining an overall secondary structure similar to the wild type protein. However, when the V144M construct was incubated with PE head groups, the disease-associated protein became misfolded, leading to precipitation in vitro, in complete contrast to wild type LITAF. Furthermore, cycloheximide chase experiments in vivo suggested that the V144M construct was degraded more rapidly compared to wild type. It is therefore tempting to speculate that all CMT1C mutations might lead to similar structural alterations within the LITAF domain, resulting in an unstable and toxic interaction with lipid head groups and consequent endocytic membrane disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This aberrant association of LITAF with membranes might lead to the dysfunctional trafficking of Schwann cell membrane receptors, including growth factor receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and cell adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], with consequent disruption of the critical endocytic pathways that maintain the integrity of peripheral nerve myelin. Such mistrafficking would, in turn, lead to instability of the myelin sheath, demyelination, secondary axonal degeneration and, eventually, the motor and sensory deficits that characterise patients affected by a diagnosis of CMT1C.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In summary, we present the first structural protein model of LITAF based on experimental data, and describe the biophysical and biochemical consequences of a CMT1C-associated pathogenic mutation. We anticipate that this work will form a platform for the future study of LITAF, and LITAF-domains in general, and their role in intracellular membrane trafficking. In the absence of any current treatments for CMT, we believe that such investigation will not only lead to the identification of future therapeutic strategies for CMT1C, but will also highlight molecular and cellular dysfunctional pathways common to more than one subtype of this common, currently incurable, neurological disorder.</p>

        <p>The unambiguous identity of the metals in the recombinantly expressed LITAF proteins and their stoichiometry was determined using microPIXE (microbeam Proton Induced X-ray Emission), an established technique for such analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The recombinant proteins were prepared as described above before buffer exchange into 10Â mM Tris pHÂ 7.4, 200Â mM NaBr and 0.5Â mM TCEP using a Superdex 75 GL size exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). DDM (0.04%) was also used to maintain the solubility of wild type LITAF constructs for the purpose of these experiments. Resulting protein concentrations, estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280Â nm, were 1.7Â mg/mL, 4.7Â mg/mL and 1.7Â mg/mL for wild type LITAF, LITAF Î114â139 and LITAF N-helix, respectively. This pre-measurement buffer exchange was also necessary to remove any traces of sulfur and chlorine. For micro-PIXE measurements of proteins, sulfur acts as an internal standard, and because of the proximity of the X-ray emission energies of sulfur and chlorine to one another, strong chloride fluorescence can affect the accuracy with which the sulfur peak can be quantified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The measurements were carried out at the Ion Beam Centre, University of Surrey, UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. A 2.5-MeV proton beam of 3Â Î¼m in diameter was used to induce characteristic X-ray emission from dried liquid protein droplets (volume per dropletâ=â0.1Â Î¼L) under vacuum. The X-rays were detected in a solid state lithium drifted silicon detector with high energy resolution. By scanning the proton beam in <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> over the droplet, spatial maps were obtained of all elements heavier than magnesium present in the sample. Quantitative information was obtained by collecting 3- or 4-point spectra from each droplet. These spectra were analyzed with GUPIX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] within DAN32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] to extract the relative amount of each element of interest in the sample.</p>

        <title>NMR experiments and analysis</title>
        <p>
<sup>15</sup>N- and <sup>13</sup>C-labelled proteins were prepared in 20Â mM HEPES pHÂ 7.4, 100Â mM NaCl, 0.5Â mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at typical concentrations of between 60 and 250Â Î¼M. All experiments were collected at 298Â K on Bruker Avance III 600Â MHz and Avance 2+ 700Â MHz spectrometers equipped with cryogenic triple resonance TCI probes. Data were processed using the software packages Topspin 3.2 (Bruker) and both Multi-Dimensional Decomposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] and Compressed Sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] for data collected by Non Uniform Sampling. All NMR data were analyzed using SPARKY 3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco).</p>
        <p>1D proton transverse relaxation (T2) experiments were used to estimate the molecular weight of the LITAF domain. For a globular protein, its transverse relaxation is governed by its molecular weight by the following relationship: MWâÃâ0.5âââ1/5âÃâT2, where T2 is in seconds and MW is in kDa. Standard 1D proton transverse relaxation experiments were collected with different delays (1 and 2), with observed peak intensities reduced after an increased delay. T2 can therefore be estimated using the following equation: T2â=â2(Î<sub>1</sub>âÎ<sub>2</sub>)/ln(I<sub>1</sub>/I<sub>2</sub>), where I is the peak intensity and Î is the relaxation delay.</p>
        <p>Backbone chemical shift assignments were completed using HNCO, HNCACO, HNCA, HNCACB and CBCACONH. The assignment of proline residues was aided by <sup>13</sup>C observed CON experiments complimented with HCBCANCO, HCBCACON, HNCANNH and HNCOCANNH experiments. Side chain HA and HB were assigned using an HBHACONH experiment. Through space contacts were established by <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C HSQC NOESY experiments.</p>
        <p>Secondary structure predictions were made using N, HN, CA, CB and HA chemical shifts and TALOS+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
        <p>Assigned BEST-TROSY (band selective excitation short transients transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy) were used to make weighted chemical shift maps on mutation and head group or NEDD4 WW domain interactions using the equation ((Î<sup>1</sup>H)<sup>2</sup>â+â(Î<sup>15</sup>N/5)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>0.5</sup>, where the Î denotes the difference in parts per million of the chemical shift between the assigned apo peak and its nearest neighbour in the mixed sample spectra.</p>
        <p>In the head group experiments, PG, PC, PS, PE and IP<sub>6</sub> head groups were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich and incubated with LITAF (60Â Î¼M concentration) at molar ratios of 1:1000 (PG, PC, PE) and 1:500 (PS, IP<sub>6</sub>). The pH of each LITAF/head group mixture was checked and found to be the same as the sample used to generate the control spectra.</p>

        <title>LITAF structure modelling</title>
        <p>NMR assignment information was submitted to the CS Rosetta webserver for <italic>de novo</italic> structure calculations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], which did not return a convergence of structures, suggesting a low confidence in the prediction. Given the established metal coordination of the LITAF constructs and NMR restraints, a zinc-bound structure model methodology was then followed using CS-Rosetta fragment files with the abinitio.metalrelax protocol of the Rosetta package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The jump restraint file was edited so that the zinc atom coordinated cysteine residues C96, C99, C148 and C151 (full length residue numbers). Running the scripts for both the LITAF Î114â139 and wild type LITAF domains returned 5000 structural models for each construct (also referred to as decoys) of improved confidence. These decoys were clustered with a 5Â Ã cutoff using Calibur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and scored for similarity to the centre of each cluster using the score_jd2 script that is part of the Rosetta package. The structures shown in Figs.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> were representative of the lowest energy structures of the largest cluster in each calculation round.</p>

In contrast to the wild type LITAF, which targeted multiple punctate structures consistent with endosomes (HA-LITAF WT, left panel), the LITAF constructs in which the N-terminal or C-terminal conserved cysteine pairs were mutated to alanine (HA-LITAF N-term AxxA and HA-LITAF C-term AxxA) appeared in large puncta, consistent with them being proteins prone to aggregation. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Scale bars denote 10Â Î¼m. (c) Membrane fractionation from HeLa cells transiently expressing HA-LITAF constructs. A soluble fraction (Soluble) was obtained following high speed centrifugation. The resulting membrane pellet was further incubated with 1% TX100 in order to extract soluble membrane proteins (TX100) from insoluble material (Pellet). Calnexin and tubulin were used for control purposes as examples of integral membrane and soluble proteins, respectively. While HA-LITAF WT was found in the TX100 solubilised membrane fraction similarly to calnexin, HA-LITAF construct harbouring mutations in either the N-terminal or C-terminal conserved cysteine pairs within the LITAF domain were found predominantly in the TX100 insoluble pellet (P), consistent with protein aggregation. Note that longer exposure times were required for the cysteine mutant samples as the expression level of these mutated proteins was consistently lower compared to wild type.

The N-helix construct can be assumed to adopt a wild type (WT)-like fold as its sequence only differs in mutations that remove the amphipathic nature of the helix, whilst maintaining a helical secondary structure. The comparison of amide chemical shifts of LITAF N-helix with the truncated Î114â139 construct reveals very few changes in the chemical environment that the structured LITAF domain is exposed to, with just a small number of shifts seen in residues that are close to the predicted helix/truncation point (labelled residues). This strongly suggests that, while the truncated LITAF Î114â139 construct does not contain the predicted helix of the WT protein, the data gleaned from this construct is comparable to a pseudo-WT construct.
