      <abstract>
        <p>Apoptosis and necrosis, two major forms of cell death, can be distinguished morphologically and biochemically. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (INDF) is a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis, and caspase-activated DNase (CAD), also known as DNA fragmentation factor 40 kDa (DFF40), is one of the major effector endonucleases. DNase Î³, a Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent endonuclease, is also known to generate INDF but its role among other apoptosis-associated endonucleases in cell death is unclear. Here we show that (i) INDF occurs even during necrosis in cell lines, primary cells, and in tissues of mice <italic>in vivo</italic>, and (ii) DNase Î³, but not CAD, is the effector endonuclease for INDF in cells undergoing necrosis. These results document a previously unappreciated role for INDF in necrosis and define its molecular basis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Two cell death patterns, apoptosis and necrosis, can be distinguished from each other morphologically and biochemically <xref rid="pone.0080223-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080223-Proskuryakov1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Typically necrosis is evoked by non-physiological stimuli that cause damage to the plasma membrane, and is characterized morphologically by cell swelling and lysis, and biochemically by random digestion of DNA, resulting in a smear on analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis. The necrosis-associated DNA degradation process and its physiological significance, however, have not been fully elucidated. Apoptosis, by contrast, is intrinsically programmed to eliminate undesirable cells during development, and to maintain homeostasis of the immune system <xref rid="pone.0080223-Nagata1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080223-Widlak1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Apoptosis is characterized morphologically by the formation of membrane-associated apoptotic bodies, membrane blebbing, nuclear breakdown, and chromatin condensation, and biochemically by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (INDF), appearing as a ladder on agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA fragments expose 3â²-OH ends, which can be detected microscopically as fluorescent signals using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Thus, INDF, shown as DNA ladder and TUNEL, are widely accepted as the biochemical criterion of apoptosis.</p>
      <p>Several endonucleases have been shown to be involved in apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0080223-Widlak1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080223-Mizuta1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent endonuclease CAD (also known as DFF40) is located in the nucleus, normally in an inactive complex with the chaperone ICAD (also known as DFF45) <xref rid="pone.0080223-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080223-Sakahira1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Upon apoptosis-inducing stimuli, CAD is released from the complex by the caspase-3-mediated cleavage of ICAD and catalyzes INDF. In <italic>CAD</italic>-deficient mice, thymocytes do not undergo INDF <xref rid="pone.0080223-Nagata1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Endonuclease G (Endo G), another Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent endonuclease <xref rid="pone.0080223-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, was shown to migrate from mitochondria into the nucleus to cleave chromosomal DNA. However, no apoptosis-related phenotype has been observed in <italic>Endo G</italic>-deficient mice <xref rid="pone.0080223-Irvine1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. DNase Î³ (also termed DNASE1L3) is Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNase I-family endonuclease that is located in the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum of living cells and translocates into the nucleus of dying cells, where it induces INDF <xref rid="pone.0080223-Rodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0080223-Yakovlev1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. DNase Î³ endonuclease activity is enhanced in the presence of linker histone H1, implicating its direct role in INDF <xref rid="pone.0080223-Mizuta1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. DNase Î³ has been shown to be involved in apoptosis of a myoblastic cell line undergoing differentiation and of an immature B-cell line after signaling the antigen receptor <xref rid="pone.0080223-Shiokawa2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080223-Shiokawa3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, but its <italic>in vivo</italic> role remains unknown.</p>
      <p>In contrast to apoptotic endonucleases, little is known about the nucleases responsible for necrosis. Despite the general belief in the random nature of DNA degradation in necrosis, several studies have suggested that INDF can take place even in cells undergoing necrosis <xref rid="pone.0080223-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080223-Didenko1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0080223-Lecoeur1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Although caspase-independent DNase I and II are implicated in necrosis, their roles in INDF during necrosis are still unclear <xref rid="pone.0080223-Proskuryakov1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080223-Napirei1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In this study, we focused on DNase Î³ as a candidate endonuclease involved in INDF during necrosis.</p>

        <title>A selective role for DNase Î³ in necrosis-associated INDF</title>
        <p>To directly compare the role of DNase Î³ in necrosis and apoptosis, we first used the Ramos Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, which has no DNase Î³ activity, and its derivative Î³Ramos-25 stably expressing exogenous DNase Î³ <xref rid="pone.0080223-Okamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Cells were treated with staurosporine to induce apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0080223-Boulares1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, or by a freeze-thaw procedure or with saponin to induce necrosis <xref rid="pone.0080223-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Saponin treatment permeabilizes the plasma membrane as well as the membranes of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus but not the nuclear membrane <xref rid="pone.0080223-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g001">Figure 1</xref>, DNA ladders were detected in both Ramos and Î³Ramos-25 after the staurosporine treatment (lanes 3 and 4), but only in Î³Ramos-25 after treatment by freeze-thawing (lanes 5 and 6) or with saponin (lanes 7 and 8). The cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) from the 116-kDa to the 85-kDa form, a hallmark of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0080223-Boulares1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, was induced only by the staurosporine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, bottom). This result suggests a selective role for DNase Î³ in the generation of INDF in necrosis.</p>

        <title>DNase Î³ mediates INDF in TNF-Î± mediated necrosis</title>
        <p>Next we utilized the U937 human hystiocytic leukemia cell line, which is known to undergo apoptosis upon treatment with TNF-Î± in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), but necrosis in the additional presence of Z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor <xref rid="pone.0080223-Degterev1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Our stock of U937 cells did not express detectable <italic>DNase Î³</italic> mRNA, therefore we generated three U937 stable transformants: UI, expressing a caspase-resistant mutant of mouse ICAD (ICAD-CR) as a dominant inhibitor of CAD <xref rid="pone.0080223-Shiokawa4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>; UG, expressing DNase Î³; and UIG, expressing both ICAD-CR and DNase Î³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2A and 2B</xref>). After treatment with TNF-Î± and CHX (TNF-Î±/CHX), all four cell lines underwent apoptosis as evident from the appearance of apoptotic bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, center panels) and the diagnostic cleavage of PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, lanes 5, 7, 9, and 11). In the additional presence of Z-VAD-fmk (TNF-Î±/CHX/ZVAD), however, the cells showed no evidence of apoptosis phenotype, but instead underwent necrosis, as is evident from cell swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, right panels) and the absence of PARP cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, lanes 6, 8, 10, and 12). Under conditions leading to apoptosis (TNF-Î±/CHX), DNA ladders were detected in U937 and UG cells after 6 h of incubation, but were hardly detected in UI and UIG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, top), indicating the CAD-dependent generation of INDF. Weak ladder formation in UIG cells only after 24 h of incubation suggests that a contribution of DNase Î³ to INDF occurs only at the terminal stage of apoptosis (lanes 19 and 20). On the other hand, under conditions causing necrosis (TNF-Î±/CHX/ZVAD), DNA ladders were formed only in UG and UIG, beginning as early as 6 h of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, bottom). Thus, the generation of INDF during necrosis depends on DNase Î³, but not on CAD activity. This conclusion was further supported by the observation that chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> with EGTA inhibited DNA ladder formation in UIG cells undergoing necrosis, but not in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2F and 2G</xref>), since DNase Î³, but not CAD, requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> for its endonuclease activity. The terminal phase of apoptosis where DNase Î³âmediated DNA laddering appears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, top, lanes 19 and 20) may be regarded as secondary necrosis, since plasma membrane permeabilization should be inevitable at this stage <xref rid="pone.0080223-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>DNA ladders and TUNEL signals, the major hallmarks of INDF, are well known features of apoptosis. Although they have occasionally been detected in cells undergoing necrosis <xref rid="pone.0080223-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080223-Didenko1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0080223-Lecoeur1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, this outcome has not been widely appreciated and a DNA smear caused by random DNA degradation has rather been considered to be a common feature of necrotic DNA degradation. This is partly because the molecular mechanisms of necrosis have been poorly understood. Here, we showed that DNase Î³ is responsible for INDF during necrosis induced by TNF-Î±, plasma membrane disruption, or freeze-thawing of cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and in ischemic tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results thus establish that (i) INDF is a feature of DNA degradation during necrosis and (ii) it is carried out by DNase Î³. There may be several reasons why DNA ladders are not commonly observed in necrosis, including late timing of sampling and analysis and also the presence of a dominant population of intact cells in some conditions that induce necrosis. In this study, we used the Wizard DNA purification resin for DNA preparation. This procedure is helpful for detecting DNA ladder, because the resin selectively recovers and concentrates low-molecular weight DNA fragments. We also detected chromatin condensation under necrotic condition in a DNase Î³-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Chromatin condensation is also known as a hallmark of apoptosis but the molecular mechanism has not been clarified <xref rid="pone.0080223-Ton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, the mechanism and physiological significance of DNase Î³-dependent chromatin condensation should be examined in further study.</p>
      <p>DNase Î³ is normally found in the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum, but is localized in the nucleus of dying cells <xref rid="pone.0080223-Shiokawa5" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Based on our data, we propose the following possible scenarios for the role of DNase Î³ in necrosis: In cells undergoing necrosis, the disruption of the plasma and organelle membranes causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the nucleus, leading to activation of DNase Î³ diffused from the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum, and the DNase Î³ then executes INDF. Alternatively, DNase Î³ may be secreted, as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0080223-Wilber1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, diffusing into necrotic cells together with Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the damaged plasma membrane to the nucleus. Either scenario would explain the ladder formation in the terminal phase of apoptosis, often called secondary necrosis, even in the absence of CAD activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0080223-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the case of apoptosis, DNase Î³ is not necessarily responsible for INDF (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080223-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), and CAD is responsible. Thus, INDF is likely a common outcome of dying cells, but it is differentially processed in apoptosis vs. necrosis, for the latter uniquely by DNase Î³.</p>
      <p>As for the physiological significance of INDF in cell death, strong evidence that DNA degradation is important for avoiding unwanted immune activation has come from studies of mice that are deficient in endonucleases <xref rid="pone.0080223-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0080223-Napirei2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In phagocytes, DNase II inside the phagocytic lysosomal organelles digests DNA of engulfed apoptotic cells. Deficiency in DNase II results in accumulation of DNA in these organelles, which stimulates the pro-inflammatory activity of phagocytes <xref rid="pone.0080223-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. DNase I digests the DNA of the chromatin released into the extracellular space after cell death. DNase-I-deficient mice produce autoantibodies and manifest lupus-like autoimmune diseases <xref rid="pone.0080223-Nagata2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Thus the physiological significance of INDF might be to render the chromatin more manageable for subsequent disposal by phagocytic cells. The specific role of DNase Î³âdependent necrotic DNA fragmentation <italic>in vivo</italic> has not yet been addressed because a condition causing local necrosis without lethal damage is difficult to achieve. We also have not detected any gross abnormalities in DNase-Î³-deficient mice. More specific functions, especially immune functions, should be examined in further study.</p>
      <p>In this paper we showed that DNase Î³ carries out INDF in cells undergoing necrosis. This finding should have a substantial impact on studies of cell death, because INDF has been widely accepted for a long time as the hallmark of apoptosis. Our studies clearly suggest that this criterion is not definitive, since even when INDF is detected, it is not always an indicator of apoptosis, and DNase Î³-related necrosis should also be considered.</p>

        <title>Extraction of total RNA and RT-PCR</title>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II with oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). Thereafter, the resultant cDNA was amplified together with GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) using gene-specific primer pairs: DNase Î³ sense, <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-GAAGGTCATCAAACGCTGTG-3â²</named-content>; DNase Î³ antisense, <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-GGAACCAGACCACAAAG-3â²</named-content>; GAPDH sense, <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3â²</named-content>; GAPDH antisense, <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-GACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACT-3â²</named-content>. The amplified PCR products were fractionated on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.</p>

        <title>Establishment of <italic>DNase Î³</italic> knockout ES cells and mice</title>
        <p>A DNA fragment containing the mouse <italic>DNase Î³</italic> gene was isolated from a C57BL/6 genomic DNA library (Stratagene). Using this genomic DNA clone as a template, a 4.9-kb DNA fragment, corresponding to intron 4 and part of exon 5 of the <italic>DNase Î³</italic> gene, was amplified by PCR with the following primers: DNaseF8, <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-GACGTCGACCCCCAACAACTTGGCTATGGGTCC-3â²</named-content>, and DNaseR4, <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-CTCACTAGTGGGGACAATCACGAAGTCCTTGAC-3â²</named-content>. This 4.9-kb fragment and the 6.0-kb Acc I fragment spanning from exon 5 to intron 6 of the <italic>DNase Î³</italic> gene were used for constructing the gene-targeting vector. In the resulting targeting vector, pLNTK-Î³-KO3, the sequence of 17 amino acids (Leu159-Asp175) including the active site residue (His160) of the mouse DNase Î³ protein (NCBI accession no. AAH12671) is deleted from exon 5. After linearization with <italic>Sal I</italic>, the targeting vector was transfected into 3Ã10<sup>7</sup> ES cells (Bruce 4, C57BL/6 origin) <xref rid="pone.0080223-Kntgen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and the targeted clones were selected with 0.2 mg/ml of G418 and 2 ÂµM of ganciclovir. The drug-resistant colonies were expanded and the homologous recombination event was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (described below). The targeted ES cell clones were used for the generation of chimeric mice. Heterozygous (<italic>DNase Î³</italic>
<sup>+/â</sup>) and then the homozygous mice (<italic>DNase Î³</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup>) of C57BL/6 background were generated from these chimeric mice.</p>

        <p>The activity gel system (Zymography) was used for the identification of DNase activity <xref rid="pone.0080223-Nishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Briefly, protein extracts from spleen cells were electrophoresed in a Laemmli SDS gel containing salmon sperm DNA (200 Âµg/ml). After washing, the gel was incubated in a reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.8], 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), at 37Â°C for 24 h. DNase activity was detected as an ethidium bromide-unstained dark band under ultraviolet illumination.</p>
