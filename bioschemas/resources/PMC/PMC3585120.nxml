      <abstract>
        <p>Enamel-renal syndrome (ERS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe enamel hypoplasia, failed tooth eruption, intrapulpal calcifications, enlarged gingiva, and nephrocalcinosis. Recently, mutations in <italic>FAM20A</italic> were reported to cause amelogenesis imperfecta and gingival fibromatosis syndrome (AIGFS), which closely resembles ERS except for the renal calcifications. We characterized three families with AIGFS and identified, in each case, recessive <italic>FAM20A</italic> mutations: family 1 (c.992G&gt;A; g.63853G&gt;A; p.Gly331Asp), family 2 (c.720-2A&gt;G; g.62232A&gt;G; p.Gln241_Arg271del), and family 3 (c.406C&gt;T; g.50213C&gt;T; p.Arg136* and c.1432C&gt;T; g.68284C&gt;T; p.Arg478*). Significantly, a kidney ultrasound of the family 2 proband revealed nephrocalcinosis, revising the diagnosis from AIGFS to ERS. By characterizing teeth extracted from the family 3 proband, we demonstrated that <italic>FAM20A</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> molars lacked true enamel, showed extensive crown and root resorption, hypercementosis, and partial replacement of resorbed mineral with bone or coalesced mineral spheres. Supported by the observation of severe ectopic calcifications in the kidneys of <italic>Fam20a</italic> null mice, we conclude that FAM20A, which has a kinase homology domain and localizes to the Golgi, is a putative Golgi kinase that plays a significant role in the regulation of biomineralization processes, and that mutations in <italic>FAM20A</italic> cause both AIGFS and ERS.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>
<italic>FAM20A</italic> belongs to a family of 3 genes (<italic>FAM20A</italic>, <italic>FAM20B</italic>, and <italic>FAM20C</italic>) that encode kinases (phosphorylating enzymes) that modify proteins within the secretory pathway. FAM20C phosphorylates secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins (SCPPs) that are critical for bone, dentin, and enamel biomineralization, and other calcium-binding proteins in milk and saliva. The function of FAM20A is unknown, but defects in the <italic>FAM20A</italic> gene have recently been shown to cause dental enamel defects along with enlarged gingiva (amelogenesis imperfecta and gingival fibromatosis syndrome or AIGFS; OMIM #614253). We identified three families with disease-causing mutations in <italic>FAM20A</italic>. All of the symptoms of AIGFS are also found in enamel-renal syndrome (ERS, OMIM #204690), which in addition features kidney calcifications known as nephrocalcinosis. We were only able to acquire a kidney ultrasound from one of our patients with <italic>FAM20A</italic> mutations, and it showed these kidney calcifications. We conclude that <italic>FAM20A</italic> mutations cause ERS and that persons diagnosed with AIGFS should have their kidneys examined. We also were able to obtain teeth from a patient with defined <italic>FAM20A</italic> mutations and to characterize the unusual mineral deposits that replace and add to normal tooth structures and may provide clues to the function of FAM20A.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Enamel-Renal Syndrome (ERS; OMIM #204690) is a recessive syndrome characterized by severely hypoplastic (thin) or aplastic enamel on both the primary and secondary dentitions, pulp stones, and failed or delayed eruption of much of the permanent dentition, particularly the posterior teeth. Coronal dentin is sometimes resorbed and replaced by lamellar bone and there is often hypercementosis on root surfaces. These dental symptoms are associated with nephrocalcinosis, although blood chemistry analyses are typically normal <xref rid="pgen.1003302-MacGibbon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003302-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Gingival enlargement is sometimes noted <xref rid="pgen.1003302-NormanddelaTranchade1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Paula1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The initial patient complaint is the lack of enamel and failed eruption of many permanent teeth. Nephrocalcinosis is typically discovered by a renal ultrasound scan ordered because of the known association between this rare pattern of dental defects and renal dysfunction, rather than due to a patient complaint or history of renal problems <xref rid="pgen.1003302-NormanddelaTranchade1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003302-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the original report of ERS one of the two affected individuals died of renal failure <xref rid="pgen.1003302-MacGibbon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Another report described the results of a series of renal evaluations on an ERS patient that observed minimal renal calcifications at age 5 that became progressively denser in roentgenograms taken at ages 8, 11, and 14 years, and then stabilized <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Lubinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Subsequent reports found the kidney calcifications in patients with ERS to be benign <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-NormanddelaTranchade1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Dellow1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The literature describes patterns of recessive tooth defects similar to that observed in enamel renal syndrome (ERS), but without evidence of nephrocalcinosis <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Catena1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003302-Reddy1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. As in ERS, the patient's initial chief complaint relates to the lack of enamel and failure of permanent tooth eruption. Dental radiographs reveal that most if not all of the teeth lack an enamel layer and have extensive pulp calcifications. The unerupted teeth show pericoronal radiolucencies delimited by a sclerotic margin. The teeth are usually smaller than normal, often with misshapened roots <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Mock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A common observation on radiographs is resorption of the occlusal surface (sometimes all the way to the pulp) of unerupted teeth <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Korbmacher1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. When the malformed teeth are characterized histologically, they lack dental enamel, but show normal-looking dentin with well-formed dentinal tubules <xref rid="pgen.1003302-vanHeerden1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Ooya1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The minimal âenamelâ has no prismatic structure. On some teeth there is extensive localized root and/or crown resorption with partial replacement of the resorbed dentin by lamellar bone or in some places by globular structures comprised of incompletely coalesced concentric calcifications <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Mock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The thin roots are often covered by an abnormally thick layer of what appears to be cellular cementum <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Nakata1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Feller1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, advanced genetic methods involving targeted exome capture, next generation DNA sequencing, and bioinformatics computer analyses implicated <italic>FAM20A</italic> (family with sequence similarity 20, member A) located on chromosome 17q24.2 as the defective gene in a recessive disorder manifesting the same oral features as described above <xref rid="pgen.1003302-MartelliJunior1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-OSullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and designated âAmelogenesis Imperfecta and Gingival Fibromatosis Syndromeâ (AIGFS; OMIM #614253). The association between <italic>FAM20A</italic> and a syndrome that included severe enamel hypoplasia and gingival hypertrophy was confirmed by mutational analyses in four additional families that identified three homozygous <italic>FAM20A</italic> mutations (c.34_35delCT; c.813-2A&gt;G; c.1175_1179delGGCTC) and compound heterozygous mutations (c.590-2A&gt;G with c.826C&gt;T) in four families <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In none of the families with <italic>FAM20A</italic> mutations were teeth available for microscopic examination or were renal ultrasounds performed.</p>
      <p>We have characterized three families with a recessive syndrome caused by <italic>FAM20A</italic> mutations. All affected individuals in these families had mutations in both <italic>FAM20A</italic> alleles. Extracted molars were characterized histologically and shown to have hypercementosis and dentin replaced by lamellar bone. All findings were consistent with a diagnosis of AIGFS; however, we were intrigued by the similarity of AIGFS with ERS and inquired further about whether or not our probands had kidney problems.</p>

        <title>Family 1</title>
        <p>The proband's parents were born in the Caribbean. Oral photos and a panoramic radiograph were obtained for the proband and DNA was collected from nine family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003302-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The proband (III:1), his younger sister (III:4), and niece (IV:1) were affected. According to the proband, when his adult teeth finally came in they were the same size as his baby teeth and very short. As far as he remembers, his gums have always been large and bumpy. He reported that he was otherwise healthy with average height and weight. Intraoral photographs of the proband showed a mixed dentition, small dental crowns with generally thin enamel, and yellow discoloration. Over-retained primary molars in the mandibular arch and partially erupted maxillary premolars were observed. The proband had a deep anterior overbite, a posterior cross-bite, and a class III molar relationship. The vertical dimension appeared to be reduced. Radiographically, the proband had the full complement of permanent teeth, but eruption of the canines, mandibular premolars and molars was failed or delayed. No radiopaque enamel layer was apparent on any of the teeth. Even unerupted teeth with completed root formation lacked enamel. Pericoronal radiolucencies outlined by sclerotic borders were observed around unerupted teeth, symptomatic of a slow expansion of the dental follicle covering the crown. In some cases the dentin occlusal surface appeared concave and close to the pulp chamber, suggesting pre-eruptive crown resorption. Most teeth showed intrapulpal calcifications. The gingiva appeared to be hyperplastic.</p>

        <p>Family 2 was a consanguineous family from Jordan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003302-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A panorex radiograph of the proband showed the retention of primary teeth and delayed eruption of permanent cuspids, premolars, and second molars. No radiopaque enamel was detected and expanded peri-coronal radiolucencies were evident on all unerupted teeth. The pulp chambers were typically calcified and nearer the occlusal surface than expected. On some unerupted teeth the crown occlusal to the pulp chambers had disappeared, as if by resorption. An ultrasound of the proband's kidneys revealed bilateral medullary nephrosis with small calcifications in both kidneys causing acoustic shadowing. Otherwise both kidneys were normal in size and corticomedullary differentiation, each measuring about 11 cm in bipolar length.</p>

This sequence variation has not been previously identified in the dbSNP database or in 1000 Genomes Project Pilot Data. Several possible aberrant RNA splicing outcomes could occur <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Skipping of exon 5 would delete 31 amino acids (p.Q241_R271del). No normal transcript variants skipping exon 5 are listed in GenBank. Retention of intron 4 would introduce a premature termination codon, and likely cause mutant <italic>FAM20A</italic> transcripts to be degraded by nonsense-mediated decay. Human Splice Finder version 2.4.1 <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Desmet1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> suggests there could be activation of a 5â² cryptic splice site that would add one nucleotide to exon 5 and lead to a frameshift and subsequent nonsense-mediated decay.</p>

Based upon the patterns of the growth lines, this lamellar bone had undergone repeated cycles of resorption and deposition. The calcifications in the pulp were unevenly mineralized. The most highly mineralized pulp material was comprised of incompletely coalesced spherical structures (calcospherites). Thus there appeared to be at least two types of pathological mineralization within the crown: lamellar-like bone and calcospherites that apparently formed by a different mechanism. Backscatter SEMs of the root region revealed thin roots, with normal-looking root dentin covered by a thick layer of laminated, cementum-like mineralized tissue similar to the lamellar mineralized tissue that had replaced dentin in the crown but with fewer osteocyte lacunae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003302-g010">Figure 10</xref>). The dentin was often separated from this thick cementum-like layer by a hypermineralized line that might represent the original cementum.

We noted the mild gingival enlargement but did not consider the possibility of a kidney phenotype.</p>
      <p>With the breakthrough discovery that <italic>FAM20A</italic> mutations cause AI associated with a variety of oral manifestations including eruption failures and gingival enlargement <xref rid="pgen.1003302-OSullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we performed mutation analyses in three families exhibiting this pattern of defects, and in each case we identified disease-causing mutations in both <italic>FAM20A</italic> alleles and made the diagnosis of Amelogenesis Imperfecta and Gingival Fibromatosis Syndromeâ (AIGFS). However, we read several reports showing the AIGFS pattern of oral manifestations in a person with kidney calcifications (nephrocalcinosis) <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Lubinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003302-Paula1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Kirzioglu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-MartelliJunior2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In every case the nephrocalcinosis was discovered by radiographic or ultrasound images of the kidneys and not through a history of kidney problems in the family. Among the reports of similar cases without nephrocalcinosis, we found no cases in which a renal ultrasound was performed and found to be negative. After finally appreciating the kidney association, we were able to contact family 2 to obtain a kidney ultrasound, which detected nephrocalcinosis. The appropriate diagnosis for this family then is Enamel-Renal Syndrome (ERS). Unfortunately, we have been unable to obtain renal ultrasounds from affected individuals in families 1 and 3.</p>
      <p>Additional support for the association of nephrocalcinosis and the absence of FAM20A comes from recent analyses of <italic>Fam20a</italic> null mice <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Vogel1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, which discovered that âtwo-thirds of <italic>Fam20a</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice had small kidneys with pitted surfaces, which showed widespread calcificationâ¦â. Another interesting finding was detecting <italic>Fam20a</italic> gene expression in the parathyroid gland, given the failure of posterior tooth eruption in AIGFS and ERS and that primary failure of tooth eruption (PFE, OMIM #125350) can be caused by mutations in <italic>PTH1R</italic> (OMIM 168468; 3p21.31), the gene encoding a receptor for both parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related protein <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Decker1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Our SEM analyses of <italic>FAM20A</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> molars detail an assortment of developmental malformations juxtaposed with secondary modifications. Developmentally, the enamel failed to form and the roots were small and misshapened. The crown and roots were susceptible to secondary resorption and turnover. Lamellar bone replaced parts of the resorbed crown, while a thick material resembling cellular cementum covered the roots. Highly mineralized, coalesced spherical calcifications were observed in the pulp and/or radicular area. We expect that the secondary root resorption and pathological mineralization occurred during the period of impaction. These unusual dental changes are rare in patients with non-syndromic amelogenesis imperfecta <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, but are hallmark features of Enamel-Renal Syndrome (ERS) and were observed in the teeth from our probands with <italic>FAM20A</italic> mutations and nephrocalcinosis. These distinctive dental histological changes have previously been described in persons diagnosed as having AI without checking for nephrocalcinosis <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Catena1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Nakata1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Mock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The similarities between our histological observations and those reported for extracted teeth with a comparable dental phenotype are remarkable and increase our suspicion that ERS has been historically under-diagnosed.</p>

<italic>FAM20A</italic> is part of a small gene family that in human and mouse has three members: <italic>FAM20A</italic>, <italic>FAM20B</italic>, and <italic>FAM20C</italic>. All three proteins have signal peptides of 21 amino acids and appear to be secreted <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Nalbant1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The FAM20 genes encode proteins of similar size with a conserved C-terminal putative kinase domain (cd10469). <italic>FAM20A</italic> (17q24.2; cDNA reference sequence NM_017565.3) encodes a 541 amino acid protein. <italic>FAM20B</italic> (1q25; NM_014864.3) encodes 409 amino acids and <italic>FAM20C</italic> (7p22.3; NM_020223.2) 584 amino acids. Analysis of human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) suggests that the FAM20 family is expressed in many tissues. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) human EST database currently has 5,779,625 entries for 45 healthy tissues. Among these are 103 EST entries for <italic>FAM20A</italic> (Hs.268874) from 22 tissues, with larynx (82/million), testes (60/million), and kidney (47/million) showing the highest proportion of <italic>FAM20A</italic> transcripts. Mice homozygous for a defined 58-kb deletion in the 5â² region of <italic>Fam20a</italic> showed growth-cessation and growth-delay <xref rid="pgen.1003302-An1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Recently, <italic>Fam20a</italic> null mice were characterized with severe ectopic calcifications in the kidneys <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Vogel1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>FAM20B is a xylose kinase in the Golgi required for the efficient addition of glycan attachments on secreted proteins. <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Koike1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. FAM20C has recently been identified as Golgi casein kinase <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Tagliabracci1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, the enzyme that phosphorylates the secretory calcium binding phosphoproteins critical for biomineralization <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Kawasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. <italic>FAM20C</italic> mutations cause autosomal recessive lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia (Raine syndrome; OMIM #259775) <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, as well as non-lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Simpson2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003302-Fradin1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. FAM20A localizes to the Golgi, so perhaps FAM20A is a Golgi kinase like FAM20B and FAM20C, and its deficiency results in altered post-translational modifications of secreted proteins. In the absence of FAM20A, the dental follicle does not support tooth eruption, slowly expands, and generates psammomatous calcifications. The connective tissue of the gingiva also slowly expands and psammomatous calcifications are deposited within the hyperplastic gingiva <xref rid="pgen.1003302-MartelliJunior1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Similar calcifications occur in the dental pulp and possibly in the kidneys, causing nephrocalcinosis. This pattern of ectopic mineralization might be explained by failure to catalyze appropriate post-translational modifications on extracellular matrix molecules that inhibit mineralization when FAM20A is absent.</p>
        <p>The nine novel, disease-causing <italic>FAM20A</italic> mutations so far reported are obviously destructive of protein structure and function. Three are nonsense mutations (c.406C&gt;T, p.Arg136*; c.826C&gt;T, p.Arg276*; c.1432C&gt;T, p.Arg478*). Three are splice junction mutations at the borders of exon 3 (c.590-2A&gt;G, p.Asp197_Ile214delinsV), exon 5 (c.720-2A&gt;G, p.Gln241_Arg271del) and exon 6 (c.813-2A&gt;G, p.Arg271Serfs*70). Two are frameshifts (c.34_35delCT, pLeu12Alafs*67; c.1175_1179delGGCTC, p.Arg392Profs*22), and one is a missense mutation (c.992G&gt;A, p.Gly331Asp) at a highly conserved site. Only one of the nine <italic>FAM20A</italic> disease-causing mutations was found in more than one family (c.406C&gt;T). These data strongly implicate <italic>FAM20A</italic> in the etiology of this recessive disorder that combines enamel defects, retention of primary teeth, delayed and failed eruption of permanent teeth with pericoronal radiolucencies, pulp calcifications, small and misshapened teeth, gingival hyperplasia, and now, nephrocalcinosis. Only further studies can show if defects in other gene(s) can cause this pattern of malformations and if <italic>FAM20A</italic> defects were not previously associated with nephrocalcinosis due to a lack of penetrance, subclinical presentation, or delayed onset.</p>
