      <abstract>
        <p>The TOCA family of F-BARâcontaining proteins bind to and remodel lipid bilayers via their conserved F-BAR domains, and regulate actin dynamics via their N-Wasp binding SH3 domains. Thus, these proteins are predicted to play a pivotal role in coordinating membrane traffic with actin dynamics during cell migration and tissue morphogenesis. By combining genetic analysis in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> with cellular biochemical experiments in mammalian cells, we showed that: i) loss of CeTOCA proteins reduced the efficiency of Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in oocytes. Genetic interference with CeTOCAs interacting proteins WSP-1 and WVE-1, and other components of the WVE-1 complex, produced a similar effect. Oocyte endocytosis defects correlated well with reduced egg production in these mutants. ii) CeTOCA proteins localize to cellâcell junctions and are required for proper embryonic morphogenesis, to position hypodermal cells and to organize junctional actin and the junction-associated protein AJM-1. iii) Double mutant analysis indicated that the <italic>toca</italic> genes act in the same pathway as the nematode homologue of N-WASP/WASP, <italic>wsp-1</italic>. Furthermore, mammalian TOCA-1 and <italic>C. elegans</italic> CeTOCAs physically associated with N-WASP and WSP-1 directly, or WAVE2 indirectly via ABI-1. Thus, we propose that TOCA proteins control tissues morphogenesis by coordinating Clathrin-dependent membrane trafficking with WAVE and N-WASPâdependent actin-dynamics.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cells continuously remodel their shape especially during cell migration, differentiation, and tissues morphogenesis. This occurs through the dynamic reorganization of their plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton: two processes that must therefore be intimately linked and coordinated. Molecules that sit at the crossroads of membrane remodeling and actin dynamics are predicted to play a pivotal role in coordinating these processes. The TOCA family of proteins represents a case in point. These proteins bind to and deform membranes during processes such as membrane trafficking. They also control actin dynamics through their interactions with actin remodeling factors, such as WASP and WAVEs. Here, we characterize the functional role of TOCA proteins in a model organism, the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. We established that <italic>toca</italic> genes regulate Clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking during oocyte growth. We further discovered that these proteins play an important role in epithelial morphogenesis in developing embryos, and in egg production in adult nematodes. Moreover, the TOCA interacting proteins WASP/WSP-1 and WAVE/WVE-1, as well as other components of the WVE-1 complex, appear to be involved in TOCA-dependent processes. Thus, we propose that TOCA proteins control tissue morphogenesis by coordinating Clathrin-dependent membrane trafficking with WAVE and N-WASPâdependent actin-dynamics.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The coordination and functional cooperation between endocytic trafficking of membranes and membrane proteins with actin-based motility is required for the correct execution of many cellular phenotypes. These include directional cell migration, tissue morphogenesis, cell-fate determination, and the establishment of cell polarity in epithelial and in neuronal cells. Consistently, endocytic trafficking and actin-based motility and dynamics are intimately linked. Results obtained in several species have established that endocytosis and trafficking events rely on propelling forces generated by actin treadmilling <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Kaksonen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Consistent with these results, an increasing number of actin binding and regulatory proteins have been shown to participate in a variety of internalization and trafficking processes, ultimately controlling the signaling response of cells to extracellular stimuli. In addition, genetic and cellular biochemical evidence has revealed how cycles of endocytosis and recycling of plasma membranes and plasma membrane proteins are essential to promote the spatial restriction of signaling <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Caswell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Palamidessi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>However our understanding of the molecular circuitry involved in these processes is still in its early stages. Proteins that sit at the crossroads of membrane remodeling and actin dynamics are predicted to play a prominent role in these processes, simultaneously binding regulators of actin dynamics and sensing or inducing membrane curvature. A prototypical example of this kind of protein is the BAR (Bin, Amphiphysin, Rvs) domain superfamily of proteinsâincluding âclassicalâ BAR domains, F-BAR (FCH-BAR or EFC Extended-FCH) and I-BAR (Inverse-BAR) domains, which have emerged as important players in membrane-remodeling processes <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Members of the superfamily are recruited from the cytoplasm to trigger the formation of plasma-membrane extensions, invaginations, tubular organelles, and transport intermediates, including endocytic vesicles <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Itoh2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Tsujita1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Much of what is known about the structure-function relationships of the BAR superfamily has been obtained from crystallographic and <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical studies, showing that members of the family are elongated dimers formed by the antiparallel association of Î±-helical coiled coils which can deform liposome into tubules of different diameters <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Futterer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Frost2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A defining feature of a subfamily of F-BAR-containing proteins that includes three mammalian members, TOCA-1 (Transducer of Cdc42 dependent actin assembly), CIP4 (Cdc42 interacting protein 4) and FBP17 (Formin binding protein 17) (hereafter referred to as the TOCA family), is to possess additional protein:protein interaction domains that enables them to function as signal transducers, physically bridging membrane trafficking with signalling that controls actin dynamics. TOCA-1 and CIP4, through their imperfect HR1/CRIB-like (Cdc42 and Rac interacting binding motif) domain act as direct downstream effectors of the small GTPase Cdc42 <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Aspenstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition all members of the TOCA family bind, through their conserved C-terminal SH3 domain, to either prototypical endocytic proteins such as dynamin <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Kamioka1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Tsujita1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, or to actin nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) such as N-WASP and WASP <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Tsujita1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Takano1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In this latter case, the association of TOCA-1 with the inhibited WASP-WIP complex has been shown to be critical for the activation of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization induced by Cdc42 <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Takano1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite this wealth of structural and biochemical observations, the functional and cellular roles of the TOCA family proteins have remained largely elusive. Consistent with their biochemical properties, concomitant downregulation of TOCA-1 and FBP17 in vivo resulted in a relative slight inhibition of Transferrin receptor internalization <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Tsujita1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Whereas the ectopic expression of FBP17 and CIP4, but not of TOCA-1, caused the appearance of membrane tubules, whose accumulation was enhanced by inhibition of dynamin or actin dynamics <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Kamioka1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Tsujita1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Recently, by somatic gene disruption in dorsal epithelial cells, the only <italic>Drosophila</italic> TOCA-family was demonstrated to mediate E-cadherin endocytosis in conjunction with the Cdc42/Par6/aPKC polarity complex <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Leibfried1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However the precise molecular details in this pathway remain to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Here, by combining genetic approaches in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> with cellular biochemical analysis in mammalian cells we have identified a requirement of the TOCA subfamily of proteins in WASP and WAVE-dependent pathways controlling actin dynamics and membrane trafficking. Specifically we find that CeTOCA-1 and CeTOCA-2 are important for the regulation of Clathrin-mediated endocytic processes during oocyte growth, and in the control of epithelial morphogenesis in developing embryos. Remarkably, mammalian TOCA-1, like <italic>C. elegans</italic> CeTOCA-2, associates with ABI-1, a key member of the WAVE complex. Furthermore mammalian TOCA-1 localizes at tight junction in epithelial cells, suggesting that this function may be conserved.</p>

The secondary structure prediction of the N-terminus of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> TOCA-1 protein is in good agreement with the one described for the human F-BAR domain of FBP17 <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Thus we built a structural atomic model of the F-BAR domains of <italic>C. elegans</italic> CeTOCA-1. With an estimated precision of 100% (E-value 2.6 e<sup>â30</sup>), the model predicted this domain to fold into a nearly flat zeppelin shape. This analysis also showed full conservation of all key cationic residues required for membrane lipid bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that the biochemical functions of this domain in CeTOCA-1 is equivalent to that of its mammalian homologues. Consistent with this prediction, the ectopic expression into mammalian cells of GFP-tagged CeTOCA-1 and CeTOCA-2 induced the formation of tubular/vesicular-like structures in nearly 100% of cells expressing the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), like their mammalian homologues <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Next, we tested whether the SH3 domain of CeTOCA-1 is also functional and able to associate with one of the known mammalian ligands, N-WASP or <italic>C. elegans</italic> WSP-1. Indeed, immobilized GST-SH3 domains of CeTOCA-1 and CeTOCA-2 bound to mammalian N-WASP and CeWSP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s001">Figure S1F</xref>), CeTOCA-2 SH3 was less efficient than the SH3 domains of human TOCA-1 or CeTOCA-1.

Both proteins labeled intracellular structures and appeared enriched along cell-cell junctions. This was particularly pronounced for CeTOCA-1, which colocalized with the junctional protein AJM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s001">Figure S1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), while TOCA-2 appears to be more diffuse in the cytoplasm or cytoplasmic structures, suggesting that these proteins may function in the formation or maintenance of adhesive structures. We further confirmed the intracellular localization of CeTOCA proteins by analyzing the expression of CeTOCA-1::GFP and CeTOCA-2::GFP transgenes in their respective mutant strains lacking the endogenous protein. Attempts to use the endogenous promoters to drive the transgenes failed. We therefore employed the commonly used <italic>pie-1</italic> promoter, to drive maternal protein expression in the germline, and early embryos <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Mello1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This was particularly relevant because of the endocytic defect of oocytes in animals lacking CeTOCA proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In oocytes, both gene products are present at the plasma membrane and in vesicular-like structures, consistent with their predicted role in membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, we observed a similar staining pattern of endogenous CeTOCA-1 in dissected gonads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) (the anti-CeTOCA-2 antibody was not sufficiently efficient to recognize specifically the endogenous protein in this organ and adult worms).

        <title>Efficient Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of the yolk protein YP170 by oocytes requires CeTOCA proteins</title>
        <p>Lipids and proteins derived from yolk are thought to provide essential nutrients required for rapid embryo development. Accordingly, adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites synthesize massive quantities of yolk particles in their intestines and secrete them basolaterally into the pseudocoelomatic space (body cavity), from which they are taken up into growing oocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Kimble1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Disruption of CME impedes the internalization of yolk protein YP170, causing characteristic aberrant accumulation of aggregated yolk in the pseudocoelomatic space <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Since some of the mammalian TOCA family members are involved in CME <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Itoh2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Tsujita1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> we tested whether this was the case also in the nematode.</p>
        <p>We observed aberrant accumulation of transgenically expressed yolk marker YP170::GFP <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> in the body cavity of <italic>toca-1(tm2056)</italic>, <italic>toca-1(tm3334)</italic>, and <italic>toca-2(ng11)</italic>, single mutants, as well as <italic>toca-1(tm2056);toca-2(ng11)</italic> double mutant animals. The aberrant distribution of YP170 was most prominent in the <italic>toca-1(tm2056);toca-2(ng11)</italic> double mutant, where nearly 100% of the worms accumulated YP170::GFP in the pseudocoelomatic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). Importantly, we could restore the normal distribution of YP170 marker by re-expressing either CeTOCA-1 or CeTOCA-2 specifically in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), thus demonstrating the requirement for both TOCA gene products in the germ cells.</p>
        <p>Furthermore we found that the amount and distribution of YP170 in the oocytes was reduced in toca double mutant, as one would expect from defective internalization. As the growing oocytes move toward the spermatheca, where fertilization takes place, they progressively accumulate YP170, which in Wt distributes in a gradient that generally encompasses three or more oocytes <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Sato1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Conversely, in endocytosis defective mutants, YP170 is either not detectable, or present only in the last most proximal oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). t<italic>oca-1(tm2056);toca-2(ng11</italic>) strain displays a significant reduction in the number of oocytes positive for YP170, with YP170::GFP only detectable in the single most proximal oocyte, in more than 50% of mutant worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Additionally, the amount of YP170::GFP, as determined by measuring total fluorescence of the worm with a similar number of YP170-positive oocytes, was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). It is relevant to point out that when we compared worms at a similar stage and displaying a similar number of oocytes in the gonads, most wild type worms had three YP170 positive oocytes (&gt;80% of cases), while most <italic>toca-1(tm2056);toca-2(ng11</italic>) worms had only the most proximal of the oocyte positive for YP170 (&gt;85% of cases), with striking accumulation of YP170 in the pseudocoelomatic cavity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, we found that yolk receptor was correctly localized, and actually slightly, but significantly enriched at the plasma membrane, in the <italic>toca-1(tm2056);toca-2(ng11</italic>) double mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g002">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s004">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that the accumulation of YP170 was not due to poor expression or mistargeting of yolk receptors during secretion. Thus, CeTOCA proteins are essential for the efficient endocytosis of yolk protein during oogenesis, suggesting that their primary role is to control CME. The specific role of CeTOCA protein in CME is further demonstrated by the observation that fluid-phase endocytic processes, such as the internalization of ssGFP into coelomocytes was not altered (not shown).</p>

        <p>Collectively, these observations support the notion that WSP-1 and, more surprisingly, the WVE-1 complex, which in mammalian cells has never been implicated in CME, are both concomitantly required for efficient internalization of YP170 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes.

        <p>As previously reported <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Withee1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, mutation of <italic>wsp-1</italic> caused a significant reduction in the number of eggs laid with respect to Wt worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

Conversely, individual RNAi-mediated reduction of either <italic>wve-1</italic> or <italic>gex-2</italic> or <italic>gex-3</italic> caused a somewhat variable (presumably reflecting the variable efficiency of RNAi), but detectable reduction in the number of eggs laid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

We observed a similar set of morphological alterations in <italic>toca-1(tm2056);toca-2(ng11)</italic> double mutant. Time-lapse analysis of developing <italic>toca</italic> double mutant revealed that virtually all dying embryos are defective in morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s010">Video S1</xref>). In all these cases gut cells appeared to differentiate normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Using the DLG-1::GFP transgene to label the apical junctions <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Totong1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> we further monitored morphogenesis in live embryos and detected Gex-like morphogenetic defects, including failure of epidermal enclosure (full Gex-phenotype, leading to extrusion of gut to the exterior), 1-fold arrest and 2-fold arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, arrow, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s010">Video S1</xref>), just as it has been described for loss of the WVE-1/WAVE protein complex. Mutations in WAVE/SCAR components lead to an expansion of the apical lumen of the intestine <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Using the DLG-1::GFP transgene, we measured the width of the intestinal lumen and found that <italic>wve-1</italic> mutant and the <italic>toca-1(tm3334);toca-2(ng11)</italic> double mutant display a similar increase in the width of the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This Gex-like intestinal morphogenesis defect was further confirmed by staining embryos at the same stage of development with anti-IFB-2 antibody, MH33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g005">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>), which recognizes intermediates filaments forming the terminal web beneath the microvilli of intestinal cells.

Together these results strengthen the notion that the embryonic lethality of <italic>toca-1(tm2056);toca-2(ng11)</italic> double or <italic>toca-2(ng11)</italic> mutants is due to a Gex epithelial morphogenesis phenotype <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Francis1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We further examined the effect of <italic>toca</italic> mutations on apical junctions, focusing on the key junctional protein AJM-1 (also know as JAM-1) <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Knust1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Koppen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In the <italic>toca-1;toca-2</italic> double mutant, AJM-1::GFP was localized at cell-cell junctions, as in the Wt strain, but hypodermal cells failed to intercalate dorsally and to correctly migrate ventrally, similar to <italic>gex-2</italic> and <italic>gex-3</italic> mutants strains <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). Finally, like DLG-1, AJM-1::GFP also marks the apical borders of cells lining the intestinal lumen, which is enlarged in <italic>toca-1;toca-2</italic> double mutants, similar to defects previously reported for <italic>gex</italic> mutants <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Soto1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, quantification of AJM-1::GFP at junction (along the cell perimeter) in embryos at similar stage of development revealed a significant 1.5-fold higher fluorescent signal of AJM-1 in <italic>toca-1;toca-2</italic> mutant than in Wt strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, right graph, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s006">Figure S6</xref>), while its overall levels were unchanged as determined by immunoblotting of total worm lysates (not shown). These data suggest an altered cellular trafficking that may lead to increase junctional accumulation of the protein. We caution, however, that junctional AJM-1 levels are an indirect measurement of the amounts on the cell surface of transmembrane proteins, reflecting possible trafficking impairment. Collectively, these results indicate the requirement of CeTOCA proteins in the earliest event of epidermal morphogenesis due to a Gex phenotype and suggest a role in regulation of junctional protein traffic.</p>

Consistent with this idea, we found that mammalian TOCA-1 binds to N-WASP and to WIP, an N-WASP interacting regulatory protein, -through the TOCA-1 SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s007">Figure S7A and S7B</xref>).</p>
        <p>The relationship between CeTOCA proteins and the WVE-1/WAVE complex in the nematode is, instead, more complex, suggesting unexpected levels of molecular interactions and regulation. To overcome the lack of reliable antibodies and the intrinsic limitations of cellular biochemistry of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we set out to define whether any physical or functional interaction between these proteins is conserved in mammals. To this end, we utilized the SH3 domain of TOCA-1 to search for novel interactors, employing phage display libraries of human polypeptides <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Zucconi1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. We found ABI-1 among the most represented interactors (not shown). We validated this interaction by showing that endogenous and ectopically expressed TOCA-1 and ABI-1 coimmunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>), and interacted in <italic>in vitro</italic> binding experiments using immobilized SH3 domain of TOCA-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s007">Figure S7C</xref>). A similar interaction was also detected between ABI-1 and FBP17 or CIP4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s007">Figure S7D</xref>), indicating that all family members have the capacity to form a complex with ABI-1. Notably, we could recover endogenous TOCA-1, but not CIP4 or FBP17 (not shown), in ABI-1 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that TOCA-1 is the most likely physiological relevant F-BAR containing interaction partner of ABI-1. In keeping with this notion, we found that <italic>in vitro</italic> translated <italic>C. elegans</italic> ABI-1 readily interacted with the SH3 domain of CeTOCA-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), indicating that this interaction is conserved in the nematode.</p>

        <p>The quantitatively more relevant binding partner of ABI-1 in mammalian cells is WAVE2 <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Innocenti2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Consistent with this, we also detected WAVE2 in TOCA-1 and ABI-1 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) and in <italic>in vitro</italic> binding experiments using TOCA-1 SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s007">Figure S7C</xref>). The extent of this interaction was lower than the one between TOCA-1 and ABI-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g007">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s007">Figure S7C</xref>). These results suggest that ABI-1 may serve as a bridge between TOCA-1 and WAVE2. Accordingly, the amount of WAVE2 in TOCA-1 immunoprecipitates was significantly increased when ABI-1 was over-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>
        <p>TOCA-1, like CIP4, was originally identified as an effector of the small GTPase Cdc42. We thus sought to assess whether ABI-1 could be linked directly to Cdc42 in the presence of TOCA-1. The binding of TOCA-1 to purified, GTP-loaded Cdc42 was specific and readily detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), as previously reported <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. More importantly, ABI-1 interacted with GTP-loaded Cdc42 only in the presence of TOCA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Under these conditions, WAVE2 was also recovered on immobilized and activated Cdc42 (not shown), suggesting that a signaling complex connecting Cdc42-TOCA-1 and ABI-1/WAVE-2 may form. Thus, mammalian TOCA-1 can associate with the WAVE complex through ABI-1, in addition to N-WASP, recapitulating the interactions observed in the nematode.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this manuscript, we provide evidence that a primary role of the CeTOCA family proteins is to control endocytic processes with important implications for the regulation of actin-dependent epithelial morphogenesis and migration. <italic>toca</italic> genes genetically interact with <italic>wve-1</italic>, acting in the same pathway as <italic>wsp-1</italic>, most likely downstream of <italic>cdc-42</italic>. This, combined with the observation that TOCA family members can form complexes with N-WASP or WAVE2 through ABI-1, indicates that these proteins coordinate N-WASP and WAVE-dependent actin dynamics with membrane trafficking.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>TOCAs, WVE-1, and WSP-1 are essential for optimal Clathrin-dependent endocytosis</title>
        <p>The concomitant genetic disruption of the two <italic>C. elegans toca</italic> homologues results in a fully penetrant endocytic defect in oocytes. This defect in yolk uptake likely accounts also for the significant reduction in the number of eggs laid by double <italic>toca-1;toca-2</italic> mutant worms. The finding, however, that CeTOCA-2, but not CeTOCA-1, is enriched at the cortical surface of rachis suggests that this protein may have a specific role beyond vitellogenin endocytosis, possibly by directly affecting oocyte structure and organization. Recently, proteins that display a cortical rachis enrichment, like that of CeTOCA-2, such as Anillin-2 (ANI-2) <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Maddox1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and Flightless-1 (FLI-1) <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, have been shown to be required for germline morphogenesis and oocyte growth. Both of these proteins are actin-binding factors, pointing to the importance of actin dynamics and architectural organization in this process. In keeping with this observation, one possible, albeit speculative, function for CeTOCA-2 would be to provide a link between actin and membranes during germline morphogenesis. We note however that we did not observe obvious abnormalities in germline structure (e.g. the distribution of nuclei in the syncytium and the size of the oocytes appear relatively normal in <italic>toca-2(ng11)</italic> strain (not shown). More experiments will be needed to assess whether <italic>toca-2</italic> is a germline morphogenesis gene and its precise role in the process.</p>
        <p>In YP170 internalization, CeTOCA-1 and CeTOCA-2 act in a redundant fashion. However, in this process, as in embryo development and oocyte growth, CeTOCA-2 display a more prominent role than CeTOCA-1, likely reflecting a differential intracellular localization and/or different binding affinity for their common partners, namely ABI-1 or N-WASP. In these latter cases, the relative low affinities of the interactions observed suggest that CeTOCA<italic>s</italic> may modulate the function of WSP-1 and ABI-1/WVE-1, but are not obligatory partners of either protein complexes.</p>
        <p>Notably, the concomitant disruption of <italic>toca-1</italic> and <italic>toca-2</italic> reduced or delayed, but did not abrogate, YP170 entry into oocytes, indicating that these proteins are critical, but not essential for endocytosis of YP170. This is not unexpected given the complexity of CME, where &gt;50 accessory proteins <xref rid="pgen.1000675-EngqvistGoldstein1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Rappoport1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, including membrane binding and bending BAR-domain-containing molecules <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Gallop1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, have been shown to aid the core machinery of internalization in a cell context and often cargo-dependent manner <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Sorkin1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome contains additional F-BAR, N-BAR and SH3-containing proteins. These proteins may, thus, potentially function in a partially redundant fashion with the <italic>tocas</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
        <p>The membrane tubulation activity of the F-BAR domain coupled with the ability to bind key actin regulators is predicted to enable TOCA proteins to assist and promote the initial events leading to the internalization of plasma membrane proteins. The genetic evidence provided in this study in part confirms this proposition <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Itoh2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Tsujita1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Frost2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We found that: i) the two major actin NPFs WSP-1, and more surprisingly WVE-1 (and its binding partners), are important for optimal internalization of YP170; ii) CeTOCA<italic>s</italic> genetically interact with WVE-1, while acting in the same pathway of WSP-1. The existence of the latter pathway is consistent with the demonstrated role of mammalian TOCA-1 in mediating the biochemical activation of WASP downstream of Cdc42 <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. According to this model, the direct and concomitant interaction of TOCA-1 and Cdc42 with WASP relieves the autoinhibited state of the latter protein leading to Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A similar mechanisms is likely functional in YP170 internalization, as indicated by the fact that RNAi-interference of Cdc42 phenocopies <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Balklava1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> the removal of WSP-1 and CeTOCA<italic>s</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
        <p>The pathways emanating from Cdc42 and regulating endocytosis are, however, more complex that the one depicted here. Indeed, the Cdc42-dependent polarity effector complex, PAR-3/PAR-6/atypicalPKC was also shown to mediate the endocytosis of YP170 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Balklava1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Whereas, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Cdc42, PAR-6 and atypical PKC, but not PAR-3, have been recently demonstrated to be required for E-cadherin endocytosis, working in concert with CIP4 <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Leibfried1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, WASP and Dynamin <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Georgiou1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The full Cdc42, Par6, Par3, and aPKC complex affect the trafficking of Crumbs and apically applied FM 4â64 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> during neuroectoderm development <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. While the hierarchical organization and precise mechanisms through which these proteins function remains unclear, these data and our findings suggest a role of a CDC42/PAR-3/atypicalPKC/TOCA/WASP axis in the regulation of early endocytic steps of multiple cargos.</p>
        <p>An additional level of complexity is revealed by the requirement for the WAVE/WVE-1 in YP170 endocytosis, suggesting a previously unsuspected regulatory role for the WAVE complex in a <italic>bona fide</italic> Clathrin-dependent internalization process. In mammals, however, no co-localization of this protein complex with Clathrin was ever detected at the plasma membrane, suggesting that it does not directly control internalization <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Innocenti1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Benesch1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Assuming that this is also the case in the nematode, the most likely role of the WAVE/WVE-1 complex is in later steps of the endocytic route, or to regulate Clathrin-independent pathways.</p>
        <p>Finally, it is worth noting that <italic>toca</italic> mutants display more severe endocytic impairment than the combined genetic/functional interference of <italic>wsp-1</italic> and/or <italic>wve-1</italic> or <italic>Cdc42</italic>. This might simply reflect an incomplete down-regulation of <italic>wve-1</italic> and its associated components by RNAi. Alternatively, <italic>toca</italic> genes, by analogy to the role exerted in embryonic development, may act upstream of or in parallel to these NPFs, exerting a modulatory role on their activities, and further regulating additional actin-independent pathways. In favor of this latter possibility, the SH3 domains of all the mammalian TOCA paralogues have been shown to associate with Dynamin <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, a GTPases that is essential for vesicle scission during multiple internalization mechanisms.</p>
        <p>One possible scenario that emerges from, and may account for these and previous published observations, is that CeTOCA-1 and CeTOCA-2 may be part of a network of intertwined pathways acting downstream or in parallel to Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s008">Figure S8</xref>). CeTOCA-1 and CeTOCA-2 may directly connect Cdc42 to WSP-1 and/or Dynamin. Concomitantly, a WVE-1 complex cascade may contribute to the generation of actin dynamics-based forces required for optimal endocytosis. TOCA proteins might drive the correct localization of the WVE-1 complex, rather than modulating its biochemical activity. This possibility is suggested by the interaction between CeTOCA-2 and ABI-1, which is conserved in mammals and nematodes. All of these pathways, including the Cdc42-PAR-6-PAR-3-aPKC complex, may converge, coordinating actin and membrane dynamics during the internalization of different cargos, such as YP170-RME-2 and, presumably, junctional complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000675.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

        <title>How do TOCAs control epidermal morphogenesis?</title>
        <p>Our results indicate that CeTOCA proteins are localized at cell-cell junctions, preferentially at the apical/lateral side, where junctional complexes are also located. A similar localization is also conserved in mammalian epithelial cells. Additionally, at these sites, removal of CeTOCA<italic>s</italic> impairs the organization of cortical filamentous actin and enhances accumulation of the junctional protein AJM-1. Since the primary function of CeTOCA proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> appears to regulate endocytosis, it is reasonable to assume that CeTOCA<italic>s</italic> may similarly control the internalization or trafficking of key cell-cell junction proteins. Indeed, intracellular trafficking of junctional proteins is emerging as a critical device to ensure dynamic remodeling of epithelial cell-cell adhesion molecules <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000675-DSouzaSchorey1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. This process may become particularly relevant when epithelial cells migrate, such as during morphogenesis in embryonic development, or in wound closure <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Matsuda1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Similarly, disruption of CeTOCA proteins may impair the proper internalization of junctional complexes, resulting in altered morphogenetic movements of hypodermal cells. It is of note that defective endocytosis of E-cadherin, a key component of adherens junctions, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> notum epithelium or dorsal thorax has been recently linked to the only <italic>Drosophila</italic> TOCA family member, CIP4 <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Leibfried1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In this system, <italic>Drosophila</italic> CIP4 appears to somehow connect the Cdc42-dependent polarity subcomplex, PAR-6/atypicalPKC with WASP and Dynamin, ultimately regulating vesicle scission and internalization of E-cadherin <xref rid="pgen.1000675-Leibfried1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000675-Georgiou1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. A similar situation may also occur in hypodermal cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In this case, CeTOCA proteins may directly regulate the activity of WSP-1/WASP, downstream of CDC-42, while cooperating with WVE-1, ultimately mediating the generation of actin dynamics-dependent forces needed for the correct remodeling of junctional complexes during cell migration. Future studies exploiting the mammalian epithelial cell model systems will be required to address these hypotheses. Nevertheless our data suggest that TOCA proteins sit at a critical crossroad of actin and membrane dynamics in the regulation of the intracellular trafficking during epithelial morphogenesis.</p>

(A) <italic>toca-1;toca-2</italic> double mutant worm displays altered intestinal morphology during embryo development. Wt and the indicated mutant worms were fixed and stained with anti-MH33 antibody or DAPI to detect the intestinal cells and cell nuclei, respectively. Embryos die at 1.5 fold stage, just before elongation starts; DAPI shows that Wt and mutants have a similar number of nuclei, indicating a similar developmental stage. Bar, 10 Âµm. The percentage of gut-defective embryos of the various genotypes, quantified as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, is shown in the bottom graph. Please note that in the case of <italic>gex-3(zu196)</italic> we used a balanced heterozygous strain <italic>OX169 gex-3(zu196)/DnT1</italic> in which only 25% of the progeny is homozygous for <italic>gex-3(zu196)</italic> according to Mendelian distribution. Nearly 100% of these homozygous <italic>gex-3(zu196)</italic> embryos display the morphogenetic intestinal defect as previously reported (Soto et al., 2002). Data are the meanÂ±s.e.m. (nâ=â100) of at least three independent experiments. P&lt;0.0001, two-tailed t-test is indicated by an asterisk.

Of note, at this stage it is easy to appreciate that MH33 display an apical distribution as previously reported (Patel et al., 2008) (<italic>right</italic>). Bar, 10 Âµm.

Loss of <italic>tocas</italic> leads to the distinctive Gex (Gut on the exterior) phenotype due to failures in cell movement and cell shape changes. Lateral view: <italic>gex</italic> embryos fail to initiate epidermal ventral movements. By 400 min after first cleavage, Wt embryos initiate circumferential constrictions to squeeze the embryo into a worm. <italic>gex</italic> embryos undergo constriction that leads the epidermis to collapse inwardly.

          <p>The surface levels of AJM-1 of <italic>toca-1;toca-2</italic> mutant embryos are slightly higher than wt embryos. Quantification of AJM-1 along the cell perimeter of hypodermal cells in WT and <italic>toca-1;toca2</italic> mutant embryos. Embryos at the two-cell stage were kept at 22Â° for 5 hours before fixation between 360 and 400 min, as indicated, when the âbean shape stageâ was reached. Embryos were stained with anti-actin (not shown). The second and third raw images were used to determine the levels of F-actin at junctions as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, or processed for epifluorescence or DIC. Images were captured with a Leica Microsystems confocal microscope using the HCX PL APO CS 63.0Ã1.40 OIL objective lens, and objective zoom (3.49Ã). Exposure time and gain setting were fixed as follows: (Dapi PMT1 (Photo Multiplier Tube)â=â500, GFP-PMT2â=â583, Cy3-PMT3â=â550, PMT Trans (HV)â=â298). Identical settings were used for all samples so that direct comparison of the signal intensities among the images of embryos of different genetic backgrounds was possible. The ImageJ threshold alogorithm (red channels) were then applied to eliminate cytoplasmic and background signals by placing âRegions of Interestâ (ROI) over areas outside the junctional contour. We manually determined the cell perimeters and calculated mean intensities and perimeter length. The mean intensitiy values were then multiplied by the perimeter of each cell to obtain the total intensity along the cell perimeter, as exemplified in the boxed cells on the bottom raw (the line around the cells is meant to outline the chosen cell, not the actual perimeter). Examples of the values obtained for the outlined (white circles) cells are shown. We repeated the procedures to obtain statistically meaningful data that are expressed as meanÂ±s.e.m (n&gt;20 from at least 4 to 5 independent embryos of each genotype). The values of the total intensities along the cell perimeters were plotted as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000675-g006">Figure 6A</xref>. Bar is 10 Âµm. The results indicate that there is a slight, but significant enrichment of AJM-1 at the junction. This may suggest an altered trafficking of junctional proteins. However, AJM-1 is not a transmembrane protein in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but rather associates with apical junctional molecules and thus presumably reflects the cell surface levels of such transmembrane proteins. P&lt;0.0002, two-tailed t-test is indicated by asterisks.</p>

          <p>Working model of TOCA proteins signalling network in the regulation of membrane trafficking. Working model of TOCA proteins signalling network in the regulation of membrane trafficking. TOCA-1 and TOCA-2 may link nucleating promoting factors to the plasma membrane (not shown) via their F-BAR domain and integrate signalling pathways controlled by the small GTPases Cdc42. A Cdc42/WASP(WSP-1)/TOCA-1/2, in analogy to that demonstrated in mammalian (Itoh et al., 2005; Tsujita et al., 2006), may directly promote localized actin dynamics during early steps of Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The polarity complex PAR-3/PAR-6 whose activity is required for endocytic and recycling events downstream of Cdc42 (Balklava et al., 2007) may define an alternative branch of the pathway that may also converge in controlling the TOCA-1/2/WASP(WSP-1) axis. An unexpected contribution of the WAVE(WVE-1) axis in this process is evidenced by; i) the increased accumulation of YP170 after interference with WAVE (WVE-1) complex components; ii) the genetic interactions of these latter genes with <italic>toca-1/2</italic>; iii) the biochemical link between TOCA-1/2 and ABI1, which is conserved also in mammals. The WAVE (WVE-1) complex may function in later endocytic steps of CME since, at least, in mammals it does not localize to Clathrin-coats at the plasma Membrane (Benesch et al., 2005). The precise relation of the WAVE (WVE-1) complex with CDC42/TOCA-1/2 is unclear at present. However, TOCA-2 appears dominant with respect to TOCA-1. TOCA1/2 may also directly associate to Dynamin (Itoh et al., 2005; Tsujita et al., 2006), whose pinching activity is critical to promote vesicle scission. Dynamin- and actin-dependent activities may work in concert with TOCA-1/2 to promote tubule scission. Other F-BAR containing proteins, such as Nostrin may add further layers of complexity to this network, which may coordinate membrane tubulation and curvature sensing with the activity (WASP/WSP-1) (Itoh et al., 2005; Tsujita et al., 2006). Green lines indicate potential genetic interactions; black line indicates genetic and/or biochemical interactions.</p>
