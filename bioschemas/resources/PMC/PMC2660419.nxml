      <abstract>
        <p>The Alzheimer disease (AD) amyloid protein precursor (APP) can bind the FE65 adaptor protein and this complex can regulate gene expression. We carried out yeast two-hybrid studies with a PTB domain of FE65, focusing on those genes that might be involved in nuclear signaling, and identified and validated Teashirt proteins as FE65 interacting proteins in neurons. Using reporter systems, we observed that FE65 could simultaneously recruit SET, a component of the inhibitor of acetyl transferase, and Teashirt, which in turn recruited histone deacetylases, to produce a powerful gene-silencing complex. We screened stable cell lines with a macroarray focusing on AD-related genes and identified <italic>CASP4</italic>, encoding caspase-4, as a target of this silencing complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed a direct interaction of FE65 and Teashirt3 with the promoter region of <italic>CASP4</italic>. Expression studies in postmortem samples demonstrated decreasing expression of Teashirt and increasing expression of caspase-4 with progressive cognitive decline. Importantly, there were significant increases in caspase-4 expression associated with even the earliest neuritic plaque changes in AD. We evaluated a case-control cohort and observed evidence for a genetic association between the Teashirt genes <italic>TSHZ1</italic> and <italic>TSHZ3</italic> and AD, with the <italic>TSHZ3</italic> SNP genotype correlating with expression of Teashirt3. The results were consistent with a model in which reduced expression of Teashirt3, mediated by genetic or other causes, increases caspase-4 expression, leading to progression of AD. Thus the cell biological, gene expression and genetic data support a role for Teashirt/caspase-4 in AD biology. As caspase-4 shows evidence of being a primate-specific gene, current models of AD and other neurodegenerative conditions may be incomplete because of the absence of this gene in the murine genome.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>AÎ², the major component of the amyloid fibrils found in AD patients, is a proteolytic product of APP <xref rid="pone.0005071-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. APP, which is mutated in some early-onset AD patients <xref rid="pone.0005071-Goate1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and overexpressed in others <xref rid="pone.0005071-Palmert1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, is a type I transmembrane protein and a member of a family of APP-like proteins, also including APLP1 and APLP2. These proteins are proteolytically processed in the extracellular and intracellular domains, including by the Î³-secretase protease complex, which leads to the generation of a cytoplasmic fragment (APP intracellular domain/AICD) that has been implicating in intracellular and nuclear signaling <xref rid="pone.0005071-Reinhard1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>FE65 is an adapter protein with a single WW domain and two phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains <xref rid="pone.0005071-Duilio1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, which binds the YENPTY sequence in the carboxy-terminus of APP through the second PTB (PTB2) of FE65 <xref rid="pone.0005071-Fiore1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Zambrano1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and which can modulate APP trafficking, and/or enhance the proteolytic processing of APP <xref rid="pone.0005071-Sabo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. FE65 is required for nuclear signaling following the formation of the AICD fragment <xref rid="pone.0005071-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been shown that the WW domain of FE65 is necessary and sufficient for FE65-dependent transcriptional activation of heterologous reporter genes <xref rid="pone.0005071-Duilio1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Cao2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Telese1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and that the interaction of APP and FE65 (via the PTB2 domain) at the peripheral membrane is crucial for the full assembly of a transcriptionally active complex <xref rid="pone.0005071-Cao2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Hass1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It is therefore of interest to define the role of PTB1 in nuclear signaling, as the proteins that bind to PTB1 might be crucial determinants of the native transcriptional activity of FE65. In this study, we screened for PTB1 binding proteins that might be involved in nuclear signaling and identified the transcriptional core repressor Teashirt as an interactor. We propose that FE65 can function as the core adapter molecule of multi-subunit transcriptional repressor by recruiting both histone deacetylases (via Teashirt) and SET, a component of inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT). This complex can in turn silence expression of the <italic>CASP4</italic> gene. Our genetic and expression studies support a role for Teashirt and caspase-4 in AD.</p>

        <title>Interaction of FE65 with Teashirt proteins</title>
        <p>We used the first phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB1) of FE65 to carry out comprehensive yeast two-hybrid screens in both mouse and human brain cDNA libraries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005071-t001">Table 1</xref>). Multiple interactors were identified from both screens, including previously identified FE65-interactors such as CP2 <xref rid="pone.0005071-Zambrano2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and calsyntenin <xref rid="pone.0005071-Araki1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Given our interest in nuclear signaling, we selected putative nuclear proteins including High mobility group 20A (HMG20A), Zinc finger protein 189 (ZNF189), PHD finger protein 1 (PHF1), Teashirt3, and DEAD box 1 (DDX1), and further screened them by co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown assays. As we found that Teashirt3 was positive in both assays (see below), we focused on this protein in further studies. Note that we had identified an interacting clone coding for Teashirt3 from the mouse library, and two Teashirt3 clones from the human library.</p>

        <p>To confirm the FE65-Teashirt3 interaction in mammalian cells, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation of myc-tagged Teashirt3 and FE65 from transiently transfected human neuroglioma (H4) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Anti-myc antibody, but not control mouse IgG, immunoprecipitated FE65 from lysates expressing both proteins, as detected by anti-FE65 antibody. The COOH-terminal 200 amino acid region of Teashirt3 was identified in the yeast two-hybrid screens. This fragment contains the homeo-box region at the amino-terminus, followed by two zinc finger motifs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Drosophila,</italic> which carries only a single gene encoding Teashirt, it has been reported that the mouse genome contains three structurally related family members, identified as Teashirt1, 2, and 3 <xref rid="pone.0005071-Caubit1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Caubit2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, all of which include a homeo-box region. We therefore tested if Teashirt1 and Teashirt2 are also able to bind the PTB1 domain of FE65, making use of a GST-pulldown with myc-tagged Teashirt proteins expressed in H4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). All Teashirt proteins interacted with GST-PTB1 but not GST alone, indicating that FE65 can interact with all Teashirt proteins through PTB1.</p>

        <p>To determine which region is responsible for interacting with FE65, deletion constructs of Teashirt3 were prepared and GST-pulldown assays were performed with the deletion constructs and with full-length Teashirt3. Only a construct lacking the homeo-box region failed to interact with GST-PTB1, demonstrating that the interaction with PTB1 domain of FE65 takes place within the homeo-box region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). For certain PTB interactions, the PTB recognize a consensus NPXY motif, while for other interaction, there is no NPXY motif <xref rid="pone.0005071-FormanKay1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Ebinu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Teashirt3 does not contain a canonical NPXY motif within the homeo-box region but there is NVKY sequence. Mutating this sequence to NATA failed to abolish the interaction with FE65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) indicating that the interaction between Teashirt3 and FE65 is non-canonical. Other PTB1 domain interactors of FE65 that have been reported to date, such as Tip60, CP2, and calsyntenin, do not contain any canonical motif. Finally, to determine the degree to which FE65 and Teashirt3 colocalize in mammalian cells, we expressed FE65 and/or Teashirt3 in H4 cells and observed that FE65 and myc-tagged Teashirt3 strongly co-localized in the nuclei of H4 cells (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Interaction of endogenous FE65 and Teashirt proteins in native systems</title>
        <p>As the validation studies supported a potential physiological interaction between Teashirt3 and FE65, we next developed a series of mouse monoclonal antibodies against Teashirt (identified by their clone identifiers as KD74, VR46 and WR1) and used them to confirm an interaction of endogenous Teashirt proteins and FE65. We first demonstrated that FE65 and Teashirt co-immunoprecipitate from primary neuronal cultures from E18 rat cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The co-precipitation of these proteins indicates that they are likely to be physically associated in intact cells. We next carried out immunocytochemistry in primary neuronal cultures. When rat cortical neurons maintained for 3.5 div were stained with a Teashirt monoclonal antibody, Teashirt was localized to the cell body as well as to the tips of extending processes, especially in axonal growth cones. When these neuronal cultures were co-immunostained for Teashirt and FE65, both proteins co-localized in growth cones as well as cell bodies, indicating that a binary complex can be formed within these compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The three monoclonal antibodies showed similar staining of neuronal cultures and we saw a loss of staining in the presence of immunogen, indicating that the staining we observed arose from Teashirt, and not from other proteins or non-specific interactions (data not shown).</p>

When FE65 was introduced with either APP-GAL4 or C50-GAL4, there was a 25â150-fold increase in transcriptional activity, but the further introduction of Teashirt3 into the system resulted in a profound down-regulation of the AICD/FE65-mediated up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). There was no detectable effect of Teashirt3 alone in this system, in the absence of FE65. Immunoblot analysis of lysates showed that expression levels of transfected proteins were not significantly different under different conditions, when averaged over all experiments, indicating that the effect of repression was not due to the difference of expression (representative immunoblots are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>Recent studies have suggested that neither Î³-secretase cleavage nor nuclear translocation of AICD may be necessary for the transduction of FE65-dependent transactivation in certain systems <xref rid="pone.0005071-Cao2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Hass1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. To test if Teashirt3 also functions in the absence of AICD or in the absence of an interaction between FE65 and APP, we constructed a fusion protein consisting of Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to FE65. When this reporter system was used, Teashirt3 also inhibited the transactivation by Gal4-FE65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
        <p>It has recently been shown that the WW domain of FE65 can interact with SET, one of the main components of inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) <xref rid="pone.0005071-Telese1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

The addition of either SET or Teashirt3 led to a significant reduction in transactivation. Moreover, the co-expression of both SET and Teashirt3 led to further, significant reduction of transactivation. The effect of repression was not due to the difference of expression, since immunoblot analysis of lysates showed that expression levels of transfected were comparable in different conditions. These data indicated that FE65 can form a transcriptional repressor complex consisting of SET and Teashirt proteins.</p>

        <title>A role for histone deacetylation in Teashirt-mediated transcriptional repression</title>
        <p>As transcriptional repression often involves the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), we first tested if human Teashirt3 can be associated with HDAC activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. When anti-myc antibody immunoprecipitates from H4 cells transfected with Teashirt3 constructs were analyzed for HDAC activity, HDAC activity was recovered in the precipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g005">Fig. 5A</xref> for a schematic representation of the constructs used). Constructs containing the amino-terminus of Teashirt3 (i.e., full-length Teashirt3, and the N-term and ZF3 fragments) showed significantly higher HDAC activity, whereas those without the amino-terminus showed background level of activity. [The differences observed in this assay in the level of HDAC activities associated with full-length, N-term, and ZF3 constructs were likely due to the difference in the level of expression in H4 cells, as immunoblot analysis of these constructs with anti-myc antibody showed that the associated HDAC activities of constructs correlated well with the difference in expression among the constructs (data not shown).] These data show that human Teashirt3 can associate with HDAC activity through its amino-terminus <italic>in vitro,</italic> providing a mechanism whereby Teashirt3 is able to function as a transcriptional repressor.</p>

        <p>We next sought to identify the HDACs that associated with the amino-terminus of human Teashirt3. In mammals, there are 18 HDACs identified to date and they are assigned into three classes based on the structural similarity to yeast homologues <xref rid="pone.0005071-Dokmanovic1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Class I HDACs are related to yeast Rpd3 and consist of HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8, while class II HDACs are related to yeast Hda and consist of HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. Class III HDACs require NAD+ as a cofactor and include Sirt1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We first analyzed the same immunoprecipitates used in the HDAC assay by immunoblot with available anti-HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 or HDAC4 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Full-length human Teashirt3 was immunoprecipitated with endogenous HDAC1 and 2 but not HDAC4, and we found that HDAC3 was not expressed in H4 cells. Consistent with the HDAC activity data, those constructs that precipitated together with endogenous HDAC1 and 2 all contained the amino-terminal domain of Teashirt3, indicating that this region mediates the interaction between Teashirt3 and HDAC. To exclude the possibility that additional proteins were necessary for the interaction between Teashirt3 and HDAC1, recombinant HDAC1 and the amino-terminus of Teashirt3 were expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> and a direct interaction was confirmed by co-precipitation (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To see if FE65 and Teashirt3 form a trimeric complex with endogenous HDAC1, myc-Teashirt3 and FLAG-FE65 were co-nucleofected into H4 cells. FLAG-FE65 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using rabbit antibodies to the FLAG epitope and the precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-myc, anti-HDAC1, and anti-FLAG antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Endogenous HDAC1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FE65 when both FE65 and Teashirt3 were co-transfected (lane 4), but not when Teashirt3 or FE65 was omitted (lane 5 and 6), confirming that the association of HDAC1 with FE65 is dependent on, and mediated, by Teashirt3.</p>
        <p>If the binding of Teashirt3 to FE65 recruits HDAC activity to the complex and mediates transcriptional repression, it would be expected that inhibition of HDAC activity would lead to an inhibition of the Teashirt3-mediated repression of transcription. To test if the transcriptional repression by Teashirt3 in reporter assays is in fact mediated by the action of HDACs, the reporter assay using AICD-GAL4 and FE65 was performed with increasing concentration of the HDAC inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). The inhibition of luciferase expression observed in the presence of Teashirt3 decreased with increasing concentration of the inhibitor, confirming that the repressing action of Teashirt3 in the AICD-GAL4 reporter assay was mediated, at least in part, by recruiting Class I and Class II HDACs. As FE65 can simultaneously bind SET and, through Teashirt3, HDACs, this would establish a strongly transcriptionally repressed state of nucleosomes by deacetylating histone amino-terminal tails (through HDAC) and preventing them from being reacetylated (through SET inhibition of histone acetyltransferase).</p>

        <title>The CASP4 gene as a target of the FE65/Teashirt complex</title>
        <p>To identify target genes regulated by the FE65/Teashirt3 complex, lines of H4 cells stably expressing GFP or both FE65 and Teashirt3 were established and analyzed using the Oligo GEArray Human Alzheimer's Disease Microarray, looking for genes that showed reduced expression when both FE65 and Teashirt3 were expressed. Expression from one gene, <italic>CASP4</italic>, which codes for the inflammatory caspase-4, was found to be significantly down-regulated in cells expressing FE65 and Teashirt3, compared to the control cell lines. TaqMan-based quantitative PCR, using two probes directed at caspase-4 as well as probes for control genes, was performed to confirm the GEArray results, demonstrating that the double transfected clones (lines 12 and 17) showed prominent reduction of caspase-4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>

<italic>A,</italic> Expression of caspase-4 in stable cell lines. Extracts from indicated cell lines were subjected to qPCR followed by normalization of caspase-4 expression to that of control genes using qBase (version 1.3.5). Three independent experiments were then each normalized to the expression levels of clone 1 (far left) and means and SEM determined. Two distinct probes [identified here as caspase4 (black bars) and caspase4 (white bars)] were used for caspase-4 gene expression. Significant differences in expression were observed for both probes when comparing clones expressing both Teashirt3 and FE65 (clones 12 and 17), as compared to GFP-expressing clones (clones 1â5 and 14). Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA (P&lt;0.0005) followed by Dunnett's T3 post-hoc testing. (*, P&lt;0.05; **, P&lt;0.01). <italic>B,</italic> Effects of siRNA on caspase-4 expression in stable cell lines. H4 cells stably expressing either GFP (clone 1) or FE65 and Teashirt3 (clone 12) were transfected with siRNA against indicated exogenous proteins. Normalized levels of caspase-4 were quantified as in A, and the fold inhibition of caspase-4 (expressed as the ratio of normalized expression in clone 12 to that in clone 1) in each condition determined. Immunoblot analysis is shown out for a representative experiment. Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA (P&lt;0.001) followed by Bonferroni post-hoc testing. ***, P&lt;0.001. <italic>C,</italic> Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with FE65 and Teashirt3. Sonicated chromatin from clone 12 was used for ChIP was subjected to immunoprecipitation with either control mouse IgG, 3H6 anti-FE65, or anti-myc antibodies, and the washed precipitates (as well as an aliquot of the original lysate, indicated as Input) were used for PCR. The scheme below indicates the location of amplified regions in relation to the major transcription start site (1), indicated by an arrow and initiation codon (73) of the <italic>CASP4</italic> gene. Another arrow at â839 position indicates an alternative transcriptional start site.</p>

        <p>To further confirm that the reduction of caspase-4 mRNA was mediated by overexpression of FE65 and Teashirt3, both clone 1, expressing GFP, and the double transfected clone 12 were transiently transfected with siRNA against the exogenous FE65 and/or Teashirt3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Relative caspase-4 expression (expressed as the ratio of caspase-4 expression in clone 12 relative to expression in clone 1) was significantly increased when siRNA for either FE65 or Teashirt3 were introduced into clone 12, and the repression was almost completely abolished when both siRNAs were simultaneously introduced, confirming that the reduced expression of caspase-4 observed upon overexpression of FE65 and Teashirt3 was mediated by these proteins. Knock-down of each siRNA targets was confirmed by immunoblot of the cell lysates prepared from the same transfections.</p>
        <p>To confirm that there is an association between FE65/Teashirt3 and the <italic>CASP4</italic> gene promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed in clone 12 of the doubly transfected H4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Immunoprecipitates with anti-FE65 (3H6), anti-myc, or control mouse IgG were analyzed with four sets of primers designed to amplify the promoter region surrounding <italic>CASP4</italic> transcriptional start site(s) (see scheme). In both the anti-FE65 and anti-myc immunoprecipitates, amplification of a region proximal to the transcriptional start site was observed, indicating that both FE65 and Teashirt3 associated with chromatin near the start site. In the anti-FE65 immunoprecipitates, amplification of a region just upstream of the primary start site was also observed, indicating that conformation of the DNA-protein complex was such that FE65 was also closely associated with this region.</p>

<italic>A,</italic> Altered expression of FE65, caspase-4 and Teashirt gene products in AD. Expression of the indicated genes in BA28/36 was assessed by qPCR, comparing expression in controls with that in subjects with probable or definite AD. All comparisons between cases and controls were significant (P&lt;â=â0.003) (see text for a full description of statistical analyses). <italic>B,</italic> Altered expression of FE65, caspase-4 and Teashirt gene products as a function of CDR score. Expression of the indicated genes in BA28/36 was assessed by qPCR, comparing expression in individuals with differing degrees of cognitive impairment as assessed by CDR. For simplicity, results for Teashirt1 and Teashirt2, which paralleled the results for Teashirt3 and are summarized in the text, have been omitted from the figure. <italic>C,</italic> Altered gene expression of FE65, caspases-4 and Teashirt gene products as a function of plaque density. Expression of the indicated genes in BA28/36 was assessed by qPCR, comparing expression in individuals with differing degrees of neocortical neuritic plaque density. For simplicity, results for Teashirt1 and Teashirt2, which paralleled the results for Teashirt3 and are summarized in the text, have been omitted from the figure. <italic>D,</italic> Residuals from linear regressions of caspase-4, FE65, Teashirt1, Teashirt2, and Teashirt3 on APOE4, sex, PMI, and pH were calculated and the associations of residuals between caspase-4 and FE65 or Teashirt genes were plotted, because Pearson correlations of the residuals are equal to partial correlations of the original values. Note that to better visually represent the data, three data points falling outside the graphed area (at positions 1.20, 2.44 and 1.88, â0.46 in left panel and 0.47, 2.44 in right panel), were omitted from the figure but included in the analyses. <italic>E,</italic> To determine whether the significant correlations in C were driven by disease the analyses were re-done in controls (left panels) and in individuals with probable or definite AD (right panels). Note again that to better visually represent the data, data points (at positions 1.89, â0.35 in the upper left panel, 1.30, 2.15 in the upper right panel, as well as 0.74, 2.15 and 1.86, â0.34) in lower right panel, were omitted from the figures but included in the analyses.</p>

        <p>When gene expression was studied as a function of the degree of cognitive impairment (as measured by CDR), significant difference were seen for FE65 and the Teashirt genes, particularly Teashirt3 (FE65: F<sub>6, 89</sub>â=â3.160, pâ=â0.007; Teashirt1: F<sub>6, 89</sub>â=â2.613, pâ=â0.022; Teashirt2: F<sub>6, 89</sub>â=â2.660, pâ=â0.0020; Teashirt3: F<sub>6, 89</sub>â=â3.262, pâ=â0.006). Furthermore, when linear regression analyses were performed, significantly negative linear correlations were observed with increasing CDR, indicating reduced expression of these genes with the progression of dementia (FE65: F<sub>1, 94</sub>â=â17.566, p&lt;0.0005, bâ=ââ0.128, râ=ââ0.397; Teashirt1: F<sub>1, 94</sub>â=â10.626, pâ=â0.002, bâ=ââ0.094, râ=ââ0.319; Teashirt2: F<sub>1, 94</sub>â=â11.399, pâ=â0.001, bâ=ââ0.092, râ=ââ0.329; Teashirt3: F<sub>1, 94</sub>â=â13.310, p&lt;0.0005, bâ=ââ0.124, râ=ââ0.352) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). It was notable that p-value/correlation coefficient for FE65 and Teashirt3 were especially robust compared to Teashirt1 and Teashirt2. There was also a significantly positive linear correlation for caspase-4 expression (F<sub>1, 94</sub>â=â6.192, pâ=â0.015, bâ=â0.067, râ=â0.249) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), and again this correlation remained significant after controlling for age of death (F<sub>1, 93</sub>â=â5.070, pâ=â0.027, bâ=â0.060, râ=â0.227).</p>
        <p>When gene expression was studied as a function of plaque density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>), significant differences were observed for Teashirt2, Teashirt3 and caspase-4 (FE65: F<sub>3, 98</sub>â=â2.10, pâ=â0.105; Teashirt1: F<sub>3, 98</sub>â=â2.534, pâ=â0.062; Teashirt2: F<sub>3, 98</sub>â=â5.952, pâ=â0.001; Teashirt3: F<sub>3, 98</sub>â=â7.472, p&lt;0.0005; caspase-4: F<sub>3, 98</sub>â=â4.102, p&lt;0.009). It was particularly striking to observe that caspase-4 expression significantly increased when going from a plaque density score of 0, which corresponds to no plaques observed in the 5 cortical regions, to 1, which corresponds to only 1â6 neuritic plaques per mm<sup>2</sup>. After this transition, caspase-4 expression remains elevated as neuritic plaque counts increase to 7â12 (plaque group 2) or &gt;12 (plaque group 3) plaques per mm<sup>2</sup>.

        <title>Relationship between FE65/Teashirt expression and caspase-4 expression</title>
        <p>To explore the relationship between FE65 and Teashirt expression with caspase-4 expression stepwise linear regression analyses were performed. Expression of FE65 and Teashirt3 showed significant negative partial correlation with caspase-4 expression (râ=ââ0.229, pâ=â0.023 and râ=ââ0.239, pâ=â0.018, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>), whereas Teashirt1 and Teashirt2 showed non-significant correlation (râ=ââ0.135, pâ=â0.184, and râ=ââ0.135, pâ=â0.185, respectively). In order to determine whether the correlations between FE65 or Teashirt3 expression and caspase-4 expression were driven by disease per se, we also carried out exploratory analyses and separately analyzed the correlations for controls and for probable or definite AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>). In these subgroups, there appeared to be better inverse correlation between caspase-4 and FE65 or Teashirt3 levels in controls than in AD, although the smaller numbers of controls reduced the power to identify significant correlations in that group (correlations between caspase-4 and FE65 or Teashirt3 in the control group were râ=ââ0.326, pâ=â0.064 and râ=ââ0.278, pâ=â0.117, whereas in the AD group, these values were râ=ââ0.049, pâ=â0.707 and râ=ââ0.084, pâ=â0.522). An inverse correlation in the control samples would indicate that the relationship is not simply a result of disease progression with associated cellular changes. In AD, this relationship breaks down indicating that other factors associated with disease progression (including perhaps cellular changes) have important effects on the expression of caspase-4.</p>
        <p>A significant interaction between FE65 and Teashirt1 gene expression was observed for the prediction of caspase-4 expression (F<sub>1,94</sub>â=â8.603, pâ=â0.004). To better understand this interaction, we dichotomized the FE65 and Teashirt1 distributions, and examined the mean expression of caspase-4 in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). We noted expression of caspase-4 were high when levels of FE65 and Teashirt1 were low, but in the presence of high levels of Teashirt1, levels of caspase-4 were essentially unchanged with differing levels of FE65. Similar trends were evident when looking at FE65 and either Teashirt2 or Teashirt3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

It was of great interest to note that for both SNPs, the AD risk allele was associated with decreased Teashirt3 expression, which, based on our cell biological and postmortem studies, we would predict would lead to increased expression of caspase-4.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have identified Teashirt transcription factors as partners for PTB1 of FE65 and demonstrated that Teashirt3 can repress AICD/FE65 mediated transactivation, consistent with prior evidence that FE65 can function as a transcriptional repressor in certain settings <xref rid="pone.0005071-Bruni1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Teashirt has been shown to be a transcriptional activator of <italic>wing</italic> and <italic>rhomboid</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0005071-Gallet1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Gallet2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, or a transcriptional repressor of homeo-box transcription factor target genes, such as <italic>modifier of variegation</italic> through Scr <xref rid="pone.0005071-Alexandre1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-TaghliLamallem1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and wingless target genes, such as <italic>labial</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0005071-Alexandre1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and <italic>ultrabithorax</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0005071-Waltzer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, none of which are represented in the human or mouse genomes. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Teashirt-mediated repression revealed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Teashirt recruits the transcriptional corepressor CtBP via a PLDLS motif at the amino-terminus <xref rid="pone.0005071-Waltzer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The mouse genome contains three Teashirt genes, Teashirt1, Teashirt2, and Teashirt3, which can rescue <italic>Drosophila tsh</italic> null phenotype, suggesting functional redundancy <xref rid="pone.0005071-Manfroid1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Note, however, that the interaction of mouse Teashirt1 with CtBP1 does not account for all the observed transcriptional repression <xref rid="pone.0005071-Manfroid1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, as a significant basal repression activity was observed even after deletion of the CtBP interaction motif, indicating that other factors, aside from CtBP1, contribute to Teashirt-mediated repression in that system. We found that human Teashirt3 associates with HDAC activity and directly interacts with HDACs through its amino-terminus, indicating an additional mechanism for Teashirt-mediated transcriptional repression. It is interesting to note that recent studies have shown that Tip60 can also function as an FE65-dependent repressor <xref rid="pone.0005071-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and that Tip60 can form complexes with HDAC proteins <xref rid="pone.0005071-Gaughan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0005071-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, indicating that Tip60 also uses similar mechanisms to those we postulate for Teashirt. The relationship between FE65 and Tip60 is interesting in the context of the FE65-Teashirt interaction as both bind PTB1. It is possible that Tip60 and Teashirt compete for FE65 binding, hence regulating transcription. It may be that the choice of partners with which FE65 interacts, either Tip60 or Teashirt, determines the transcriptional role of FE65. In this model, for example, a FE65/Tip60 complex might typically function as a transcriptional activator, while a FE65/Teashirt complex might function as a transcriptional repressor. Our finding that Teashirt proteins localized not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm in neurons, when considered with the presence of nuclear localization signals in all vertebrate members of the Teashirt family (and two nuclear export signals in Teashirt1) raise the possibility that Teashirt proteins distribute between the two compartments in a regulated manner and/or shuttle between them.</p>
      <p>We observed that FE65 and Teashirt3 together repress the transcription of <italic>CASP4</italic> gene via a direct interaction as these proteins associate with the <italic>CASP4</italic> gene at the transcriptional start site. In our attempt to obtain further <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence of caspase-4 down-regulation mediated by an FE65/Teashirt complex, we encountered the difficulty that the <italic>CASP4</italic> gene was not represented in the mouse genome (discussed further below), preventing us from utilizing mouse models of AD as well as knockout mice.</p>
      <p>The entorhinal cortex (Brodmann area 28/36) is critically involved in memory <xref rid="pone.0005071-Eichenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and subjected to disruption in prodromal stages of AD or mild cognitive impairment <xref rid="pone.0005071-Kordower1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Delacourte1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The expression of FE65 and Teashirt family genes were down-regulated in AD, while that of caspase-4 was up-regulated, and we observed negative correlations of gene expression when comparing caspase-4 expression with that of FE65 and Teashirt3. There are many reasons why gene expression would change over the course of AD including loss or gain of specific cell types or functional changes in specific cells. It has been previously shown that at least one other inflammatory caspase (caspase-1), as well as additional caspases, shows increased expression over the course of the disease <xref rid="pone.0005071-Pompl1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and much or all of this is likely due to inflammatory processes not directly related to FE65/Teashirt. Of note, however, is that when we examined the correlation of gene expression, comparing caspase-4 expression with that of FE65 and Teashirt, just in the control individuals, we observed evidence for correlations in the controls, and not in individuals with AD, indicating that the cellular change associated with advancing AD are not the exclusive cause for these correlations. It was also interesting to note that caspase-4 expression increased most dramatically with the presence of even just a few neuritic plaques.</p>
      <p>A causal role for Teashirt in AD is supported by our genetic association studies. Although genetic association studies in complex disease require replication before they can be accepted, our studies indicate that SNPs in <italic>TSHZ1</italic> and <italic>TSHZ3</italic> show genetic association with AD. Moreover, our studies in postmortem samples are consistent with an effect of <italic>TSHZ3</italic> SNPs on gene expression. More interestingly, we observed that the <italic>TSHZ3</italic> risk alleles are associated with reduced Teashirt3. This suggests a model where reduced expression of Teashirt3 leads to increased expression of caspase-4, which can then contribute to AD risk and pathology. The increase in caspase-4 expression we observed at the earliest stages of neuritic pathology in AD, may contribute to further pathological process in AD progression.</p>
      <p>Caspase-4 belongs to a family of inflammatory caspases consisting of caspases-1,-4, -5, -11, and -12 <xref rid="pone.0005071-Martinon1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The mouse genome includes caspase-1, -11, and -12, whereas the human and chimp genomes contain caspase-1, -4, -5, and -12, with caspase-12 typically inactivated in the human genome. Sequence similarity suggests that human caspase-4 and -5 seem to have evolved from gene duplication of a caspase-11-like ancestral gene and there is evidence from studies with LPS that regulation of gene expression of murine caspase-11 parallels that of human caspase-5 <xref rid="pone.0005071-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, with no murine correlate of caspase-4. A primary function of the inflammatory caspase family is the regulation of the inflammatory response. Studies using knock-out mice lacking inflammatory caspases-1, -11, and -12 have shown that these mice were resistant to mouse models of neurodegenerative disease, such as ischemia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington disease, and Parkinson disease <xref rid="pone.0005071-Friedlander1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0005071-Ona1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. This resistance to neuronal cell death is likely due to the lack of inflammatory responses that can have deleterious effects to neurons. Current murine models of AD have surprisingly little neuronal death or synaptic loss, when compared to AD. It is very intriguing to consider whether the absence of a gene whose expression is regulated like caspase-4 in rodents might be partially responsible, something that could be addressed by introducing the human <italic>CASP4</italic> promoter and gene into the murine genome.</p>
      <p>As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005071-g010">Figure 10</xref>, we have identified Teashirt proteins as FE65-interacting proteins. We have further observed that Teashirt can recruit HDAC, and with FE65 can form a repressor complex that may include SET. Thus, several repressor complexes involving FE65 might form (FE65/Teashirt/HDAC, FE65/SET, or possibly FE65/Teashirt/HDAC/SET), depending on expression levels of these proteins, subcellular compartmentalization, and possibly steric considerations. Our studies indicate that FE65 and/or its associated proteins can possess dual functions in transcriptional regulation: trans-activation by interacting with the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 as previously described <xref rid="pone.0005071-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Cao2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005071-Hass1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and repression by interacting with Tip60 under certain circumstances or by interacting with Teashirt/HDAC and/or SET. The Teashirt family shows altered expression in AD and we have evidence for genetic association for some of these genes with AD. These findings, while intriguing, will benefit from replication in independent cohorts. <italic>CASP4</italic> appears to be one target for the repressor complex centering on FE65. In is interesting to speculate that APP and FE65 may regulate the levels of key inflammatory cascades and to consider that altering the levels or processing of APP might contribute to neuroinflammation and/or neuronal death in neurodegenerative conditions, including AD. As the APP-FE65-Teashirt-caspase-4 pathway not readily studied in current mouse models, its role in neuroinflammation and/or neurodegeneration may be under-recognized.</p>

        <p>Chemically competent BL21(DE3)pLysS <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were transformed with the pGEX2T-hTeashirt3-ZF12 or pET28a-HDAC1 vectors using the manufacturer's protocol, and plated on LB plates with appropriate antibiotics. A single colony was inoculated in 10 ml of LB medium with antibiotics, grown overnight and seeded into 500 ml of LB medium. The bacterial cultures were grown to an optical density of 0.6 and expression of recombinant proteins were induced by the addition of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM for 4 hours at 37C. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were harvested by centrifuging bacteria at 5,000 g for 15 minutes and the resultant pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1Ã phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/1% tritonX-100/Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were lysed in a French press (SIM AMINCO Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) and centrifuged at 10,000g for 15 minutes to precipitate the debris. Supernatants were incubated with Glutathione SepharoseTM 4B (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) on a rotator for 4 hours at 4C and washed 3 times with wash buffer containing PBS/protease inhibitor cocktail.</p>

The 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody against the myc epitope tag was obtained from the Mount Sinai Hybridoma Facility. The 2E10 mouse monoclonal antibody against HDAC1 and the 3F3 antibody against HDAC2 were obtained from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against HDAC4 (#2072) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Monoclonal Teashirt antibodies were generated by using GST fused to amino acids 184â324 of human Teashirt3 as the antigen. The recombinant protein was expressed in the BL21(DE3)pLysS strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified as described above. Injection of the antigen into mice, generation of hybridomas, clone screening, and clone isolation were performed in the Mount Sinai Hybridoma Shared Research Facility.</p>

        <p>For the quantitative analyses of gene expressions in post-mortem samples (FE65, caspase-4, Teashirt1, Teashirt2, and Teashirt3), analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed to compare gene expression for different diagnoses, clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) levels, plaque density, and Braak stages. The covariates were post-mortem interval (PMI), sex, APOE4 genotype, and sample pH. However, a covariate was omitted from an analysis if there was significant heterogeneity of the groups' regression coefficients. The figures display the adjusted estimates of the mean and standard error of the mean from ANCOVA. For CDR and Braak stage analyses, stepwise regression was used to test linear association of gene expression, controlling for the same covariates as in ANCOVA. Stepwise linear regression was used to assess the partial correlations of FE65, Teashirt1, Teashirt2, and Teashirt3 gene expression with caspase-4 expression, controlling for APOE4 genotype, sex, sample pH, and PMI. A subsequent step evaluated the interactions of FE65 with Teashirt1, Teashirt2, and Teashirt3 gene expression for predicting caspase-4 expression.</p>

This method tests for a linear trend in the number of alleles at a single locus. That is, two copies of an allele have more of an effect than one copy, which in turn has more of an effect than no copies. The effect is in the same direction for each genotype. This test is equivalent to the score statistic from a logistic regression model with no covariates. Gene-wide multiple testing correction was applied with a false-discovery rate, using the beta-uniform distribution and SNPs with q-values less than a 0.20 false discovery rate were declared significant.</p>
