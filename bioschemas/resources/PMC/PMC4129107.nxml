          <title>Background</title>
          <p>BRAT1 (BRCA1-associated ATM activator 1) interacts with both BRCA1, ATM and DNA-PKcs, and has been implicated in DNA damage responses. However, based on our previous results, it has been shown that BRAT1 may be involved in cell growth and apoptosis, besides DNA damage responses, implying that there are undiscovered functions for BRAT1.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Using RNA interference against human BRAT1, we generated stable BRAT1 knockdown cancer cell lines of U2OS, Hela, and MDA-MA-231. We tested cell growth properties and <italic>in vitro</italic>/<italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenic potentials of BRAT1 knockdown cells compared to control cells. To test if loss of BRAT1 induces metabolic abnormalities, we examined the rate of glycolysis, ATP production, and PDH activity in both BRAT1 knockdown and control cells. The role of BRAT1 in growth signaling was determined by the activation of Akt/Erk, and SC79, Akt activator was used for validation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>By taking advantage of BRAT1 knockdown cancer cell lines, we found that loss of BRAT1 expression significantly decreases cell proliferation and tumorigenecity both in vitro and in vivo. Cell migration was also remarkably lowered when BRAT1 was depleted. Interestingly, glucose uptake and production of mitochondrial ROS (reactive oxygen species) are highly increased in BRAT1 knockdown HeLa cells. Furthermore, both basal and induced activity of Akt and Erk kinases were suppressed in these cells, implicating abnormality in signaling cascades for cellular growth. Consequently, treatment of BRAT1 knockdown cells with Akt activator can improve their proliferation and reduces mitochondrial ROS concentration.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>These findings suggest novel roles of BRAT1 in cell proliferation and mitochondrial functions.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>BRAT1 (BRCA1-associated ATM activator-1) was isolated as BRCA1 binding protein, interacting with the BRCT domain of BRCA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Biochemical analysis indicated that pathogenic forms of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 protein (e.g. M1775R) do not bind to BRAT1, suggesting BRCA1/BRAT1 interaction is important for BRCA1âs tumor-suppressive functions. Mechanisms of sensing and repairing DNA lesions are well conserved among the species, and ATM, ATR and DNA-PK are essential for this mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Subsequent studies have shown that BRAT1 also binds to ATM and DNA-PKs, implicating the broad role of BRAT1 in DNA repair as well as in DNA damage response in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Previous studies have also illustrated BRAT1 acts as a regulator of cell growth and apoptosis. When BRAT1 was knocked down in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human osteosarcoma cell (U2OS), a constitutive level of apoptosis was increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Interestingly, these studies have shown that ionizing radiation (IR) does not further induce apoptosis of these BRAT1 knockdown cells.</p>
      <p>Recent genetic mapping and exome sequencing analysis identified that insertion mutations in the BRAT1 coding exon are pathogenic and cause lethal neonatal rigidity and multifocal seizure syndrome (RMFSL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This disease is a lethal, neonatal, neurologic disorder characterized by episodic jerking, lack of psychomotor development, axial and limb rigidity, frequent multifocal seizures, and dysautonomia. Infants show poorly responsive focal jerks of the tongue, face and arms in a nearly continuous sequence throughout life. These results indicate the clinical relevance of BRAT1 pathways.</p>
      <p>Mitochondria are critical organelles with important roles in cellular energy metabolism, which produces ATP via tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Also, mitochondria plays a key role in program cell death (apoptosis) as major site, where pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins interact and activates, so-called, mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Mitochondrial failure by chemical or under disease condition induces increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential loss, leading to sequential apoptotic pathways, such as release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent studies suggested that ROS generation and inhibition in mitochondrial functions are critical steps in chemical or knockdown-induced apoptosis of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In contrast, since Warburg discovered metabolic alterations in cancer cells (Warburg effect, the increase in aerobic glycolysis and the dependency on glycolytic pathway for ATP generation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], a mitochondrial malfunction in respiration systems, due to mitochondrial DNA mutations/deletions, has been known as one of typical phenotypes in tumor tissues and cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>Recently, our previous studies showed the potential roles of BRAT1 not only in DNA damage responses, but also cell growth and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In current study, we found that BRAT1 is involved in cellular growth properties including cell proliferation and tumor growth, and required for mitochondrial homeostasis, describing new roles of BRAT1 in cell growth and metabolism, and providing novel strategies for cancer treatment.</p>

        <title>BRAT1 expression is required for optimal proliferation and viability</title>
        <p>To detail the role of BRAT1 in cell proliferation, BRAT1 expression was stably knocked down in two different human cancer cells, U2OS (human osteosarcoma) cell line and HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cell line, using BRAT1-targeted shRNA plasmids. Levels of BRAT1 were determined by immunoblot analysis. Sh2, Sh16 clones for U2OS cells and Sh3, Sh8 for HeLa cells showed much lowered expression of BRAT1 among the stable clones isolated and they were further studied for functional analysis of the protein (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>
<bold>BRAT1 expression is required for optimal proliferation and viability. (A)</bold> NC (nonspecific shRNA) and Sh (selected BRAT1 knockdown cells) were selected and cloned from U2OS and HeLa parental cells after transfection with 4 different shRNA against BRAT1 mRNA. The expression of BRAT1 was confirmed by immunoblot (inserts). Actin protein was used as internal control. The number of live cells (trypan blue negative) was directly counted at indicated days. <bold>(B)</bold> 4 different BRAT1 knockdown HeLa cells (sh3, sh8, sh15, and sh17) were cultured for 3 days (upper panel) and indicated days (bottom panel), then cell proliferation was measured using the MTT assay. <bold>(C)</bold> Both control and knockdown U2OS cells were treated with NCS (1 Î¼g/ml) or hydroxyurea (HU, 5 Î¼M), then cultured for 24 h. Cells were fixed and stained with propidium iodide (PI). DNA profile was analyzed by a flow cytometry. <bold>(D)</bold> Both control and BRAT1 knockdown cells were cultured for indicated times without changing media, and then subjected to apoptosis analysis using AnnexinV/PI double stain. Apoptosis and necrosis were expressed by percentage from total cells in dot plot graphs.

        <p>First, we studied the effect of BRAT1 silencing on cell growth by measuring cell number (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) and the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a yellow tetrazole) assay (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). These experiments show that BRAT1 knockdown in both U2OS and HeLa cell lines results in extensive growth retardation. Next, we tested cell cycle profile by DNA staining with propidium iodide (PI), followed by flow cytometry analysis. We found that BRAT1 knockdown U2OS cells showed lower S-phase population (15.6âÂ±â2.7% in U2OS Sh2 and 16.2âÂ±â2.3% in U2OS Sh16) than control cells (30.2âÂ±â0.3%) (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). When treated with neocarzinostatin (NCS, radio-mimetic chemical, 1 Î¼g/ml), accumulation in G2/M-phases was observed in control U2OS cells (59.3âÂ±â5.9%), however this NCS-induced G2/M-arrest was abrogated in U2OS Sh2 and Sh16 cells (33.27âÂ±â0.5 and 42.9âÂ±â2.2% respectively), indicating that BRAT1 is involved in G2/M checkpoint under conditions of DNA damage as shown in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Interestingly, U2OS Sh2 and Sh16 cells showed G1 arrest (10.3âÂ±â2.8 and 6.1âÂ±â1.0%, respectively) to the similar degree with that of control U2OS cells (7.8âÂ±â1.6%), when treated with hydroxyurea (Hu, 5 Î¼M), suggesting that BRAT1 is not essential for HU-induced G1 checkpoint.</p>
        <p>We next studied whether decrease in BRAT1 expression causes apoptosis. HeLa Sh3 cells were maintained without changing media and apoptosis was determined by Annexin V staining, followed by FACS analysis. We found that HeLa Sh3 cells showed increase in apoptosis (Annexin A<sup>High</sup>/PI<sup>Low</sup>) and necrosis (Annexin V<sup>Low</sup>/PI<sup>High</sup>) when cell culture is maintained for 3 days (D3) to 6 days (D6) compared to control cells (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). These results suggest that BRAT1 is required to maintain cell viability.</p>

        <title>Loss of BRAT1 causes reduced cell migration and tumorigenesis</title>
        <p>Increased cell migration and tumor formation are key characteristics of cancer cells. To further characterize the BRAT1-knockdown cells, we performed wound healing and migration assay. Both control (NC) and HeLa Sh3 and Sh8 cells were pretreated with mitomycin C before making injury lines to exclude the effect by proliferation. As shown in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, wound healing activity of BRAT1 knockdown cells was severely impaired. Roles of BRAT1 in cell migration were studied with a migration chamber (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Control and BRAT1 knockdown MDA-MA-231 (231), human breast cancer cells, were used for this assay, since MDA-MA-231 cells have been frequently used for cell migration and penetration assay using matrigel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. 231 cells were stably transfected with nonspecific shRNA or 4 different BRAT1shRNA, and then antibiotic-resistant clones were selected after 2 weeks as described. Knockdown of BRAT1 protein in these stable cells was confirmed by immunoblot (insert of FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). We found that 231 Sh2 and 231 Sh20 cells showed significantly decreased mobility, compared with control cells, which was determined by staining cells that infiltrated the membrane. Quantified analysis showed that migration of BRAT1 knockdown cells was more than 3 fold lower than that of control cells.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

        <p>Next, we examined the tumorigenicity of BRAT1 knockdown cells in vivo by xenograft assay using HeLa Sh3 and Sh8 cells.

As shown in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, tumor size of BRAT1 knockdown cells was almost half of control HeLa cells throughout the time course, indicating that BRAT1 regulates tumor cell growth.

        <title>The rate of glycolysis and dependency on glucose are increased in BRAT1 knockdown cells</title>
        <p>Increased glycolysis is one of the most prominent metabolic alterations in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and this metabolic alteration increases aerobic glycolysis and dependency on the cytoplasmic glycolytic pathway for ATP generation, instead of mitochondrial TCA cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We observed rapid changes of acidity of cell culture media of BRAT1 knockdown cells compared to control cells (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Acidic pH in culture media implied that rate of glycolysis is increased in BRAT1 knockdown cells. To examine whether BRAT1 knockdown results in the change of glucose metabolism, we studied the rate of glucose consumption and lactate formation in both control and BRAT1 knockdown cells (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Increase in glucose consumption was measured daily by concentration of glucose in culture media. Compared to control cells, glucose concentration in culture media of HeLa Sh3 and Sh8 cells was lower than that of control cells, indicating that knockdown of BRAT1 results in higher glucose consumption. Increase in glucose metabolism was confirmed by lactate concentration in culture media. Thus, we found that HeLa Sh3 and Sh8 cells produce more lactate than control cells (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, right).These results suggest that BRAT1 knockdown cells require more glucose for their growth. We further analyzed glucose metabolism in BRAT1 knockdown cells by maintaining cells with or without glucose in cell culture media, and their apoptosis was measured on day 3 and day 5 (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Apoptosis was quantified by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). On day 3, control HeLa cells showed slight increase in apoptosis in glucose (â) media, but HeLa Sh3 was more sensitive to glucose deprivation. Increased sensitivity to glucose deprivation was more obvious on day 5, when, compared to control HeLa cells, HeLa Sh-3 cells showed much higher apoptosis.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

        <p>2DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose) is a chemical analogous to glucose, which inhibits glucose metabolism by causing glucose starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Increased sensitivity of BRAT1 knockdown cells to glucose deprivation was further studied to maintain those cells in the presence of 2DG (5 mM). Early to late apoptosis was determined by Annexin V staining using flow cytometry. As shown in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, 2DG treatment induced apoptosis of control HeLa cells. Apoptosis of HeLa Sh-3 cells was constitutively high, and it was further increased when cells were treated with 2DG. These results support a notion that BRAT1 knockdown cells are more sensitive to glucose deprivation.</p>

        <title>Loss of BRAT1 induces mitochondrial malfunctions</title>
        <p>Several groups have suggested that DNA damage response protein ATM is required for mitochondrial function, which ATM plays direct roles in modulating mitochondrial homeostasis and ATM deficiency induces mitochondrial dysfunction and increase mitochondrial ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. As we reported previously, BRAT1 is essential for the activation of ATM and DNA-PKcs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, we investigated whether BRAT1 is required for mitochondrial functions.</p>
        <p>First, we found that distribution of mitochondria in HeLa knockdown clone is different from that of control cells when cells are stained with dye that localizes mitochondria. In control cells, mitochondria localization is dispersed in the cytoplasm, but it is more condensed in BRAT1 knockdown cells (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). Because proper mitochondrial distribution is essential for mitochondrial functions, such as ATP delivery and calcium regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], this change in mitochondrial distribution suggests that BRAT1 is involved in mitochondria homeostasis. Supporting this model, we found that BRAT1 localizes in both nuclear and cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, cytoplasmic BRAT1 might be involved in this mitochondria regulation. Based on preliminary data, we tested the production of superoxide by mitochondria with fluorescence microscopy using the MitoSOX reagent. It permeates live cells where it selectively targets mitochondria, and is rapidly oxidized by superoxide but not by other reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). As shown in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, production of mitochondrial superoxide is significantly increased in HeLa Sh3 cells, compared to the control cells. Intensity of fluorescence was quantified by MFI.</p>
        <p>Next, we monitored the generation processes of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the luminescence analysis of 2â,7â-dichlorfluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA), which has been broadly used as a compound to detect and quantify intracellular produced ROS. Quantified fluorescent signal analysis determined by MFI indicated that HeLa Sh3 cells contain much higher levels of ROS compared to the parental HeLa cells (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B).The membrane-permeant JC-1 (5,5â²,6,6â²-tetrachloro-1,1â²,3,3â²-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbo-cyanine iodide) dye is widely used to monitor mitochondrial health, and can be used as an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential in a variety of cell types. The dissipation of the mitochondrial electrochemical potential gradient is known as an early event in apoptosis. In normal cells, due to the electrochemical potential gradient, the JC-1 concentrates in the mitochondrial matrix. Any event that dissipates the mitochondrial membrane potential prevents the accumulation of the JC-1 dye in the mitochondria and thus, the dye is dispersed throughout the entire cell leading to a shift to green fluorescence (JC-1 monomers). When we tested JC-1 signal of control, Sh3 and Sh8 HeLa cells, we observed increase in JC-1 monomeric signals in both HeLa Sh3 and Sh8 cells, illustrating mitochondrial dysfunction in HeLa Sh3 and Sh8 cells (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>

        <p>Taken together, these results suggest that BRAT1 depletion results in mitochondrial malfunction, leading to increased metabolism of glucose consumption. It is assumed that these cells are more sensitive to glucose deprivation.</p>
        <p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) transforms pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, contributing to linking the glycolysis metabolic pathway to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. ATP production from mitochondria is one of criteria to evaluate mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In this assay, endogenous PDH reduces tetrazolium salt, INT (2-p-iodophenyl-3-nitrophenyl-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride) to INT-formazan in a NADH-coupled reaction. The intensity of the red color formed is increased in the presence of increased PDH activity. As shown in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D, PDH activity was reduced in BRAT1 knockdown cells. Next, we tested if BRAT1 is involved in mitochondrial or cytoplasmic ATP production. In this assay, enzyme luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin, in ATP-dependent manner, which can be measured by a luminometer. As shown in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E, the level of mitochondrial ATP was significantly lower in BRAT1 knockdown cells compared with control cells, but the total levels of cellular ATP were not significantly different. These results indicate that ATP production from mitochondria is decreased in BRAT1 knockdown cells, suggesting that BRAT1 cells shift their energy source toward glycolysis to generate their ATP supply. Taken together, present data demonstrate that BRAT1 plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial functions.</p>

        <title>BRAT1 is required for constitutive Akt activation, and Akt activation by SC79 partially restores BRAT1 knockdown cells</title>
        <p>It has been well documented that PI3K/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling cascades regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, cell transformation and metastasis of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Further, Akt activation stimulates glucose consumption in transformed cells, and constitutive active Akt-expressing cells were more susceptible to glucose deprivation than Akt-deficient cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Also recent works suggested that mitochondrial stress leads to increased expression, activation, and nuclear localization of Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Together, these works suggested that glucose metabolism inhibits mitochondrial oxidation and suppresses apoptosis and increase proliferation in cancer cells by Akt-mediated signal. However, mitochondrial failure without increase in glucose metabolism suppresses cell growth and increase apoptotic phenotypes of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].Because our data showed that mitochondria function is impaired in BRAT1 knockdown cells, we studied whether growth promoting pathways are activated in those cells. The expression of Akt, Erk and their phosphorylation status were assessed by western blotting. As shown in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, phosphorylation of both Akt and Erk decreased in BRAT1 knockdown cells. Serum-induced activation of these kinases is significantly reduced in knockdown cells. Given the low migration and tumorigenesis of BRAT1 knockdown cells, these results suggest that phosphorylated Akt is indicative of reduced cell proliferation. We continue to study the mechanism of lowered Akt phosphorylation of BRAT1 knockdown cells, even though these cells consume more glucose than the control cells.</p>
        <p>Recently, Luoâs laboratory developed a novel Akt activator (SC79) which augments neuronal survival in mouse model for ischemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. SC79 directly enhanced Akt phosphorylation of all Akt isoforms and increases Akt activity in multiple cell types, including HeLa, HL60, HEK293, NB4 and HsSulton cells. When HeLa Sh3 cells were treated with SC79, Aktâs phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 were induced, although it was slightly weaker than that of control cells (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). We explored the effect of SC79 on cell proliferation of BRAT1 knockdown cells using MTT assay. As shown in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C, SC79 treatment restored proliferation of BRAT1 knockdown cells to the similar degree of control cells. We also found that SC79 reduces the production of superoxide in mitochondria that was detected by MitoSox positive cells (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). These data clearly indicate that the loss of BRAT1 inhibits growth signaling cascades mediated by Akt pathways.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>It has been implicated that BRAT1 might be a regulator for ATM and DNA-PK activation in response to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (IR) or chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, silencing of BRAT1 increased constitutive apoptosis and reduced cell growth. In this study, we determined a role for BRAT1 in proliferation and mitochondrial functions. After confirming suppressed BRAT1 expression, we found reduced BRAT1 expression in multiple cell lines induces growth retardation, increased apoptosis, and reduced tumor growth in vivo (FiguresÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This data suggests that BRAT1 has play a role in tumorigenesis, but further studies will be needed to identify BRAT1 role for whole tumor progress, including metastasis of specific tumor models.</p>
      <p>It was interesting that BRAT1 knockdown cells used inefficient glucose, leading to fast reduction in pH. We first found acidic extracellular pH through phenol red color (Figure S1). Although BRAT1 knockdown decreased cell proliferation, higher glycolysis and increased lactate accumulation were observed in BRAT1 knockdown culture media (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A), suggesting that glucose metabolism was modulated in correlated with reduced expression of BRAT1. To support this notion, we showed the glucose deprivation and blocking glycolysis by 2DG induce more severe apoptosis in BRAT1 knockdown cells than in control hela cell (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B and C). However, our data suggests that increased dependency on glucose is not direct reason of growth retardation and constitutive apoptosis as shown in BRAT1 knockdown cells (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D).</p>
      <p>Several possibilities could be suggested why glucose consumption might be increased in BRAT1 knockdown cells. These mechanisms may include mitochondrial malfunction and oncogenic signaling, such Ras and Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cytoplasmic glycolysis are two main metabolic pathways by which ATP is generated for energy supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Mitochondrial malfunction has been implicated to be responsible for increased glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Impaired mitochondrial function also causes pyruvate accumulation in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, we reasoned that high glucose consumption might be due to mitochondrial malfunction. Data in FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows that 4 different analyses revealed aberrant mitochondrial functions and metabolic pathways. In other words, elevated level of ROS, lower mitochondrial membrane potential, impaired PDH activity, and decreased production of ATP from mitochondria in BRAT1 knockdown cells clearly describe that BRAT1 has play a critical role in mitochondrial functions.</p>
      <p>It was reported that mitochondrial respiration defects lead to activation of Akt survival pathway through a mechanism mediated by NADH, describing how metabolic alteration in cancer cells gain a survival advantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Also recent work suggested that mitochondrial stress leads to increased expression, activation, and nuclear localization of Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Because our data showed a series of mitochondrial-originated stresses, we expected that Akt pathway might be constitutively activated in BRAT1 knockdown cells. However, both basal and serum-induced activation of Akt were reduced in BRAT1 knockdown cells (FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B), suggesting that knockdown-induced cellular and mitochondrial stress is not able to activate Akt. Further, Erk phosphorylation was also decreased in these cells. Akt and Ekr-mediated signaling pathways are critical steps for a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell survival, growth, proliferation, metabolism and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, we couldnât detect any stress-induced Akt or Erk activation in BRAT1 knockdown cells, instead, results implicates that BRAT1is involved in Akt/Erk-mediated growth regulation. SC79 can enhance Akt-PDK1 interaction, leading to enforced phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 of Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Using SC79, we confirmed Akt activation can moderately restore cell growth and ROS level (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). Although SC79 treatment was able to induce Akt phosphorylation in knockdown cells, the level of phosphorylation was less than control, suggesting that the upstream of Akt might be impaired by suppressed expression of BRAT1. It is interesting further study to investigate whether BRAT1 is involved in PI3K/mTOR/Akt signaling pathway, leading to optimal growth and keeping metabolic homeostasis of mitochondria.</p>
      <p>So far, BRAT1 has been the only DNA damage response protein, which regulates reaction stability of ATM/DNA-PK, leading to genomic stability after DNA damaging stress. However, this protein seems to account for proliferation and cellular metabolism in correlated with mitochondrial functions. Genetic investigation of patients with mutated BRAT1 suggests that BRAT1 plays a role on neuronal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. They found deletion mutant of BRAT1 in patient, however it remains to be clear how this mutation affect disease development.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In the current studies, we demonstrate that loss of BRAT1 induces mitochondrial malfunctions, suppresses growth signaling, and increase steady-state levels apoptosis. We also show that growth retardation in BRAT1 knockdown cells is due to mitochondrial malfunction that causes increased ROS and decreased ATP production. It has been illustrated that BRAT1 regulates activation of ATM and DNA-PK under conditions of DNA damaging stress. Present results indicate that BRAT1 is also involved in cell proliferation and mitochondrial metabolism. Because ATM-deficient cells showed mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], abnormal cellular differentiation/development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and impaired Akt activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], our results further support the model that BRAT1 determines the phenotypes caused by ATM deficiency.</p>
