          <title>Background</title>
          <p>p73, a p53 family member is a transcription factor that plays a role in cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis. p73 is regulated through post translational modifications and protein interactions. c-Abl is the only known tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates and activates p73. Here we have analyzed the role of Src family kinases, which are involved in diverse signaling pathways, in regulating p73.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Exogenously expressed as well as cellular Hck and p73 interact <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vitro </italic>binding assays show that SH3 domain of Hck interacts with p73. Co-expression of p73 with Hck or c-Src in mammalian cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of p73. Using site directed mutational analysis, we determined that Tyr-28 was the major site of phosphorylation by Hck and c-Src, unlike c-Abl which phosphorylates Tyr-99. In a kinase dependent manner, Hck co-expression resulted in stabilization of p73 protein in the cytoplasm. Activation of Hck in HL-60 cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous p73. Both exogenous and endogenous Hck localize to the nuclear as well as cytoplasmic compartment, just as does p73. Ectopically expressed Hck repressed the transcriptional activity of p73 as determined by promoter assays and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the p73 target, Ipaf and MDM2. SH3 domain- dependent function of Hck was required for its effect on p73 activity, which was also reflected in its ability to inhibit p73-mediated apoptosis. We also show that Hck interacts with Yes associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional co-activator of p73, and shRNA mediated knockdown of YAP protein reduces p73 induced Ipaf promoter activation.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>We have identified p73 as a novel substrate and interacting partner of Hck and show that it regulates p73 through mechanisms that are dependent on either catalytic activity or protein interaction domains. Hck-SH3 domain-mediated interactions play an important role in the inhibition of p73-dependent transcriptional activation of a target gene, Ipaf, as well as apoptosis.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>p73 is a transcription factor that shares significant homology with the tumor suppressor protein p53 and mediates cellular functions such as cell cycle arrest, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Alternate promoter usage and splicing give rise to p73 variants differing at the N and C-terminus, p73 Î± and Î² forms being the predominant transactivation competent forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. p73 and p53 bind common response elements and transactivate an overlapping set of target genes, though with differing efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. p73 knockout mice exhibit severe neurological, inflammatory and pheromonal defects but lack spontaneous tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Forced expression of p73 activates target genes like p21, Bax, IGF BP3, CyclinG, Mdm2, caspase-1, etc and promotes apoptosis in both p53 positive as well as negative cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>Cellular p73 protein is maintained at very low levels and activation is controlled at transcriptional as well as post-translational levels. p73 is induced in response to a range of DNA damaging agents as well as during differentiation of many cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Multiple mechanisms like post-translational modifications, protein-protein interaction and sub-cellular compartmentalization regulate transactivation potential and apoptosis inducing property of p73 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Several viral and cellular proteins interact with p73 and regulate its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. While some of the interacting proteins enhance transactivation potential of p73 by stabilizing it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], others inhibit transactivation property of p73 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. p73 is also known to interact with and cooperate with other transcription factors to regulate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interaction with c-Abl through SH3 domain in response to DNA damage results in phosphorylation at Tyr99, stabilization and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. c-Abl can also activate p38 MAP kinase to phosphorylate p73 leading to its stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p>
      <p>Src family kinases (SFKs) are non receptor tyrosine kinases involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions like proliferation, differentiation, survival, adhesion, motility and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Apart from a catalytic domain, they possess SH2, SH3 and SH4 domains required for sub-cellular targeting and protein interaction and therefore have cellular functions dependent on catalytic activity as well as protein interaction domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Hck is a SFK showing restricted expression in hematopoietic cells of myeloid and monocytic lineage and in embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It exists as two isoforms (p61 and p59 in humans), which arise due to alternate translational start sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Hck is activated in response to cytokines and is an important component of signaling pathways in activated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Hck levels increase during differentiation of monocytes and it plays a role in phagocytosis, adhesion, respiratory burst, granule secretion and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Several proteins like Cbl, Stat-3, WASP, WIP, ELMO, ACK1 and C3G interact with Hck through its SH3 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]</p>
      <p>The mechanisms that regulate stability and pro-apoptotic activity of p73 are distinct from those used by p53 and regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown only for p73 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Though initial studies described Tyr-99 as the major site of phosphorylation by cAbl, it has been shown that several other tyrosine residues are also targeted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. But thus far, no other tyrosine kinase has been described to phosphorylate or regulate p73 activity. Hck interacts with c-Abl and they modulate each other's activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Given the role of SFKs in mediating survival and apoptotic pathways in cells, we investigated the role of Hck in regulating p73 activity and function. Our results identify p73 as a novel interacting partner and substrate of Hck, and that Hck regulates p73 through kinase dependent as well as independent functions. We also provide evidence for functional interaction between p73 and Hck leading to regulation of p73 induced apoptosis.</p>

        <title>Hck interacts with p73Î±</title>
        <p>We explored the possibility of p73 interacting with Hck <italic>in vivo </italic>in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. p73 was detected in Hck immunoprecipitates from cells expressing both Hck and p73, but not in cells expressing p73 alone suggesting their interaction in mammalian cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). p73 has polyproline sequences that could serve as interacting motifs for SH3 domain containing proteins. To determine whether Hck and p73 form a complex through SH3-polyproline mediated interaction, <italic>in vitro </italic>binding experiments were carried out using glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Recombinant fusion protein of GST with SH3 domain of Hck (GST-SH3 Hck) bound to Glutathione Sepharose beads was incubated with lysates of Cos1 cells transfected with p73Î± and p73Î´. p73Î´ is the shortest isoform which lacks the entire C-terminus including the SAM domain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. p73Î± and p73Î´ bound to GST-SH3-Hck and not with GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Further, recombinant fusion protein of SH3 domain mutant (W93A) disabled for interaction (GST-mSH3 Hck) and GST-SH3-Hck were incubated with lysates of Cos1 cells transfected with p73Î±. p73Î± bound to GST-SH3-Hck and not to GST or GST-mSH3-Hck (whose levels were comparable) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). It has been shown that upon dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment of HL-60 cells, both mRNA and protein levels of p73Î± increase in a time dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Hck levels are also known to increase under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. To examine whether endogenous p73 interacts with Hck under these conditions, we subjected lysates of differentiated HL-60 cells to immunoprecipitation using Hck antibody. Western blotting with p73 antibody showed that p73Î± was co-immunoprecipitated with Hck and not with control antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Our results suggest that endogenous Hck and p73 interact under physiological conditions.</p>

        <title>Hck co-expression results in phosphorylation of p73</title>
        <p>Since p73 interacted with Hck, the possibility of p73 being a substrate of Hck <italic>in vivo </italic>was explored. Cos1 cells were transfected with HA-p73Î± expression construct with and without Hck and whole cell lysates subjected to western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. When p73 was co-expressed with Hck, phosphotyrosine was seen on the polypeptide corresponding to p73 in mobility as detected by reprobing the blot using p73 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Cells transfected with p73 or Hck alone did not show any corresponding phosphotyrosine containing peptides. Phosphorylation of p73 was dependent on kinase activity of Hck since co-expression of a catalytically inactive mutant KD-Hck (K269E) did not show tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptide at the corresponding position (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). To confirm phosphorylation of p73 more directly, p73 was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing p73Î± and Hck. Phosphorylated p73 could be detected in immunoprecipitates of p73Î± with Hck over-expression whereas it was not observed with over-expressed KD-Hck (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, upper panel). Hck also phosphorylated p73Î², dependent on its kinase activity (data not shown). These results suggested that Hck expression could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p73Î± and Î² <italic>in vivo</italic>. To check whether Hck phosphorylation on p73 is a direct event, <italic>in vitro </italic>phosphorylation assay was carried out. Recombinant GST and GST-p73Î± bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with purified Hck enzyme and Î³<sup>32</sup>P ATP. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, stained and the gel dried for phosphor imaging. Hck phosphorylated GST-p73Î± and not GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, right panel). Protein expression was visualized by commassie staining of the gel prior to exposure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, left panel). This result showed that Hck could directly phosphorylate p73Î±.</p>

        <title>Endogenous p73 gets tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation of Hck</title>
        <p>Treatment of myelomonocytic cell lines with mercuric chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>) has been shown to specifically activate Hck, and has been used to identify substrates of Hck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Treatment of HL-60 cells with DMSO showed an increase in protein levels of both p73Î± and Hck (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). To find out whether endogenous p73 gets tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation of Hck, HL-60 cells were differentiated for 48 hours with DMSO and then subjected to HgCl<sub>2 </sub>treatment. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with p73 and control antibody. It was observed that endogenous p73 gets tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation of Hck as determined by western blotting with phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, right panel). The left panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> shows the western blots of whole cell lysate (WCL) with phosphotyrosine, p73 and Hck antibodies.</p>

        <title>Hck phosphorylates p73Î± predominantly on Tyr28</title>
        <p>To identify the site of phosphorylation on p73Î± by Hck, different tyrosine mutants were constructed by PCR based site directed mutagenesis in which tyrosine residues that are predicted targets for Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) were mutated to phenylalanine. Cos1 cells were transfected with p73Î± or Y28F-p73Î±, Y121F-p73Î±, Y309F-p73Î±, Y355-356F-p73Î± in the presence of Hck and whole cell lysates subjected to western blotting with pTyr, p73 and Hck antibodies. All the mutants except Y28F-p73Î± showed phosphorylation comparable to that seen on WT-p73Î± (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Y28F-p73Î± was compromised considerably in phosphorylation by Hck (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This was not due to lower level of expression because p73 and Hck were comparable as determined by reprobing the blot with anti-p73 and anti-Hck antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). c-Abl is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase which phosphorylates p73Î± on Y99 residue and activates it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Hck induced phosphorylation of Y99F-p73Î± as well as WT-p73Î± while Y28F-p73Î± was particularly compromised in phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). c-Src co-expression also resulted in p73Î± phosphorylation predominantly on Y28 residue whereas expression of KD Src did not result in p73 phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest a novel site (Y28) of phosphorylation on p73Î± by Src family kinases, which is different from c-Abl mediated phosphorylation of p73 on Y99 residue.</p>

        <title>Hck co-expression stabilizes p73</title>
        <p>To determine whether Hck affects p73 protein levels, Hela cells were transfected with p73Î± alone or with Hck and whole cell lysates subjected to immunoblotting with anti p73 antibody. Co-expression of Hck but not KD-Hck showed higher p73Î± protein levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Hck also increased the protein levels of Y28F-p73Î±, which suggested that increase in p73Î± protein level is not dependent on Y28 phosphorylation. The same blot was probed for Hck and GFP that was used as transfection efficiency control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These results suggest that Hck could increase the p73 protein levels in a kinase dependent manner. To examine whether p73 increase seen upon co-expression with Hck is due to effect on its stability, levels of p73 protein were determined in the presence of cycloheximide. p73 levels dropped significantly by 9 hours of cycloheximide treatment but did not change significantly when co-expressed with Hck (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) suggesting that Hck increases p73 protein stability.</p>

Phosphorylated p73Î± was present predominantly in cytosolic fraction upon Hck over expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). When co-expressed with Hck, there was 2.3-fold increase in cytosolic p73 as compared to the cytosolic fraction of p73Î± transfected alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) suggesting that p73 is stabilized in the cytosolic fraction. Surprisingly, we observed that a fraction of Hck localized to the nucleus. Cross-contamination of the fractions was ruled out by probing for tubulin and PARP.</p>

        <title>Hck suppresses transactivation of p73 targets</title>
        <p>Since interacting proteins and modifications affect the transactivation ability of p73, we determined if Hck co-expression influences p73 activity. We first compared the ability of Hck and c-Abl to regulate p73 activity using PG13 construct that has multiple binding sites for p73. c-Abl enhanced p73Î² activity but Hck co-expression resulted in inhibition of its activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This effect of Hck was also tested using Ipaf promoter. Ipaf, an activator of caspase-1, was recently identified as a p53 target gene induced by DNA damage and was shown to play a role in p53 mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. p73Î± even at low level (2 ng of plasmid) could strongly transactivate expression of a reporter gene cloned downstream of the Ipaf promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). It was found that Hck repressed activation of Ipaf promoter reporter construct by p73Î± (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Coexpression of kinase dead (KD) mutant of Hck was also able to repress p73Î±-mediated transactivation similar to wild type (WT) Hck when tested using Ipaf reporter construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Overexpression of Hck also repressed p73Î±-induced transactivation of MDM2 promoter, which was independent of kinase activity of Hck, as co-expression of KD mutant of Hck repressed p73Î± mediated transactivation similar to WT-Hck (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Functional SH3 domain of Hck is required for inhibition of p73 transcriptional activity</title>
        <p>Since Hck inhibited the transcriptional activity of p73Î± isoform in a kinase-independent manner, we explored the possibility of the involvement of SH3 domain. Towards this end, a critical tryptophan was mutated to alanine (W93A). This mutation in Hck abolished the binding of SH3 domain to proline rich sequences of proteins as well as enhanced its kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. W93A-Hck (mSH3-Hck) was transfected in the presence and absence of p73Î± along with Ipaf-CAT reporter construct. mSH3-Hck was not able to inhibit p73Î± mediated transcriptional activity of Ipaf promoter whereas WT-Hck showed inhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>), suggesting that this inhibition is dependent on functional SH3 domain of Hck. To analyse if this property was unique to Hck, the effect of Src on Ipaf-promoter transactivation was examined. HeLa cells were transfected with p73Î± (2 ng) and c-Src or Hck (200 ng each) along with Ipaf-CAT promoter (200 ng) and cell lysates subjected to reporter activity assay. c-Src inhibited p73Î± mediated transactivation by 26.21% as compared to Hck which inhibited the activity by 60% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). These results suggest that Hck is a more potent inhibitor of p73 induced Ipaf-promoter transactivation as compared to c-Src indicating the difference in properties between the two members of Src family kinases.</p>
        <p>The effect of Hck on p73 induced endogenous gene expression was examined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptional (RT)-PCR analysis in HeLa cells. Hck and mSH3-Hck were transfected with p73Î± in a ratio of 6.5:1 and total RNA prepared. These conditions were used to ensure that all p73 expressing cells also co-express Hck. Ectopic expression of p73Î± resulted in an increase in endogenous Ipaf mRNA levels, and co-expression with WT-Hck resulted in inhibition of expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). Co-expression of mSH3-Hck with p73Î± did not inhibit p73Î± induced Ipaf mRNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). This was also observed with endogenous MDM2 mRNA levels where coexpression of WT-Hck inhibited MDM2 gene expression significantly and mSH3-Hck coexpression with p73Î± did not inhibit p73Î± induced MDM2 mRNA levels. These results suggested that functional SH3 domain of Hck is indispensable for repression of p73 transcriptional activity. We assessed the ability of Hck to regulate expression of PUMA, a well-known target of p73. RT-PCR analysis showed that p73Î± expression upregulates expression of PUMA in HeLa cells. Upon co-expression of Hck with p73Î±, PUMA expression was not altered under the conditions where Ipaf gene expression was repressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>). This result shows that Hck may regulate endogenous p73 targets selectively.</p>

        <title>Inhibition of p73Î± induced apoptosis by Hck</title>
        <p>p73Î± expression induces apoptosis in osteosarcoma cell line SAOS2 that is p53-/- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We wished to determine whether repressive effect of Hck on p73 activity is reflected also in its ability to suppress apoptosis. We examined the effect of Hck expression on p73Î±-induced apoptosis in SAOS2 cell line. p73Î± was overexpressed with and without Hck and cells were scored for apoptosis after immunostaining for p73 and Hck expression. p73Î± alone induced apoptosis in 33% of expressing cells but co-expression with Hck resulted in apoptosis of only 15% of expressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). A functional SH3 domain in Hck was required for inhibiting p73-induced apoptosis since the W93A-Hck construct did not show any inhibitory effect. This property was independent of Hck kinase activity as seen by the ability of KD Hck to inhibit p73-induced apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The morphology of single and dual expressing cells is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>. Further, to assess downstream events of apoptosis, cleaved caspase-3 levels were determined by immunostaining. A large number of p73Î± expressing cells showed increased staining of cleaved caspase-3, which is a hallmark for apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Co-expression of Hck along with p73Î± showed significant reduction in number of cells expressing cleaved caspase-3, whereas mSH3-Hck coexpression did not affect the number of cells with cleaved caspase-3 in SAOS2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).</p>

        <p>The effect of Hck on p73 induced Ipaf gene expression in SAOS-2 cells was examined. When Hck was co-expressed with p73Î±, Ipaf expression was reduced significantly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). This repression was independent of kinase activity of Hck but dependent on functional SH3 domain of Hck (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). We determined the effect of Y28F-p73Î± mutation on its ability to transactivate gene expression. Expression of p73Î± or Y28F-p73Î± mutant in SAOS2 cells resulted in an increased expression of Ipaf gene as determined by RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). Co-expression of Hck suppressed p73Î±-induced as well as Y28F mutant-induced expression of Ipaf mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). To determine whether some other target of p73 is affected by Y28F mutation, we analysed the induction of 14-3-3Ï mRNA (known to be induced by p73Î±) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] by p73Î± as well as by Y28F mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). Induction of 14-3-3Ï mRNA was seen upon expression of p73Î± as well as Y28F mutant. Interestingly, there was no suppression of p73Î± or Y28Fp73Î± mutant induced 14-3-3Ï mRNA by Hck (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study identifies p73 as a substrate and interacting partner of the Src family kinase, Hck. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies using a GST fusion protein suggest that p73Î± could interact directly with SH3 domain of Hck. Hck represses the transcriptional activity of p73Î±. This repression was observed under conditions where c-Abl co-expression showed enhanced transactivation by p73 indicating that c-Abl and Hck have opposing influence on the function of p73 as a transcriptional activator. This repression was independent of the catalytic activity of Hck but required its SH3 domain. The effect of Hck on p73 activity was also observed at the level of endogenous Ipaf and MDM2 gene expression but did not influence two other known targets of p73, PUMA and 14-3-3Ï. The selective regulation of p73 targets by Hck suggests a distinct role for Hck <italic>in vivo </italic>with respect to modulation of expression of certain genes. Apoptosis induced by exogenously expressed, as well as endogenous p73, was inhibited by Hck, dependent on its SH3 domain protein interaction function. This property of Hck may therefore be a consequence of its ability to repress target gene induction by p73.</p>
      <p>Hck mediated inhibition of p73 activity may be effected by direct interaction between these two proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, or by the involvement of a Hck interacting protein that is required for p73 dependent transcriptional activation. Endogenous as well as exogenously expressed Hck has earlier been shown to localize to plasma membrane, Golgi, secretory granules, nongranular membranes and cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Most intracellular functions of Src family kinases have been attributed to their localization to the plasma membranes and cytosolic compartments. More recently tyrosine kinases involved in receptor mediated signaling pathways have been shown to be present in the nucleus and their role in influencing activity of transcription factors has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Our results suggest that both exogenously expressed as well as endogenous Hck is present to some extent in nuclear compartment of cells. These observations raise the possibility that the inhibition of p73 transcriptional activity by Hck is mediated at least in part by the fraction of Hck present in the nucleus. Cytoplasmic sequestration of p73 by Hck is not likely to explain inhibition of p73 activity by Hck because the level of p73 in the nucleus (which is likely to be the transcriptionally active component) does not decrease upon co-expression of Hck. Hck interaction with p73 directly could alter its ability to bind or transactivate a set of targets selectively.</p>
      <p>Our results also show that Hck interacts with YAP, a transcriptional co-activator, which imparts target selectivity to p73. Since YAP was required for maximal activation of Ipaf promoter by p73, it is possible that Hck mediates repression of p73 transcriptional activity through its ability to interact with YAP. Based on the ability of p73Î´ to interact with Hck and not with YAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], we can infer that Hck and YAP bind to different sequences on p73. Formation of multimolecular complex, whereby both Hck and YAP interact with p73, could be responsible for Hck causing selective repression of p73 target genes. Since Hck can bind to YAP or to p73 through its single SH3 domain, an alternate possibility is that its interaction with YAP may alter the ability of YAP to transactivate p73 targets.</p>
      <p>Phosphorylation of p73 by c-Abl at Y99 results in its activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our study shows that Hck predominantly targets a tyrosine in the transactivation domain (Y28). This difference in target site beween Hck and c-Abl rules out the possibility of Hck expression resulting in p73 phosphorylation through activation of c-Abl, although Hck is known to activate c-Abl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This modification (Y28 phosphorylation) did not influence the activity of p73 because Y28F mutant showed the same level of activation of Ipaf promoter as WT p73. Hck inhibited Ipaf gene expression induced by p73Î± as well as Y28F mutant. We also demonstrated that this modification is not a unique property of Hck, since c-Src expression also resulted in predominant phosphorylation of p73 at Y28. In addition, Hck also targets other tyrosine residues (which we have not specifically identified) because Y28 mutant was not totally deficient in phosphorylation.</p>
      <p>p73 stabilization has generally been shown to reflect in an increase in its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our study showed that over- expression of Hck results in stabilization of p73 protein, dependent on its kinase activity, but this does not lead to an increase in p73 activity. Similarly, it has been reported earlier that interaction of p73 with MDM2 results in p73 stabilization but inhibition of p73 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Our results also show that activation of endogenous Hck results in tyrosine phosphorylation of p73. p73 protein levels increase upon differentiation of mylemonocytic cells ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and present study). Under these conditions of differentiation, Hck levels and activity are also known to increase. Hck activity mediated signaling may therefore contribute to enhanced protein levels of endogenous p73 upon differentiation. Upon cell fractionation, we observed that Hck co-expression enhanced p73 protein levels only in the cytosolic fraction, but not in the nuclear fraction. Phosphorylated p73 was essentially seen in the cytosolic fraction. p73 localized to nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments may have independent cellular functions just as does p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Since phosphorylation at Y28 by Hck does not appear to play a significant role in its stability, it is likely that other mechanisms contribute to p73 stabilization dependent on the kinase activity of Hck. Recently, Fyn, a Src family kinase was shown to negatively regulate Itch by tyrosine phosphorylation, impairing its ubiquitinating activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Since Itch regulates cellular p73 levels by causing its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], it is also possible that SFKs may indirectly regulate p73 by preventing its degradation. We have yet to determine the role of p73 stabilized by the kinase activity of Hck in the cytoplasmic compartment.</p>
      <p>SFKs modulate diverse signaling cascades dependent on their ability to interact with and phosphorylate various target proteins. In some contexts kinase and adaptor functions can act independently to effect downstream signaling. It therefore, appears that stabilization, which is catalytic activity dependent and suppression of apoptosis, which is SH3 domain interaction dependent, are independent effects of Hck on p73. The functional significance of Y28 phosphorylation of p73 is not clear at present and would require further investigation.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, our results show that the tyrosine kinase Hck interacts with p73Î± physically and functionally. Hck and c-Src phosphorylate p73Î± at Tyr-28, a novel site of phosphorylation located in the transcriptional activation domain. Transcriptional activity of p73 towards certain target genes is selectively inhibited by Hck independent of its kinase activity. Hck-SH3 domain mediated interactions play an important role in the inhibition of p73-dependent transcriptional activation of target genes as well as apoptosis.</p>
