      <abstract>
        <p>Androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor, plays a critical role in prostate cancer onset and progression, and its transcriptional function is mediated largely by distinct nuclear receptor co-regulators. Here, we show that cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) functions as an AR co-activator. CCAR1 interacted with and enhanced the transcriptional activity of AR. Depletion of CCAR1 caused reduction in androgen-dependent expression of a subset of AR target genes. We further showed that CCAR1 is required for recruitment of AR, MED1 and RNA polymerase II to the enhancers of AR target genes and for androgen-induced long-range prostate specific antigen enhancerâpromoter interaction. The molecular mechanism underlying CCAR1 function in AR-mediated transcription involves CCAR1-mediated enhanced recruitment of GATA2, a pioneer factor for AR, to AR-binding sites. CCAR1 stabilized the interaction between AR and GATA2 by interacting directly with both proteins, thereby facilitating AR and GATA2 occupancy on the enhancers. Furthermore, CCAR1 depletion inhibited the growth, migration, invasion of prostate cancer cells and reduced the tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results firmly established CCAR1 as an AR co-activator that plays a key role in AR transcription complex assembly and has an important physiological role in androgen signaling and prostate tumorigenesis.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays a key role in the growth and maintenance of the normal prostate and the onset and progression of prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B2">2</xref>). Transcriptional activation by AR and other NRs is tightly controlled by a complex process, including DNA sequence, epigenetic signatures, chromatin structure and dynamic interactions between NRs and gene specific co-activators at the target enhancers and promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B4">4</xref>). On activation, AR binds to androgen response elements (AREs) in the enhancer and promoter regions of target genes. Recent genome-wide ChIP-on-chip studies have shown that motifs for pioneer factors (e.g. FoxA1, GATA2 and Oct1) are significantly enriched within the AR-binding regions, compared with genomic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B6">6</xref>). The pioneer factors FoxA1 and GATA2 are recruited to a significant portion of AR-binding sites in prostate cancer cells, facilitating AR binding to AREs by interacting directly with AR and consequently enhancing AR-mediated transcription. Once bound to AREs, AR regulates the expression of a variety of target genes through the recruitment of co-regulators (co-activators and co-repressors) that mediate local chromatin remodeling as well as communications with the RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated basal transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B7">7</xref>). Although there has been considerable progress in describing the roles of AR co-regulators in AR-mediated gene regulation, little is known about their roles in the interplay between AR and pioneer factors.</p><p>Cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) is a regulator of apoptosis signaling as well as cell proliferation. Recently, we have shown that CCAR1 interacts with estrogen receptor Î± (ERÎ±) and cooperates synergistically with components of the p160 co-activator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B8">8</xref>). In addition, CCAR1 associates with components of the Mediator complex and facilitates recruitment of Mediator complex to the promoter of target genes by providing a physical link between p160 co-activator and Mediator complexes. CCAR1 is important for estrogen-induced expression of ERÎ± target genes and estrogen-dependent growth of breast cancer cells. Deletion in breast cancer (DBC1), which shows significant homology to CCAR1, has been reported as an AR co-activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B9">9</xref>). DBC1 interacts with AR and enhances AR-mediated transcription by promoting DNA-binding activity of AR. Recently, we identified DBC1 as a CCAR1-binding protein and showed that DBC1 associates directly with ERÎ± and cooperates synergistically with CCAR1 to enhance ERÎ± and other NRs function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B10">10</xref>). To further characterize the mechanism by which CCAR1 contributes to transcriptional activation by NRs, we explored the possibility that CCAR1 may play a role in AR-mediated transcription and contribute to the tumorigenic potential of prostate cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transient transfection</title><p>LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

We next tested whether CCAR1 can function as a co-activator for AR. In reporter gene assays, CCAR1 enhanced the hormone-induced AR activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F1">Figure 1</xref>B), and coexpression of CCAR1 and DBC1 enhanced AR function in a synergistic manner (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>).

To investigate the possible role of CCAR1 in prostate cancer growth, we examined the effect of reduced CCAR1 levels on DHT-stimulated cell proliferation in LNCaP cells infected with lentiviruses expressing a shNS or CCAR1 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F3">Figure 3</xref>A). DHT treatment stimulated proliferation of LNCaP/shNS cells, but DHT stimulation of LNCaP cell growth was attenuated by CCAR1 depletion.

To further investigate the role of CCAR1 in promoting prostate tumorigenesis, we assessed the effect of CCAR1 depletion on the growth of LNCaP xenograft tumors in nude mice injected with CCAR1-depleted (shCCAR1) cells or control (shNS) cells that had been engineered to stably express luciferase (LNCaP-LUC). The expression of luciferase in LNCaP-LUC cells was not affected by CCAR1 depletion (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S10A</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">B</ext-link>).

Immunohistochemistry analysis using anti-CCAR1 antibody confirmed that CCAR1 expression was much weaker in tumor specimens derived from LNCaP-LUC/shCCAR1 grown in mice when compared with LNCaP-LUC/shNS tumors, indicating that CCAR1 depletion was maintained during the tumor formation in mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 10C</ext-link>).

To further test the role of CCAR1 as an AR co-activator, we assessed the effect of reduced CCAR1 levels on transcription complex assembly on the PSA enhancer. Reduction of CCAR1 levels by shRNA had no measurable effect on the cellular levels of AR, MED1 and Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F4">Figure 4</xref>A). However, CCAR1 depletion severely affected the DHT-dependent recruitment of AR to the PSA enhancer, and the recruitment of MED1 and Pol II was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Similar results were observed on the TMPRSS2 and KLK2 enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F4">Figure 4</xref>C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S11A</ext-link>).

These results are consistent with the data that CCAR1 is required for AR-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F2">Figure 2</xref>) and strongly suggest that CCAR1 is required for efficient binding of AR to its regulatory regions and thereby facilitates the occupancy of Mediator and Pol II on the regulatory regions of AR target genes.

GATA2 recruitment to these enhancers was significantly decreased in CCAR1-depleted cells, both in the absence of ligand and, to a great extent, in the presence of androgen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C).

CCAR1 depletion had no measurable effect on the level of GATA2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F4">Figure 4</xref>A). This suggests that CCAR1 plays necessary roles both in the basal recruitment of GATA2 to chromatin and in its recruitment following androgen stimulation.</p><p>In the presence of androgen, AR and its co-activators bind to the distal PSA enhancer, and the AR-co-activator complex communicates with the proximal PSA promoter through chromosomal looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B7">7</xref>). As CCAR1 is required for the recruitment of AR and Pol II to the PSA enhancer, we next asked whether CCAR1 can affect PSA enhancer/promoter loop formation. To this end, we performed 3C analysis, a technique used to detect physical long-range chromosomal interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B12">12</xref>). The cross-linked chromatin from LNCaP cells treated with or without DHT for 16 h was digested with BstYI and ligated. After reversing crosslinking, PCR was performed with one primer in the PSA enhancer and another in the PSA promoter (primer E+/Pâ). Control PCR (primer P+/Pâ) for the level of input chromatin was equivalent under all conditions. As expected, the PSA enhancer and promoter interacted in a ligase-dependent manner, and this interaction was enhanced by DHT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F4">Figure 4</xref>D). However, depletion of CCAR1 severely reduced the interaction between the PSA enhancer and promoter, implicating its involvement in bridging between the enhancer and promoter of the PSA gene. Together, these results indicate that CCAR1 is required for chromatin looping and maximal occupancy of AR and Pol II at the PSA locus. To assess whether CCAR1 plays a direct role in mediating chromatin remodeling at AR-binding regions, we performed FAIRE analysis, a method for enriching nucleosome-depleted regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B13">13</xref>). CCAR1 depletion reduced androgen-inducible chromatin remodeling of AR-binding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F4">Figure 4</xref>E), suggesting that CCAR1 is required for optimal euchromatic conditions at the enhancer of AR target genes.</p></sec><sec><title>CCAR1 stabilizes the association between AR and GATA2</title><p>The aforementioned observations prompted us to examine the interaction and cooperation between CCAR1 and GATA2. In CoIP experiments, GATA2 was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with CCAR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F5">Figure 5</xref>A). In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pull-down assays confirmed the interaction between CCAR1 and GATA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F5">Figure 5</xref>B), suggesting that CCAR1 interacts directly with GATA2. Since CCAR1 interacts with both AR and GATA2, we next mapped the CCAR1 domains involved in the interaction with AR and GATA2 in GST pull-down assays (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S13</ext-link>). AR interacted with the N-terminal domain of CCAR1 (aa 1â249); in contrast, GATA2 bound to the central domain of CCAR1 (aa 203â660). Thus, AR and GATA2 interact with different domains of CCAR1, suggesting that CCAR1 might interact simultaneously with AR and GATA2. Furthermore, CCAR1 significantly increased the amount of GATA2 that coimmunoprecipitated with AR in CoIP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F5">Figure 5</xref>C). To test whether CCAR1 can stabilize the interaction between AR and GATA2 on DNA, we next performed DAPA assays. A biotinylated PSA enhancer probe was incubated with 293T cell extracts transiently transfected with AR, GATA2 and CCAR1 expression vectors, and then the DNAâprotein complexes were precipitated by streptavidin beads. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F5">Figure 5</xref>D, AR binding to the enhancer was increased in the presence of DHT. Furthermore, AR and GATA2 binding to DNA was increased by enforced expression of CCAR1 both in the presence and absence of DHT, suggesting that CCAR1 increases DNA-binding activities of AR and GATA2 by stabilizing the interaction between AR and GATA2 on the PSA enhancer. In reporter gene assays using PSA-LUC constructs, CCAR1 and GATA2 synergistically enhanced the transcriptional activity of AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F5">Figure 5</xref>E). In contrast, deletion of the GATA motif within the PSA enhancer region dramatically decreased GATA2 effect on AR activity and the synergy between GATA2 and CCAR1, demonstrating the functional importance of the interaction among AR, GATA2, and CCAR1 on the PSA enhancer. Taken together, our results suggest that CCAR1 may function as adaptor protein that stabilizes the interaction of GATA2 and AR and possibly maintains the integrity of AR transcription complex.

Specifically, CCAR1 functioned as a co-activator for 86 of 87 genes that were induced by DHT and affected by CCAR1 depletion; and CCAR1 served as a co-repressor for 72 of 74 genes that were repressed by DHT and affected by CCAR1 depletion. Thus, in most cases, CCAR1 facilitated, rather than opposed, the positive or negative regulation of genes by DHT, suggesting that CCAR1 functioned as a co-activator for androgen-activated genes and as a co-repressor in support of androgen-induced gene repression.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular mechanism of CCAR1 co-regulator function</title><p>Genome-wide ChIP-on-chip and ChIP-Seq studies identified a highly significant overlap of AR and GATA2-binding sites in androgen target genes and showed that GATA2 acts as a pioneer factor in the recruitment of AR to AR binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B17">17</xref>). In this study, we report a novel mechanism for AR-mediated transcription involving the interplay between AR, GATA2 and CCAR1. Our ChIP analyses showed that recruitment of AR and GATA2 to the PSA, TMPRSS2 and KLK2 enhancers was decreased by CCAR1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S11A</ext-link>). In line with these observations, MED1 and Pol II failed to bind to the enhancers, and consequently, the expression of PSA, TMPRSS2 and KLK2 was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F2">Figure 2</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). These results suggest that AR and GATA2 bind to the enhancer more efficiently when complexed with CCAR1. Indeed, CCAR1 stabilized the interaction between AR and GATA2 by associating with both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F5">Figure 5</xref>C) and enhanced their DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Although GATA2 is required for PSA, TMPRSS2 and KLK2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B18">18</xref>), GATA2 does not play a significant role in androgen-regulated FKBP5 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B19">19</xref>). Interestingly, CCAR1 depletion did not affect AR binding but greatly reduced MED1 and Pol II loading on the FKBP5 enhancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S11B</ext-link>), which is similar to our previous finding that inhibition of CCAR1 recruitment to the pS2 promoter had no observable effect on recruitment of ERÎ± but compromised the hormone-dependent recruitment of Mediator complex and Pol II to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B8">8</xref>). Similarly, CCAR1 depletion caused only a modest reduction in AR recruitment to the PSA promoter containing GATA2-independent AREs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S12</ext-link>). Thus, we propose that CCAR1 has a dual function in regulating AR signaling: first as an adaptor protein by stabilizing the association between AR and GATA2 and increasing their occupancy on AR-binding sites, and second as a co-activator by facilitating recruitment of Mediator complex and Pol II to AR-binding sites by providing a physical link between DNA-bound AR and the Mediator complex, and thereby facilitating transcription complex assembly, chromatin looping and chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F6">Figure 6</xref>).
<fig id="gkt644-F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The proposed role of CCAR1 in chromatin loading and assembly of AR transcription complex. CCAR1 is recruited to GATA2-dependent AR-binding sites at least in part through interaction with DNA-bound GATA2 and AR and stabilizes their association with DNA, thereby increasing their occupancy on AR-binding sites. The recruited CCAR1 possibly provides a physical link between DNA-bound AR and Mediator complex and facilitates recruitment of p160 co-activator complex, and thereby facilitating transcription complex assembly, chromatin looping and chromatin remodeling. For example, CCAR1 facilitates AR and GATA2 recruitment and stabilizes their occupancies on the distal PSA enhancer (ARE III) containing a GATA2-dependent ARE. CCAR1 also facilitates recruitment of Mediator complex and Pol II to AR-bound PSA enhancer (ARE III) and promoter (ARE I and ARE II). CCAR1 provides a physical link in AR transcription complex, thereby leading to chromatin looping and enhancing communication between the PSA enhancer and promoter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkt644f6p"/></fig></p><p>The exact mechanism of CCAR1-mediated gene repression is unclear. However, it is becoming apparent that many co-activators and co-repressors can carry out either function in a gene-specific manner. For example, GRIP1, a member of p160 co-activator family, has been shown to regulate positively or negatively the transcriptional efficiency of specific subsets of NR target genes. GRIP1 interacts directly with hormone-activated NRs, recruits secondary co-activators (p300, CARM1 and CoCoA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt644-F6">Figure 6</xref>), and acts synergistically with secondary co-activators to enhance NR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B11">11</xref>). However, GRIP1 can also serve as a platform for recruitment of downstream co-repressors such as RIP140 and Suv4-20h1.1 to specific subsets of NR target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B21">21</xref>). G9a, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, not only acts as a co-repressor but also has been shown to function as a co-activator for NRs. As a co-activator, G9a acts as a molecular scaffold to facilitate recruitment of co-activators CARM1 and p300 to GR target genes, and G9a co-activator function, in contrast to its co-repressor function, is independent of its catalytic H3K9 methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B23">23</xref>). DBC1, a NR co-activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B10">10</xref>), was also found to be involved in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B24">24</xref>). DBC1 associates with COUP transcription factor 1 (COUP-TFI) complex, stabilizes the interaction between NCoR and COUP-TFI, and thereby contributes to COUP-TFI-mediated transcriptional repression. Thus, the positive or negative actions of co-regulators are likely determined by the gene-specific regulatory environment, chromatin architecture and combinatorial interactions between different co-regulators. A recent proteomics study found a few proteolytic fragments of CCAR1 in immunopurified SIRT7 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B25">25</xref>), suggesting that CCAR1 might be associated with some forms of the SIRT7 complex. SIRT7, a NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, deacetylates histone H3K18 and promotes transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B26">26</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to test whether SIRT7 is involved in CCAR1-mediated repression.</p></sec><sec><title>CCAR1 as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer</title><p>AR plays a critical role in all phases of prostate cancer, including onset, androgen-dependent tumor growth and transition to androgen-independence of prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B2">2</xref>). Interestingly, several recent studies have shown that the program of gene expression regulated by AR in androgen-independent prostate cancer is distinct from the androgen-regulated program in androgen-dependent prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B28">28</xref>). In addition, the AR transcription program in primary human tissue is divergent from that in cultured prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B27">27</xref>). These differences in AR transcriptional program between androgen-dependent prostate cancer and androgen-independent prostate cancer or between cultured cells and primary human tissue could be explained by genetic or epigenetic alterations in co-regulators and pioneer factors to modulate AR activity. For example, recent reports demonstrated that high expression of GATA2 and AIB1/SRC3 is predictive of poor outcome in prostate cancer and modulates the expression of key androgen-regulated genes that have potential roles in the transition of prostate cancer cells to aggressive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B29">29</xref>). Co-regulators play crucial roles in modulating AR activity and consequently may be important in regulating aberrant activity of AR during prostate cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B4">4</xref>). In this study, we showed that CCAR1 is required for growth and tumorigenic properties of prostate cancer cells. Importantly, we further demonstrated that CCAR1 contributes to chromatin looping and AR transcription complex assembly by stabilizing AR-GATA2 association on chromatin and facilitating MED1 and Pol II recruitment to AR-binding sites. A recent study showed that MED1 plays an essential role in chromatin looping at the castration-resistant prostate cancer-specific AR target UBE2C gene locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt644-B30">30</xref>). Given that CCAR1 is required for optimal recruitment of MED1 to AR-binding sites, it will be interesting to test whether CCAR1 also contributes to UBE2C locus looping and castration-resistant prostate cancer progression. Understanding the co-activators involved in the mechanisms of ARâDNA interaction and AR transcription complex assembly will provide useful information for developing therapeutic drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. Our study thus suggests CCAR1 as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt644/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online, including [31â37].</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>Samsung Biomedical Research Institute</funding-source> (SBRI) grant [<award-id>GE1-B2-061</award-id>]; <funding-source>Korean Foundation for Cancer Research</funding-source> [<award-id>CB-2011-04-01</award-id>]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the <funding-source>Ministry of Education, Science and Technology</funding-source> [<award-id>2010-0021428</award-id>]; and Korea Healthcare Technology R&amp;D Project funded by the <funding-source>Ministry for Health &amp; Welfare</funding-source> [<award-id>A092255</award-id>]; Postdoctoral training grant for translational research from <funding-source>Samsung Medical Center</funding-source> [<funding-source>SMX1131141</funding-source> to W.-Y.S.].
