      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Enhancing the response to interferon could offer an immunological advantage to the host. In support of this concept, we used a modified form of the transcription factor STAT1 to achieve interferon hyperresponsiveness without toxicity and markedly improve antiviral function in transgenic mice and transduced human cells. We found that the improvement depends on expression of a PARP9-DTX3L complex with distinct domains for interaction with STAT1 and for activity as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts on host histone H2BJ to promote interferon-stimulated gene expression and on viral 3C proteases to initiate their degradation via the immunoproteasome. Together, PARP9-DTX3L acts on host and pathogen to achieve a double layer of immunity within a safe reserve in the interferon signaling pathway.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P2">The interferon (IFN) signaling pathway is considered to be a mainstay of the immune system <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, a concept that is proven for the most part by loss-of-function approaches. Thus, deficiency of IFN production or signal transduction leads to defects in immune-mediated control of microbial pathogens in experimental animal models and in humans <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The biological consequences of increased activity of the IFN signaling pathway are less certain, but chronic activation of type I IFN production has been linked to autoimmune disease in humans <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, administration of exogenous IFNs is accompanied by toxicity that limits pharmacologic use <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These outcomes suggest that regulation of the IFN signaling pathway is already optimized under native conditions and that enhancing this pathway may not provide a therapeutic benefit without significant toxicity.</p>
    <p id="P3">However, previous approaches to enhancing IFN effects have generally relied on excessive expression or administration of unregulated IFN ligand. An alternative strategy might be to enhance the efficiency of endogenous IFN to activate downstream signal transduction. While targeting the responsiveness of the IFN signal transduction pathway might be desirable, it is made difficult by the complexity in the IFN signaling pathway and its functional activities. The protective actions of IFNs rely on signaling through three types of IFN receptors (for type I, II, and III IFNs) and the Janus activated kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway that includes receptor-associated JAKs and STATs as well as downstream modulators, transcription factors, enhancers and coactivators <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In the case of viral infection, the overall process leads to expression of hundreds of distinct IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products that provide functional effector activities, but also feedback into IFN signaling <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, IFN signaling may also interact with other cytokine (e.g., TNF) signaling pathways with additional immune consequences <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">Despite this complexity, the STAT1 transcription factor stands out as a critical functional component common to each of the IFN receptor signaling pathways <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, a double cysteine-substituted STAT1 (designated STAT1-CC) enhances type I and II IFN signal transduction in human cells, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. This enhancement is due to the increased capacity of STAT1-CC for transcriptosome assembly at the promoter of ISGs, which is manifest by prolonged activation (marked by Tyr-701 phosphorylation), nuclear localization (marked by DNA-binding) and co-activator recruitment (marked by binding of p300/CBP). Importantly, STAT1-CC preserves the requirement for ligand-dependent activation. STAT1-CC gene expression thereby offers a distinct gain-of-function approach to understanding how an improvement in IFN signaling might affect immune function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
    <p id="P5">The present experiments were initiated to define the consequences of a hyperresponsive IFN signaling pathway for host defense and, if successful, to establish new mechanisms for improving the outcome from infection. We therefore developed gain-of-function models in transgenic mice and transduced human cells with controlled expression of STAT1-CC. These models showed an increase in the efficiency of IFN signaling and a consequent benefit for host defense against a broad range of viruses. Whole genome analysis of these models identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 9 (PARP9) and deltex 3-like (DTX3L) as being induced in concert with IFN hyperresponsiveness. PARP9 was originally identified as being overexpressed in chemotherapy-resistant diffuse large B-cell lymphomas <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and was later reported to bind to DTX3L, which in turn was found to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that selectively ubiquitinates histone H4 and protects cells against DNA-damaging agents <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. This function was consistent with the conventional role of PARP family members in the DNA-repair response <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. However, PARP9 and DTX3L were also found to be located in a head-to-head orientation regulated by the same bidirectional IFN-responsive promoter, and overexpression of PARP9 in a malignant B-cell lymphoma cell line caused widespread induction of ISG expression, suggesting an alternative role for PARP9 in the IFN signaling pathway <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Here we show that PARP9 and DTX3L are STAT1-associated components for IFN signal transduction that are rate-limiting and are thereby capable of enhancing IFN efficacy and consequent host defense when expressed in higher amounts. We also identify PARP9-DTX3L as an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets both host histone H2BJ to promote ISG expression and viral 3C protease to disrupt viral assembly. These observations offer proof of principle on how a single molecular complex can act on host and pathogen to provide a double benefit for IFN-dependent host defense and thereby afford some guidance on therapeutic development for IFN-sensitive conditions.</p>

        <title>STAT1-CC expression achieves IFN hyperresponsiveness <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
        <p id="P6">To achieve IFN hyperresponsiveness <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated CAG-STAT1-CC transgenic mice with a CMVâÎ²-actinâÎ²-globin (CAG) gene promoter to drive widespread expression and human STAT1-CC with cysteine substitutions at Ala-656 and Ala-658 to improve ISG expression <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. CAG-STAT1 transgenic mice expressing wild-type STAT1 were also generated as controls (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Both CAG-STAT1 and CAG-STAT1-CC mice showed similar levels of transgene expression in heart, pancreas, brain, and lung (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>) and exhibited normal birth frequency, development and longevity without histologic evidence of autoimmunity or other disease at 2 years of age (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). STAT1-CC exhibited prolonged activation (monitored by nuclear accumulation in heart tissue) compared to the endogenous or transgene-derived wild-type STAT1 in response to IFN-Î³ administration <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Similarly, CAG-STAT1-CC mice showed significant increases in ISG expression (monitored by <italic>Irf1</italic> and <italic>Gbp3</italic> mRNA level in pancreas) at baseline and after IFN-Î² administration compared to CAG-STAT1 or wild-type mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">We next questioned whether CAG-STAT1-CC mice were protected from viral infection. After infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) at an inoculum of 100 PFU, wild-type and CAG-STAT1 mice showed 100% lethality, whereas 97% of CAG-STAT1-CC mice survived at this inoculum and 82% of them survived at a 100-fold higher inoculum (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). At lower viral inoculum (3 PFU), CAG-STAT1-CC survival was 100%, while only 25â28% of wild-type and CAG-STAT1 mice survived (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Improved survival was associated with a marked decrease in viral load at the primary sites of infection (heart, brain and pancreas) in CAG-STAT1-CC compared to wild-type or CAG-STAT1 mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Similarly, we found decreased EMCV loads by immunostaining in the pancreas of CAG-STAT1-CC mice compared to wild-type or CAG-STAT1 mice and a concomitant decrease in tissue inflammation and injury in heart, brain, and pancreas (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). CAG-STAT1-CC transgenic mice were also protected against influenza A virus (IAV, strains A/WS/33 and A/Vietnam/1203/04) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), although to a lesser degree than EMCV (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that STAT1-CC expression allows for better control of viral loads and virus-induced tissue damage across a broad range of viruses and tissue sites.</p>

        <title>IFN hyperresponsiveness tracks with PARP9-DTX3L expression</title>
        <p id="P8">To define basis for the STAT1-CC benefit during viral infection, we analyzed whole-genome expression arrays of pancreas from CAG-STAT1-CC and CAG-STAT1 mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We also analyzed gene expression in STAT1-deficient U3A fibrosarcoma cells that were retrovirus-transduced for STAT1 (U3A-STAT1) or STAT1-CC (U3A-STAT1-CC) expression <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Following expression in U3A cells, STAT1-CC showed increased nuclear translocation and conferred increased ISG expression and increased control of viral levels following infection with EMCV, IAV, and Sindbis virus (SINV) compared to U3A or U3A-STAT1 cells, with EMCV showing the greatest sensitivity to STAT1-CC actions (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Similar to our approach <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used whole-genome expression arrays to identify genes that were differentially expressed in STAT1-CC- versus STAT1-expressing U3A cells under baseline or low-dose IFN-Î² treatment that mimics physiologic conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 2, 3</xref>). By comparing the sets of differentially expressed genes for three conditions, U3A-STAT1 versus U3A-STAT1-CC cells at baseline, U3A-STAT1 versus U3A-STAT1-CC cells with IFN-Î² treatment, and CAG-STAT1 versus CAG-STAT1-CC transgenic pancreas tissues, we identified an overlapping set of genes as candidates for mediating the observed benefit of STAT1-CC in IFN signaling function (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Within this set, genes that were not previously assigned to any direct or indirect antiviral function were identified as candidates for further study. Among these, the gene encoding <italic>PARP9</italic> (also known as <italic>BAL1 and ARTD9</italic>) <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> showed the highest differential expression between U3A-STAT1 and U3A-STAT1-CC cells treated with IFN-Î² (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).

        <title>PARP9-DTX3L controls host ISG expression linked with STAT1</title>
        <p id="P9">To analyze <italic>PARP9</italic> and <italic>DTX3L</italic> gene function, we used lentiviral transduction for stable expression of shRNAs targeting <italic>PARP9</italic> or <italic>DTX3L</italic> mRNA in U3A, U3A-STAT1, and U3A-STAT1-CC cells. Specific knockdown of either <italic>PARP9</italic> or <italic>DTX3L</italic> mRNA caused a knockdown of both PARP9 and DTX3L protein without influencing STAT1 or STAT1-CC phosphorylation or activation (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5aâe</xref>). <italic>PARP9</italic> mRNA knockdown decreased the expression of DTX3L protein without a decrease in <italic>DTX3L</italic> mRNA, suggesting that PARP9 may regulate DTXL protein expression at a post-translational level. In contrast, <italic>DTX3L</italic> mRNA knockdown caused a decrease in PARP9 protein expression that reflected down-regulation of the <italic>PARP9</italic> mRNA, suggesting that DTX3L may regulate <italic>PARP9</italic> gene expression at a transcriptional level. Knockdown of either PARP9 or DTX3L protein had no effect on the levels STAT1 and STAT1-CC (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5câe</xref>) but still resulted in loss of STAT1-CC-mediated control of EMCV, IAV-A/WS/33 and SINV infection in U3A cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Thus, PARP9 and DTX3L are necessary for the beneficial effect of STAT1-CC in controlling viral replication. In addition, restoring PARP9 expression to PARP9-knockdown U3A cells reversed the down-regulation of DTX3L expression and reconstituted the antiviral effect of STAT1-CC on EMCV (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5f, g</xref>), again supporting a role for PARP9 in regulating DTX3L protein expression. We also found <italic>PARP9</italic> mRNA knockdown was overcome with IFN treatment in U3A-STAT1 and U3A-STAT1-CC cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5h</xref>), indicating the difficulty in analyzing PARP9-DTX3L loss of function under IFN stimulation conditions.</p>
        <p id="P10">We next examined whether PARP9-DTX3L was capable of enhancing the antiviral function of wild-type STAT1 in U3A cells that overexpress PARP9 (U3A-STAT1-PARP9), DTX3L (U3A-STAT1-DTX3L) or PARP9 and DTX3L together (U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells). We found the control of EMCV, and SINV viral load was improved in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells but not U3A-STAT1-PARP9 or U3A-STAT1-DTX3L cells, and the beneficial effect was increased in combination with IFN treatment in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These results raised the possibility that PARP9 and DTX3L might work together with STAT1 to enhance IFN signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-ip) assays showed that PARP9 and DTX3L interacted separately or together with STAT1 with or without IFN stimulation in U3A-STAT1 cells, and immunoblotting and immunostaining showed that PARP9 and DTX3L accumulated with STAT1 in the nucleus following IFN stimulation in these cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4aâc</xref>). In addition, we found increased STAT1 binding to the <italic>IRF1</italic> promoter as assessed by X-ChIP assay, increased STAT1-driven ISRE and GAS promoter activity based on luciferase-reporter transactivation assay, and increased STAT1 nuclear localization based on cell imaging assays in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared to U3A-STAT1 cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4dâf</xref>). However, PARP9 and DTX3L interactions with STAT1 were unchanged by IFN stimulation in U3A-STAT1 cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) or STAT1 mutation (Y701F) that eliminates the IFN-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylation activation site in U3A-STAT1-Y701F cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Moreover, we found no change in IFN-driven STAT1 phosphorylation in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared to U3A-STAT1 cells or in p300/CBP recruitment to STAT1-containing transcriptional complexes in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared to U3A-STAT1 cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6b,c</xref>). This result contrasts with STAT1-driven increases and STAT1-CC-driven further increases in STAT1 phosphorylation and p300/CBP recruitment to the STAT1 transcriptional complex (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>) to increase ISG expression and antiviral function in U3A-STAT1-CC cells <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Together, these findings indicated that PARP9 and DTX3L associates with STAT1 under baseline and IFN-stimulated conditions to modulate the STAT1 nuclear localization and transcriptional activity, however the precise mechanism for PARP9-DTX3L to enhance STAT1-dependent ISG expression and antiviral function still needed to be defined.</p>

        <title>PARP9-DTX3L controls host ISG expression via histone modification</title>
        <p id="P11">We recognized from previous work on the DNA repair response that PARP9 contains N-terminal Macro1 and Macro2 domains that recognize poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) for recruitment to sites of DNA damage and that DTX3L contains a C-terminal E3 ubiquitin ligase RING domain to ubiquitinate histone H4 at those sites <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We therefore questioned whether the capacity of the PARP9-DTX3L complex to detect and modify histone H4 chromatin sites during the DNA repair response might also apply to the response to IFN stimulation. However, we did not detect histone H4 ubiquitination under baseline or IFN-stimulated conditions in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>). To define an alternative mechanism for PARP9-DTX3L to enhance ISG expression and antiviral control in these cells, we made structural predictions for targeted mutations of conserved glycine residues in the PARP9 macro domains that are needed for PAR binding <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and in the cysteine residues in the DTX3L RING domain that are needed for catalytic Zn binding <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). The mutant PARP9 protein (PARP9M) was unable to bind to PAR, while the mutant DTX3L protein (DTX3LM) lacked E3 ligase activity (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7b,c,d</xref>). We found that PARP9M-DTX3LM interaction with STAT1 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7e</xref>), interaction between PARP9M and DTX3LM (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>), and STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7g</xref>) were all preserved when we compared U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells to U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells. These results indicated that the PAR-binding activity of PARP9 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of DTX3L were not required for STAT1 binding or activation or PARP9-DTX3L complex formation.</p>
        <p id="P12">To next identify ISGs that might be regulated in response to PARP9 PAR-binding-domain and DTX3L RING-domain activities, we analyzed whole-genome expression arrays from U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells versus U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells and compared each set to U3A-STAT1 cells. We identified a set of ISGs (e.g., <italic>IFIT1, IFIT3, OASL</italic>) whose expression was enhanced in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared to U3A-STAT1 cells, but not in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells compared to U3A-STAT1 cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Further analysis with gene-specific PCR assays showed that baseline and IFN-Î²-stimulated expression of these ISGs was enhanced in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared to U3A-STAT1 cells, and this increase was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). We next determined whether the pattern for expression of these ISGs corresponded to an increase in chromatin accessibility using the Chromatin Accessibility by Real-Time (CHART) PCR assay (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7h</xref>). Indeed, we found an IFN-Î²-stimulated increase in chromatin accessibility in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared to U3A-STAT1 cells, and this increase was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7i</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Similarly, we found that antiviral function against EMCV, IAV-A/WS/33, and SINV was enhanced in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L compared to U3A-STAT1 cells, and this enhancement was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). Together, these results indicated that PARP9-DTX3L enhances ISG expression and viral control by a mechanism that does not depend on the PAR-binding function of the PARP9 macro domains but may require the ubiquitination function of the DTX3L-RING domain.</p>
        <p id="P13">We next aimed to better define the ubiquitination function of DTX3L, particularly in relation to histone ubiquitination that might be linked to chromatin accessibility for ISG expression. Given the uncertainty over which histone(s) might be DTX3L substrate(s), we used ubiquitin proteome microarrays that include representation for 29 different histones. We found that recombinant DTX3L applied to the microarray resulted in significant ubiquitination of histone H2BJ and H2AFV (isoform 3) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), indicating a high degree of selectivity for DTX3L E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Native ChIP assays showed increases in H2B ubiquitination and concomitant H3K4 methylation at the <italic>IFIT1</italic> gene promoter in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L compared to U3A-STAT1 cells, and this increase was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>). Moreover, co-ip assays demonstrated histone H2BJ binding to the PARP9-DTX3L-STAT1 complex in HEK293T cells transfected for expression of H2BJ, PARP9, and DTX3L (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7j</xref>). We also observed a relative increase in endogenous H2B (but not H2A) mono-ubiquitination in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared to U3A-STAT1 cells at 6 h after EMCV infection, and this increase was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7k</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that PARP9-DTX3L selectively ubiquitinates a subset of histones (notably H2BJ) and thereby increases histone methylation as a mechanism for chromatin remodeling and gene expression in at least a subset of ISGs (notably <italic>IFIT1</italic>) to confer enhanced antiviral function.</p>

        <title>PARP9-DTX3L uses specific domains for interaction and function</title>
        <p id="P14">To further address the role of PARP9 and STAT1 in PARP9-DTX3L actions, we identified domain-based regions of the PARP9 and DTX3L proteins (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>) for expression in HEK293T cells and used co-ip assays to map the regions of PARP9-DTX3L required for interactions with each other and with STAT1. Under baseline conditions (without IFN stimulation), DTX3L interaction with STAT1 was confined to the N-terminal portion of DTX3L, particularly the D3 domain (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>); PARP9 interaction with STAT1 was mediated through both N- and C-terminal portions of PARP9, particularly the Macro1-Macro2 and PARP domains (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Similarly, PARP9 binding to DTX3L was localized to the D3 domain of DTX3L and the PARP domain of PARP9 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). In addition, PARP9-DTX3L interactions with STAT1 were mostly unaffected by deletion of the STAT1 transactivation domain (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b,c</xref>), the site of IFN-inducible binding of p300/CBP <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.

        <p id="P15">Given these interactions (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>), we generated a mutant PARP9 lacking the PARP domain (PARP9-M12), mutant DTX3L lacking the D3 domain (DTX3L-delD3), and mutant DTX3L with only RING and DTXH domains (DTX3L-RDTXH) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f,g</xref>) for lentiviral transduction and stable expression in U3A-STAT1 cells. We found that DTX3L-delD3, which did not interact with PARP9 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>) but maintained ubiquitination activity (see below) could not control EMCV levels (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>) or induce ISG expression (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref>) in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L-delD3 cells compared to U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells.

        <title>PARP9-DTX3L initiates degradation of viral 3C proteases</title>
        <p id="P16">Since the ubiquitin-proteasome system can degrade EMCV-3C protease <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, we investigated whether PARP9-DTX3L might be an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets this protease. We found a decrease in EMCV-3C expression at 6 h after infection in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared to U3A-STAT1 cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). We detected no decrease in EMCV-3C in infected U3A cells that were not complemented for STAT1 expression (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>), consistent with a role for STAT1-dependent ISGs (e.g., <italic>PSMB, PSME</italic> and <italic>PMSF</italic>) in proteasome activity <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 1â4</xref>). Moreover, the decrease in EMCV-3C amounts persisted in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells, was lost in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells and was preserved in U3A-STAT1-DTX3L cells, but not U3A-STAT1-PARP9 cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). The observation that DTX3L alone could decrease EMCV-3C amounts, but could not fully control viral loads (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), suggests that PARP9 must also contribute to antiviral effect under IFN-stimulation or viral-infection, as well as baseline conditions. Furthermore, an inhibitor of the immunoproteasome component PSMB8 effectively attenuated EMCV-3C degradation at 6 h after infection in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L but not U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). The effect of DTX3L was specific to EMCV-3C protein degradation rather than an overall decrease in viral loads, because the effect was independent of viral RNA amounts at 6 h after infection (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). The decrease in EMCV-3C amounts persisted at 18 h after infection in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared to U3A-STAT1 cells with or without IFN-Î² treatment (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). Expression of PARP9-DTX3L or DTX3L with transient transfection in HEK293T cells also caused a decrease in EMCV-3C expression, and this effect was sensitive to blockade with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and comparable to the decrease in EMCV-3C amounts found with expression of TRIM22 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>), which has been implicated in EMCV-3C ubiquitination <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.

These cells also showed induction of endogenous PARP9-DTX3L expression with IFN-Î² or IFN-Î³ treatment and interaction of endogenous PARP9-DTX3L with STAT1 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P17">We also found that DTX3L localized with EMCV-3C and STAT1 at nuclear and cytosolic sites in EMCV-infected U3A cells based on immunostaining of U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells at 4-6 hours after infection (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>), consistent with EMCV-3C localization reported by others <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.

Similarly, we detected DTX3L binding to the <italic>IFIT1</italic> promoter in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells, and this binding was enhanced by infection with EMCV (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>), consistent with EMCV-3C-assisted traffic of PARP9-DTX3L to the nucleus and the loss of nuclear integrity during picornavirus infection. DTX3L binding to this promoter was inhibited in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>), consistent with a decrease in chromatin accessibility (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P18">These findings raised the possibility that DTX3L might contain a distinct domain to directly target viral 3C proteases for ubiquitination. Indeed, we found that DTX3L ubiquitinated EMCV-3C by using recombinant proteins in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d</xref>). DTX3L ubiquitination of EMCV-3C was not affected by titrating in various amounts of recombinant PARP9 into the <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8e</xref>), ruling against competition between the two proteins for binding to their substrate. Specificity for EMCV-3C ubiquitination was validated by purification of the His-V-EMCV-3C-Ub reaction product using Ni-NTA columns (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8f</xref>). DTX3L also ubiquitinated the related human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8g</xref>) that exhibits a similar pattern of early nuclear and late cytosolic localization during infection as the EMCV 3C protease <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> ubiquitination assays further showed DTX3L did not require PARP9 for activity against EMCV-3C or HRV-3C (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8dâg</xref>) and DTX3L could mediate K48-linked ubiquitination of EMCV-3C (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8h</xref>). Recombinant DTX3L did not ubiquitinate respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-NS1 (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8i</xref>), a viral protein implicated in ubiquitination-dependent protein degradation of host factors <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> indicating DTX3L ubiquitination was at least somewhat specific to viral 3C proteases. DTX3L-delD3 and even DTX3L-RDTXH alone maintained ubiquitin ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8j</xref>), suggesting that the RING and DTXH domains of DTX3L mediate ubiquitination and substrate recognition. Using BioLayer Interferometry (BLI), we were able to detect concentration-dependent interaction between recombinant DTX3L-RDTXH and both EMCV-3C and HRV-3C (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8k</xref>). Thus, the RING-DTXH domains of DTX3L were sufficient for recognition of EMCV-3C and HRV-3C proteases and complemented the capacity of the DTX3L-D1-3 domains to bind PARP9-STAT1. In addition, we found that ubiquitination of EMCV-3C was decreased in HEK293T cells expressing PARP9M-DTX3LM compared to PARP9-DTX3L using co-ip assays to detect V5-labeled EMCV-3C and HA-labeled Ub (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8l</xref>). Together, these results indicate that PARP9-DTX3L interacts with viral 3C proteases to target them for degradation and thus attack the pathogen directly, in concert with interaction at ISG promoters to enhance the host response to viruses.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P19">Our study shows that a single molecular complex PARP9-DTX3L mediates ubiquitination of both host histones and viral proteases to enhance IFN-dependent immunity and thereby control viral infection. We identified PARP9-DTX3L based on increased expression in a gain-of-function system wherein modification of STAT1 to STAT1-CC (containing two cysteine substitutions in the SH2 domain) enhanced the response to type I and II IFNs and thereby broadly and safely protected against otherwise lethal viral infections <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our analysis of this enhanced IFN responsiveness showed that PARP9 interacted with DTX3L and STAT1 and functioned as a chaperone to enhance the levels of the PARP9-DTX3L protein complex and STAT1-mediated ISG expression. In addition, DTX3L interacted with a subset of host histones (notably histone H2BJ) and viral proteases (specifically viral 3C proteases) to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for both of these substrates. By targeting these substrates, DTX3L tailored chromatin accessibility for expression of a specific subset of ISGs, and promoted immunoproteasome-dependent blockade of viral replication. Each of these endpoints contributed separately to control viral infection. These findings place PARP9-DTX3L in a new context and establish IFN-driven ubiquitination as a key immunomodulatory step that can be targeted to enhance IFN signaling and control infection.</p>
      <p id="P20">The multifunctional nature of PARP9-DTX3L is based on the use of distinct protein domains for interactions between PARP9, DTX3L, STAT1, and specific ubiquitination substrates (histones and viral 3C proteases). Thus, the dual function of DTX3L was mediated by binding to PARP9 via the DTX3L-D3 domain (to increase DTX3L level and consequent function) and to ubiquitnation substrates via the DTX3L-RDTXH domain (to enable viral 3C degradation and histone modification). In addition, DTX3L D1-3-domains can weakly bind and PARP9 macro and PARP domains can strongly bind to STAT1, consistent with evidence that PARP9 also interacts with STAT1 via PARP9 macro domains in B-cell lymphoma cell lines <sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. However, we found that PARP9-STAT1 binding was independent of conventional PARP macro domain binding to ADP-ribosylated histones described for the DNA repair response <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, and so appeared specially tuned to the IFN system. Since both STAT1 and EMCV-3C protease traffic to nuclear and cytosolic sites <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, PARP9-DTX3L binding to STAT1 and EMCV-3C protease allows at least two aids for the PARP9-DTX3L complex to also traffic to these two sites. This fits with detection of the PARP9-DTX3L-STAT1-EMCV-3C complex at both sites during infection, and the capacities of the PARP9-DTX3L complex to control viral and host gene expression in the nucleus and viral assembly in the cytosplasm. Since we also found that PARP-DTX3L-STAT1 interaction occurs during baseline conditions, the complex appears ready in advance of infection. Moreover, PARP9 enhanced DTX3L protein levels and PARP9-DTX3L in turn promoted <italic>PARP9</italic> and <italic>DTX3L</italic> gene expression, so that PARP9-DTX3L complex formation can also auto-amplify in response to IFN production that develops after infection.</p>
      <p id="P21">The presently described properties of PARP9-DTX3L appear to be distinct from other PARP family members in regard to the antiviral or IFN response. For example, PARP1 directly poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates viral proteins to control viral replication <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. By contrast, PARP9 completely lacks PARP enzymatic activity. PARP13 (ZAP) interacts directly with viral proteins but recruits the RNA exosome to mediate degradation without a ubiquitination mechanism <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, and PARP13 shorter isoform (ZAPS) associates with RIG-I to increase expression of IFN and other cytokines as an antiviral mechanism <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. PARP12L, PARP7, and PARP10 may also have some antiviral activity, but the basis for this activity was linked to translation of viral and cellular RNA <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. PARP14 regulates STAT6 activity, but in contrast to PARP9-DTX3L, PARP enzymatic activity was again required, no E3 ligase partner was identified, and DNA binding was undetectable <sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. In addition, we found no decrease in STAT1 level or function with PARP9-DTX3L overexpression. Therefore, PARP9-DTX3L action is also distinct from E3 ubiquitin ligases that target STAT1 to down-regulate IFN signaling <sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P22">The identification of PARP9-DTX3L actions could provide valuable lessons to harness a safe reserve in the IFN signaling pathway for therapeutic benefit. In particular, we learned that PARP9-DTX3L contains modules for interaction with each other and with STAT1, specific cellular histones, and viral 3C proteases to control viral infection at two levels (host ISG expression and viral 3C protease degradation) and two cellular sites (nucleus and cytoplasm). It therefore appears critical to understand and retain the multifunctional nature of PARP9-DTX3L to safely and effectively enhance IFN signal performance. We also learned that PARP9-DTX3L is specially suited to control viral 3C proteases, which along with 3C-like proteases are required for the wide range of common picornaviruses and other important pathogens in the picornavirus-like supercluster that includes certain coronaviruses and caliciviruses <sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Thus, PARP9-DTX3L provides a particular roadmap to guide translation towards a broad-acting next-generation therapeutic for this class of viruses. Indeed, small-molecule interferon-signal enhancer (SMISE) compounds were identified in a cell-based screen for ISRE-driven luciferase reporter activity and were shown to increase host ISG expression and control EMCV and HRV levels in 2fTGH cells and primary-culture human airway epithelial cells <sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Whether these compounds also promote viral 3C protease degradation and depend on PARP9-DTX3L expression for antiviral activity still needs to be determined. Nonetheless, SMISE-type agents that mimic the antiviral mechanism of STAT1-CC and PARP9-DTX3L expression should help to fill the unmet need for protecting against the acute illness and chronic inflammatory disease that develops with picornavirus infection <sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and perhaps the need for therapy of other IFN-sensitive conditions.</p>

CHART PCR assays for human <italic>IFIT1</italic> promoter were performed using the following forward and reverse primers: 5â²-CAGCAGGAATTCCGCTAGC-3â² and 5â²-GCCAATGGTGTAAGCTGTGG-3â² and the probe: 5â²-TGTGTCCTTGCAAGTTGGA to cover ISRE sequence. Normalization of Avr IIâcutting DNA samples was performed against 2 kb upstream genomic sequence of ISRE site lacking Avr II restriction site by real-time PCR. The following primers and probe were used for this PCR: 5â²-CATAACTGGTCAGTCCCTTGC-3â² as a forward primer and 5â²-TCAGCACTAGGTTGTGAGTTCG-3â² as a reverse primers, and the probe: 5â²-AGCCCAGCTTAGACTCCT-3â² <sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>. The relative accessible chromatin DNA was calculated as percentage of the IFN-Î² (1000 U/ml) stimulated Avr II-cutting samples divided by non-IFN-Î² stimulated Avr II-cutting samples.</p>

        <p id="P40">Possible substrates of DTX3L were identified using a 17,000 protein microarray (E3 Substrate ID, Catalog #MA102) from CDI Laboratories (Mayaguez, PR). Microarrays were incubated with recombinant E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 (UBE2D1) ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, ubiquitin, and ATP with or without recombinant DTX3L and ubiquitinated substrates were detected with tandem ubiquitin-binding entities (TUBEs) <sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> using the system from LifeSensors, Inc. (Malvern, PA). Comparisons between conditions with and without DTX3L were analyzed using methods described previously <sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> and below for analysis of gene expression microarrays. For data analysis, GenePix generated data files containing signal intensities from the test sample (with DTX3L added) and background control sample (without DTX3L added). The median intensity values were processed using the R package âlimmaâ for: (1) background correction using the saddle model; (2) normalization by positive control spots (e.g., IgG555/647); and (3) additional normalization by array printer tip and location. Using this normalization process, an M value [log2 test â log2 control value) and A value [(log2 test + log2 control value)/2] were generated for each spot on the array. All proteins with M value &lt; 0, signifying a lower signal in the test sample than in the control sample, were removed without further analysis. For the remaining proteins, the M values of duplicate spots for a protein on the array were subjected to paired t-test to determine statistical significance.</p>

Cells were treated with IFN-Î² (1 U/ml) for 16 h. The cell pellet was suspended in 2 ml N-ChIP buffer I (0.3 M Sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EGTA, 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors), then 2 ml of N-ChIP buffer with 0.4% NP-40, and then 8 ml of N-ChIP buffer with 1.2 M sucrose instead of 0.3 M sucrose. The mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 30 min, and the nuclei-containing pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of digestion buffer and then micrococcal nuclease (100 units in 1 Î¼l, Thermo Scientific) was added for 7 minutes at 37 Â°C. Nucleosomes were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of N-ChIP dialysis buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM EDTA), and then dialyzed overnight at 4 Â°C. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and to immunoprecipitation using the same procedure as for X-ChIP but with mouse anti-histone H2B-Ub mAb (Millipore), anti-histone H3K4me3 Ab (Abcam), or rabbit anti-histone H2B Ab (Millipore).</p>

For EMCV-3C degradation, EMCV-3C cDNA was amplified from EMCV virus stock, confirmed with sequencing, tagged with V5, and inserted into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. The pCI-His-Ub plasmid was a gift of A. Winoto (Addgene plasmid #31815), and pHA-Ubiquitin plasmid was a gift of E. Yeh (Addgene plasmid #18712). The TRIM22 plasmid was from GeneCopoeia. Cells were transfected with V5-EMCV-3C and His-Ub vectors using X-tremeGene 9 (Roche), and 36 h later were treated with or without 20 Î¼M MG-132 for 14 h before lysis and Immunoblotting. For EMCV-3C ubiquitination, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 mAb conjugated to agarose (Sigma), eluted with 1% SDS, subsequently diluted to 0.1% SDS, reprecipitated with anti-V5 mAb (Invitrogen), and then Immunoblotted with anti-HA Ub mAb (Sigma) followed by anti-V5 Ab.</p>

Analysis of DTX3L-RING-DTXH binding to EMCV-3C and HRV-3C was assessed using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) with an Octet (ForteBio). Streptavidin-coated biosensors from ForteBio were used to capture biotinylated proteins onto the surface of the sensor. After reaching baseline, sensors were moved to association step for 300 sec and then dissociation for 300 sec. Curves were corrected by a subtraction of signal from a reference pin. The running buffer consisted of 10 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween, and 1% BSA.</p>
