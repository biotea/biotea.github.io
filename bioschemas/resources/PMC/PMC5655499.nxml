      <abstract>
        <p>zDHHC <italic>S</italic>-acyltransferases are enzymes catalyzing protein <italic>S</italic>-acylation, a common post-translational modification on proteins frequently affecting their membrane targeting and trafficking. The ankyrin repeat (AR) domain of zDHHC17 (HIP14) and zDHHC13 (HIP14L) <italic>S</italic>-acyltransferases, which is involved in both substrate recruitment and <italic>S</italic>-acylation-independent functions, was recently shown to bind at least six proteins, by specific recognition of a consensus sequence in them. To further refine the rules governing binding to the AR of zDHHC17, we employed peptide arrays based on zDHHC AR-binding motif (zDABM) sequences of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and cysteine string protein Î± (CSPÎ±). Quantitative comparisons of the binding preferences of 400 peptides allowed us to construct a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) for zDHHC17 AR binding, with which we predicted and subsequently validated many putative zDHHC17 interactors. We identified 95 human zDABM sequences with unexpected versatility in amino acid usage; these sequences were distributed among 90 proteins, of which 62 have not been previously implicated in zDHHC17/13 binding. These zDABM-containing proteins included all family members of the SNAP25, sprouty, cornifelin, ankyrin, and SLAIN-motif containing families; seven endogenous Gag polyproteins sharing the same binding sequence; and several proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, cell communication, and regulation of signaling. A dozen of the zDABM-containing proteins had more than one zDABM sequence, whereas isoform-specific binding to the AR of zDHHC17 was identified for the Ena/VASP-like protein. The large number of zDABM sequences within the human proteome suggests that zDHHC17 may be an interaction hub regulating many cellular processes.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein <italic>S</italic>-acylation, the reversible attachment of fatty acids onto cysteines, is a widespread post-translational modification. The regulatory effects of <italic>S</italic>-acylation are protein-specific but this modification typically impacts membrane binding, intracellular trafficking, protein stability, and protein-protein interactions (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">â</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p><italic>S</italic>-Acylation reactions are mediated by the large (24 isoforms in humans) zDHHC enzyme family. Collectively, these enzymes are responsible for the modification of up to 10% of the proteome (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, we currently lack a detailed understanding of substrate specificity in the zDHHC family, since knowledge about the enzymes that modify specific proteins is sparse.</p><p>The zDHHC13 and zDHHC17 enzyme isoforms contain N-terminal ankyrin repeat (AR)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1"><sup>3</sup></xref> domains. AR domains are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, and indeed our previous work (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and that of others (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">â</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), demonstrated that the AR domains of these zDHHC enzymes are involved in both substrate binding as well as <italic>S</italic>-acylation-independent functions.</p><p>Efforts to profile zDHHC enzyme substrates and binding partners have had limited success to date, with proteomics analysis of zDHHC knock-out samples only revealing a small number of high-confidence targets (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This might reflect the use of gene-trap models with residual zDHHC expression, or the partial overlap in the zDHHC isoforms that can modify a specific protein. To examine zDHHC-substrate specificity and interactions, we have adopted a different strategy that involves the identification of a âconsensusâ recognition motif for the AR domains of zDHHC17 and zDHHC13. We previously showed that a (VIAP)(VIT)<italic>XX</italic>QP motif present in several targets of zDHHC17/13 mediates interaction with these enzymes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). To capitalize on this novel observation, we have now undertaken peptide array mapping to generate a set of sequence rules for zDHHC17 binding. These sequence rules have allowed the prediction and validation of binding sites in a wide range of cell proteins. We now term this sequence motif as zDABM (zDHHC-AR-binding motif).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Establishment of sequence rules governing binding of peptides to the AR of zDHHC17</title><p>Peptide arrays consisting of 15-mers of SNAP25 and CSPÎ± peptides were constructed, with all amino acids within a 10-amino acid region containing the zDABM serially substituted to any possible amino acid. Binding of purified His<sub>6</sub>-tagged AR domain (residues 51â288) of zDHHC17 (ARzD17-His) to each of these peptides was subsequently assessed by far-Western blotting using a histidine tag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Binding of ARzD17-His was more sensitive to alterations of amino acids at positions 2â3 and 6â7 for both SNAP25 and CSPÎ± peptides; however, amino acid preferences at position 2 for the ARzD17-His binding were slightly different for SNAP25 and CSPÎ± (<italic>e.g.</italic> preference for proline in CSPÎ±), whereas additional sensitivity at position 9 was observed for SNAP25 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Interestingly, cysteine and methionine could compensate well for the loss of glutamine at position 6 in both SNAP25 and CSPÎ±. Additionally, as derived from both SNAP25 and CSPÎ± arrays, no amino acid preference for ARzD17-binding was observed at position 1; amino acids glycine and proline were strongly disfavored at positions 4 and 5; and negatively charged (Asp and Glu) amino acids were disfavored at positions 8â10.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Assessment of amino acid preferences for binding to the AR domain of zDHHC17.</bold> SNAP25 and CSPÎ± 15-mer peptides having all possible amino acid substitutions within a 10-amino acid region were constructed on peptide arrays. The ability of each peptide to interact with the AR of zDHHC17 was assessed by far-Western blotting, using a histidine-tagged purified human AR domain of zDHHC17 (ARzD17-His; 51â288 amino acids), and detection using a histidine tag antibody. Corresponding sequence logos showing preferences for each amino acid within these 10-amino acid stretches were subsequently created. Signals for each peptide spot were quantified and normalized against the average signal of wild-type peptides for each protein. Peptides having signal intensities less than 5% of wild-type peptides were considered non-binders and were penalized with a score of zero; the rest were expressed as frequencies (normalized so that the sum of scores for each position equals to 1). The derived PSSMs (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.799650/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>) were used for the generation of sequence logos (generated by Seq2Logo; Shannon type with no clustering method).

A total of 533,409 peptides were scored (Scansite scores ranging from 0.1931 to 2), with only a minority of peptides occupying lower (and thus best matching) scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.799650/DC1">supplemental Table S1</ext-link>). Modified z-scores (number of S.D., below the median Scansite score) were also calculated for each scored peptide. Peptides having modified z-scores above 6 (Scansite scores below 0.6601) were considered as high confidence hits; both SNAP25 and CSPÎ±, as well as Huntingtin (HTT) and SNAP23, from the previously identified zDABM sequences (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), were scored within this range, which corresponds to only the top 0.11% percentile of the scored peptides; medium and low confidence levels were arbitrary chosen to include peptides having modified z-scores between 5 and 6, and between 3 and 5, respectively; within these three confidence levels all six previously reported zDABM sequences (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) are scored as good matches for ARzD17-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), and this range accounts for the top 5% percentile of the scored peptides.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Procedure used for the <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of zDHHC-AR-binding motif (zDABM) sequences across the human proteome.</bold> A hybrid SNAP25 and CSPÎ± PSSM was created, from averaging scores from individual SNAP25 and CSPÎ± PSSMs (derived from quantification of far-Western blots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and adjusting this PSSM for Scansite, with Pro at position 7 assigned as a fixed amino acid (see âExperimental proceduresâ for details). The derived PSSM was used for matching peptides across the human proteome (SwissProt database; UniProt release 2011_11). The number of peptides scored and the distribution of peptides for each score are shown. Selected hits with Scansite scores ranging between 0.2 and 1.4 (see âExperimental proceduresâ for more details) were filtered for cytosolic localization and disorder prediction to be included for validation of ARzD17 binding. Peptides with a modified z-score (number of S.D. below the median Scansite score â1.663) above 6 were considered as high confidence hits. The positions in the histogram of the six peptides that have been previously shown to bind to the AR of zDHHC17 and zDHHC13 are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0451775650002"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Validation of putative zDABM sequences for binding to the AR domain of zDHHC17</title><p>More than 2,600 sequences deriving from the Scansite search were analyzed for cytosolic localization and disorder (for more information see âExperimental proceduresâ and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.799650/DC1">supplemental Table S1</ext-link>). We identified a total of 590 disordered and cytosol-localized sequences, which were distributed among 224 proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.799650/DC1">supplemental Table S2</ext-link>). 107 of these peptides (distributed in 96 proteins) were chosen for assessment of binding to ARzD17-His; these included 51 high confidence sequences, 28 medium confidence sequences, 26 low confidence sequences, and 2 sequences below the lowest confidence threshold level. 40 of the 107 sequences derived from proteins are either known or are speculated to be zDHHC17 interactors. One sequence from the nuclear MAX gene-associated protein (MGAP), for which no cytosolic localization has been documented, was also included in peptide synthesis to serve as positive control, because this was at the top 0.01% percentile, with a Scansite score below 0.4 and a modified z-score above 7.5. Additionally, two non-natural peptides were synthesized: one with a highly favorable ARzD17-binding amino acid sequence, and another one with a highly disfavorable amino acid sequence (according to the SNAP25-CSPÎ± PSSM); these two peptides, served as positive and negative controls, respectively.</p><p>12-mer peptides of the 109 sequences mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>E</italic>) were synthesized in an array, and their ability to bind ARzD17 was assessed by far-Western blot analysis, using purified ARzD17-His and detection with histidine tag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). A total of 96 natural occurring zDABM sequences were identified. As expected, the artificial favorable peptide was a strong binder, whereas binding of the artificial disfavorable peptide to ARzD17 was hardly detected. Surprisingly, the zDABM sequence of MAP6, although previously found to be involved in interaction with the AR domain of zDHHC17/13 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), was not sufficient to promote ARzD17 interaction on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>), which suggests that MAP6 may require a sequence greater than 12 amino acids, or additional domains for stable interaction with zDHHC17. All high confidence hits tested (51 sequences with z-scores above 6, including MGAP) were able to bind ARzD17 quite strongly, whereas at lower threshold levels, a number of weak binders or no-binders appeared, along with the strong binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Validation of predicted zDABM sequences.</bold> A peptide array was constructed comprising a total of 109 12-mer peptides, which correspond to 107 human sequences, and two artificial sequences: one expected to bind ARzD17 (favorable peptide) and one not expected to bind (disfavorable peptide). Binding to ARzD17 was assessed by far-Western blotting using purified human ARzD17-His (51â288 amino acids) and detection with a histidine tag antibody.

The resulting amino acid frequencies for each position reveal an unexpected versatility in amino acid usage for ARzD17-binding, as well as marked absence of particular amino acids (such as Glu, Asp, Asn, Cys, Phe, Met, Trp, and Tyr) in all positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D</italic>). Serine, on the other hand was the most favorable amino acid, but in positions less critical for binding. Putative phosphorylation of these serine residues is expected to negatively affect ARzD17-binding, because no negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) are favored for binding at equivalent positions.

To assess whether this domain or a zDABM sequence is involved in zDHHC17 interaction, we utilized both full-length SPRED2, as well as two truncation mutants lacking, either the SPR domain, or both the SPR and a region containing the zDABM sequence (SPRED2 has only one zDABM sequence).

Matings co-expressing zDHHC17/13 and SPRED2 are able to grow in media lacking adenine and histidine only upon the zDHHC-SPRED2 interaction, because the latter will lead to the reassembly of ubiquitin, its recognition by ubiquitin-specific proteases, and the subsequent cleavage and translocation of the PLV transcription factor to the nucleus, where it can activate genes essential for adenine and histidine synthesis.

PAI-RBP1 presumably utilizes 2 different sequences for ARzD17-binding, and both of them have arginine instead of glutamine at position 7; SLAIN1 on the other hand, may use 2â3 different sequences for ARzD17-binding, each having unfavorable amino acids at positions 2â3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>).

The binding profile of this comprehensive set of peptides enabled us, not only to construct a sequence rule-based consensus for ARzD17 binding, but also to search for and subsequently validate a large number of human sequences as zDABM-bearing sequences. The striking preference for specific amino acids at positions 2â3 (aliphatic ones) and 6â7 (QP dipeptide) within zDABM sequences observed before (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) has been confirmed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Indeed a very recent structural study (Ref. <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>; published while this paper was under review) showed that the above residues in SNAP25 zDABM form a number of important contacts with a region between ankyrin repeats 1 and 3 of zDHHC17; more specifically, interactions between, Val-113 and Pro-117 of the analyzed SNAP25 peptide, and Asn-100 and Trp-130, respectively, of zDHHC17, were found to be particularly important. Nevertheless, despite the striking preference for particular amino acids in these positions, a large number of peptides having non-favorable amino acids at those positions are still able to bind strongly to ARzD17. The favoritism for certain amino acids at various positions thus seems to be influenced by the surrounding amino acids within the zDABM sequence: for example, the amino acid sequence of the SNAP25 zDABM has a strong preference for lysine or arginine at position 9, whereas the CSPÎ± zDABM permits a wider variety of residues at this position; the CSPÎ± zDABM also strongly favors proline and alanine at position 2, which are either less favored or disfavored for ARzD17-binding, respectively, in the SNAP25 sequence; similarly, the disfavored dipeptide sequences at positions 2â3, YP and SK, appear to be permitted/favored in the zDABM sequences of PDE4D (Pro-46) and SLAIN1 (Pro-541), respectively. zDABM sequences thus appear very versatile in the usage of amino acids.</p><p>Although the sequence assessment of non-binders and binders could hardly indicate amino acids that are absolutely detrimental for ARzD17-binding, the binding pattern of the over 500 peptides tested in our study reveals marked preferences for particular amino acids at certain positions, and at the same time strong lack of preference for other amino acids (Asn, Asp, Glu, Cys, Phe, Met, Trp, and Tyr) at all positions tested; the latter partly reflects the propensity of certain amino acids (Cys, Phe, Met, Trp, and Tyr) not to be present in disordered regions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The strong preference for positively charged residues (Arg and Lys) over negatively charged ones (Asp and Glu) at certain positions (4 and 9), as well as the general lack of preference of negatively charged residues, indicates the possible existence of a negatively charged patch in or around the zDABM-binding pocket in zDHHC17. Indeed, Glu-89 and Asp-122 of zDHHC17, which contribute to the interaction with the zDABM sequence of SNAP25, may provide the negative charge involved in favoring positive over negative charged residues in zDABM sequences (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Additionally, a strong preference for serine residues at the less critical binding positions was observed within the confirmed and highly predicted sets of zDABM sequences. Putative phosphorylation of these serines is expected to impair binding to the AR domain of zDHHC17/13. A phosphorylation-dependent binding switch-off has been previously documented for the Ankyrin repeat of ANKRA2 and the phosphorylated LYTSP(pS)LPNITL sequence of HDAC4 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Unexpectedly, cysteine and methionine were found to compensate reasonably well for the lack of glutamine at position 7. The reason for that is unclear, because Gln-116 of a SNAP25 peptide is involved in hydrogen bonding with Glu-89 and Asp-122 of zDHHC17 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and both cysteine and methionine would be unable to substitute these bonds. It is possible that some substitutions force peptides to create new bonds, originally absent in wild-type proteins, and such flexibility in new bond formation was recently shown for Gln-116 of SNAP25 upon zDHHC17 binding (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Despite the versatility of amino acid usage at critical binding positions of zDABM sequences, our approach could accurately predict a large number of zDABM sequences, with 100% accuracy (51 tested) for peptides with modified z-scores above 6 (Scansite scores below 0.6601). In total, we were able to identify zDABM sequences in 28 of the known and speculated zDHHC17/13 interactors, and in 62 proteins not previously implicated in zDHHC17/13-binding. Seven of these novel zDHHC17 interactors are retrovirus group K Gag polyproteins sharing the same zDABM sequence. Increased mRNA levels of such proteins have been linked with cancer and a number of autoimmune and neurological diseases (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Whether zDHHC17-binding can enhance or prevent such processes remains to be found. Other families whose members were enriched among zDABM-containing proteins were: the Sprouty, Ankyrin, Cornifelin, and SLAIN-motif families, whereas 2 members of the Sprouty-related EVH1-domain containing (SPRED) protein family were identified to have zDABM sequences.</p><p>Sprouty and SPRED proteins are known to be negative regulators of MAPK signaling and may thus function as tumor suppressors (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), whereas SPRED1 and SPRED2 have been additionally found to be negative regulators of hematopoiesis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Because zDHHC17 has an oncogenic potential upon overexpression (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and is up-regulated in cells overexpressing an essential hematopoiesis transcription factor (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), it is expected that the interaction of zDHHC17 with Sprouty and SPRED proteins would negatively regulate the functions of the latter.</p><p>Ankyrins are major scaffolding proteins that coordinate membrane transporters and cell adhesion proteins within plasma membrane compartments (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>); these functions depend heavily on Ankyrin palmitoylation, but among all zDHHC <italic>S</italic>-acyltransferases, only zDHHC5 and zDHHC8 were found to be able to mediate Ankyrin 3 palmitoylation (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).

This protein was recently found to be palmitoylated on 5 different sites and to be a substrate of zDHHC13 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>); because zDHHC17 has been shown to have greater activity than zDHHC13 for all interacting proteins tested (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), it is expected that zDHHC17 is able to palmitoylate Cornifelin as well. The placenta-specific gene 8 protein (PLAC8) and PLAC8-like protein 1 (PLAC8L1) also belong to the Cornifelin family. Both proteins, like Cornifelin, have four predicted palmitoylation sites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.799650/DC1">supplemental Table S3</ext-link>) and an N-terminal zDABM sequence. Hence, these are also likely to be palmitoylated by zDHHC17 and zDHHC13. Although PLAC8 seems to have functions important for a range of processes like immunity (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), brown and white fat cell differentiation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and autophagy (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), the function for PLAC8L1 is currently unknown.</p><p>SLAIN-motif proteins (SLAIN1 and SLAIN2) are enriched in brain and promote microtubule growth by recruiting the microtubule polymerase ch-TOG to microtubule plus-ends (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Furthermore, loss of function mutations of SLAIN1 (as well as of MAPK8, which was also identified as zDABM-protein in our screening) are associated with intellectual disability (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). How the zDHHC17 interaction with SLAIN-motif proteins regulates these functions is currently unknown.</p><p>SLAIN-motif proteins and Ankyrins are only some of the many neuronal zDABM-containing proteins with roles in cytoskeletal organization and regulation of cell communication, respectively, whereas proteins that regulate signaling, like SPRED and Sprouty, are also very common among zDABM proteins. Importantly, these three processes often converge, especially in brain cells, with neurons executing their function by efficiently communicating with other neurons, as well as glial cells, and transmitting various signals either intracellularly or extracellularly via a network of cell adhesion proteins and cytoskeleton-associated proteins. Hence zDHHC17 may be an important regulator of communicative networks in the brain. Indeed, a sharp decrease in zDHHC17 expression in mice results in numerous behavioral and synaptic deficits (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), which get more severe and become incompatible with life, when zDHHC17 is completely lost (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). These deficits are associated with striatal dysfunction, astrogliosis, and microgliosis (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The regulation of actin- and microtubule-based processes by zDHHC17 in neurons is probably reflected by the fact that, loss of zDHHC17 in zebrafish, neuronal stem cells, or PC12 cells causes defects in axonal outgrowth (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The actin-associated EVL protein is a recently identified zDHHC17 interactor (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), which is involved, along with other Ena/VASP proteins, in neuritogenesis and axon formation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Rat cortical neurons and glial cells contain two alternatively spliced isoforms of EVL differing in a 21-amino acid sequence (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), whereas similar alternatively spliced products are also reported in frogs (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Here, we show that alternatively spliced products differing in this sequence exist in humans too, and that the AR of zDHHC17 can only bind EVL when this extra sequence is present; thus EVL binding to zDHHC17 can serve functions associated only with the longer EVL isoform. The latter isoform has been reported to be phosphorylated by protein kinase D on this extra sequence (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), but distal to the zDABM sequence. The exact role of the modification is not known; however, the phosphorylated EVL longer isoform was found to be enriched in tight cell junctions (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, a zDABM-containing peptide of the microtubule-associated protein 6 (MAP6) was not sufficient for binding to the AR domain of zDHHC17. This sequence is known to be implicated in ARzD17/13-binding, because alanine substitution of the conserved proline does impair binding (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Hence, the zDHHC17/13-MAP6 interaction may require either a longer MAP6-peptide sequence than typically required for zDABMs, or a second interface to stabilize the interaction. It is currently established that structures comprised of 4â6 ankyrin repeats can support binding of up to 8-amino acid peptide stretches (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">â</xref><xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), whereas considerably longer peptide sequences of sodium channel Nav1.2 and Neurofascin peptides (28 and 95 amino acid peptides, respectively) are required for efficient interaction with the 24 ankyrin repeats of Ankyrin proteins (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Thus the 7 ankyrin repeats of zDHHC17 and zDHHC13 AR domains may be able to accommodate slightly longer than 8-amino acid long sequences, with the exact length being dependent on the individual sequence of each protein. In the case of SNAP25, a longer than 10-amino acid sequence seems to be required for maximal zDHHC17-binding, because a 10-amino acid stretch of SNAP25 could not support a strong interaction with the ARzD17, as full-length SNAP25 could (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Additionally, the analysis of amino acid frequencies among zDABM-containing proteins has been revealed as disfavorable for ARzD17-binding amino acids in the whole 12-amino acid stretch assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D</italic>), which indicates that many proteins may need sequences of 12 amino acids or longer for efficient ARzD17-binding.</p><p>In this work we found that the AR of zDHHC17 could interact with two different sequences located in the same protein, for at least 12 of the 17 proteins tested. Thus a greater number of zDHHC17 binders with two zDABM sequences may potentially exist. Moreover, given that more than 10 putative zDABM sequences per protein were found for certain proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.799650/DC1">supplemental Table S2</ext-link>), it is possible that zDHHC17 may recognize more than 2 sequences within these and other proteins. The above indicate that the AR domain of zDHHC17 (and potentially of zDHHC13) has the capacity to engage with a given number of proteins in different ways, thus forming different complexes according to the way that each protein is presented to its AR domain. This means that blockage of zDHHC17 binding on one site of a protein (<italic>i.e.</italic> by phosphorylation or binding to another protein) may result on this protein being bound to zDHHC17 using a different site; this may subsequently result in a different function executed due to this alternative binding. The ability of zDHHC17 to bind such a large number of sequences with relaxed rules for binding may thus enable this enzyme to bind a plethora of proteins under different orientations; zDHHC17 may thus be a hub for many interactions responsible for dynamic regulation of a multitude of processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Chemicals and antibodies</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Dorset, UK). Mouse His<sub>6</sub> tag antibody (ab18184) was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), rat HA from Roche Applied Science (Sussex, UK), and mouse GFP (JL8) from Clontech. Secondary IRDye mouse antibodies were from LI-COR (Cambridge, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning, mutagenesis, and protein purification</title><p>With the exception of human ARzD17-His protein (His-tagged ankyrin-repeat domain of zDHHC17), which is described below, and murine zDHHC17 in HA-pEF-BOS, which was kindly provided by Masaki Fukata (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), all cDNAs were cloned by Gateway technology (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), using the manufacturer's kits and instructions (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). PCR and site-directed mutagenesis reactions for insertion of STOP codons were performed using a KOD hot-start polymerase kit according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Merck Millipore, Watford, UK). Primers for introducing Gateway compatible adapters by PCR (attB-PCR) were purchased from Life Technologies, whereas primers for site-directed mutagenesis, or PCR amplification with restriction adapters, were purchased from Sigma. All site-directed mutagenesis reactions occurred in entry clones and were confirmed by sequencing (GATC service, Constance, Germany). Original cDNAs used for cloning were as follows: human zDHHC17 was provided by Michael Hayden (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), murine zDHHC17 and zDHHC13 (DHHC22) was provided by Masaki Fukata (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), murine SPRED2 was provided by Akihiko Yoshimura (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), whereas human SLAIN1 (isoform 2), PAI-RBP1 (isoform 3), and EVL (isoforms 1 and 5) were isolated from a human embryonic cDNA brain library. Although isoform 2 of SLAIN1 and isoform 3 of PAI-RBP1 are lacking sequences present in the canonical isoforms of these proteins, they both have all the zDABM sequences predicted in the canonical isoforms.</p><p>For the production of pET303-ARzD17-His plasmid, a human zDHHC17 cDNA fragment (encoding for either 51â288 or 51â304 amino acids) was amplified by PCR using appropriate primers containing also the XbaI and XhoI restriction sites, and the resulting PCR product was subcloned into pET303CT-His plasmid (Life Technologies), following XbaI and XhoI digestion. The resulting protein (51â288 or 51â304 amino acids of human zDHHC17, followed by a Leu-Glu linker and a His<sub>6</sub> tag) was purified from transformed BL21(DE3)pLysS bacterial cells (Life Technologies), as described previously for murine His<sub>6</sub>-AR<sub>D17</sub> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Protein concentration was estimated by Nanodrop 2000c measurement.</p></sec><sec><title>Far-Western blots</title><p>Peptide libraries were produced by automatic SPOT synthesis (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). They were synthesized on continuous cellulose membrane supports on Whatman 50 cellulose membranes using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) chemistry with the AutoSpot-Robot ASS 222 (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments, Berlin) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The SNAP25 and CSPÎ± arrays consisted of 15-mer peptides (200 peptides each), with all possible amino acid substitutions within a 10-amino acid stretch (sequences and serial substitution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The dried membranes were submerged in 100% ethanol for 2 min, washed briefly with distilled water, and then incubated with blocking buffer: 5% (w/v) milk in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.02% Tween) for 2 h at room temperature. Then, after a brief washing with PBS-T, overnight incubation with the ARzD17-His protein (500 n<sc>m</sc> in PBS-T) took place at 4 Â°C. Membranes were then washed extensively with PBS-T, incubated with mouse His<sub>6</sub> tag antibody (1/2,000 dilution in PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature, washed again with PBS-T, incubated with mouse secondary antibody (1/10,000 dilution in PBS-T), and after extensive washes with PBS-T containing 0.2% Tween, ARzD17-His-bound peptides were visualized using a LI-COR infrared scanner. Spots were quantified using Image Studio software (version 2.0), with an area of the blot containing no peptide assigned as background.</p></sec><sec><title>PSSMs</title><p>Derived signals from quantification were normalized against the average signal intensity of wild-type peptides for either SNAP25 or CSPÎ±. Peptides displaying signals that were less than 5% of average wild-type intensities were considered non-binders and were thus given a score of: (<italic>a</italic>) zero for PSSMs to be used for generation of sequence logos, or (<italic>b</italic>) a score of 0.05 for PSSMs intended to be used for Scansite. The rest of the signals were expressed as frequencies: signals were normalized so that the sum of scores for each peptides equals (<italic>a</italic>) 1 for each position for PSSMs used for sequence logo generation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.799650/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>), or (<italic>b</italic>) 20 in PSSMs to be used for Scansite search. For Scansite search, a hybrid PSSM was subsequently produced by averaging each of the scores (ranging from 0.05 to 20) from SNAP25 and CSPÎ± PSSMs. Proline at position 7 was then assigned as the fixed residue: the Pro substitution was given a score of 21 in the hybrid PSSM, whereas all other substitutions at that position were given a score equal to zero (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.799650/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>B</italic></ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>In silico prediction of zDABM human sequences</title><p>The hybrid SNAP25-CSPÎ± PSSM (with the Pro assigned as fixed residue at position 7) was selected as the âinput motifâ in Scansite 3 for the search of human sequences (SwissProt database; 2011_11 release) matching this motif. Modified z-scores (number of S.D. below the median Scansite score) were also calculated for each peptide. Because zDABM sequences are positioned within disordered regions (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and they need to be cytosolic to physically interact with zDHHC17 (and/or zDHHC13), selected hits were validated for disorder and cytosolic localization; these included all sequences from proteins with modified z-scores above 6, and a number of sequences with modified z-scores above 3, including other sequences from the above proteins, all known and speculated zDHHC17/zDHHC13 interactors, and a few randomly selected peptides/proteins. Some of the sequences with modified z-scores ranging from 1.5 to 3, derived from all the above proteins, were also analyzed. The known and speculated zDHHC17 interactors to be analyzed were picked from the zDHHC17 interactor list reviewed by Butland <italic>et al.</italic> in 2014 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and the most recently identified interactors and substrates of zDHHC17 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Additionally, proteins whose palmitoylation was decreased in zDHHC17-deficient mice (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the known zDHHC13 substrate cornifelin (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and related proteins were also included in the analysis. We first excluded sequences for which luminal, nuclear-only, mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and extracellular localization has been shown/proposed, as well as those that are predicted to be within transmembrane helices, or are located in regions previously crystallized (and are thus structured). For the remaining sequences in our list, we predicted disorder using either the DISOPRED3 tool (within the PSIPRED server; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/">bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/</ext-link>),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>4</sup></xref> or the PrDOS tool (Protein DisOrder Prediction; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prdos.hgc.jp/cgi-bin/top.cgi">prdos.hgc.jp/cgi-bin/top.cgi</ext-link>),<sup>4</sup> these two have been evaluated as the two most reliable disorder prediction tools, among the 28 prediction groups tested, by the recent Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction, CASP10 (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). From the sequences predicted to be cytosolic and disordered (at least 8 amino acids with a 10-amino acid stretch with Pro at position 7), 51 of the predicted top-scoring hits (modified z-scores above 6), and 56 other sequences with lower scores were synthesized as 12-mer peptides (positions 0â11) to be validated for ARzD17 binding.</p></sec><sec><title>SUS</title><p>5 Î¼l of yeast matings expressing both zDHHC-Cub-PLV bait and NubG-2HA-tagged prey at corresponding optic densities (<italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub>) were dropped on synthetic defined (SD) media, to assess interactions, and on SD media supplemented with adenine and histidine to verify equal optical density among matings.
