      <abstract>
        <p>Viral infection triggers induction of type I interferons (IFNs), which are critical mediators of innate antiviral immune response. Mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA, also called STING) is an adapter essential for virus-triggered IFN induction pathways. How post-translational modifications regulate the activity of MITA is not fully elucidated. In expression screens, we identified RING finger protein 26 (RNF26), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, could mediate polyubiquitination of MITA. Interestingly, RNF26 promoted K11-linked polyubiquitination of MITA at lysine 150, a residue also targeted by RNF5 for K48-linked polyubiquitination. Further experiments indicated that RNF26 protected MITA from RNF5-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation that was required for quick and efficient type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokine induction after viral infection. On the other hand, RNF26 was required to limit excessive type I IFN response but not proinflammatory cytokine induction by promoting autophagic degradation of IRF3. Consistently, knockdown of RNF26 inhibited the expression of <italic>IFNB1</italic> gene in various cells at the early phase and promoted it at the late phase of viral infection, respectively. Furthermore, knockdown of RNF26 inhibited viral replication, indicating that RNF26 antagonizes cellular antiviral response. Our findings thus suggest that RNF26 temporally regulates innate antiviral response by two distinct mechanisms.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Virus infection induces the host cells to produce type I interferons, which are secreted proteins important for the host to clear viruses. Previously, we identified a cellular protein called MITA, which is essential for virus-triggered induction of interferons. In this study, we found an enzyme called RNF26 could covalently modify MITA with one type of polypeptide, called polyubiquitin. This modification caused increased stability of MITA after viral infection. RNF26 also caused disability of IRF3, another important component required for virus-triggered interferon induction. Thus, RNF26 could temporally regulate virus-triggered interferon induction by two distinct mechanisms. This discovery helps to understand how the antiviral response is delicately regulated.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Host pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) detect nucleic acid from invading viruses or necrotic cells and trigger a series of signaling events that lead to the induction of type I interferons (IFNs), which plays a central role in autoimmune diseases as well as protective immune responses against viruses, respectively <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Kawasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Much progress has been made to characterize viral nucleic acid-triggered signaling pathways that result in transcriptional activation of type I IFN genes. A family of DExD/H box RNA helicases consisting of retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and LGP2 are RNA sensors and recruit the adaptors VISA (also called MAVS, IPS-1 and Cardif) <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004358-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and MITA (also known as STING, MPYS and ERIS) <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004358-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>to activate the transcription factors NF-ÎºB and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 or IRF7, leading to transcriptional induction of the genes encoding type I IFNs and other antiviral effectors <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A number of DNA sensors have been identified, including DAI, IFI16, DDX41 and MRE11 which may function in a ligand- and/or cell-type-specific manner <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Takaoka1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004358-Kondo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has been recently characterized as a viral DNA sensor in almost all types of cells <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These sensors depend exclusively on the adaptor MITA to activate NF-ÎºB and IRF3/7 and lead to subsequent induction of type I IFNs <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Paludan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>MITA is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria-associated membrane and mitochondria <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Ishikawa2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Upon viral infection, MITA translocates to intracellular membrane-containing compartments to form punctate aggregates and acts as a scaffold protein to facilitate the phosphorylation of IRF3 and STAT6 by the kinases TBK1 and IKKÎµ <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Saitoh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004358-Konno1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Recent studies also suggest that MITA is a direct sensor that recognizes cyclic dinucleotides such as c-di-AMP, c-di-GMP and cGAMP generated from self and viral DNA infection <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Jin2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004358-Cavlar1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been demonstrated that MITA undergoes various post-translational modifications and such modifications are key to the activity and stability of MITA <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Konno1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhong2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. MITA is phosphorylated at Ser358 by TBK1 which is critical for phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, while UNC-51-like kinase (ULK1) phosphorylates MITA at Ser366 which impairs MITA-IRF3 interaction and subsequent activation of IRF3 <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Konno1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In addition, RNF5 catalyzes K48-linked polyubiquitination of MITA and targets MITA for degradation <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhong2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, whereas TRIM56 and TRIM32 promote K63-linked polyubiquitination of MITA and positively regulates virus-triggered type I IFN induction <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Tsuchida1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Whether and how additional proteins mediate other types of modifications of MITA is unknown.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase, RING finger protein 26 (RNF26) that targeted MITA for K11-linked polyubiquitination upon viral infection. MITA with K11-linked polyubiquitin chains remained as reservoir of MITA and was protected from RNF5-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. However, overexpression of RNF26 indirectly induced degradation of IRF3 through an autophagy pathway. As a result, knockdown of RNF26 promoted degradation of MITA after viral infection and prevented degradation of IRF3. Virus-triggered phosphorylation of IRF3 and induction of IFN-Î² were inhibited at the early time points and potentiated at late time points in the absence of RNF26, respectively. Our findings suggest that RNF26 temporally regulates virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs by two distinct mechanisms.</p>

        <title>RNF26 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for MITA</title>
        <p>Because post-translational modifications of MITA are critical for mediating viral nucleic acid-triggered type I IFN induction, we assumed there are additional proteins that interact with and target MITA for various modifications and thereby regulate innate antiviral signaling. We attempted to unambiguously identify E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate MITA ubiquitination and function <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This effort led to the identification of RNF26 which could promote polyubiquitination of MITA <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Analysis of the NCBI EST profile database indicates that RNF26 is ubiquitously expressed in most examined cells and tissues. In overexpression experiments, RNF26 dose-dependently promoted polyubiquitination of MITA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004358-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, the enzymatic inactive mutants RNF26(C395S), RNF26(C399S) or RNF26(C401S) failed to mediate polyubiquitination of MITA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004358-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Results from <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assays demonstrated that RNF26 catalyzed polyubiquitination of MITA <italic>in vitro</italic>, which depended on the enzymatic activity of RNF26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004358-g001">Figure 1CâD</xref>). These data suggest that RNF26 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting MITA for polyubiquitination.</p>

            <p>(A) Overexpression of RNF26 promoted polyubiquitination of MITA. The 293 cells (5Ã10<sup>6</sup>) were transfected with Flag-MITA (5 Âµg) and HA-Ub (1 Âµg) together with a control or RNF26 expression plasmid (0.5, 1, 2 Âµg). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) under denatured conditions with anti-Flag and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblots with anti-HA (upper panel) or anti-Flag (lower panel). The whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblots with anti-HA (upper panel), anti-Flag (middle panel) and anti-RNF26 (bottom panel). Ub, ubiquitin. (B) RNF26-mediated polyubiquitination of MITA depends on the enzymatic activity of RNF26. The 293 cells (5Ã10<sup>6</sup>) were transfected with Flag-MITA (5 Âµg) and HA-Ub (1 Âµg) together with RNF26 or its mutants (1 Âµg each). IP under denatured conditions and ubiquitination assay was performed as described in (A). (C) UbcH5 mediated polyubiquitination of MITA by RNF26. The RNF26 and MITA proteins were obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and translation, then incubated with biotin-Ub, E1 and the indicated E2s. Polyubiquitination of MITA was examined by immunoblot analysis with HRP-streptavidin (top panel).

(D) RNF26 but not its enzymatic inactive mutants targeted MITA for polyubiquitination <italic>in vitro</italic>. MITA, RNF26 and its mutants were obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and translation. Biotin-Ub, E1, UbcH5 and MITA were incubated with RNF26 or its mutants, followed by ubiquitination and immunoblot analysis as described in (C).

        <title>RNF26 interacts with MITA</title>
        <p>Since RNF26 caused polyubiquitination of MITA, we examined whether RNF26 interacted with MITA. Transient transfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RNF26 was associated with MITA in 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004358-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In untransfected THP-1 cells, endogenous RNF26 constitutively interacted with MITA. This interaction was enhanced at 6 hours and decreased at 12â24 hours after SeV or HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004358-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). It has been reported that MITA is localized to the ER, mitochondria-associated membrane and mitochondria <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Ishikawa2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The subcellular localization of RNF26 was examined. Fluorescent confocal microscopy and cellular fractionation analysis suggested that RNF26 was mainly localized to the ER and a minor fraction of RNF26 was found to be colocalized with the mitochondria marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004358-g002">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

Thus, RNF26 might temporally regulate virus-triggered type I IFN induction through regulating K11-linked polyubiquitination of MITA at the early phase and autophagy-dependent degradation of IRF3 at late phase, respectively.</p>

        <p>Since RNF26 regulates virus-induced expression of IFN-Î² and other downstream genes, we examined its roles in cellular antiviral response.

Various studies have shown that post-translational modifications of MITA are essential for its function <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Konno1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhong2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrated that RNF26 but not the enzymatic inactive mutants induced polyubiquitination of MITA. RNF26 mediated K11-linked polyubiquitination of MITA and modulated expression of type I IFN triggered by viral infection. RNF26 was localized mainly at the ER and constitutively interacted with MITA through their respective transmembrane domains. Viral infection potentiated this association and induced RNF26 to form punctate dots with MITA. Our studies suggest that RNF26 is a MITA-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligase which targets MITA for K11-linked polyubiquitination.</p>
      <p>Polyubiquitination of MITA catalyzed by RNF26 was mapped to K150, which is also targeted by RNF5 for K48-linked polyubiquitination and by TRIM56 or TRIM32 for K63-linked polyubiquitination <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhong2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These observations prompted us to hypothesize that polyubiquitin chains of distinct linkages might compete with each other at the same residue of MITA. Interestingly, virus-triggered K48- but not K63-linked polyubiquitination of MITA was enhanced by knockdown of RNF26. Previously, it has been demonstrated that TRIM32 targets not only K150 but also K20, 224 and 236, whereas RNF5 targets only K150 of MITA <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This is consistent with our observations that RNF26 impaired K48- but not K63-linked polyubiquitination of MITA. RNF26-mediated K11-linked polyubiquitination of MITA protected it from RNF5-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. Consistently, degradation of MITA was accelerated in RNF26 knockdown cells compared to control cells after viral infection. These results suggest that RNF26-meidated K11-linked polyubiquitination competes with RNF5-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitination of MITA at K150. These results are consistent with our observations that knockdown of RNF26 inhibited induction of type I IFNs at early phase of viral infection. The functions of K11-linked polyubiquitination are not well understood so far <xref rid="ppat.1004358-Bremm1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004358-Budhavarapu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. To our knowledge, our study represents the first report on the function of K11-linked polyubiquitination in virus-triggered signaling and innate antiviral response.</p>
      <p>Unexpected, although knockdown of RNF26 inhibited virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs at the early phase of viral infection, it had opposite effect at the late phase of viral infection. This led us to hypothesize that RNF26 temporally regulates virus-triggered type I IFN induction by distinct mechanisms. In this context, we observed that overexpression of RNF26 promoted degradation of IRF3, whereas knockdown of RNF26 increased the level of IRF3. Interestingly, RNF26-mediated degradation of IRF3 was blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA but not the lysosome inhibitor NH<sub>4</sub>Cl or the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In addition, RNF26-induced degradation of IRF3 was markedly inhibited by knockdown of ATG12, an essential component in the autophagic degradation pathway. These results indicate that RNF26 indirectly regulates stability of IRF3 protein in an autophagy-dependent manner. The exact mechanism on how RNF26 mediates autophagy-dependent degradation of IRF3 is currently unknown. Based on our findings, we come to a working model on how RNF26 temporally regulates virus-triggered type I IFN induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004358-g008">Figure 8</xref>). At the early phase of infection, RNF26 mediates K11-linked polyubiquitination of MITA, which protects it from K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation to facilitate the fast induction of type I IFN genes. In addition to its early phase function through K11-linked polyubiquitination of MITA, RNF26 constitutively down-regulates IRF3 level by autophagic degradation. This may contribute to the termination of type I IFN induction at the late phase of viral infection. Interestingly, since IRF3 activation is not required for virus-triggered induction of the proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFÎ± and IL-6, RNF26 positively regulates virus-triggered induction of the proinflammatory cytokines in a constitutive but not temporal manner. Therefore, our findings not only reveal the mechanisms on how RNF26 temporally modulate virus-triggered type I IFN induction, but also provide an explanation on how virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines can be distinctly regulated.</p>
