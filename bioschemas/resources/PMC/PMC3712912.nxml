        <p>The dynein partner dynactin not only binds to microtubules, but is found to potently influence microtubule dynamics in neurons.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Regulation of microtubule dynamics in neurons is critical, as defects in the microtubule-based transport of axonal organelles lead to neurodegenerative disease. The microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein and its partner complex dynactin drive retrograde transport from the distal axon. We have recently shown that the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin promotes the initiation of dynein-driven cargo motility from the microtubule plus-end. Because plus end-localized microtubule-associated proteins like p150<sup>Glued</sup> may also modulate the dynamics of microtubules, we hypothesized that p150<sup>Glued</sup> might promote cargo initiation by stabilizing the microtubule track. Here, we demonstrate <italic>in vitro</italic> using assembly assays and TIRF microscopy, and in primary neurons using live-cell imaging, that p150<sup>Glued</sup> is a potent anti-catastrophe factor for microtubules. p150<sup>Glued</sup> alters microtubule dynamics by binding both to microtubules and to tubulin dimers; both the N-terminal CAP-Gly and basic domains of p150<sup>Glued</sup> are required in tandem for this activity. p150<sup>Glued</sup> is alternatively spliced <italic>in vivo</italic>, with the full-length isoform including these two domains expressed primarily in neurons. Accordingly, we find that RNAi of p150<sup>Glued</sup> in nonpolarized cells does not alter microtubule dynamics, while depletion of p150<sup>Glued</sup> in neurons leads to a dramatic increase in microtubule catastrophe. Strikingly, a mutation in p150<sup>Glued</sup> causal for the lethal neurodegenerative disorder Perry syndrome abrogates this anti-catastrophe activity. Thus, we find that dynactin has multiple functions in neurons, both activating dynein-mediated retrograde axonal transport and enhancing microtubule stability through a novel anti-catastrophe mechanism regulated by tissue-specific isoform expression; disruption of either or both of these functions may contribute to neurodegenerative disease.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Microtubules are polymers of tubulin that undergo successive cycles of growth and shrinkage so that the cell can maintain a stable yet adaptable cytoskeleton. In neurons, the microtubule motor protein dynein and its partner complex dynactin drive retrograde transport along microtubules from the distal axon towards the cell body. In addition to binding to dynein, the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin independently binds directly to microtubules. We hypothesized that by binding to microtubules, p150<sup>Glued</sup> might also alter microtubule dynamics. We demonstrate using biochemistry and microscopy <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells that p150<sup>Glued</sup> stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting the transition from growth to shrinkage. We show that specific domains of p150<sup>Glued</sup> encoded by neuronally enriched splice-forms are necessary for this activity. Although depletion of p150<sup>Glued</sup> in nonpolarized cells does not alter microtubule dynamics, depletion of endogenous p150<sup>Glued</sup> in neurons leads to dramatic microtubule instability. Strikingly, a mutation in p150<sup>Glued</sup> known to cause the neurodegenerative disorder Perry syndrome abolishes this activity. In summary, we identified a previously unappreciated function of dynactin in direct regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. This activity may enhance generic microtubule stability in the cell, but could be especially important in specific areas of the cell where dynactin and dynein are loaded onto microtubules.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Microtubules are dynamic, polarized polymers of tubulin that serve as tracks for long-distance transport in eukaryotic cells. In neurons, transport along microtubules is especially important yet particularly vulnerable to disruption, as these cells are long-lived and postmitotic with elongated axonal processes that can extend up to a meter <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Perlson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. There is accumulating evidence that axonal transport is disrupted in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In neurodegeneration, defects in microtubule dynamics may precede transport defects <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Cartelli1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The rate-limiting step in microtubule formation is nucleation from soluble tubulin, which in the canonical pathway is catalyzed by <bold>Î³</bold>-TuRC enriched at the centrosome <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Kollman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, in large, postmitotic cells like neurons, noncentrosomal nucleation may be particularly important <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Stiess1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Following nucleation, the dynamics of polymerization and depolymerization are strongly influenced by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). In particular, a spatially specialized group of MAPs that localize to the microtubule plus end, the plus end-tracking proteins (+TIPs), are ideally poised to modulate dynamics in cells <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Akhmanova1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One of these +TIPs is dynactin <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Vaughan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, a large complex that binds and activates cytoplasmic dynein <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Karki1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Vaughan2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and also associates with microtubules through its dimeric p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit <xref rid="pbio.1001611-WatermanStorer1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. p150<sup>Glued</sup> has two alternatively spliced microtubule-binding domains at its N-terminus: a cytoskeleton associated protein glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domain <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Riehemann1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, followed by a serine-rich basic domain <xref rid="pbio.1001611-CulverHanlon1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Dixit1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The p150<sup>Glued</sup> microtubule-binding N-terminus is dispensable for most dynein-mediated organelle transport <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Dixit1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, we and others have recently shown that it is specifically required for efficient transport initiation from the distal axon in neurons <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Because p150<sup>Glued</sup> is specifically enriched at the microtubule plus end, we hypothesized that it might modify microtubule dynamics. Here, using solution assays and direct visualization of microtubule dynamics using TIRF microscopy, we show that p150<sup>Glued</sup> promotes microtubule formation by binding both to microtubules and to soluble tubulin. Both the CAP-Gly and basic domains are required for tubulin-binding <italic>in vitro.</italic> The full-length isoform encoding both these domains in tandem is primarily expressed in neurons, so we hypothesized that this pro-polymerization activity might be a neuron-specific function of p150<sup>Glued</sup>. Accordingly, we find that in epithelial cells depleted of p150<sup>Glued</sup> there is no effect on microtubule dynamics, while in primary neurons, we observed a significant increase in catastrophe upon depletion of p150<sup>Glued</sup> that was specifically rescued by expression of the neuronal isoform. Finally, we find that a mutation in p150<sup>Glued</sup> causative for Perry syndrome, a lethal Parkinson's syndrome, inhibits the anti-catastrophe activity. Thus, the novel neuron-specific anti-catastrophe activity described here may facilitate microtubule stabilization in neurons. We speculate that disruption of this function may contribute to neurodegeneration.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>To investigate the dynein-independent effects of dynactin on microtubule dynamics, we designed N-terminal recombinant polypeptides truncated before the dynein binding site within the first p150<sup>Glued</sup> coiled-coil domain (CC1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pbio.1001611-King1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Since CC1 is also required for endogenous dimerization of p150<sup>Glued</sup>, we replaced this domain with a short, well-characterized GCN4 coiled-coil <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Trybus1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In order to assay the effects of dimerization on microtubule dynamics, we also generated a corresponding construct lacking the dimerization domain, but including both the N-terminal CAP-Gly and basic microtubule-binding domains.</p>

      <p>To characterize our recombinant polypeptides, we performed glutaraldehyde cross-linking and hydrodynamic analysis, and confirmed that p150 Nt-GCN4 dimerized as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s002">Figure S1A</xref>). Both the monomeric and dimeric constructs were soluble and monodisperse following purification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s002">Figure S1B</xref>). Hydrodynamic analysis also indicated that both polypeptides are highly elongated (R<sub>s</sub>/R<sub>min</sub>&gt;1.9, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s002">Figure S1B</xref>), consistent with previous electron microscopy images of dynactin <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Schafer1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> that indicate that the p150<sup>Glued</sup> dimer projects outward from the Arp1 filament that forms the base of the dynactin complex. We measured the relative affinities of both the dimeric and monomeric constructs for microtubules, and found that both bound to paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules with moderate affinities (K<sub>d</sub> of 340 nM and 890 nM, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s002">Figure S1C</xref>), within the typical range for CAP-Gly proteins <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Steinmetz1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>p150<sup>Glued</sup> Dimer Potently Promotes Microtubule Formation</title>
        <p>Previous work from our lab suggested that the N-terminus of p150<sup>Glued</sup> promotes bulk microtubule formation <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Ligon1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. To confirm and extend this result, we first compared the activities of the dimeric p150 Nt-GCN4 and the monomeric p150 Nt constructs using in vitro assembly assays. Only the dimeric construct induced a large increase in light scattering, a measure of increased microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also compared the activities of these constructs to that of the well-characterized neuronal MAPs tau (Tau23) and doublecortin (DCX-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s002">S1D</xref>), both of which have been shown to promote the formation of microtubules, a function that appears defective in the setting of disease <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Bechstedt1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The increase in light scattering induced by 1 ÂµM p150 Nt-GCN4 was similar in magnitude to the increase induced by addition of 10 ÂµM DCX-GFP, and approximately 4-fold more than the increase induced by 2 ÂµM Tau23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, p150, like these classical neuronal MAPs, enhances the polymerization of microtubules from soluble tubulin. In contrast, the microtubule-binding motor domain of kinesin-1 (rKin430-GFP) did not promote the formation of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that this effect is not a nonspecific one characteristic of all microtubule-binding proteins.</p>
        <p>Since microtubule bundling, as well as microtubule polymerization, can lead to increases in light scattering signal, we pelleted the reaction mixtures and analyzed the resulting microtubule pellets by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s002">Figure S1E</xref>). This analysis confirmed that p150 Nt-GCN4 induces a large increase in tubulin polymerization. Additionally, we tested to ensure that increased turbidity from protein aggregation was not responsible for the light scattering signal; when the purified p150Nt-GCN4 is incubated in the absence of tubulin, light scattering remained low and constant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s002">Figure S1F</xref>). As a final control, because the fusion of a His-affinity tag has been reported to disrupt the activity of another plus-tip protein, EB1 <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, we compared our His-tagged p150 constructs to equivalent Strep-tagged constructs, as well as to the activity of an untagged construct purified by ion exchange chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s003">Figure S2A</xref>). The untagged construct was identical to the His-tagged construct on size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s003">Figure S2B</xref>), and the activities we measured were identical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s003">Figure S2C, S2D</xref>), indicating that the promotion of microtubule polymerization by dimeric p150 is not affected by the nature of the N-terminal purification tag.</p>

        <p>We hypothesized that p150<sup>Glued</sup>, which localizes to microtubule plus-ends in the cell <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Vaughan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Dixit1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, might, like other +TIPS <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Akhmanova1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, influence the parameters of dynamic instability. In the absence of MAPs, microtubule dynamic instability is characterized by periods of slow polymer growth ending in catastrophe and rapid depolymerization; following rescue, microtubule growth resumes by addition of new tubulin subunits at the plus end. To test the hypothesis that p150<sup>Glued</sup> alters these parameters, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to directly observe microtubule polymerization from pre-formed GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Gell1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Dixit2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Addition of tubulin alone to pre-formed, stabilized seeds induced characteristic periods of slow growth, with transitions to rapid shrinkage following a catastrophe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, addition of a low (100â200 nM), physiological concentration of p150 Nt-GCN4 <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Gill1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> to the assay led to more rapid microtubule growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The polymerization rate increased more than 2-fold at 200 nM p150 Nt-GCN4 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).

        <p>In agreement with the results from the light scattering assay described above, here by direct observation we also see that dimerization of p150<sup>Glued</sup> is necessary to influence microtubules.

        <p>We designed a TIRF assay to directly test this hypothesis. We specifically oriented the p150 N-terminal microtubule-binding domains toward the microscopy chamber by immobilizing 250 nM p150 polypeptides on the coverslip via an antibody to the C-terminal His-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We then washed the chamber to remove unbound p150, and perfused in 3.5 ÂµM soluble tubulin, which is below the critical concentration for spontaneous microtubule nucleation.</p>
        <p>Consistent with our hypothesis, in the presence of dimeric p150 Nt-GCN4, we observed the appearance of many short microtubules within 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

        <p>p150<sup>Glued</sup> is well-characterized as a MAP, but we hypothesized that it might affect microtubule dynamics by also binding to soluble tubulin through its CAP-Gly domain.

When p150<sup>Glued</sup> was depleted by â¼80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), we did not observe significant differences in either polymerization rates or the number of EB3-GFP comets compared to scrambled RNAi-treated cells (unpublished data). However, we noted that when p150<sup>Glued</sup> was depleted, there was a significant decrease in the distance GFP-EB3 comets traveled before catastrophe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g005">Figure 5G,H</xref>), indicating a significant increase in the catastrophe frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g005">Figure 5J</xref>). For example, compare the comets that traveled at least 5 Âµm before catastrophe (black) compared to those that travelled less than 2 Âµm (magenta) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g005">Figure 5H</xref>.</p>
        <p>To confirm that this was a specific effect of p150<sup>Glued</sup> knockdown, we quantitated dynamics in RNAi-treated neurons rescued with either the full-length neuronal p150 isoform, or with p135, which lacks the N-terminal CAP-Gly domain. We observed that rescue of neurons with a plasmid encoding RNA-resistant p150 significantly reduced the catastrophe frequency as compared to RNAi-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g005">Figure 5I,J</xref>). Wild-type dynamics were not completely restored, likely because we did not fully restore endogenous expression levels with the rescue plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001611.s007">Figure S6C</xref>). In contrast, transfection with the p135 isoform, which lacks the N-terminal CAP-Gly domain, did not rescue defective polymerization dynamics in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g005">Figure 5I,J</xref>). Importantly, we found that transfection with the Î5â7 construct, the nonneuronal splice form that lacks the basic domain, also did not rescue the defective polymerization dynamics induced by depletion of endogenous p150<sup>Glued</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g005">Figure 5I,J</xref>). Thus, in strong agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> results, these observations indicate that the tandem CAP-Gly and basic domains of p150 are required to generate anti-catastrophe activity in neurons.</p>

        <title>A Parkinson Disease Mutation Abolishes p150<sup>Glued</sup> Activity</title>
        <p>Mutations in the CAP-Gly domain of p150<sup>Glued</sup> have been found to cause multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Perry syndrome, a disease characterized by Parkinsonism, weight loss, hypoventilation, and depression. While human disease-associated mutations in p150<sup>Glued</sup> are expressed throughout the body, these mutations induce pathologies only in the nervous system <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Thus, we hypothesized that the tissue-specific activity of p150<sup>Glued</sup> described above might be disrupted in this disease.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we show that p150<sup>Glued</sup> promotes microtubule formation <italic>in vitro</italic> by catalyzing nucleation, increasing the polymerization rate, and inhibiting catastrophe. These activities require dimerization and are dependent on the ability of p150<sup>Glued</sup> to form a stable complex with tubulin through interactions with both the N-terminal CAP-Gly and basic domains. In primary neurons, we observe that the dominant effect of p150<sup>Glued</sup> on microtubule dynamics is the suppression of catastrophe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Finally, we determine that a single point mutation within the CAP-Gly domain of p150<sup>Glued</sup> causative for a fatal familial form of Parkinson disease, known as Perry Syndrome, leaves p150<sup>Glued</sup> unable to promote microtubule assembly either <italic>in vitro</italic> or in neurons.</p>

The N-terminus of the 150 kDa subunit binds microtubules independently of dynein <xref rid="pbio.1001611-WatermanStorer1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and increases the processivity of dynein <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pbio.1001611-CulverHanlon1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-King2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the microtubule-binding N-terminus of p150<sup>Glued</sup> is dispensable for organelle localization and vesicular motility in nonneuronal cells <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Dixit1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, the microtubule-binding CAP-Gly domain of dynactin is required for efficient transport initiation from the distal axon in neurons <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A plus end-localized pool of p150<sup>Glued</sup> may serve to load dynein onto the microtubule <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Vaughan3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. However, biochemical analyses and immunolocalization suggest that a large proportion of dynactin may in fact not be in complex with dynein <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Gill1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Habermann1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Enriched at the plus end, this population of dynactin would be perfectly poised to affect microtubule dynamics.</p>
      <p>Our data suggest a mechanism whereby p150<sup>Glued</sup> could modify microtubule dynamics. Recently, it has been suggested that the kinetics of tubulin association and dissociation with the microtubule plus end may be much faster than previously appreciated <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Gardner1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This makes it increasingly plausible that one mode whereby MAPs alter microtubule dynamics is by modulating the off-rate of tubulin subunits from microtubule plus ends. Since p150<sup>Glued</sup> can bind both to microtubules and to soluble tubulin, and because dimerization appears necessary for p150<sup>Glued</sup> to robustly modify dynamics, we speculate that p150<sup>Glued</sup> may be acting in this capacity by binding to both microtubules and tubulin at the same time, decreasing the off-rate and inhibiting catastrophe, enabling efficient initiation of dynein-mediated retrograde runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001611-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, this mechanism is distinct from the mode by which cytoplasmic dynein independently functions to inhibit catastrophe <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Hendricks1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Areas of the distal neuron where both cytoplasmic and dynactin are localized could be sites of particularly robust microtubule stabilization.</p>
      <p>The regulation of these microtubule-modifying abilities of p150<sup>Glued</sup> may be multifactorial. We have shown that the basic region is necessary for the modification of microtubule dynamics by p150<sup>Glued</sup>, likely by ensuring a stable complex with the distributed acidic nature of tubulin. The basic region is also serine- and threonine-rich, and has been shown to be the target of phosphorylation by regulatory kinases <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Rome1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, which might further modulate the p150-tubulin interaction during mitosis, or during development. p150<sup>Glued</sup> also binds to CLIP-170 <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Ligon1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Hayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Honnappa1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Goodson1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, which could further modify the behavior of p150<sup>Glued</sup> in the cell.</p>
      <p>
<italic>In vivo</italic>, only the p150<sup>Glued</sup> isoform expressed in neurons includes both the full CAP-Gly and basic domains that we have shown are necessary to modify microtubule assembly dynamics. We have recently shown that young, developing neurons depleted of p150<sup>Glued</sup> are morphologically normal <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In fact, profound depletion of both EB1 and EB3, which should effectively disrupt plus-end targeting, has no gross effects on neurite outgrowth <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It may be that, as recent evidence suggests, only as neurons age, and their processes lengthen and elaborate, does the centrosome lose its function as a microtubule organizing center and microtubule dynamics become particularly reliant on plus-end regulation <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Stiess1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is perhaps telling that human patients with the Q74P p150<sup>Glued</sup> mutation do not show disease onset until the fifth decade of life <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Farrer1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. More broadly, microtubule dynamics may alter in aging or degenerating neurons, as suggested from studies of cells from patients with sporadic Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Cartelli2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001611-Silva1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have identified and characterized a novel role for p150<sup>Glued</sup> in the tissue-specific stabilization of microtubules, and implicated defects in neurodegeneration. Further studies to disentangle the effects of the mutation on axonal transport and microtubule stability in neurons will be required to clarify the pathogenesis involved.</p>

        <p>Amino acids 1â210 of human p150<sup>Glued</sup> (DCTN1, NM_004082.4) were inserted into pET-29a (Novagen) with a short linker (AAAADPPVAT) before the C-terminal 6Ã-His tag. Dimeric constructs contained a GCN4 sequence (VMKQLEDKVEELLSKNYHLENEVARLKKLVGE) <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Trybus1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> before the linker and 6Ã-His. Î5â7 dimer was deleted for exons 5â7 (RGLKPKKAPTARKTTTRRPK). The p135 dimer encodes an N-terminal MMRQ (replicating the endogenous expressed spliceform) appended to p150<sup>Glued</sup> AA 139â210. Q74P Nt-GCN4 was constructed from the p150 Nt-GCN4 backbone and previously used plasmids <xref rid="pbio.1001611-Moughamian2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The tag-less p150<sup>Glued</sup> construct was similar to 1â210-GCN-His, but lacked the C-terminal His-tag. The Strep-tagged construct was made by replacing the C-terminal His-tag by PCR. C-terminal GFP-tagged constructs were expressed from pET-29a with EGFP-6Ã-His appended after the above short linker. The accuracy of all inserts was verified by sequencing.</p>
        <p>For expression, transformed Rosetta <italic>E. coli</italic> (Novagen) were grown in LB at 37Â°C and 275 rpm under standard chloramphenicol and kanamycin selection. At OD<sub>600</sub> of â¼0.8, cultures were cooled to 15Â°C and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. After 16 h, cells were harvested and resuspended in binding buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail from Sigma, TAME, leupeptin, and PMSF). At that point, cells were either flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, or lysed via French press (Thermo) at 18,000 psi. Nucleic acids were cleaved with DNAse I and RNAse H treatment (Roche) and the lysate was cleared at 45,000 g for 20 min at 4Â°C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 Âµm polysulfone membrane (PALL Life Sciences) and applied to a 2 mL V<sub>b</sub> Ni Sepharose Fast Flow column by gravity or a 1 mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) by FPLC. To purify the Strep-tagged construct, a 1 mL Strep-Tactin Superflow Plus column (Qiagen) was used, and for the un-tagged construct, this step was omitted. The column was washed with binding buffer until the UV absorbance had settled, then eluted with binding buffer plus 0.5 M imidazole (or desthiobiotin for Strep-tagged construct). Protein-containing fractions were then diluted in 100 mM NaCl binding buffer, loaded into a 50 mL Superloop (GE Healthcare), and injected onto a Mono S 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 M NaCl to 1 M NaCl in binding buffer. Finally, the protein was exchanged into BRB80 (80 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA) with 75 mM KCl and 10% glycerol (v/v) by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare), aliquoted, and flash-frozen and stored in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. We found that for the p150 constructs, concentration determined in this way differed by only â¼10% when compared to concentration determined spectrophotometrically with a calculated extinction coefficient. All concentrations are expressed assuming either complete or absent dimerization, as appropriate from experimentation or the literature.</p>
