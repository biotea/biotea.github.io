          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Neurodevelopmental disorders have challenged clinical genetics for decades, with over 700 genes implicated and many whose function remains unknown. The application of whole-exome sequencing is proving pivotal in closing the genotype/phenotype gap through the discovery of new genes and variants that help to unravel the pathogenic mechanisms driving neuropathogenesis. One such discovery includes <italic>TRIO</italic>, a gene recently implicated in neurodevelopmental delay. Trio is a Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and a major regulator of neuronal development, controlling actin cytoskeleton dynamics by activating the GTPase Rac1.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Whole-exome sequencing was undertaken on a family presenting with global developmental delay, microcephaly and mild dysmorphism. Father/daughter exome analysis was performed, followed by confirmatory Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis on four individuals. Three further patients were recruited through the deciphering developmental disorders (DDD) study. Functional studies were undertaken using patient-specific Trio protein mutations.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We identified a frameshift deletion in <italic>TRIO</italic> that segregated autosomal dominantly. By scrutinising data from DDD, we further identified three unrelated children with a similar phenotype who harboured de novo missense mutations in <italic>TRIO</italic>. Biochemical studies demonstrated that in three out of four families, the Trio mutations led to a markedly reduced Rac1 activation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>We describe an inherited global developmental delay phenotype associated with a frameshift deletion in <italic>TRIO</italic>. Additionally, we identify pathogenic de novo missense mutations in <italic>TRIO</italic> associated with the same consistent phenotype, intellectual disability, microcephaly and dysmorphism with striking digital features. We further functionally validate the importance of the GEF domain in Trio protein function. Our study demonstrates how genomic technologies are yet again proving prolific in diagnosing and advancing the understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neurodevelopmental delay is genetically heterogenous and affects between 1% and 3% of the general population.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The usage of next-generation genomic techniques such as whole-exome sequencing (WES) has facilitated the identification of numerous novel pathogenic variants implicated in the evolution of neurodevelopmental pathology.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> One such gene on chromosome 5, <italic>TRIO</italic>, has recently been identified as a candidate for human neurodevelopmental delay.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
      <p>Neurodevelopment is a complex process requiring coordinated axonal guidance and neuronal migration to facilitate the delivery of neurons from the neuroepithelium to their synaptic target. This process is driven by specific molecular cues, which regulate the neuronal growth cone, residing at the tip of the axon.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Motility of the growth cone is, in part, regulated through remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
      <p>Members of the Rho GTPase family are key modulators of cytoskeletal dynamics.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> They play an essential role in neurodevelopment through the control of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, including motility of the growth cone.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Rho GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). <italic>TRIO</italic> encodes a GEF expressed in many tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It is highly expressed in many areas of the developing brain including the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampi and thalami.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Interestingly, <italic>TRIO</italic> can be alternatively spliced, and, as a result, can encode several isoforms whose expression is nervous-system specific.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Trio is thought to be one of the major regulators of neuronal development by controlling actin cytoskeleton remodelling through the activation of the GTPase Rac1.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The importance of the Trio protein in neuronal development is further emphasised by the fact that total knockout or specific deletion of <italic>Trio</italic> in the mouse nervous system is embryonically lethal; embryos display defects in brain organisation and reduced brain size.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Deletion of <italic>Trio,</italic> specifically in the hippocampus and in the cortex during early embryogenesis, results in aberrant organisation of these structures, impairing the learning ability of these mice.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
      <p>Our findings consolidate and extend the human phenotype recently reported by Ba <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Through the application of parent/offspring WES analysis, we report three children from across the UK with microcephaly and neurodevelopmental delay who harbour de novo missense mutations in <italic>TRIO</italic>. We also report a family with <italic>TRIO</italic> mutations that segregate autosomal dominantly. We show for the first time that <italic>TRIO</italic> mutations identified in patients affect Trio function and consequently could be responsible for the phenotype observed.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>Patients 1, 2 and 3 were assessed at the Wessex Clinical Genetics Service (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103942F1">figure 1</xref>). Exome sequencing of patients 2 and 3 was performed on DNA extracted from whole blood. Sequencing and analysis were undertaken as previously described;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> all variant positions reported are defined on GRCh37 (hg19) and <italic>TRIO</italic> transcript NM_007118. To validate the sample provenance, a parallel SNP panel was applied to confirm data identity.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>

      <p>Patients 4, 5 and 6 were referred to regional Clinical Genetics services across the UK, where they were recruited to the deciphering developmental disorders (DDD) study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ddduk.org">http://www.ddduk.org</ext-link>). DDD has so far investigated over 4000 children with severe, undiagnosed developmental delay, and their parents, using a combination of genome-wide assays to detect all major classes of genetic variation in the protein-coding portion of the genome. Clinical information and phenotypes have been recorded using the Human Phenotype Ontology via a secure web portal within the DECIPHER database.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> DNA samples from patients and their parents were analysed by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute using high-resolution microarray analysis (array-comparative genomic hybridisation and SNP genotyping) to investigate CNVs in the affected child, and exome sequencing to investigate single-nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions (indels). Putative de novo sequence variants were validated using targeted Sanger sequencing. The population prevalence (minor allele frequency) of each variant in nearly 15â000 samples from diverse populations was recorded, and the effect of each genomic variant was predicted using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Likely diagnostic variants in known developmental disorder genes were fed back to the referring clinical geneticists for external Sanger validation and discussion with the family via the patientâs record in DECIPHER, where they can be viewed in an interactive genome browser. Full genomic datasets were also deposited in the European GenomeâPhenome Archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>Functional analysis to assess input of variants was undertaken. <italic>TRIO</italic> point mutants were generated by introducing a point mutant in the wild-type (wt) form of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Trio using the Quick change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The Rac1-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) pull-down assay was performed using the Cdc42/Rac1-interactive binding (CRIB) domain of PAK1 as described.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Total HEK293T lysates and corresponding pull-downs retained on GST-Sepharose beads were processed for western blotting using the Rac1 (BD) and GFP (Clinisciences) antibodies.</p>

        <p>Patient 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103942F1">figure 1</xref>) was whole exome sequenced and a heterozygous frameshift deletion (p.Gln1489Argfs*11) in <italic>TRIO</italic> was identified, which was paternally inherited. This variant is predicted to cause nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript, and thus prevent expression of this allele (<xref rid="JMEDGENET2016103942TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> She was last assessed at the age of 17âmonths and was displaying signs of mild developmental delay; she sat unsupported at 9âmonths and walked unaided at 17âmonths. First words were spoken at 17âmonths and there was evidence of mild delay in expression and comprehension. She is a fussy eater and has dietetic input to increase calorific intake. There were some subtle behavioural signs including poor attention. She is microcephalic with a head circumference 5 SDs below the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103942F2">figure 2</xref>). Dysmorphic features included a short nose, long philtrum, thin upper lip, epicanthic folds, 2/3 toe syndactyly and an almost absent fifth toe nail. She has right radial aplasia, a rudimentary thumb and absent first metacarpal. She was found to have multiple cardiac septal defects at birth; at the age of 3 she has two small apical muscular ventricular septal defects and a patent foramen ovale, none of which are of concern clinically. The pregnancy was complicated by pre-existing maternal type 2 diabetes mellitus, which required insulin therapy. She also has a 381âkb 15q11.2 microdeletion.</p>

        <title><italic>TRIO</italic> mutations</title>
        <p>The six patients presented in this study have mutations in <italic>TRIO</italic>, a gene containing 57 exons that encodes a member of the Dbl family of GEFs, displaying strong conservation across evolution.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Alternative splicing of <italic>TRIO</italic> results in isoforms that harbour either one or both of the highly conserved Dbl homologyâPleckstrin homology (DHâPH) domains. Out of the six Trio isoforms, five contain the first DHâPH domain, which specifically catalyses exchange of GDP for GTP on RhoG and Rac1.</p>
        <p>We set out to test whether the mutations identified in Trio could impact on its function and consequently contribute to the phenotypes observed in the six patients. The RhoGEF Trio is a major regulator of neuronal development, mainly through its activation of Rac1. Patients 1, 2 and 3 share a frameshift mutation (p.Q1489fs*) resulting in a truncated Trio protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103942F3">figure 3</xref>); it would be expected that this truncated transcript would be degraded by nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in the production of negligible protein product. Patients 4, 5 and 6 harbour de novo missense mutations. Interestingly, among the four mutations identified, three lie within the GEFD1 domain, responsible for Rac1 activation (p.R1428Q, p.P1461T and p.Q1489fs*) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103942F3">figure 3</xref>C). Furthermore, the mutations affect highly conserved residues, since both R1428 and P1461 are present in Trio from invertebrates to mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103942F4">figure 4</xref>B). They lie, respectively, within the Î±-5 and Î±-6 helices of the DH domain, which have been shown to interact with the target GTPase and occur at the proteinâprotein interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103942F4">figure 4</xref>A).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24â26</xref> The truncated mutant of Trio, p.Q1489fs*, is missing the PH1 domain, which is shown to be required for efficient GDP/GTP exchange.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In contrast to the other five patients, individual 6 has a missense mutation (p.N1080I) within a spectrin repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103942F3">figure 3</xref>C).</p>

(B) Graphical representation of the <italic>TRIO</italic> gene, comprising its 57 exons (vertical lines) spanning 366.5 kb. Exons are numbered alongside their relative position to coding domains. (C) Schematic overview of the Trio protein and its domains alongside the four mutations identified in the six patients from this study. Trio displays three enzymatic domains. Each guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) module contains a catalytic domain, called Dbl homology (DH) domain (in reference to Dbl, the first RhoGEF identified as an oncogene in mammalian cells), and a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that plays a role in GEF activation and localisation. The first GEF domain, GEFD1, activates Rac1 and RhoG. The second GEF domain, GEFD2, acts on RhoA. In addition, Trio harbours numerous accessory domains. Listed from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, these include a CRAL-Trio/Sec14 motif; several spectrin-like repeats; two Src-homology 3 (SH3) motifs; and an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain. (D) Rac1-GTP pull-down assay. HEK293T cells (transfected as indicated) were lysed and active GTP-Rac1 was affinity purified using the Cdc42/Rac1-interactive binding (CRIB) domain of PAK1, immobilised on Glutathione-Sepharose beads. Purified GTP-bound and total Rac1 were detected by western blot, using an anti-Rac1 antibody. Protein expression in the cell lysates was verified by immunoblotting with an anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody. One representative experiment is shown. (E) Quantification of the Rac1-GTP pull-down assay shown in (D). Rac1 activation mediated by wt Trio was arbitrarily set to 100%, in order to be able to compare the individual experiments. The % of Rac activation was calculated from at least six independent experiments (mean Â±SEM). *p&lt; 0.015, ***p&lt; 0.0001. Of note, all three mutations lying in the DH1 domain strongly affect Trio-mediated Rac1 activation.</p>

        <p>We tested whether the mutations identified in our six patients affected Trio-mediated Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103942F3">figure 3</xref>D,E). We introduced four mutations individually into the Trio cDNA and expressed wt or mutant GFP-tagged Trio proteins in HEK293T cells. Rac1-GTP pull-down experiments were performed using the CRIB domain of PAK1. As expected, Rac1-GTP was efficiently pulled down from cells expressing wt Trio. In contrast, the pull-down of active Rac1 from cells expressing the Trio p.R1428Q, p.P1461T or the truncated mutant p.Q1489fs* was strongly reduced, although to a lesser extent than the fully dead GEF mutant used as a negative control (Q1427A/L1435E).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The results obtained with the two point mutants in the GEFD1 domain are therefore consistent with a crucial function of these two residues in Rac1 activation. The p.N1080I mutant (in individual 6) did not affect Trio-mediated Rac1 activation. Taken together, our results reveal that in five out of six patients harbouring a mutation in the <italic>TRIO</italic> gene, Rac1 activation is strongly reduced, demonstrating that Trio function is affected in these patients.</p>

<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<italic>TRIO</italic> and its paralog kalirin play a fundamental role in mammalian neuronal development. Trio deletion in mice results in impaired neuronal migration and axon guidance defects, global brain reduction and aberrant structural development of the hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Complete knockout mice are embryonically lethal; they have smaller brains and aberrant organisation in the hippocampus and hindbrain.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A mouse model recently reported with a <italic>Trio</italic> knockout specific to the hippocampus and brain cortex addressed the role of Trio in postnatal brain development, concluding that Trio regulates the neuronal development of the hippocampus and affects the learning ability and intelligence of adult mice.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
      <p>Five of the six patients we report share a core phenotype comprising intellectual disability (ID), behavioural difficulties, subtle dysmorphism and microcephaly. This presentation aligns with the phenotype recently presented by Ba <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> who screened 2300 ID cases and identified four truncating mutations in <italic>TRIO.</italic> Similarly, they described skeletal anomalies, short stature, feeding difficulties and facial asymmetry. Perhaps most striking, however, are the similarities of the digital dysmorphology, most notably phalangeal hypoplasia, swollen proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and tapering fingers shared between their study and our findings. The microcephalic presentation is likely to be primary in nature, in which the skull is small because the underlying brain is small. Noteworthy, the microcephaly we describe is more severe than in the individuals reported by Ba <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> who all harboured loss-of-function mutations. Of interest, we showed that microcephaly was only present in individuals who harboured mutations in the GEFD1 domain affecting Rac1 activation by Trio. Since Trio function in the nervous system is mainly mediated by Rac1 activation, we can propose from these data that alteration of Rac1 activation by Trio variants is associated with microcephaly. Furthermore, we have recently shown that Trio is implicated in cell division by counteracting the effect of MgcRacGAP on Rac1 during cytokinesis.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Interestingly, many genes associated with cell-cycle regulation have been found to be mutated in different forms of microcephaly.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Therefore, the microcephaly phenotype observed in patients with <italic>TRIO</italic> mutations could also originate from a cell-cycle defect.</p>
      <p>In contrast to patients 1â5, one individual in our study (individual 6) is somewhat of a phenotypic outlier; although she has ID, behavioural difficulties and dysmorphism, she is the only patient we report without microcephaly and who has seizures, complete speech failure and plagiocephaly. Unlike individuals 1â5 who have mutations affecting the DH1âPH1 domain, individual 6 has a missense mutation that affects a spectrin repeat and was functionally shown not to affect Trio-mediated Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103942F3">figure 3</xref>). Spectrin repeats are important for Trio function as they bind many Trio regulators, such as NAV1, DISC1 and KidIns220.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore, we can hypothesise that the mutant Trio, p.N1080I, is mediated by a pathway independent of Rac1 activation, and could impair the binding of Trio to its interactors, potentially leading to protein mislocalisation.</p>
      <p><italic>TRIO</italic> is expressed in many tissue types; however, its role outside of the CNS remains to be fully elucidated. In addition, interpretation of a truly specific <italic>TRIO</italic> phenotype is confounded by additional findings; notably a 15q11.2 microdeletion in patients 1 and 2 and a pathogenic <italic>KCNJ2</italic> variant in patient 3. Mutations in <italic>KCNJ2</italic> have been associated with AndersonâTawil syndrome, short QT and familial atrial fibrillation,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> likely explaining the ventricular ectopic beats seen in individual 3. It is also of note that individual 1 has right radial aplasia and ventricular septal defects, which may be secondary to an <italic>in utero</italic> environment complicated by maternal type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p>
      <p>Two of our probands displayed additional neurological signs including seizures, ataxia and pain insensitivity, and three of the probands had feeding difficulties. Furthermore, the ID reported was variable. The phenotypic variability could be related to the differing variant types (loss of function vs missense) and the importance of mutations affecting different exon positions within the DH1âPH1 domain and their consequent effect on protein function. Of particular interest, there was little difference in phenotypic severity between individuals harbouring loss-of-function mutations versus missense mutations that did not significantly alter protein length, and nor in the biological disruption of Trio-mediated Rac1 activity.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>We are the first study to describe pathogenic missense mutations in <italic>TRIO</italic> and a <italic>TRIO</italic> syndrome that segregates in an autosomal-dominant pattern. Our findings corroborate and extrapolate previous literature; we show that mutations in <italic>TRIO</italic> affecting the RhoGEF1 domain cause a phenotype comprising microcephaly, ID, behavioural difficulties and dysmorphism with specific digital features. We functionally prove that genotypic, patient-specific <italic>TRIO</italic> mutants cause protein dysfunction modulated through reduced Rac1 activity, and that microcephaly was only present in individuals who harboured mutations in the GEFD1 domain. It now remains to be established whether the phenotypic contribution of <italic>TRIO</italic> variants in patients are attributable to the function of Trio in cell division and/or neuronal differentiation.</p>
