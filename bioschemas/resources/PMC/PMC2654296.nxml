      <abstract>
        <p>In this study, insulin receptor substrate (IRS) p53 is identified as a binding
partner for Kank, a kidney ankyrin repeatâcontaining protein that
functions to suppress cell proliferation and regulate the actin cytoskeleton.
Kank specifically inhibits the binding of IRSp53 with active Rac1
(Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>) but not Cdc42 (cdc42<sup>G12V</sup>) and thus inhibits the
IRSp53-dependent development of lamellipodia without affecting the formation of
filopodia. Knockdown (KD) of Kank by RNA interference results in increased
lamellipodial development, whereas KD of both Kank and IRSp53 has little effect.
Moreover, insulin-induced membrane ruffling is inhibited by overexpression of
Kank. Kank also suppresses integrin-dependent cell spreading and IRSp53-induced
neurite outgrowth. Our results demonstrate that Kank negatively regulates the
formation of lamellipodia by inhibiting the interaction between Rac1 and
IRSp53.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Rho family of small GTPases acts as molecular switches for a variety of
extracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hall, 1998</xref>). These
signals are transduced through a rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that
changes the cell shape, leading to cell adhesion and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ridley et al., 1992</xref>). Rho GTPases are also
implicated in many other cellular events and functions such as cell polarity, gene
transcription, cell cycle progression in the G1 phase, microtubule dynamics,
vesicular transport, and enzymatic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kozma et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Aelst and
D'Souza-Schorey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AspenstrÃ¶m, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002</xref>). The Rho family proteins such as Rac1
and cdc42 along with proteins like Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), neural
WASP, and Scar/WAVE participate in cell migration, neurite extension, and budding in
yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Innocenti et al., 2004</xref>). These
proteins can bind to the globular actin and Arp2/3 complex through their catalytic
domain, which results in filament branching at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takenawa and Miki, 2001</xref>). The regulatory actions of WASP and
neural WASP proteins involve their binding to active cdc42 at their GTPase-binding
domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgs and Pollard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takenawa and Miki, 2001</xref>). WAVE1 was found to
be inactive in a complex with Nap1, Abi2, PIR121, and HSP300, and a GTP-loaded
active Rac1 dissociated from this complex, relieving active WAVE1-HSP300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eden et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, WAVE2 was
found to bind to active Rac1 indirectly through insulin receptor substrate (IRS) p53
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miki and Takenawa, 2002</xref>), a
well-characterized adapter protein that connects actin remodeling proteins with the
Rho family of small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funato et al.,
2004</xref>). IRSp53 contains several domains: a Rac1-binding domain in the N
terminus, a half cdc42/Rac1 interactive binding (CRIB) motif, a proline-rich domain,
and an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. It also binds to cdc42 via the CRIB motif and
stimulates the formation of filopodia through Mena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Govind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krugmann et al., 2001</xref>). IRSp53 is involved in neuronal morphogenesis
through a variety of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soltau et al.,
2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hori et
al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>During a comprehensive analysis of loss of heterozygosity in renal cell carcinoma
patients, Kank, a kidney ankyrin repeatâcontaining protein, was identified
as a growth suppressor in HEK293 cells and a disruptor of Î²-actin
distribution in G-402 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sarkar et al.,
2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodley et al., 2003</xref>). The
protein contains a coiled-coil domain in the N-terminal region and an ankyrin repeat
domain in the C-terminal region, both of which are likely to be involved in
proteinâprotein interactions and thus may play a major role in cellular
events. Interestingly, an orthologue of Kank in <italic>Caenorhabditis
elegans</italic>, VAB-19, was reported to act in epidermal morphogenesis and to play
a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this study, we report that Kank disrupts the function of active Rac1 through
IRSp53. The binding between IRSp53 and Kank inhibits the association of active Rac1
with IRSp53 rather than the association of active cdc42 with IRSp53. Kank inhibits
the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles induced by active Rac1 in NIH3T3
cells. In addition, the depletion of Kank induced lamellipodial membrane protrusions
in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, Kank inhibits IRSp53-induced cell spreading and
neurite outgrowth in N1E115 cells.</p>

        <title>Kank interacts with IRSp53 in vivo</title>
        <p>To identify proteins binding to Kank, we screened a human placental cDNA library
using Kank (amino acids 77â977) as bait with the yeast two-hybrid
system. Among &gt;200 clones isolated, two encoded IRSp53, both lacking 49
amino acids from the N terminus. The specificity of interaction was confirmed by
the growth of the yeast clones on plates lacking Leu/Trp/His and by
Î²-galactosidase activity in the X-gal filter assay (unpublished data).
To verify the result of the screening, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation
experiments were performed using antibodies against Kank and IRSp53 with
mammalian cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).
Immunoprecipitation of Kank resulted in the coprecipitation of IRSp53 as
detected by Western blotting using the anti-IRSp53 antibody, whereas the result
of the control experiment using a preimmune serum was negative. However,
immunoprecipitation of IRSp53 resulted in coprecipitation of Kank as detected
with the anti-Kank antibody, confirming binding in vivo between Kank and IRSp53.
Immunocytochemical characterization of Kank in VMRC-RCW cells, a renal cell
carcinoma cell line, also showed the colocalization of endogenous Kank and
IRSp53 at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>,
arrowheads). To further authenticate our finding, we coimmunostained Kank with
WAVE2, which is known to be localized to areas of ruffling, in VMRC-RCW cells.
Kank and WAVE2 were colocalized at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, arrowheads). Furthermore, Kank and IRSp53 were
both present in the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1
D</xref>). In the spreading cells, IRSp53 was detected at the tips of both the
lamellipodium and the filopodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakagawa et
al., 2003</xref>) where WAVE2 is also localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miki et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, we concluded that Kank is
localized at the leading edge in the VMRC-RCW cells.</p>

        <p>To determine the binding domains of Kank and IRSp53, various mutants were
constructed for IRSp53 (in GFP-tagged forms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) and Kank (in Flag-tagged forms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).2 HEK293T cells were transfected with the
indicated constructs along with the wild-type Flag-Kank, and immunoprecipitation
was performed using an anti-Flag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.
2 B</xref>). Positive GFP signals were observed for the wild-type GFP-IRSp53
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, construct a) and
GFP-IRSp53(N) (N-terminal part containing the IMD/RCB domain and half CRIB
domain; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, construct c). In
contrast, a mutant of IRSp53 having a deletion at the coiled-coil domain (amino
acids 75â153; GFP-IRSp53<sup>Îcoil</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, construct b), a mutant containing
the C-terminal part, including the SH3 domain (amino acids 362â521;
construct d), and the GFP-vector (control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.
2 A</xref>, construct v) did not show any signal for GFP in the
immunoprecipitates, indicating that Kank binds to IRSp53 at its coiled-coil
domain. The lanes for lysates showed the expression of the individual
constructs. Similarly, Flag-tagged Kank and its mutants were expressed in
HEK293T cells along with GFP-IRSp53(N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2
A</xref>, construct c) and were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-GFP
antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Western blotting
using an anti-Flag antibody showed strong signals for Flag-Kank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, construct e) and
Flag-Kank<sup>ÎAnk</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2
C</xref>, construct g) but no signal for Flag-Kank<sup>Îcoil</sup>
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, construct f). The result
also indicates that Kank binds to IRSp53 at the coiled-coil domain. This result
was further verified by coexpressing Flag-IRSp53(N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, construct c) and a GFP-tagged coiled-coil region
of Kank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, construct h) in
HEK293T cells and by examining reciprocal immunoprecipitation followed by
Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). The
specificity of the binding was further examined by using a coiled-coil domain of
kinectin (amino acids 1,116â1,356; GFP-kinectin<sup>coil</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). In this study,
GFP-kinectin<sup>coil</sup> did not bind to Flag-IRSp53(N). Thus, the
results indicate that IRSp53 binds specifically to Kank through its coiled-coil
domain.</p>

        <title>Kank regulates the binding between active Rac1 and IRSp53</title>
        <p>As reported, active Rac1 binds to IRSp53 through its N-terminal 229 amino acid
residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miki and Takenawa, 2002</xref>), which contain
the Kank binding domain, so we tested whether Kank can compete against Rac1 in
vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Both
His-Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> and His-cdc42<sup>G12V</sup> bound to GST-IRSp53(N),
whereas GST alone did not, indicating that IRSp53 binds to Rac1 or cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). When this
binding was challenged by maltose-binding protein (MBP; a control) or
MBP-Kank<sup>coil</sup>, MBP-Kank<sup>coil</sup> inhibited the binding of
GST-IRSp53(N) to His-Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> in a dose-dependent manner more
efficiently than the binding of GST-IRSp53(N) to His-cdc42<sup>G12V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>, lanes 6â8). MBP
alone or MBP-kinectin<sup>coil</sup> (containing a control coiled-coil domain)
did not affect the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and
B</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, we
determined the binding domain of Kank in IRSp53 (amino acids 80â150),
which also overlapped with the coiled-coil domain and was located within the
RCB. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamagishi et al. (2004)</xref> reported
that the N-terminal half of IRSp53 contains a filopodium-inducing domain
regulated by Rac1 and cdc42. IRSp53 contains a partial CRIB motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burbelo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Govind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krugmann et al., 2001</xref>), a sequence of 16
amino acid residues (amino acids 267â283), which is located far from
the Kank binding domain (amino acids 80â150). Our result showed that
the binding of Kank to IRSp53 partially affected the binding between cdc42 and
IRSp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). We then
examined the effect of knockdown (KD) of Kank using endoribonuclease-prepared
siRNA (esiRNA) on the binding between active Rac1 and IRSp53 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). For this, we established HEK293
cells stably expressing active Rac1 (Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>). These cells were
transfected with Kank esiRNA along with control esiRNA. After treatment with
esiRNA for 30 h, the cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an
anti-IRSp53 antibody that was raised against the C-terminal portion of IRSp53.
The results of Western blot analysis revealed that Kank esiRNA efficiently
decreased the level of Kank protein in the lysates but did not change the level
of IRSp53 or Rac1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>,
compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 or 2 in the lysate panel). The results of
immunoprecipitation showed that depletion of Kank with Kank esiRNA resulted in
less Kank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, compare lanes 3 and
4 with lane 2 in the top row) and, at the same time, increased the amount of
active Rac1 (Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3

        <title>Kank inhibits Rac1-induced formation of lamellipodia through IRSp53</title>
        <p>Kank affected the interaction between IRSp53 and Rac1 and partially affected that
between IRSp53 and cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). This
led us to investigate the effect of Kank expression on the formation of
lamellipodia or filopodia mediated by Rac1 or cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).
Initially, IRSp53 was reported to be a downstream target of Rac1 that links Rac1
activity to WAVE/Scar and the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002</xref>). However, others reported that
IRSp53 preferentially binds to active cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Govind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krugmann et
al., 2001</xref>). Overexpression of Kank severely impaired the development
of lamellipodia and cell spreading induced by a constitutively active form of
Rac1, Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lane
4). Overexpression of Kank<sup>S167A</sup>, which lacks the ability to bind to
14-3-3 and has inhibitory effects on active RhoA and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kakinuma et al., 2008</xref>), also impaired the
formation of lamellipodia induced by Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lane 5). However,
Kank<sup>Îcoil</sup>, which cannot interact with IRSp53, had no effect
on the Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>-induced development of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lane 6). To confirm that this
effect of Kank depends on the interaction with IRSp53, we performed coexpression
of Kank with IRSp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).
Coexpression of GFP-Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> and Kank with IRSp53 resulted in the
disappearance of Kank's inhibitory effect on the
Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>-dependent formation of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lane 4). However, coexpression of
GFP-Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> and Kank with IRSp53<sup>R11E/Q23E</sup> or
IRSp53<sup>K143E</sup>, which could not bind to Rac1 and could bind to Kank
(Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805147/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805147/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suetsugu et al., 2006b</xref>), resulted in the
retention of the inhibitory effect on the Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>-dependent
development of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>,
lanes 5 and 6). This result implies that Kank inhibits Rac1âIRSp53
signals for the formation of lamellipodia. Moreover, to confirm that this
Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>-dependent formation depends on IRSp53, we performed KD
of IRSp53 along with GFP-Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). We first examined the KD of mouse IRSp53 (mIRS)
in NIH3T3 cells using various candidate plasmids (Fig. S2). These plasmids
contained an H1 promoterâbased expression system for siRNAs in
mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steffen et al., 2004</xref>).
Based on the results, we used #513 siRNA for the KD of mIRS.
Coexpression of GFP-Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> and mIRS-KD reduced the
Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>-dependent formation of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, lane 3), whereas on the coexpression of human
IRSp53 with GFP-Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> and mIRS-KD, GFP-Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>
retained its function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, lane 4).
However, the coexpression of human IRSp53<sup>R11E/Q23E</sup> or
IRSp53<sup>K143E</sup> with GFP-Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> and mIRS-KD had little
effect on mIRS-KD's function in the Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>-dependent
formation of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>,
lanes 5 and 6). Therefore, the interaction between IRSp53 and active Rac1 is
important for lamellipodia to form. These results suggest that IRSp53 is one of
the targets of Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> in the Rac1<sup>G12V</sup>-dependent
development of lamellipodia. However, overexpression of Kank and
Kank<sup>S167A</sup> had little effect on the formation of filopodia induced by
a constitutively active form of cdc42, cdc42<sup>G12V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>, lanes 3 and 4), which may imply
that Kank was not involved in the cdc42<sup>G12V</sup>-mediated formation of
microspikes.</p>

        <p>Based on the finding that Kank bound to IRSp53 and inhibited active Rac1-mediated
lamellipodial development, as well as reports of IRSp53 as a downstream target
of Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miki and Takenawa, 2002</xref>), we examined the
effect of KD of Kank on the formation of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>).6 NIH3T3 cells were transfected with a Kank KD
vector that targeted mouse <italic>Kank</italic> transcripts, a control KD
vector, and an mIRS-KD as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.
6</xref>. Because we used plasmids containing a <italic>neo-gfp</italic> fusion
gene in this assay, transfected cells can be stained with an anti-GFP antibody
against GFP or can be detected with GFP fluorophore. The cells were cultured for
48 h after transfection and fixed and stained with anti-GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>; green) or with phalloidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>; red). Transfection of a KD vector
(Kank-KD) effectively suppressed the expression of Kank protein by â¼80%
with respect to control-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>,

â¼100% with respect to control-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6

that silencing of Kank resulted in the formation of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lane 2). However, the silencing
of both Kank and IRSp53 simultaneously had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lane 3). These findings support the idea that
Kank inhibits lamellipodia from forming by interrupting the interaction between
active Rac1 and IRSp53.</p>

        <title>Kank inhibits insulin-induced membrane ruffling</title>
        <p>Lamellipodia and filopodia are formed at the leading edge in migrating cells in
response to growth factors, chemokines, and extracellular matrix molecules
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>). Insulin acts
as a growth factor, and insulin-stimulated KB cells, a strain derived from human
epidermoid carcinoma, show membrane ruffling and Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishiyama et al., 1994</xref>). Overexpression
of Kank inhibited active Rac1-dependent lamellipodial development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), and KD of Kank enhanced the
formation of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). We
then investigated whether Kank can inhibit insulin-induced membrane ruffling
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Whereas serum-starved
NIH3T3 cells without treatment showed little membrane ruffling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>, lane 1), insulin-stimulated cells
exhibited extensive membrane ruffling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig.

membrane ruffling was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>, lane 3). However, the effect of overexpression of Kank was
not observed when IRSp53 was coexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig.

        <title>Kank inhibits integrin-mediated cell spreading through IRSp53</title>
        <p>Integrins are major adhesion receptors in vertebrates and play major roles in
cell adhesion and in a variety of intracellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hynes, 2002</xref>). The Rho family of small
GTPases such as Rac1 and cdc42 are involved in integrin-mediated cell spreading
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Price et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katoh and Negishi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2005</xref>). As Kank interrupted the interaction between
active Rac1 and IRSp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), we
hypothesized that it might inhibit integrin-mediated cell spreading. To
investigate the role of Kank downstream of integrin signaling, NIH3T3 cells were
transfected, seeded on fibronectin-coated glass substrata, fixed, and stained
with phalloidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>).8 The cells
adhered rapidly to the substrata and completed spreading in 30 min, showing a
normal shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>, lane 1). However,
the expression of the wild-type Kank radically changed cell shape and markedly
inhibited cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>, lane
2). Notably, this change was not caused by apoptosis because nuclear staining of
transfected cells with DAPI did not show any sign of apoptosis (unpublished
data) and the cells were viable, as they could spread later (unpublished data).
Kank<sup>Îcoil</sup>, which cannot bind to IRSp53, did not show
any significant changes in cell shape or cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>, lane 3). Kank<sup>S167A</sup>, which cannot bind
to 14-3-3, partially inhibited cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>, lane 4). We obtained similar results using COS-7 and HeLa
cells (unpublished data). In contrast, a control protein with the coiled-coil
domain, kinectin<sup>coil</sup>, did not affect the spreading of NIH3T3 cells
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>, lane 5). From these
results, Kank inhibits cell spreading specifically through its coiled-coil
domain.</p>

        <p>To see how Kank inhibits cell spreading and whether this phenomenon depends on
IRSp53, Kank was coexpressed with IRSp53 in NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). When Kank was coexpressed with wild-type
IRSp53, cell spreading was enhanced compared with that when only Kank was
expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>, compare lane 2 with

2002</xref>). We then examined whether the inhibitory effect of Kank on cell
spreading depends on IRSp53âRac1 signaling. Kank was coexpressed with
IRSp53<sup>R11E/Q23E</sup> or IRSp53<sup>K143E</sup> in NIH3T3 cells when
the cells were spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>, lanes
4 and 5). Surprisingly, the rates of spreading differed little between wild-type
IRSp53, IRSp53<sup>R11E/Q23E</sup>, and IRSp53<sup>K143E</sup> when Kank was
present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>, lanes 3â5).
Next, we investigated whether IRSp53 was involved in the spreading of NIH3T3
cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). KD of mIRS resulted in
the inhibition of cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8
C</xref>, compare lane 1 with lane 3). In contrast, KD of mIRS with
overexpression of the wild type or the mutants of human IRSp53 did not affect
the spreading of NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>,
lanes 4â6). Furthermore, there was almost no change in cell spreading
with or without KD of IRSp53 when Kank was overexpressed (Fig. S3, available at
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805147/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805147/DC1</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>We then investigated the effect of Kank and IRSp53 expression on cell morphology
when NIH3T3 cells were spreading upon stimulation with fibronectin (Fig. S4,
available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805147/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805147/DC1</ext-link>). Cell
shapes were classified according to those in the process of matrix-based cell
spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Applewhite et al., 2007</xref>).
Overexpression of Kank decreased the number of cells with the filopodial
phenotype, whereas overexpression of IRSp53 increased the number of smooth-edged
cells. Notably, coexpression of Kank and IRSp53 decreased the number of cells
with the filopodial phenotype, whereas there was no increase in the number of
the cells with the smooth-edged phenotype. These results suggest that Kank
partially inhibits the spreading of NIH3T3 cells through IRSp53, although this
phenomenon was not part of the Rac1âIRSp53 signaling pathway. The
reason why IRSp53 partially recovers cell spreading inhibited by Kank might be
that Kank inhibits the formation of both filopodial microspikes and
lamellipodial sheets, whereas IRSp53 contributes only to lamellipodial sheets
when the cells are spreading.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we demonstrated that Kank plays a major role in the negative
regulation of lamellipodial development in fibroblasts. The regulation is likely to
be mediated by interaction with IRSp53 in ruffled areas of the cell. This binding
seems to be constitutive because it was not affected by stimulation with a growth
factor like PDGF or EGF (unpublished data). IRSp53 is a multidomain scaffolding
protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Govind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krugmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soltau et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connolly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hori
et al., 2005</xref>) and a downstream target of Rac1 and links WAVE2 to Rac1
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miki and Takenawa, 2002</xref>), which plays an
important role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.</p>
      <p>Kank contains two important domains, the coiled-coil and ankyrin repeat domains, both
of which have been described in several structural proteins as well as in proteins
involved in an array of cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sedgwick and Smerdon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhard et
al., 2001</xref>). We showed in this study that the coiled-coil domain of Kank
is necessary for binding with IRSp53 and the negative regulation of cell spreading
and lamellipodial development induced by constitutively active Rac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although active Rac1- or active cdc42-dependent actin polymerization has been
described for the regulation of WASP and WAVE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bompard and Caron, 2004</xref>) and the regulation of Rac1 activity
through three major classes of regulators, GTPase-activating proteins, guanine
nucleotide exchange factors, and GDP dissociation inhibitors, has been identified,
albeit with little understanding of the signaling pathways that modulate their
activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004</xref>),
Kank does not possess any of these classical regulatory functions in Rac1
activation. This raises the possibility that Kank functions via other proteins also.</p>
      <p>IRSp53 makes a complex with Eps8 and activates Rac1, which is important to cancer
cell motility and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funato et al.,
2004</xref>). Active cdc42 binds to the complex of IRSp53 and Eps8 and controls its
cellular distribution, thereby contributing to the generation of actin bundles and
promoting filopodial protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Disanza et al.,
2006</xref>). Eps8 was shown to form a complex with Abi-1, Sos-1, E3B1, and
PI3-K, which activate Rac1 and transduce signals from Ras to Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biesova et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scita et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Innocenti et al., 2003</xref>).
Tiam1, another Rac1 activator, also binds to IRSp53, leading to increased activation
of Rac1 and enhanced binding of IRSp53 to both active Rac1 and WAVE2. Tiam1 promotes
the localization of IRSp53 to Rac1-induced lamellipodia rather than cdc42-induced
filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connolly et al., 2005</xref>).
Similarly, Kank specifically inhibits the binding between IRSp53 and
Rac1<sup>G12V</sup> rather than that between IRSp53 and cdc42<sup>G12V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>), which is consistent with the
finding that the coexpression of Kank with active Rac1 or active cdc42 in NIH3T3
cells showed marked differences: the formation of lamellipodia induced by active
Rac1 was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), whereas
microspikes or filopodia generated by active cdc42 showed some but not great
alteration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Because the IMD/RCB
domain of IRSp53 overlaps with the Kank binding domain, Kank might disrupt the
association of active Rac1 to IRSp53. In contrast, the cdc42-binding domain of
IRSp53 is located far from the Kank binding domain. This may be why Kank weakly
inhibits cdc42-IRSp53 association. KD of Kank by RNAi in NIH3T3 cells revealed that
depletion of Kank resulted in an increase in lamellipodia, whereas KD of both Kank
and IRSp53 resulted in normal or unaltered cell shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Moreover, Kank inhibited insulin-induced membrane
ruffling, and coexpression of Kank with IRSp53 abrogated this inhibitory effect
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). This suggests that Kank
inhibits the IRSp53-dependent formation of lamellipodia. However, Kank inhibited
integrin-dependent cell spreading through IRSp53, but this was not caused by Rac1
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, B and C</xref>). Kank also inhibited
IRSp53-dependent neurite outgrowth in N1E115 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig.
9</xref>). Kank binds to the IMD/RCB domain of IRSp53, and it has been shown that
this domain binds not only to active Rac1 but also to actin and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamagishi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Millard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suetsugu et al.,
2006b</xref>). The IMD/RCB domain was also shown to have actin-bundling activity
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Millard et al., 2005</xref>), although this
activity may only be seen under nonphysiological conditions such as at a low ionic
strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattila et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this,
we also found that actin was present in a complex immunoprecipitated with an
anti-IRSp53 antibody in HEK293 cells (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805147/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805147/DC1</ext-link>). Expression
of Kank is likely to inhibit the association of IRSp53 with actin, which implies
that Kank negatively regulates the association of IRSp53 with actin. This might be
why Kank inhibits the spreading of NIH3T3 cells and the outgrowth of neurites in
N1E115 cells through the binding of IRSp53.</p>
      <p>Kank regulates RhoA activity through its 14-3-3 binding motif inside the coiled-coil
domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kakinuma et al., 2008</xref>). Kank
inhibited Rac1âIRSp53 signaling, which is mediated by the coiled-coil
domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). However, the formation of
lamellipodia induced by active Rac1 was inhibited by both Kank and
Kank<sup>S167A</sup>, which cannot bind to 14-3-3 and was ineffective against active
RhoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). From this
finding, the effect of Kank on active Rac1-induced lamellipodial development can be
separated from the effect of the binding of 14-3-3 to Kank. In contrast,
overexpression of Kank<sup>S167A</sup> was relatively ineffective compared with the
effect of wild-type Kank on integrin-dependent cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>, compare lane 2 with lane 4). A deletion mutant,
Kank<sup>Îcoil</sup>, was not completely effective against
integrin-dependent cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>,
lane 3); Kank may affect the integrin-dependent cell spreading mediated by both
IRSp53 and 14-3-3 or more likely through the Kank coiled-coil domain.</p>
      <p>Although there are orthologues of Kank in different species, in which the coiled-coil
domain along with the ankyrin repeat domain are conserved, only VAB-19 of <italic>C.
elegans</italic> has been studied and was shown to be a component of the
epidermal attachment structure and to interact with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2003</xref>). This further strengthens our finding that
Kank functions through the coiled-coil domain in the regulation of actin remodeling.
This function of Kank in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton may be
conserved in other orthologues as well. Further studies are needed to explore other
potential roles of Kank or the KankâIRSp53 complex in response to external
stimuli, which may contribute to our understanding of the cell signaling mechanisms
in renal cell carcinoma.</p>
