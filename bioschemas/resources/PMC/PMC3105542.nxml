        <p>The newly identified SYLF lipid-binding domain of SH3YL1 mediates phosphoinositide binding during dorsal membrane morphogenesis.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Reversible interactions between cytosolic proteins and membrane lipids such as phosphoinositides play important roles in membrane morphogenesis driven by actin polymerization. In this paper, we identify a novel lipid-binding module, which we call the SYLF domain (after the SH3YL1, Ysc84p/Lsb4p, Lsb3p, and plant FYVE proteins that contain it), that is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals. SH3YL1 (SH3 domain containing Ysc84-like 1) strongly bound to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) and several D5-phosphorylated phosphoinositides through its SYLF domain and was localized to circular dorsal ruffles induced by platelet-derived growth factor stimulation. Interestingly, SHIP2 (the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> 5-phosphatase, src-homology 2âcontaining inositol-5-phosphatase 2) was identified as a binding partner of SH3YL1, and knockdown of these proteins significantly suppressed dorsal ruffle formation. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>), which is mainly synthesized from PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> by the action of SHIP2, was enriched in dorsal ruffles, and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis strongly correlated with formation of the circular membrane structure. These results provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of dorsal ruffle formation and its regulation by phosphoinositide metabolism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Membrane ruffles are short-lived, highly dynamic, and F-actinâenriched structures induced by various extracellular stimuli. It is now well established that treatment with growth factors, including EGF and PDGF, results in the formation of two different types of plasma membrane structures: peripheral ruffles and dorsal ruffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buccione et al., 2004</xref>). Of these two structures, dorsal ruffles are easily distinguishable from peripheral ruffles by their unique ring-shaped morphology and are believed to play important roles in the establishment of polarity in motile cells, macropinocytosis, and the internalization of cell surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dowrick et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Swanson and Watts, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krueger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Orth and McNiven, 2006</xref>). For the formation of dorsal ruffles, engagement of the growth factors to their receptor tyrosine kinases activates early effector kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Src. This leads to the activation of downstream signaling proteins, including small GTPases such as Rac, Ras, and Rab5 and serine/threonine kinases such as protein kinase A and Pak1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dharmawardhane et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lanzetti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palamidessi et al., 2008</xref>). Consequently, these signaling pathways are thought to regulate the activity of cytoskeletal components such as neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), Arp2/3, cortactin, sorting nexin 9, and dynamin for the robust actin polymerization at dorsal ruffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krueger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buccione et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yarar et al., 2007</xref>). Despite these findings, the role of membrane lipids such as phosphoinositides and their metabolizing enzymes, including phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases, is yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>Reversible interactions between soluble cytosolic proteins and phospholipids in the plasma membrane are essential for a wide variety of cellular functions, including vesicular trafficking, cell proliferation, and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itoh and Takenawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lemmon, 2008</xref>). Moreover, studies in recent years have revealed that the curvature of membranes can be determined by a certain group of lipid-binding modules such as BinâAmphiphysinâRvs (BAR), Fer-CIP4 homology and BAR (F-BAR), and Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McMahon and Gallop, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Itoh and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heath and Insall, 2008</xref>). These domains not only bind to acidic phospholipids but can also transform PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing liposomes into elongated membrane tubules in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takei et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farsad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsujita et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, overexpression of these domains can also induce robust tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamioka et al., 2004</xref>). The BAR domain super family proteins, including those with the BAR and F-BAR domains, typically contain a single or tandem SH3 domains at their C termini to form a molecular complex with N-WASP and dynamin, two key components in actin polymerization and membrane fission during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ringstad et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsujita et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we describe a novel phosphoinositide-binding domain in a group of proteins with a C-terminal SH3 domain named the SYLF (SH3YL1, Ysc84p/Lsb4p, Lsb3p, and plant FYVE protein) domain. The SYLF domain of an SH3 domain containing Ysc84-like 1 (SH3YL1), a mammalian protein, strongly binds to D5-phosphoinositides including phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>). We further identify the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> 5-phosphatase src-homology 2âcontaining inositol-5-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) as a binding partner for SH3YL1, and both proteins are required for the formation of circular dorsal ruffles induced by PDGF stimulation. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>), which is synthesized from PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> by the action of SHIP2, is enriched at matured dorsal ruffles, indicating that this phosphoinositide transition plays an important role in the formation of the ring-shaped membrane structure. Our findings suggest a mechanism by which SH3YL1 couples SHIP2 as well as subsequent PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis for membrane remodeling during dorsal ruffle formation.</p>

        <title>The N-terminal region of SH3YL1 is an evolutionarily conserved and structurally independent domain with high affinity for phosphoinositides</title>
        <p>While searching the Pfam database for proteins with an SH3 domain in their C termini, we identified an unexplored domain species, domain of unknown function (DUF) 500. By sequence alignment, we found that the DUF500 domain is part of a longer amino acid sequence that is conserved from yeast to mammals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201012161/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). Notably, this homologous region exists not only in eukaryotes, such as fungi, plants, and vertebrates, but also in Gram-negative bacteria (see Discussion).</p>
        <p>To determine whether this entire region forms an independent structure that extends from the DUF500 domain to the N terminus, we predicted the domain boundary by using the support vector machine (SVM) long method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebina et al., 2009</xref>). In the primary sequence of human SH3YL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2000</xref>), a putative linker region separating two structural domains was predicted to be Gln230âGlu265 with a peak probability at Pro242 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), suggesting that â¼230 N-terminal residues form a structurally independent unit. A similar result was obtained using the DomCut server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suyama and Ohara, 2003</xref>), which predicted Pro246 as the most probable linker position (unpublished data). These predictions were supported by the results of proteolytic digestion experiments, wherein purified FLAG-SH3YL1 (full length) protein was incubated with limiting amounts of trypsin. The N-terminal region of SH3YL1, which was recognized by anti-FLAG, was cleaved to an â¼25-kD fragment, slightly larger than FLAG-SH3YL1 SYLF (1â216) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). A faint band was also observed around â¼16 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, asterisk), suggesting another very minor cleavage site. These results indicate that the C-terminal region extending from Glu217 acts as the primary domain linker that is accessible to trypsin. Based on these data and our findings from this study, we define this â¼220-residue-long N-terminal region as a single domain module named âSYLFâ domain on the basis of its representative members (SH3YL1, Ysc84p/Lsb4p, Lsb3p, and plant FYVE protein; Fig. S1 B).</p>

        <p>The yeast SYLF protein Ysc84p/Lsb4p localizes to actin patches and plays an important role in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dewar et al., 2002</xref>). The conserved N-terminal region binds to and forms a bundle of F-actin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robertson et al., 2009</xref>). We attempted to recapitulate this finding by using SH3YL1, but neither full-length SH3YL1 nor its SYLF domain bound to F-actin (Fig. S1 C). In contrast, the SYLF domains of the budding yeast proteins Ysc84p/Lsb4p and Lsb3p, as well as actinin-1 (ACTN1), which was used as a positive control, showed efficient F-actin binding (Fig. S1 C).</p>
        <p>The failure of SH3YL1 to bind F-actin suggests that it is not an evolutionarily conserved biochemical property, at least in mammalian SYLF domains. In addition, in pull-down experiments using HeLa cell lysate and rat brain cytosolic fractions, no proteins bound to the SH3YL1 SYLF domainâGST fusion protein (unpublished data). These results prompted us to examine whether it binds to phospholipids like the BAR and F-BAR domains in the proteins containing C-terminal SH3 domains. As expected, full-length and truncated recombinant proteins containing the SH3YL1 SYLF domain bound well to liposomes that were composed of acidic phospholipids from brain extracts (brain liposomes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In contrast, a deletion mutant that lacked the SYLF domain (ÎSYLF) had nearly no affinity for liposomes. These results demonstrate that the SYLF domain is essential and adequate for lipid binding. Moreover, yeast SYLF domains had high affinities for liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), indicating that lipid binding is an evolutionarily conserved property of the eukaryotic SYLF domains.</p>
        <p>Next, we assessed the lipid-binding specificity of the full-length protein and found that it bound to PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> with the highest affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Other D5-phosphorylated phosphoinositides such as PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> were also preferred compared with other acidic phospholipids. Similar results were obtained with the SYLF domainâonly construct (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201012161/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>), confirming that this module binds to phosphoinositides.</p>

        <title>An amphipathic Î± helix at the N terminus of the SYLF domain is necessary for lipid binding</title>
        <p>We observed that the predicted Î±-helical sequence at the N terminus of the SYLF domain (residues 9â23) contained many positively charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Moreover, this region was predicted to possess amphipathic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), suggesting that it plays an important role in lipid binding. To test this hypothesis, a deletion mutant (Î1â29) was constructed and subjected to lipid-binding assay. The deletion mutant (Î1â29) showed much lower affinity than the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), indicating the importance of this region. The contribution of the positively charged residues on the hydrophilic surface of this region (Lys14 + Lys15 [M1] or Lys18 + Arg21 [M2]) was determined by replacing them with alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). In comparison with wild type, the binding affinity of these mutants for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, especially that of the M1 mutant, was significantly low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>).</p>

        <p>Notably, the 30 residues of the N terminus (1â30) bound poorly to the brain liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), indicating that this Î± helix alone is inadequate for binding and that the remainder of the region makes a significant contribution to the lipid binding. This phenomenon was not attributed to the avidity generated as a result of apparent dimerization or oligomerization through the remainder of the region because the full-length SH3YL1 and SYLF domain are monomeric, as shown by gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Together with the fact that the Î1â29 mutant still retains â¼40% of binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), these data collectively suggest that the SYLF domain has a lipid-binding surface, which is formed by positively charged residues in the N-terminal amphipathic helix and unidentified residues in the remainder of the domain.</p>

        <title>SH3YL1 localizes to the plasma membrane at an early stage of dorsal ruffle formation</title>
        <p>Growth factor stimulation induces the dynamic and transient formation of membrane ruffles on the dorsal surface of NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MellstrÃ¶m et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buccione et al., 2004</xref>). Because SH3YL1 strongly bound to PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, which is produced by growth factor stimulation, we investigated whether SH3YL1 localizes to the PDGF-induced dorsal ruffles.</p>
        <p>Under serum-starved conditions (0 min), HA-tagged SH3YL1 (HA-SH3YL1) was localized to the cytosol in NIH3T3 cells. 2 min after PDGF stimulation, HA-SH3YL1 was recruited to a plasma membrane structure with short actin filaments that were aligned in a circular pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). This structure appeared to be an immature form of dorsal ruffles, suggesting that SH3YL1 functions at an early stage of dorsal ruffle formation. At 5 min, HA-SH3YL1 accumulated at mature and circular dorsal ruffles that were rich in dense F-actin structures. Consistent with the observations in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suetsugu et al., 2003</xref>), dorsal ruffle formation was blocked by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), indicating that D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides and their binding partners are involved in this process.</p>

        <p>Next, we studied whether the lipid-binding activity of SH3YL1 is required for its localization to the dorsal ruffles. The SYLF domain, which was determined to be essential for phosphoinositide binding, was sufficient for localization to the dorsal ruffles (Fig. S2 B). In addition, the density of the mutant form of SH3YL1, which has reduced affinity for phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>, HA-SH3YL1 [M1]), was lower at the dorsal ruffles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>) compared with that of the wild type. To quantify these findings, we measured the fluorescence intensities of HA-SH3YL1 as well as mCherry protein, which was coexpressed as a cytosolic marker of the dorsal ruffle area, to calculate the net intensity by subtracting the cytosolic signal. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, the localization of the M1, M2, and Î1â29 mutants to the dorsal ruffles was significantly lower than that observed in the case of wild type, demonstrating that SH3YL1 is recruited to the plasma membrane via PI3K-dependent SYLFâphosphoinositide interactions.</p>

        <title>SH3YL1 is necessary for dorsal ruffle formation</title>
        <p>Because SH3YL1 localized to the dorsal ruffles, we assessed whether it was necessary for the formation of dorsal ruffles. Transfection of SH3YL1-targeting siRNAs resulted in the depletion of &gt;90% of SH3YL1 protein but did not alter actin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Dorsal ruffles were formed in â¼60% of control siRNAâtreated cells after PDGF stimulation, whereas significantly fewer ruffles were formed in SH3YL1 siRNAâtreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). This suppression was alleviated by the exogenous wild-type SH3YL1 but not by ÎSH3, M1, or M2 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), suggesting that the presence of both the SH3 domain and a functional SYLF domain is necessary.</p>

        <p>Dorsal ruffles have been implicated in macropinocytosis, which can be monitored with markers for fluid-phase endocytosis. Consistent with the dynamic association of SH3YL1 with dorsal ruffles, PDGF-dependent fluid-phase endocytosis was inhibited in SH3YL1 knockdown cells relative to control cells, as observed by dextran internalization assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). To quantify this effect, we measured the uptake of HRP, a marker of fluid-phase endocytosis. Knockdown of SH3YL1 expression by all three siRNAs resulted in a significant reduction in the PDGF-induced internalization of HRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>).

        <title>SH3YL1 forms a complex with SHIP2, a phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase</title>
        <p>To determine the molecular mechanism by which SH3YL1 mediates dorsal ruffle formation, we attempted to identify its binding proteins. The SH3 domain of SH3YL1 was expressed as a GST fusion protein and was used in a pull-down assay with HeLa cell lysates.

        <p>Notably, SHIP2, a PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> 5-phosphatase that generates PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, was also identified in the pull-down fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). We decided to focus on this interaction because of its potential relevance to SH3YL1 function in PI3K-dependent dorsal ruffle formation. This interaction was reproduced using exogenous Myc-tagged SHIP2 (Myc-SHIP2), which was pulled down by GST-SH3 and GST-SH3YL1 (full length) but not by GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Moreover, SH3YL1 and SHIP2 interacted with each other in the HeLa cells that were transfected with FLAG-tagged SH3YL1 (FLAG-SH3YL1). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, endogenous SHIP2 was detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from the lysates of FLAG-SH3YL1 (full length)âtransfected cells but not from lysates of cells that were transfected with ÎSH3 or W322A, wherein a highly conserved tryptophan residue in the SH3 domain was mutated; this suggested that SH3YL1 interacts with SHIP2 through its SH3 domain. The W322A mutant was unable to rescue the impaired dorsal ruffle formation in SH3YL1 knockdown NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Endogenous SHIP2 was detected in the anti-SH3YL1 immunoprecipitates from NIH3T3 cell lysates, further indicating that they form a complex in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). We also determined this interaction to be direct, as shown in pull-down experiments using purified FLAG-SHIP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>).</p>
        <p>The C-terminal region of SHIP2 is rich in proline residues and mediates several interactions with SH3 domainâcontaining proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dyson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie et al., 2008</xref>). To our surprise, the deletion of a C-terminal region, including the proline-rich area (SHIP2 (1â740)), did not alter the coimmunoprecipitation of SHIP2 with SH3YL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Conversely, deletion of the SH2 domain and a flanking region that is on the N-terminal side of the lipid phosphatase domain (SHIP2 (415â1,258)) nearly abolished the binding. In this flanking region, we identified an amino acid sequence, PPLPPR, that matched the class II consensus motif of SH3 domainâbinding peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mayer and Gupta, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, the deletion (SHIP2 (Î139â144)) and mutation (SHIP2 (PL140,141AA)) of this sequence resulted in loss of binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also examined whether the interaction between SH3YL1 and SHIP2 was regulated by growth factor stimulation. FLAG-SH3YL1âexpressing NIH3T3 cells were treated with PDGF followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG. Compared with serum-starved conditions (0 min), the interaction significantly increased 5 min after PDGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>). These results demonstrate that SH3YL1 and SHIP2 form a molecular complex through an interaction between the N-terminal proline-rich sequence in SHIP2 and the C-terminal SH3 domain of SH3YL1 that is regulated by PDGF.</p>

        <p>The function of SHIP2 was further examined in knockdown experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). In SHIP2 knockdown cells, the formation of ring-shaped circular dorsal ruffles was impaired, whereas the ruffles in the peripheral membrane remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, C [arrow] and D). Notably, several relatively straight ruffles were formed at the dorsal plasma membrane, to which SH3YL1 also localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, C [arrowheads], D, and E [arrows]). These effects were specifically suppressed by exogenous SHIP2, depending on its interaction with SH3YL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). The straight ruffles that were induced by SHIP2 knockdown are possibly malformed dorsal ruffles that cannot develop ring-shaped structures. Correspondingly, dextran uptake was also inhibited in SHIP2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 F</xref>). These data imply that SHIP2 functions with SH3YL1 and that SHIP2 mediates the formation of the circular membrane structure.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, our pull-down experiment also identified PI3K-C2Î² as a binding partner for the SH3 domain of SH3YL1.

To investigate the relationship between PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> levels and dorsal ruffle formation, we measured cellular levels of phosphoinositides after stimulation with PDGF by dot-blot assay.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we identified the SYLF domain as a novel phosphoinositide-binding module. The SYLF domain also exists in the bacterial genome and is highly conserved in mammals and green plants (Fig. S1 B). The Pfam database and findings from our analysis using the SignalP and LipoP program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Juncker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emanuelsson et al., 2007</xref>) revealed that bacterial proteins harboring the SYLF domain retain putative signal peptides at their N terminus and are thus likely to be exported to the periplasmic space or outer environment. The biochemical and physiological functions of SYLF proteins in the bacteria should be studied to learn about this newly identified lipid-binding module.</p>
      <p>Conversely, eukaryotic SYLF domains have the lowest homologies to bacterial members, especially at the â¼30 N-terminal residues, but they contain amphipathic Î± helices. Findings from our in silico and in vitro analyses support that the entire SYLF domain in human SH3YL1, including the amphipathic Î± helix, is an independent structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Moreover, we have implicated the positively charged residues (Lys14, Lys15, Lys18, and Arg21) in a putative amphipathic Î± helix in lipid binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that some lipid-binding modules, such as the ENTH and N-terminal amphipathic helix and BAR (N-BAR) domains, have N-terminal amphipathic Î± helices that mediate membrane curvature generation and/or sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farsad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatia et al., 2009</xref>). With regard to lipid-binding mechanisms, structural analyses of these domains have revealed a single binding pocket in the former and a relatively flat binding surface in the latter, to both of which the N-terminal Î± helices and the remainder of the region contribute equally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallop et al., 2006</xref>). The crystal structure of the SYLF domain will help determine the mechanism by which this novel lipid-binding module recognizes membrane lipids with its amphipathic Î± helix. We have not observed any curvature dependency in membrane binding by the SYLF domain of SH3YL1 (unpublished data). We are interested in determining whether the SYLF domain retains any membrane-deforming activity, as the ENTH and N-BAR domains have.</p>
      <p>Ysc84p/Lsb4p, an SYLF protein in budding yeast, localizes to actin patches at the plasma membrane and binds directly to F-actin through its N-terminal region in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dewar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robertson et al., 2009</xref>). On the basis of these findings, this region, which corresponds to the SYLF domain in mammals, was termed the Ysc84 actin-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robertson et al., 2009</xref>). However, despite its significant homology to the Ysc84 actin-binding domain, the SYLF domain of SH3YL1 did not bind to F-actin (Fig. S1 C); instead, it bound to the phosphoinositides, including PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and E</xref>). The yeast SYLF domains of Ysc84p/Lsb4p and Lsb3p also bound robustly to brain liposomes composed of acidic phospholipids, including PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), indicating that this lipid-binding activity is highly conserved. Because PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is believed to be absent in yeast, these SYLF proteins might be used for interactions with phosphoinositides in yeast, such as PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p>
      <p>Using the SH3 domain of SH3YL1 as a probe, we identified several interacting partners, including the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> 5-phosphatase SHIP2. Our results are consistent with the observation that the SYLF domain binds preferentially to PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. This model is supported by findings that the SH3 domain deletion mutant (ÎSH3) and the binding-incompetent mutant (W322A) of SH3YL1 were unable to rescue dorsal ruffle formation in the SH3YL1-depleted NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), suggesting that SHIP2 binding is critical for this process. Similarly, SH3YL1 binding is required for SHIP2 to recover circular dorsal ruffle formation in SHIP2 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). On the basis of our results, we propose the following model of dorsal ruffle formation: (a) upon stimulation by growth factors, SH3YL1 is recruited to the dorsal surface of the plasma membrane via interactions between its SYLF domain and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>; (b) SHIP2 is targeted to the SH3 domain of SH3YL1, where it dephosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, generating PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>; and (c) Tapp1 is recruited to the PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>-enriched membrane site, promoting dorsal ruffle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>).</p>
      <p>The cellular localization and functions of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> are poorly understood because it has been recognized only as a PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> metabolite. Recently, our group demonstrated that PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is enriched in and is crucial for the formation of podosomes in Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oikawa et al., 2008</xref>). The similarity in appearance between the dorsal ruffles and the podosomes, which are circular F-actinâenriched structures, implicates a common mechanism mediated by PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and its downstream targets. However, the lipid phosphatases that generate PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> may differ between these cases, as SHIP2 is essential for dorsal ruffle formation but not for podosomes, which require synaptojanin 2 instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oikawa et al., 2008</xref>). A recent study has shown that accumulation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> by suppression of INPP4B results in enhanced Akt activation and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gewinner et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, INPP4A, another PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> 4-phosphatase, mediates the suppression of glutamate excitotoxicity in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>). These studies and the present findings strongly suggest that PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is not only a degradation product of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, but it also has its own functions in vivo.</p>
      <p>In addition to SHIP2, SH3YL1 interacted with several proteins such as PI3K-C2Î², Tks4, and dynamin 2 through its SH3 domain. We showed that PI3K-C2Î² is important for the formation of dorsal ruffles (Fig. S3 E). PI3K-C2Î² phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to generate PI(3)P in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">SindiÄ et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foster et al., 2003</xref>). In support of this, dorsal ruffle formation was blocked by overexpression of Hrs FYVE, which masks PI(3)P on early endosomes. Correspondingly, a recent study has shown that Rab5-mediated endocytosis is required for the activation of Rac on early endosomes to initiate the formation of dorsal circular ruffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palamidessi et al., 2008</xref>). PI3K-C2Î±, another isoform of the class II PI3K, alters its substrate specificity when it binds to clathrin in such a manner that facilitates PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaidarov et al., 2001</xref>). If this were also the case for PI3K-C2Î² when it binds to SH3YL1, it would explain the reduction in PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> formation after PDGF stimulation in SH3YL1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). In support of this model, we have observed that PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production decreases by PI3K-C2Î² knockdown (Fig. S5 B).</p>
      <p>Depletion of Tks4 had minimal effects on dorsal ruffle formation (unpublished data). Tks4 is a scaffolding protein with an N-terminal phox homology domain, four SH3 domains, and several proline-rich motifs, which are required for the formation of the podosome, another circular F-actin structure rich in PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buschman et al., 2009</xref>). Given that podosomes form at the ventral surface of the cell, Tks4 might function with SH3YL1 at the ventral, but not dorsal, side of the plasma membrane.</p>
      <p>Dynamin 2 might also contribute to the regulation of the dorsal ruffles in complex with SH3YL1. Previous studies have indicated that dynamin 2 is recruited to the dorsal ruffles, and the expression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin 2 (K44A) strongly inhibits PDGF-induced macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krueger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schlunck et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with the findings of a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), the suppression of dynamin 2 by RNAi resulted in the inhibition of dorsal ruffle formation (unpublished data). However, the mechanism underlying SH3YL1 functioning in conjunction with dynamin 2 remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have identified a new class of lipid-binding modules, termed the SYLF domain, in SH3YL1. Our data support a model in which the SH3YL1âSHIP2 complex promotes dorsal ruffle formation by conversion of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>. Future studies should determine molecular mechanisms by which the downstream targets of these phosphoinositides coordinate the circular array of the actin filaments in the dorsal ruffle.</p>
