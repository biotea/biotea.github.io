        <p>TORC1 is a central regulator of cell growth in response to amino acid availability, yet little is known about how it is regulated. Here, we performed a reverse genetic screen in yeast for genes necessary to inactivate TORC1. The screen consisted of monitoring the expression of a TORC1 sensitive GFP-based transcriptional reporter in all yeast deletion strains using flow cytometry. We find that in response to amino acid starvation, but not to carbon starvation or rapamycin treatment, cells lacking <italic>NPR2</italic> and <italic>NPR3</italic> fail to fully (1) activate transcription factors Gln3/Gat1, (2) dephosphorylate TORC1 effector Npr1, and (3) repress ribosomal protein gene expression. Both mutants show proliferation defects only in media containing a low quality nitrogen source, such as proline or ammonia, whereas no defects are evident when cells are grown in the presence of glutamine or peptone mixture. Proliferation defects in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells can be completely rescued by artificially inhibiting TORC1 by rapamycin, demonstrating that overactive TORC1 in both strains prevents their ability to adapt to an environment containing a low quality nitrogen source. A biochemical purification of each demonstrates that Npr2 and Npr3 form a heterodimer, and this interaction is evolutionarily conserved since the human homologs of <italic>NPR2</italic> and <italic>NPR3</italic> (<italic>NPRL2</italic> and <italic>NPRL3</italic>, respectively) also co-immunoprecipitate. We conclude that, in yeast, the Npr2/3 complex mediates an amino acid starvation signal to TORC1.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Before a eukaryotic cell commits to cell division it must be large enough so that both daughter cells would be of viable size. The control of cell size is largely mediated by nutritional input signals via an evolutionarily conserved protein complex termed TORC1. In particular, TORC1 has been shown to sense the level of amino acids and its activity correlates with the level of amino acids present in the media. Yet, it is largely unknown how TORC1 senses amino acids. Here we demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved Npr2/3 complex mediates the amino acid scarcity signal to TORC1. Cells lacking NPR2 and NPR3 genes fail to inactivate TORC1 when amino acids are scarce. Overactive TORC1 prevents these cells from adapting to an amino acid scarce environment, and, as a result, these cells are unable to proliferate in media that is not rich in amino acids. Artificially inhibiting TORC1 with rapamycin can completely rescue these defects. These results provide insight into how cells sense amino acid deficiency. Moreover, as deletions of NPR2 have been implicated in tumor growth, these results offer a fertile ground to study the role overactive TORC1 might play in those cancers.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase has emerged as a central processing unit that can incorporate signals from diverse pathways regarding the availability of glucose, oxygen and amino acids <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Wullschleger1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The TOR kinase is a large scaffolding protein-kinase that is highly conserved in all eukaryotes. In recent years, TOR has been shown to nucleate two different multiprotein complexes. In the TOR Complex 1 (TORC1), TOR is associated with raptor and mLST8 (yeast Kog1 and Lst8, respectively), and its known mammalian phosphorylation targets are p70 S6K1 and 4E-BP1 <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In the phosphorylated state, both of these substrates are involved in promoting protein translation. In the TORC2, TOR partners with rictor (yeast Avo3), instead of raptor, and mLST8 <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Sarbassov1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Loewith1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Mammalian TORC2 phosphorylates AKT protein at Ser<sup>473</sup>, but not TORC1 substrates <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Sarbassov2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Interestingly, the natural compound rapamycin only inhibits TORC1 when complexed with intracellular protein FKBP12. The inhibition of TORC1 by the treatment of cells with rapamycin leads to a nutrient starvation-like phenotype, in cells ranging from yeast to human <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Befitting its ability to process numerous nutritional signals, TORC1 controls a diverse set of effector pathways. In a nutrient rich environment, TORC1 in yeast is responsible for promoting translation initiation, ribosome biogenesis, and anabolic pathways <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Barbet1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Cardenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Upon nutrient limitation or rapamycin treatment, these processes are inhibited, and the cell initiates macroautophagy, activates enzymes necessary for catabolic processes, and ultimately enters the G<sub>0</sub> phase of the cell cycle <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Wullschleger1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Noda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In yeast, an active TORC1 controls these processes by preventing several transcription factors from entering the nucleus and activating their target genes. In rich media, transcription factors Gln3/Gat1 are prevented from activating enzymes necessary for nitrogen catabolism, Msn2/4 from inducing stress response, and Rtg1/3 from activating retrograde signaling <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Komeili1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. TORC1 controls ribosomal protein (RP) gene expression by excluding corepressor Crf1 from entering the nucleus and inactivating RP gene transcription <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While there has been some progress in understanding how glucose, oxygen and energy status are signaled to TORC1 <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Wullschleger1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, the molecular mechanism by which an amino acid starvation leads to TORC1 inactivation is unclear and controversial <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Sarbassov3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. An amino acid starvation, just like rapamycin treatment, leads to a rapid dephosphorylation of the mTORC1 effectors S6K1 and 4E-BP1 <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This inactivation was proposed to be dependent on the presence of tuberous sclerosis proteins TSC1 and TSC2, which form a heterodimer and connect the insulin/IGF-IRS-PI3K-Akt pathway to the mTORC1 kinase <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, other labs have found TSC2 to be unnecessary for this inactivation <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Nobukuni1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Further, organisms that appear to have an amino acid sensitive TORC1, such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, do not have homologs of TSC1 and TSC2. hVPS34, encoding a class III PI3-kinase, has been shown to be required for amino acid induced phosphorylation of S6K1 <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Nobukuni1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and its kinase activity correlates with amino acid levels <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Byfield1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, at this point it is unclear how hVPS34 regulates TORC1 <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Nobukuni2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. If Vps34 was necessary to maintain active TORC1, then one would expect cells lacking the VPS34 gene to exhibit severe growth defect and mimic rapamycin treatment. Yet, yeast <italic>vps34</italic>Î cells grow normally in rich media <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, despite the fact that Vps34 is the only PI3K found in yeast. Also, a recent report was unable to detect defective TORC1 signaling in Vps34 mutant <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Juhasz1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>With the hypothesis that the genes necessary to inactivate TORC1 in response to amino acid starvation are distinct from the Vps34 pathway and that these genes are not essential for growth under a rich nutrient environment, we sought to screen the yeast deletion collection for genes necessary to inactivate TORC1 in response to amino acid starvation. We devised a GFP-based transcriptional reporter assay where TORC1 activity can be monitored by measuring intracellular GFP content by high throughput flow cytometry. The screen yielded two largely uncharacterized genes, <italic>NPR2</italic> and <italic>NPR3</italic>, and here we demonstrate that they form a heterodimer that is responsible for inactivating TORC1 specifically in response to amino acid starvation.</p>

In yeast, an active TORC1 complex binds and maintains an association between a cytosolic Ure2 and two transcription factors, Gln3 and Gat1 <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Bertram1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Upon a shift to a nitrogen free media, or rapamycin treatment, Ure2 releases both Gln3 and Gat1, which then move into the nucleus to activate the transcription of largely common target genes <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Stanbrough1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. One of the genes activated this way is <italic>DAL80</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

            <p>(A) A schematic of the TORC1 pathway. In nutrient rich environment, TORC1 is active and Gln3/Gat1 are in the cytoplasm. Upon TORC1 inactivation by rapamycin or amino acid starvation, Gln3 and Gat1 translocate into the nucleus, leading to the transcriptional activation of Dal80. (B) Dal80 gene expression reporter contains 600 basepairs of Dal80 promoter driving the expression of GFP. HygB, hygromycin B resistance gene, is used for selection of transformants. (C) Accumulation of GFP in cells is linear. Wildtype cells transformed with Dal80pr-GFP plasmid were treated either with rapamycin (20 ng/mL) or inoculated into nitrogen free medium. At indicated timepoints the average GFP content of the cells was determined by flow cytometry. (D) Fifty-five 96-well plates, containing all non-essential yeast deletion strains, were transformed with the Dal80pr-GFP reporter plasmid. The cells in each plate were grown under 3 conditions: YPD for 6 hours, YPD+rapamycin for 15 hours or N-free media for 4 hours. GFP content was determined by flow cytometry.</p>

        <p>To measure the Dal80 reporter in thousands of different deletion strains, we constructed a Dal80-based GFP reporter plasmid Dal80pr-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We could monitor the expression of this reporter by flow cytometry in a high-throughput fashion. In cells harboring this plasmid, GFP levels can be induced by either rapamycin treatment or amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As <italic>DAL80</italic> mRNA level stays constant following the start of induction (data not shown) and GFP has a long half-life, GFP accumulates linearly over time in the cell. As a result, this method enabled us to identify mutants that fail to express the reporter, as well as mutants that partially express or over-express the reporter.</p>
        <p>We assembled all non-essential yeast deletion strains into fifty-five 96-well plates, such that each well contained a known deletion strain. Each well was transformed with Dal80pr-GFP and the hygromycin B-resistant transformants were outgrown from the non-transformed cells in liquid media containing hygromycin B. Even though we set out to perform our screen for mutants that fail to induce the Dal80pr-GFP reporter in response to amino acid starvation, we also screened the genome for mutants that (1) activate Dal80pr-GFP in the rich media even in the absence of rapamycin, and (2) have altered induction of Dal80pr-GFP in response to rapamycin treatment. In summary, we screened the Dal80pr-GFP reporter expression in â¼5100 strains under three different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

        <title>RAPA screen: Screen for mutants with partially- or hyper-active Gln3 and Gat1 in the presence of rapamycin</title>
        <p>To successfully identify the mutants that under-express and over-express the Dal80pr-GFP reporter in a single screen, we selected to perform the flow cytometry analysis after a 15-hour induction in a rapamycin containing rich YPD media. We chose the 15-hour timepoint because by then the intracellular GFP levels were about 10 fold above background, enabling us to identify mutants that either under-express or over-express the Dal80pr-GFP reporter. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, deletion strains that over-express and under-express the reporter can be identified. We re-transformed 43 mutants that over-expressed our reporter two-fold or higher (mutants above the red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), and performed an induction time course for each mutant. Of these 43 mutants, 36 exhibited GFP levels higher than a WT strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000515.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Interestingly, in the re-analysis, the top three strains that over-express GFP are <italic>rtg1</italic>Î, <italic>rtg2</italic>Î and <italic>rtg3</italic>Î cells. The Rtg1â3 proteins are part of the retrograde gene expression mechanism that leads to a transcriptional activation of the first three TCA cycle enzymes in respiratory-deficient cells <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These findings demonstrate that the presence of Rtg1â3 proteins suppresses the activation of Gat1 and Gln3 transcription factors in response to rapamycin treatment and suggest that other mutants identified in this screen might be involved in retrograde gene expression (such as <italic>prm10</italic>Î cells with the 4<sup>th</sup> highest GFP expression).</p>
        <p>We also reanalyzed the top 40 strains that under-expressed Dal80pr-GFP (strains below the green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The top three deletion strains that fail to express the reporter were as expected: <italic>fpr1</italic>Î, <italic>gln3</italic>Î and <italic>gat1</italic>Î strains. Fpr1 encodes the yeast version of FKBP12 that binds rapamycin before inhibiting the TORC1 complex, and <italic>fpr1</italic>Î cells are completely rapamycin resistant. These three strains had no detectable induction of GFP, while the rest of the strains that lie below the green line had above-background levels of GFP. Upon inspection of the list of strains that only partially express Dal80pr-GFP, we noticed that many of these deletion strains are missing genes necessary for efficient transcription or translation. As our screen relies on efficient transcription and translation of GFP, we devised a filter to identify deletion strains specific to the TORC1 pathway. We constructed a reporter plasmid similar to our Dal80pr-GFP plasmid, but used the Gal1 promoter in lieu of the Dal80 promoter to drive the expression of GFP (Gal1pr-GFP). In cells harboring this plasmid, GFP can be induced by shifting the cells from glucose-containing media to galactose-containing media. By separately transforming the Dal80pr-GFP and Gal1pr-GFP reporter plasmids into strains that showed partial activation of the Dal80pr-GFP reporter, and inducing the GFP with a corresponding inducer, we were able to separate the TORC1-specific mutants from the mutants that are unable to express GFP efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). For instance, <italic>fpr1</italic>Î strain fails to induce Dal80pr-GFP in response to rapamycin treatment, yet it can efficiently upregulate GFP expression from the Gal1pr-GFP reporter under galactose induction. From the top forty strains with defective inductions of Dal80pr-GFP, twenty are TORC1-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000515.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The molecular basis for failure to activate Dal80pr-GFP can be attributed to most of these strains. The <italic>fpr1</italic>Î, <italic>gln3</italic>Î and <italic>gat1</italic>Î deletion strains fail to induce the reporter for reasons discussed above. Of the remaining 17 mutants, six (<italic>sod1</italic>Î, <italic>ymr073c</italic>Î, <italic>yml122c</italic>Î, <italic>rrd1</italic>Î, <italic>ppm1</italic>Î and <italic>spt8</italic>Î strains) are partially rapamycin-resistant. We have recently shown that rapamycin resistance in these strains is due to the inability of the Fpr1:rapamycin complex to bind to TORC1 <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Neklesa1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. As a result, these strains fail to fully respond to rapamycin treatment. Another seven (<italic>ede1</italic>Î, <italic>ppz1</italic>Î, <italic>apn1</italic>Î, <italic>yor322c</italic>Î, <italic>snf7</italic>Î, <italic>bck1</italic>Î and <italic>slt2</italic>Î strains) are rapamycin hyper-sensitive, and presumably rapamycin treatment leads to cell death in these cells. For instance, <italic>bck1</italic>Î and <italic>slt2</italic>Î cells fail to induce Gal1pr-GFP in response to galactose induction when rapamycin is present (data not shown).</p>
        <p>These findings illustrate that our screen was able to capture all major players in the pathway. Further, demonstration that we were able to identify strains that over-express and under-express our reporter suggests that we could identify even minor modifiers of TORC1 in response to amino acid starvation.</p>

        <title>Nitrogen-free screen: Identification of Npr2 and Npr3 as necessary to activate Gln3 and Gat1 by amino acid starvation</title>
        <p>To identify strains that fail to inactivate TORC1 in response to amino acid starvation, we exposed the cells harboring the Dal80pr-GFP reporter to media lacking all sources of nitrogen for four hours. Nitrogen-free media contains 2% glucose (as in rich YPD medium) and all salts, vitamins and trace elements that yeast cells need for cell proliferation. No nitrogen source was included as yeast can synthesize all 20 AAs <italic>de novo</italic>. This screen identified 17 strains that have a GFP content less than 40% of the WT. By imposing the Gal1pr-GFP filter again, we eliminated 13 strains due to their inability to activate Gal1pr-GFP in response to galactose induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). As expected, the <italic>gln3</italic>Î and <italic>gat1</italic>Î strains specifically failed to induce the Dal80pr-GFP reporter. Lastly, <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>yhl023C</italic>Î strains fail to induce the Dal80pr-GFP reporter, suggesting that proteins encoded by <italic>NPR2</italic> and <italic>YHL023C</italic> are involved in signaling the absence of amino acids to TORC1. For reasons that will become clear in next sections, we renamed <italic>YHL023C</italic> locus <italic>NPR3</italic>. <italic>NPR</italic> stands for <italic>N</italic>itrogen <italic>P</italic>ermease <italic>R</italic>egulator, as Npr1 and Npr2 have been shown to regulate amino acid transport activity <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Rousselet1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

        <title>Npr2 and Npr3 are amino acid specific regulators of TORC1</title>
        <p>To verify that Npr2 and Npr3 are involved in activation of Gln3 and Gat1, we monitored the translocation of Gat1 into the nucleus when <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells are shifted from the rich YPD medium to the nitrogen-free medium. Consistent with data from the screen, genomically GFP-tagged Gat1 fails to translocate into the nucleus upon nitrogen starvation in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

        <p>If Npr2 and Npr3 are indeed upstream regulators of TORC1, then TORC1 in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells should be sensitive to rapamycin and insensitive to nitrogen starvation. Consistent with the results from the screen, Dal80pr-GFP cannot be activated in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells in response to a nitrogen starvation, yet the reporter can be readily activated by rapamycin in both mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These data posit Npr2 and Npr3 upstream of TORC1.</p>
        <p>To confirm that Npr2 and Npr3 mediate the amino acid starvation signal to TORC1, we examined the effect of nitrogen starvation in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells on different TORC1 readouts. TORC1 has been shown to control the phosphorylation status of Npr1, a protein kinase that controls the post-Golgi sorting of amino acid permeases <xref rid="pgen.1000515-DeCraene1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In rich media Npr1 is hyperphosphorylated, whereas nitrogen starvation or rapamycin treatment leads to a faster migrating dephosphorylated form <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Gander1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Consistent with our hypothesis, cells missing <italic>NPR2</italic> or <italic>NPR3</italic> are unable to dephosphorylate Npr1 upon nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Yet, inclusion of rapamycin in rich YPD media leads to a dephosphorylation of Npr1 in both mutants. To more clearly define the signal that both mutants fail to heed, we determined the Npr1 phosphorylation state in cells grown with either 10 mM proline or 10 mM glutamine as the sole nitrogen source. The wildtype cells grown in proline media exhibited dephosphorylated Npr1, whereas wildtype cells grown in glutamine media showed a hyperphosphorylated Npr1 that is indistinguishable from <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells. To our surprise, wildtype cells grown in the presence of high concentrations of ammonia never exhibited the same level of hyperphosphorylated Npr1 as <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells. Even at 50 mM ammonium sulfate, wildtype cells exhibited a faster migrating band of Npr1 than either mutant. This suggests that ammonia itself is not sensed by Npr2 and Npr3, but rather the signal about the levels of amino acids, such as glutamine, is mediated to TORC1. That is, <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells, irrespective of the nitrogen source, exhibit an Npr1 phosphorylation state similar to the phosphorylation state of wildtype cells grown in glutamine containing media. Therefore, the absence of <italic>NPR2</italic> or <italic>NPR3</italic> appears to mimic the presence of glutamine, even if a low quality nitrogen source is provided instead.</p>
        <p>To further confirm the nature of the signal that <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î mediate to TORC1, we examined the effect of total carbon starvation in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells on Npr1 phosphorylation. The carbon starvation leads to a rapid dephosphorylation of Npr1 in both mutants, suggesting that amino acid starvation and carbon starvation are distinct signaling inputs to TORC1. These data confirm that Npr2 and Npr3 mediate the signal about amino acid starvation to TORC1.</p>
        <p>As TORC1 exerts an exquisite control over the transcription of ribosomal protein (RP) genes, we were interested whether amino acid starvation is able to downregulate RP gene expression in the two mutants. Ribosome biosynthesis is very energy expensive, and RP genes are responsible for â¼50% of the total Pol II transcription initiation events <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Warner1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Hence, an overproduction of RP mRNA can be very costly for starving cells as it depletes valuable energy resources. To study the effect of nitrogen starvation on gene transcription, we performed a whole genome microarray experiment where we shifted WT, <italic>npr2</italic>Î or <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells from YPD media to N-free media for 30 minutes. For each gene, an induction ratio was calculated by dividing the expression of that gene after the shift in media by its expression in YPD media. Genes that are downregulated upon the shift in media have an induction ratio below 1, and vice versa. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, mRNA species encoding large and small ribosomal protein subunits (RPL and RPS, respectively, highlighted in red) are downregulated less in <italic>npr2</italic>Î cells than in WT cells. (Data from <italic>npr3</italic>Î data is identical to <italic>npr2</italic>Î data and is therefore not shown). In fact, this effect appears to scale linearly, such that on average, the RP mRNA levels are â¼2.5 times higher in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells than in WT cells in N-free media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). No difference in expression was observed in rich YPD media. Independent semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis on representative RPL and RPS genes confirmed the microarray results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Based on the Npr1 phosphorylation data, we speculated that RP genes would exhibit a higher expression in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells when grown in proline or ammonium sulfate as a nitrogen source, whereas no difference would be observed when cells are grown in the presence of glutamine. Indeed, both mutants exhibited a 2â3 fold higher expression of RP genes when grown in the presence of proline as a nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Congruent with the Npr1 phosphorylation data, no difference was observed between the two mutants and WT cells when they were grown in media containing glutamine or 2% peptone. <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells grown in 0 mM, 1 mM or 50 mM ammonium sulfate consistently exhibited a 2â3 fold higher level of RP gene expression than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Again, it appears that <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells grown in a proline or ammonia containing media are incapable of inactivating TORC1. As cells grown on ammonia are known to activate retrograde signaling pathway by activating TORC1 responsive transcription factors Rtg1/3, we sought to determine whether <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells are capable of inducing the expression of the Rtg1/3 target gene <italic>CIT2</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Tate1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. As expected, the activation of <italic>CIT2</italic> mRNA was greatly diminished in the two mutant strains.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, we examined four independent TORC1 effector pathways to confirm the effect of Npr2 and Npr3 on TORC1. Gat1 nuclear translocation, Npr1 phosphorylation, RP gene expression profiling and Rtg1/3 reporter expression analysis confirm that Npr2 and Npr3 are necessary to inactivate TORC1 by amino acid starvation. In particular, <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells fail to inactivate TORC1 when a non-preferred amino acid source is presented. As TORC1 is a key player in a cell's response to nutrient availability, we hypothesized that cells lacking <italic>NPR2</italic> and <italic>NPR3</italic> would fail to adapt to an environment containing non-glutamine based nitrogen source.</p>

        <title>Due to overactive TORC1, cells missing <italic>NPR2</italic> and <italic>NPR3</italic> fail to adapt to an amino acid scarce environment</title>
        <p>To address the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of Npr2 and Npr3, we first sought to determine the ability of cells lacking <italic>NPR2</italic> or <italic>NPR3</italic> to proliferate in an environment containing low amounts of preferred nitrogen. In our previous experiments, we noticed that <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells do not appear to have any growth defects in rich YPD media. Quantitatively measuring the doubling time during an exponential phase of proliferation confirmed this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we grew prototrophic <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells in N-free media supplemented with 2% peptone, 10 mM proline, 10 mM glutamine or increasing concentrations of ammonia. Consistent with our molecular TORC1 activity data, <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells grown in the presence of peptone and glutamine do not exhibit a proliferation defect. However, when the same cells are provided with proline or ammonia as a nitrogen source, both mutants proliferate slowly. These data suggest that the inability to inactivate TORC1 in both mutants leads to a failure to adapt to an environment with a scarce source of preferred amino acids. In all cases, the double mutant behaves exactly as the single mutants, further confirming that Npr2 and Npr3 lie in the same pathway upstream of TORC1. Consistent with the finding that Npr2 and Npr3 are responsible for inactivating TORC1 only in response to amino acid starvation, all three mutants behave exactly as WT cells when limited for glucose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000515.s003">Figure S3</xref>) or grown on a non-fermentable carbon source (data not shown).</p>

        <p>We next sought to establish a role for Npr2 and Npr3 in the activation of amino acid transporters. TORC1 inactivation leads to a robust transcriptional activation of various amino acid permeases <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Cardenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In our unpublished studies, we have found that threonine uptake is particularly sensitive to the presence of a preferred nitrogen source and we sought to examine the ability of <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells to import radiolabeled Thr. We grew cells in either proline or glutamine and measured their Thr uptake. The cells grown in glutamine exhibit a barely detectable uptake of Thr, with no difference between WT and the two mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The cells grown in proline exhibit a robust increase in Thr uptake activity, but this activity is about 50% of WT levels in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells. Therefore, <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells fail to fully activate threonine amino acid transporters under amino acid limitation.</p>
        <p>A long-term characteristic of nitrogen-starved yeast is their ability to undergo sporulation, and this phenotype has been linked to TORC1 <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Jambhekar1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In fact, a large-scale study has implicated Npr3 in sporulation <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Enyenihi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our study confirmed this report and here we show that <italic>npr2</italic>Î cells also undergo sporulation much less efficiently than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Lastly, as the phenotypes associated with a lack of Npr2 and Npr3 are due to the failure to inactivate TORC1, we wondered whether artificially inhibiting TORC1 in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells might rescue the proliferation defects observed in these cells under nitrogen limitation. When <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells are shifted from rich YPD media to nitrogen limitation media containing 0.5 mM ammonium sulfate, three unique phenotypes can be observed. First, in both mutants about 40% of cells undergo lysis within the first 10 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Second, <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells resume logarithmic proliferation after about 12 hours, whereas WT cells do this in about 2 hours. Third, the maximum cell density of <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cultures is about 50% of WT levels. Remarkably, all three phenotypes can be completely rescued by including rapamycin in the nitrogen limitation media. In other words, the phenotypes associated with a lack of <italic>NPR2</italic> and <italic>NPR3</italic> genes can be completely abolished by artificially inhibiting TORC1.</p>
        <p>These data clearly demonstrate that Npr2 and Npr3 are responsible for mediating the signal about amino acid starvation to TORC1 and that TORC1 remains active in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells when preferred amino acid source (e.g. glutamine) is absent. As a result, these cells fail to adapt and thrive in an environment where nitrogen source is scarce or non-preferred. Our data also suggest that both proteins are specific for amino acid starvation, with no relevance in mediating the signal about carbon limitation. Lastly, the genetic data demonstrate that both proteins act in the same pathway upstream of TORC1.</p>

        <title>Npr2 and Npr3 form an evolutionarily conserved complex</title>
        <p>To better understand the role of Npr2 and Npr3 in cells, we purified both proteins by tandem affinity purification (TAP) expressed under the endogenous promoters <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Rigaut1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Both proteins are relatively scarce in cells, especially Npr2. When we ran the two purifications in adjacent lanes we noticed a single unique band where Npr2 runs in the Npr3-TAP lane, and a single unique band where Npr3 runs in the Npr2-TAP lane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000515.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This suggested to us that Npr2 and Npr3 might be forming a heterodimer and we sought to verify this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. By employing a strain with a genomically incorporated HA-tag at the C-terminus of Npr3 and a myc-tag at the C-terminus of Npr2, we find that when Npr3 is immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies these immunoprecipitates contain Npr2-myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This interaction is not medium-dependent, as it occurs in the medium made of either YPD or N-free media. There is a decrease in the amount of Npr2 pulled down, but this appears to be due to degradation of Npr3. The finding that Npr2 and Npr3 form a complex is consistent with the observation that <italic>npr2</italic>Î, <italic>npr3</italic>Î and <italic>npr2</italic>Î <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells have identical phenotypes with respect to amino acid starvation.</p>

If the human homologs are orthologous to yeast Npr2 and Npr3, then NPRL2 and NPRL3 should also form a complex in human cells. To verify this, we co-transfected HA-NPRL2 with three N-terminally myc-tagged proteins: XMis12 (an unrelated <italic>Xenopus</italic> protein), Î³-tubulin (an unrelated human protein) and NPRL3. Upon immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibodies, only NPRL3 immunoprecipitates contained HA-NPRL2, demonstrating that NPRL2 and NPRL3 also form a complex. The conserved nature of this complex suggests that NPRL2/3 might also signal to TORC1, although further studies are needed to verify this hypothesis.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we aimed to systematically screen the yeast genome for genes necessary in sensing amino acid starvation. To achieve this goal, we first established a robust flow cytometry-based assay to monitor the expression of a TOR-sensitive transcriptional reporter. We believe a GFP-based readout has three advantages over a luciferase-based readout: (1) by employing GFP, there is no need to lyse cells; (2) a fluorescence reading can be obtained for each individual cell, thereby abolishing the need to normalize the signal for the number of cells; and (3) this assay offers a possibility of more complicated analyses with sub-populations of cells, such as by co-induction of two different fluorescent proteins. Compared to assays where the plate could be scanned, however, performing flow cytometry in a high throughput manner is still time-consuming. It takes about 45 minutes to process each 96 well plate, with the majority of time spent flushing the fluidics system between samples.</p>
      <p>Using this assay, we found an evolutionarily conserved Npr2/3 complex that is responsible for the inactivation of TORC1 in response to amino acid limitation. In response to amino acid withdrawal, cells missing <italic>NPR2</italic> and <italic>NPR3</italic> fail to completely inactivate such TORC1 readouts as Npr1 phosphorylation, Gat1 inhibition and ribosome biosynthesis. Correspondingly, these cells are unable to adjust to a growth environment where the nitrogen source is limiting or of poor quality. Our data appear to indicate that the Npr2/3 complex specifically mediates a signal about the low quality/quantity of amino acids since phenotypes associated with <italic>NPR2/3</italic> deletion are evident only when cells are grown on nitrogen sources that are sub-optimal for TORC1 activity. For instance, when cells are grown with peptone or glutamine as nitrogen sources, TORC1 is fully active and under those conditions <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells do not exhibit proliferation defects. Under conditions where a lower activity of TORC1 is required, such as in the presence of proline or ammonia, Npr2/3 are responsible for lowering this activity. In the simplest model, the Npr2/3 complex senses the levels of glutamine and inactivates TORC1 when those levels are low. Further studies must determine whether the Npr2/3 complex is itself responsible for sensing intracellular amino acid pools or whether this complex simply mediates the signal. Interestingly, our results indicate that neither protein plays a role in carbon starvation, since in both mutants TORC1 is inhibited when glucose is removed from the media and both mutants proliferate normally under glucose-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000515-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
      <p>Despite the high degree of conservation, our best efforts to assign an activity or function to either Npr2 or Npr3 were unsuccessful, as neither protein exhibits characteristic domain structures that could predict their cellular function. Our efforts to co-immunoprecipitate TORC1 and Npr2/3 were inconclusive (data not shown). Also, the Tor1/Kog1 complex was unaltered in <italic>npr2</italic>Î and <italic>npr3</italic>Î cells (data not shown). Further complicating analysis of both proteins is their relatively low abundance in the cell. In fact, in our hands human NPRL2 is detectable in only a few cell lines (data not shown). This has hindered our attempts to purify additional members of the complex, as well as visualize their sub-cellular location. Clearly, further biochemical and genetic approaches are needed to shed light on the mechanistic aspects of their function.</p>
      <p>Recently, two groups characterized a role Rag GTPases play in activating TORC1 by amino acids in human tissue culture cells and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Sancak1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. These studies demonstrated that Rag GTPases are part of the extended TORC1 complex and that cells expressing constitutively active RagA/B fail to inactivate TORC1 when amino acids are withdrawn. Interestingly, Rag A and RagB are similar to each other and they appear to be orthologus to yeast Gtr1. If yeast Gtr1 was responsible for activating TORC1, then deletion of <italic>GTR1</italic> should lead to lethality or at least mimic a rapamycin-like slow proliferation phenotype. Yet, <italic>gtr1</italic>Î cells appear normal and don't express the TORC1-sensitive Dal80pr-GFP reporter in rich media (data not shown). This discrepancy could be explained by either a substitution of Gtr1 by another GTPase in yeast, or by a divergence of the amino acid signaling pathway to TORC1 between metazoans and yeast. By a similar token, yeast Vps34 did not emerge from our screen as a regulator of TORC1 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>). Further studies must examine the role of Rag GTPases in lower eukaryotes and whether the Npr2/3 complex is functionally conserved in higher eukaryotes. Keeping with the conserved nature of TORC1 and its regulation by amino acids, it would be exciting if a unifying mechanism emerges.</p>
      <p>Except for mTOR itself, many of the upstream and downstream components of the mTOR pathway are known to be either proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressors <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Wullschleger1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Interestingly, early reports have implicated <italic>NPRL2</italic> as a tumor suppressor gene. <italic>NPRL2</italic> is located on the human chromosome 3p21.3 homozygous deletion region <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Lerman1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, a region that is deleted in various human cancers <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Zabarovsky1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Further, reintroduction of <italic>NPRL2</italic> into these cells inhibits cell proliferation both in cell lines and in human lung cancer mouse models <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Ueda1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Human NPRL2-null cells and yeast <italic>npr2</italic>Î cells both have been shown to exhibit resistance to cisplatin <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Ueda1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, suggesting functional conservation and raising the possibility that NPRL2 might act as a repressor of mTORC1. It remains to be determined whether a mutation in <italic>NPRL2</italic> is truly the driver mutation that gives rise to neoplastic growth via overactive mTORC1, but a high mTORC1 activity has certainly been ascribed to invasive tumors <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Further, as cancer cells with hyperactive mTORC1, either due to loss of <italic>PTEN</italic> or <italic>TSC1/2</italic>, have been shown to be particularly sensitive to rapamycin treatment <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Kenerson1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000515-Neshat1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, we speculate that cancer cells with mutated <italic>NPRL2</italic> might also be particularly sensitive to rapamycin. Also, since both Npr2 and Npr3 are necessary for inactivation of TORC1 in yeast, it would be interesting to examine whether a deletion of human <italic>NPRL3</italic> also correlates with tumorigenesis.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, here we report the discovery of a novel, conserved Npr2/3 complex that specifically inactivates TORC1 in response to amino acid limitation in yeast. Inactivation of TORC1 is important for adaptation to an environment with scarce amino acids, since diminished TORC1 activity leads to activation of amino acid permeases and catabolic enzymes, repression of ribosomal protein gene expression, and induction of macroautophagy. Cells lacking <italic>NPR2</italic> or <italic>NPR3</italic> are unable to inactivate TORC1, and they fail to thrive in nitrogen challenged environment as a result. These results demonstrate a unique way by which the cells respond to nutrient limitation, and this complex provides a fertile ground to study the regulation of this important pathway.</p>

Npr1, Npr2 and Npr3 were epitope tagged at the C-terminus with PCR products amplified from pFA6a-3HA-kanMX6, pFA6a-13myc-His3MX6 and pFA6a-3HA-kanMX6, respectively <xref rid="pgen.1000515-Longtine1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. YPD media consists of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 2% glucose. N-free media consists of 0.17% Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Sigma) and 2% dextrose. Carbon-free media consists of 1% yeast extract and 2% peptone. All yeast experiments were carried out at 30Â°C. The GFP expression-reporter vectors, with added hygromycin B-phosphotransferase and GFP genes, are based on pRS426, a multicopy 2Âµ-based plasmid. Six hundred basepairs of Dal80 or Gal1 promoter was fused in-frame with GFP to obtain the final Dal80pr-GFP or Gal1pr-GFP, respectively. NPRL2 and Î³-tubulin were amplified from ProQuest cDNA library (Invitrogen). Full length NPRL2 (380 AA) was cloned into pCS-HA vector. NPRL3 was amplified from Mammalian Gene Collection clone MGC2816. This isoform is missing the first 179 amino acids from the amino terminus and is therefore 390 amino acids long. Both Î³-tubulin and NPRL3 were cloned into pCS-myc vector. Xmis12-myc was a kind gift from Aaron Straight (Stanford).</p>
