      <abstract>
        <p>The X-linked lethal Ogden syndrome was the first reported human genetic disorder associated with a mutation in an N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) gene. The affected males harbor an Ser37Pro (S37P) mutation in the gene encoding Naa10, the catalytic subunit of NatA, the major human NAT involved in the co-translational acetylation of proteins. Structural models and molecular dynamics simulations of the human NatA and its S37P mutant highlight differences in regions involved in catalysis and at the interface between Naa10 and the auxiliary subunit hNaa15. Biochemical data further demonstrate a reduced catalytic capacity and an impaired interaction between hNaa10 S37P and Naa15 as well as Naa50 (NatE), another interactor of the NatA complex. N-Terminal acetylome analyses revealed a decreased acetylation of a subset of NatA and NatE substrates in Ogden syndrome cells, supporting the genetic findings and our hypothesis regarding reduced Nt-acetylation of a subset of NatA/NatE-type substrates as one etiology for Ogden syndrome. Furthermore, Ogden syndrome fibroblasts display abnormal cell migration and proliferation capacity, possibly linked to a perturbed retinoblastoma pathway. N-Terminal acetylation clearly plays a role in Ogden syndrome, thus revealing the <italic>in vivo</italic> importance of N-terminal acetylation in human physiology and disease.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications occurring both on lysine side chains in proteins and at protein N termini (<xref rid="DDU611C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Nt-acetylation is mainly co-translational and presumed to be an irreversible covalent modification catalyzed by the ribosome associated N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), members of the Gcn5-related <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase superfamily of acetyltransferases (<xref rid="DDU611C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). NATs transfer an acetyl moiety from acetyl coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) to the primary Î±-amino group of nascent polypeptides as they emerge from ribosomes, and proteomic analyses have revealed that 50â90% of yeast, plant, fruit fly and human proteins are Nt-acetylated (<xref rid="DDU611C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="DDU611C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Originally, Nt-acetylation was assumed to protect proteins from degradation (<xref rid="DDU611C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, current findings link Nt-acetylation to degradation of some proteins, via Ac/N-degron-mediated recruitment of specific ubiquitin ligases (<xref rid="DDU611C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Nt-acetylation may also influence protein complex formation, as exemplified by the NEDD8 ligation enzymes (<xref rid="DDU611C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), next to prion formation (<xref rid="DDU611C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Also, protein-specific targeting to membranes of the nucleus (<xref rid="DDU611C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), Golgi (<xref rid="DDU611C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and lysosomes (<xref rid="DDU611C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) was shown to require Nt-acetylation, but a general role in targeting is not supported (<xref rid="DDU611C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Some proteins destined for translocation through the endoplasmic reticulum are Nt-free, suggesting that Nt-acetylation of this pool of proteins inhibits translocation (<xref rid="DDU611C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>To date, six NATs (NatAâNatF) have been identified in higher eukaryotes and their substrate specificities have been characterized (<xref rid="DDU611C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Each NAT acetylates defined subsets of substrates mainly based on the identity of the first two amino acid residues of the nascent polypeptide (<xref rid="DDU611C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), although there is some potential redundancy in the system with some NATs acetylating the same type of substrates. NatA, the major eukaryotic NAT in terms of targeted substrates, displays a broad substrate specificity profile by Nt-acetylating Ser-, Thr-, Ala-, Val-, Gly- and Cys- starting N termini of which the initiator methionine (iMet) was removed by the action of methionine aminopeptidase (<xref rid="DDU611C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The NatA complex is composed of the catalytic subunit, Naa10 (ARD1) and the auxiliary subunit Naa15 (NAT1/NATH) (<xref rid="DDU611C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="DDU611C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), which anchors Naa10 to the ribosome and modulates its catalytic activity (<xref rid="DDU611C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Furthermore, the catalytic subunit Naa50 (NAT5) defined as NatE (<xref rid="DDU611C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and in multicellular eukaryotes, the Huntingtin-interacting protein K (<xref rid="DDU611C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) are physically associated with the NatA complex, but whether Naa50 exerts activity <italic>in vivo</italic> in a monomeric form or whether the active form of Naa50 is entirely dependent on its association with NatA (<xref rid="DDU611C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â<xref rid="DDU611C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) is still not known. Recently, the structures of the first eukaryotic NATs, human Naa50 and the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Naa10âNaa15 (NatA) complex, were elucidated by X-ray crystallography (<xref rid="DDU611C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).

Although early studies suggest that the choice for which X-chromosome is inactivated is random (<xref rid="DDU611C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), later studies on female carriers of specific X-linked mutations showed skewed patterns of XCI resulting from negative selection of cells harboring the lethal allele in the active state (<xref rid="DDU611C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).

This was investigated by co-expression of hNaa15-myc and hNaa10-V5 or hNaa10-S37P-V5 followed by co-immunoprecipitation from HEK293 cells. It was evident that NatA complex formation was impaired when expressing hNaa10-S37P-V5 when compared with hNaa10-V5 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU611F5">5</xref>A). This finding was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation studies detecting endogenous proteins (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU611F5">5</xref>B, left panel). We also showed that complex formation of hNaa10 with hNaa50 was reduced in the context of NatA-S37P mutant (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU611F5">5</xref>B, right panel). In order to study complex formation of endogenous NatA and NatA-S37P complexes, lysates of WT- and S37P-hTERT cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-hNaa10 or anti-hNaa15. The NatA complex was detectable in both cell types, but the ability of hNaa10-S37P to interact with hNaa15 was significantly reduced (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU611F5">5</xref>C). As the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetic studies suggested that hNaa10-S37P is catalytically impaired, we also assessed the <italic>in vitro</italic> NAT activity of the endogenous hNaa10 in complex with hNaa15. NatA complexes were immunoprecipitated from WT- and S37P-hTERT cell lysates, and the absolute catalytic activity of NatA-S37P was measured. As expected, NatA-S37P activity towards the SESS-starting substrate oligopeptide was significantly reduced when compared with NatA-WT when correlating the amount of hNaa15 present in each sample (NAT activity per hNaa15 molecule; Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU611F5">5</xref>D, left). When correlating the amount of hNaa10 (NAT activity per hNaa10 molecule; Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU611F5">5</xref>D, right) an â¼10-fold reduction was measured. Combined, these results suggest that hNaa10-S37P is partially defective in both its ability to bind hNaa15 and in its catalytic activity.

It is well known that mutating the second residue in a protein to proline inhibits Nt-acetylation by the NATs (<xref rid="DDU611C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Therefore, these candidates and their Pro mutant versions were expressed and investigated by western blotting to probe their steady-state protein levels. None of the mutant (non-acetylated) proteins displayed a significant difference when compared with their wild-type variants except for THOC7 that showed significantly lower levels when expressed as an Nt-free, proline mutant. To verify these findings, the cDNAs of THOC7 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU611F8">8</xref>A) and SAE1 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU611F8">8</xref>B) were modified as follows; the codons for the second residue, respectively, encoding Gly (for THOC7) or Val (for SAE1) were replaced by an Ser, Pro, Val or Asp to promote full NatA- (<xref rid="DDU611C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) (Ser-) or full NatB- (Asp-) dependent Nt-acetylation of the amino-terminus, to prevent Nt-acetylation (<xref rid="DDU611C61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) (Pro-) or to promote partial Nt-acetylation of the amino-terminus (<xref rid="DDU611C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) (Val-). Furthermore, their degree of Nt-acetylation was determined using in-gel stable-isotope labeling (ISIL) followed by in gel-digestion and mass spectrometric analysis (<xref rid="DDU611C62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). In line with what was expected, the N termini of THOC7-WT (96%), THOC7-G2V (21%) and SAE1-WT (19%) were found to be partially Nt-acetylated, while THOC7-G2S, THOC7-G2D and SAE1-V2S were fully Nt-acetylated and the G2P variants were Nt-free (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU611F8">8</xref>). Of note here is that only SAE1 variants with their iMet removed were detected in the setups analyzed. Overall, no notable differences in the steady-state, synthesis and degradation levels could be observed for the N-terminal SAE1 variants, while the THOC7-G2P and G2V variants displayed a decreased protein stability which was rescued upon proteasomal inhibition (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU611F8">8</xref>A).

The syndrome is associated thus far in two families with a single point mutation in h<italic>NAA10</italic> creating an S37P substitution in the resulting protein. X-chromosome skewing analyses in the carrier women demonstrates skewing, consistent with either a production or an elimination defect for lymphocytes expressing the X-chromosome with the mutation in h<italic>NAA10</italic>. Consistent with this result, cell proliferation assays showed that both primary and TERT-immortalized hemizygous S37P-hTERT cells derived from one of the male infants have a reduced growth rate compared with standard control cells. One caveat is that these cell lines were non-isogenic, and as such genetic background differences could contribute to the different growth rates observed between these two fibroblast cell lines. However, the altered growth rate is in agreement with several studies in cancer cells demonstrating that loss of NatA or hNaa10 affects cell proliferation via several different pathways (<xref rid="DDU611C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). One of these pathways, the Rb1-pathway, was also found to be affected in the S37P-hTERT cells and could be a contributing factor to the abnormal growth observed. On the other hand, the effect of hNaa10 on cyclin D1 expression (<xref rid="DDU611C55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) as well as the interaction with TSC2 (<xref rid="DDU611C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), both observed in cancer cells, was not affected in the Ogden syndrome fibroblasts. In contrast to the cell proliferation studies, viability assays demonstrated that S37P-hTERT cells have increased cellular metabolism when kept at high cell densities. When cultivated in dense cultures, S37P-hTERT cells appeared to grow on top of each other and in a less-polarized and more disorganized cell-sheets when compared with wild-type cells, a growth pattern reminiscent to the growth pattern of cancer cells for which cellâcell contact inhibition is lost (<xref rid="DDU611C63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). In agreement with this observation, we observed that a substantial fraction of the S37P-hTERT cells did not enter the G0 phase when kept at a high density while control cells were predominantly in the G0 phase. The very first study on Naa10 in yeast reported that Naa10 deficient cells are unable to enter the G0 phase, do not respond to the mating pheromone Î±-factor and are unable to sporulate which was attributed to a potential role of Naa10 in switching between the mitotic cell cycle and different cell fates (<xref rid="DDU611C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Also, the fact that S37P-hTERT cells are more sensitive toward stress agrees with these findings. Cell cycle arrest is crucial for cell differentiation and determining cell fate. Failure of cells to enter the stationary phase might lead to developmental defects as tissue organization is known to require strict control of cell divisions. This partial inability of S37P-hTERT cells to enter G0 phase might contribute to the developmental defects observed for Ogden syndrome males.</p><p>We also observed that S37P-hTERT cells migrate at significantly reduced speed compared with wild-type cells, especially under nutrient-starved conditions. hNaa10 has previously been shown to negatively regulate cellular motility in cancer cells by binding and inhibiting the translocation of PIX to the cell migration machinery at the plasma membrane in an acetyltransferase-independent manner (<xref rid="DDU611C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). However, we were not able to confirm the PIXâhNaa10 interaction in either Naa10-WT or Naa10-S37P fibroblasts. hNaa10 has also been shown to regulate cell motility by inhibiting MYLK either directly through interaction or indirectly through acetylation of lysine residues on MYLK (<xref rid="DDU611C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). We were unable to show a direct interaction between MYLK and hNaa10 in these fibroblasts. Cellular motility is critical for normal development (<xref rid="DDU611C65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) and a functional Naa10 is important as demonstrated by the partially rescued migration phenotype when overexpressing Naa10-WT in S37P-hTERT fibroblasts. We thus suspect that a reduced cell migration capacity in combination with reduced cell proliferation and loss of correct cell cycle progression may contribute to the Ogden syndrome at the cellular level.</p><p>Our structural modelling data based on the NatA crystal structure of <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref rid="DDU611C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) revealed that the hNaa10-S37P mutation results in shortening of helix Î±2 thereby introducing changes in the flexibility of hNaa10 that may decrease its catalytic properties both in its NatA- or non-complexed form. Further, the changes in flexibility as well as rearrangement of hydrogen bonds in the interface between hNaa10 and the auxiliary subunit of the NatA complex, hNaa15, suggested a reduced NatA-complex stability. These hypotheses were confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assays demonstrating a reduced enzymatic activity for both hNatA-S37P and hNaa10-S37P, likely caused by a reduced substrate peptide binding or release. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that NatA-complex formation was clearly impaired in S37P-hTERT cells. Our recently developed Ogden syndrome heterologous yeast model also presented data in line with these findings in terms of a reduced catalytic activity and a reduced ability to form an NatA complex when co-expressed with hNaa15 in yeast for hNaa10-S37P (<xref rid="DDU611C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>Steady-state protein levels of hNaa10, hNaa15 and hNaa50 in B cells from various family members including Ogden syndrome males, carrier females and unaffected individuals revealed no major differences in protein levels. This indicates that reduced complex formation does not influence the steady-state protein levels of hNaa10 or hNaa15. In contrast, hNaa10 level seems to depend on complex formation with hNaa15 in cancer cells lines (<xref rid="DDU611C66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrated that the hNaa10-S37P mutation did not influence the subcellular localization of hNaa10 or hNaa15. Both hNaa10-WT and hNaa10-S37P were cytosolic, in contrast to what has been described in cancer and other cell lines previously, where hNaa10 is both localized to and performs functions in cytosol and nucleus (<xref rid="DDU611C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The bulk of the evidence shows that hNaa10 mainly performs cytosolic functions in normal cells, suggesting that Ogden syndrome is caused by an impaired cytosolic function of hNaa10-S37P, most likely involving co-translational Nt-acetylation. Indeed, N-terminal COFRADIC analysis of WT and hNaa10-S37P fibroblasts and B-cells revealed a significantly reduced degree of Nt-acetylation of certain NatA/NatE-type substrate N termini in Naa10-S37P cells. Again, this is in agreement with the abovementioned Ogden syndrome yeast model; yeast cells expressing mutant hNatA displayed a reduced degree of Nt-acetylation among a large group of NatA substrates when compared with yeast expressing wild-type hNatA (<xref rid="DDU611C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>The substantial loss of NatA-complex formation in cells expressing hNaa10-S37P in addition to the reduced catalytic activity toward classical NatA substrates appears sufficient to impact the Nt-acetylome. The impairment of <italic>in vivo</italic> NAT activity in hNaa10-S37P cells toward classical NatA substrates is clearly reflected in the COFRADIC datasets of B cells and fibroblasts from the Ogden-affected males. Here, mostly, NatA-type substrate N-termini displayed a reduced degree of Nt-acetylation, which is strongly reminiscent to the observations made in a previous NatA knockdown study (<xref rid="DDU611C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Several of the specific NatA substrates previously identified by means of siNatA knockdown were also identified here. The <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assays suggest that hNaa10-S37P has a decreased catalytic activity both for classical NatA substrates (Ser-, Ala-, etc.) and acidic N termini (Glu-, Asp-), the latter posttranslationally acetylated by monomeric hNaa10. However, mainly, classical NatA substrates were found to be affected in their degree of Nt-acetylation in our proteomic analyses <italic>in vivo</italic>. Earlier studies have suggested that primarily suboptimal substrates are affected by NatA or NatB knockdown, leaving the most preferred substrates unaffected in their Nt-acetylation states (<xref rid="DDU611C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Furthermore, as described previously, hNaa10 was also found in non-polysomal fractions in a monomeric form, indicating that it might function outside the NatA complex (<xref rid="DDU611C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This, together with our finding that the S37P mutation affects NatA-complex formation, indicating increased monomeric hNaa10-S37P availability, could counteract hNaa10's putatively reduced activity toward acidic N termini. We therefore hypothesize that Ogden syndrome is mainly caused by loss of NatA activity, and not by loss of NatA-independent hNaa10 activities such as the posttranslational Nt-acetylation of actin (<xref rid="DDU611C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A small subset of the affected N termini in the COFRADIC datasets represents non-NatA-type substrates and rather hints to NatE substrates. This is consistent with the immunoprecipitation results showing that there is less mutant hNaa10 interacting with hNaa15 and hNaa50 (NatE), although it is not clear if there is direct or indirect binding of hNaa50 to hNaa15 and/or hNaa10.</p><p>Several of the S37P-affected substrate N termini here identified by means of positional proteomics were chosen for further <italic>in depth</italic> analyses as they displayed an overall Nt-acetylation reduction between 10 and 40%. No observable changes in steady-state protein levels could be observed for six of the seven candidates tested. For THOC7, however, which is a component of the THO complex (<xref rid="DDU611C67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="DDU611C68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), a multi-protein complex implicated in the coupling of transcription and mRNA processing, a decrease in protein half-life could be observed. Here, the observed proteasomal-dependent decrease in protein half-life of THOC7 correlated with decreased Nt-acetylation, suggesting that the acetyl group confers stability to THOC7.</p><p>In conclusion, we present data supporting our hypothesis that a major contributing factor to Ogden syndrome is loss of Nt-acetylation of specific NatA- and NatE-type substrates due to reduced catalytic activity, reduced NatA-complex formation, and reduced interaction with hNaa50. Our cellular studies suggest that S37P-hTERT cells have reduced cell proliferation via perturbation of the Rb1-pathway and are dysregulated in terms of cellâcell contact inhibition and migration, possibly accounting for the detrimental effect of hNaa10-S37P observed in males suffering from Ogden syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Homology modeling</title><p>The homology model of the human NatA WT complex was built with Modeller version 9.8 (<xref rid="DDU611C69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>) using the NatA complex of <italic>S. pombe</italic> as a template.

The system was subjected to energy minimization, followed by a gradual heating and by a 1 ns equilibration phase during which velocities were reassigned every picosecond. The production phase consisted of a 100 ns simulation in the NPT ensemble, with a time step of 1 fs. Two simulations (replicas) using a different set of initial velocities were conducted for each system.</p><p>An extensive study of the interactions between the two subunits was conducted by using free energy decompositions and by monitoring intermolecular hydrogen bonds. All analyses were performed on the last 80 ns of simulation. They were subsequently divided into four windows of 20 ns each.

The data for quantification of the cell viability of WT- and S37P-hTERT are shown as the mean of at least three independent experiments, each with at least three technical replicates for each measurement. The <italic>P</italic>-values were calculated using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4t"><title>BrdU cell proliferation assay of primary fibroblasts</title><p>Primary hNaa10-WT fibroblasts (HDFn), 5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> and one Ogden boy (S37P; III-6) at passage 4 were plated in 12-well plates on glass coverslips coated with matrigel (Corning; 354230). To measure BrdU incorporation, the cells were incubated for 5 h with BrdU label (Millipore; QIA58, 1 : 2000) at 46 h after seeding, then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, treated with 0.07 N NaOH for 15 min at room temperature, and blocked in 10% goat serum, 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature before staining. The cells were then stained with a BrdU antibody (1 : 100) for 1 h at room temperature, washed and incubated with secondary antibody (AlexaFluor goat anti-mouse 488, Life Technologies; A-11029, 1 : 1000) for 1 h at room temperature. Hoechst 33 342 was used as a nuclear stain (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies; R37605). Quantitative analysis was performed by counting, for each cell types, the percentage of BrdU-positive nuclei on a total of â¼1000 cells, randomly observed in 15 microscopic fields from WT fibroblasts and 22 microscopic fields from S37P fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s4u"><title>Wound-healing (migration) assay</title><p>Fibroblasts were cultivated to a high density in wells of culture inserts (Ibidi) for live cell analysis. Culture inserts were removed at time 0 indicating that the start of the cell migration/wound-healing assay and growth medium was replaced either with new medium containing FBS and <sc>l</sc>-glutamine or <sc>l</sc>-glutamine containing medium without FBS or with media without both FBS and <sc>l</sc>-glutamine. Pictures were taken every 15 min for 48 h and a time-lapse video was generated by 10 pictures/s.</p></sec><sec id="s4v"><title>Cell cycle analysis</title><p>Fibroblasts were washed, harvested by trypsination and cells counted. Equal amount of cells (â¥3 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were fixed with 70% ethanol at 4Â°C overnight. Cells were washed with 1Ã PBS before treatment with heat-activated RNase A (300 Âµg/Âµl) at 37Â°C for 30 min followed by propidium staining (300 Âµg/Âµl) for 5 min and two washes.
