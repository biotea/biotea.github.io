        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Many cellular proteins are methylated on lysine residues and this has been most intensively studied for histone proteins. Lysine methylations on non-histone proteins are also frequent, but in most cases the functional significance of the methylation event, as well as the identity of the responsible lysine (<underline>K</underline>) specific <underline>m</underline>ethyl<underline>t</underline>ransferase (KMT), remain unknown. Several recently discovered KMTs belong to the so-called seven-Î²-strand (7BS) class of MTases and we have here investigated an uncharacterized human 7BS MTase currently annotated as part of the endothelin converting enzyme 2, but which should be considered a separate enzyme. Combining <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymology and analyzes of knockout cells, we demonstrate that this MTase efficiently methylates K36 in eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We suggest that this novel KMT is named eEF1A-KMT4 (gene name <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic>), in agreement with the recently established nomenclature. Furthermore, by ribosome profiling we show that the absence of K36 methylation affects translation dynamics and changes translation speed of distinct codons. Finally, we show that eEF1A-KMT4 is part of a novel family of human KMTs, defined by a shared sequence motif in the active site and we demonstrate the importance of this motif for catalytic activity.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The addition of a methyl group to a biomolecule represents a very common biochemical reaction within the cell. Methylation reactions are catalyzed by highly specific methyltransferase (MTase) enzymes, most of which use <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The products of the AdoMet-dependent MTase reactions are the methylated substrate and <italic>S</italic>-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). The human genome has been predicted to encode around 200 AdoMet-dependent MTases, which based on their sequences and structures, have been categorized into five different classes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The largest class is constituted by the seven-Î²-strand (7BS) MTases, which share a characteristic structural fold and encompass â¼130 human enzymes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The second largest class are the SET (<underline>S</underline>u(var)3-9, <underline>E</underline>nhancer-of-zeste, <underline>T</underline>rithorax) proteins, defined by the presence of a so-called SET-domain and comprising more than 50 characterized and putative human MTases (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Lysine methylation is a common post-translational protein modification. The Îµ-amino group of a lysine side chain can accept up to three methyl groups, resulting in mono- di- or trimethyllysine, and the different methylated species of lysines can exert distinct functions. The functional significance of lysine methylation has been most intensively studied in the context of histone proteins and epigenetics, where the modification constitutes a part of the so called âhistone codeâ and methylation of specific lysines in the histone tails are determinants of gene expression and chromatin state (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). For example, trimethylation of lysine 4 in histone H3 (H3-K4) is often associated with actively transcribed genes whereas trimethylation of H3-K9 or H3-K27 is linked to transcriptional repression (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Clearly, many of the human MTases are devoted to protein lysine methylation. In particular, the SET-proteins appear to exclusively encompass lysine (K)-specific MTases (KMTs), several of which specifically target histone tails. However, it has recently become clear that also the 7BS MTases, which methylate substrates ranging from small metabolites to proteins and nucleic acids, also comprise several KMTs. DOT1L was the first human 7BS KMT to be characterized (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It methylates histone H3, but in contrast to most SET enzymes, targets a residue (K79) located in the globular domain of the protein (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In recent years, several enzymes of the 7BS class have been shown to methylate specific lysine residues in non-histone substrates (reviewed in (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)). Notably, several of these have been shown to target translation elongation factors. eEF1A-KMT1, eEF1A-KMT2, eEF1A-KMT3 (encoded by the <italic>EEF1AKMT1, EEF1AKMT2, EEF1AKMT3</italic> genes, respectively) target individual lysines in eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A), whereas eEF2-KMT (encoded by the <italic>EEF2KMT</italic> gene) methylates eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In addition, several of the members of the so-called MTase Family 16 (MTF16) target various other non-histone substrates (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
      <p>eEF1A, as well as its prokaryotic ortholog EF-Tu, perform the essential function of delivering aminoacylated tRNAs to the ribosome, enabling translation of mRNA to protein (reviewed in (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)). However, eEF1A has also been attributed several non-canonical functions, including involvement in protein degradation, apoptosis, organization of the cytoskeleton and nuclear export of tRNAs (reviewed in (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)). Humans have two closely related paralogues of eEF1A, denoted eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 (here, collectively referred to as eEF1A) which display distinct expression patterns (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Mammalian eEF1A is subject to extensive lysine methylation and early studies on rabbit eEF1A identified five methylated lysine residues by peptide sequencing, i.e. K36, K55, K79, K165 and K318. Recent mass spectrometry (MS) studies have confirmed the presence of the corresponding methylated lysines also in human eEF1A (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For three out of these five methylated lysines, the responsible KMT has been identified; eEF1A-KMT1, eEF1A-KMT2 and eEF1A-KMT3 mediate methylation at K79, K318 and K165, respectively (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, the KMTs introducing methylation at K36 and K55 remain elusive.</p>
      <p>Here, we have characterized a new human MTase, which attracted our attention because it shares sequence similarity with the eEF1A-specific KMT eEF1A-KMT2. This novel MTase is encoded by a set of exons currently annotated as part of the gene encoding the endothelin converting enzyme 2 (<italic>ECE2</italic>). From analysis of genome and transcriptome data, we conclude that the exons encoding the MTase represent a separate gene. We show that the recombinant MTase methylates a single protein in cell extracts, and the substrate is identified as eEF1A through biochemical purification and protein MS. Since the enzyme represents the fourth eEF1A-specific KMT in humans, we propose that it is named eEF1A-KMT4 (suggested gene name <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic>), in keeping with the prevailing nomenclature. Moreover, we demonstrate that eEF1A-KMT4 catalyzes methylation of K36 in recombinant eEF1A <italic>in vitro</italic> and that the enzyme mediates this modification in cells. Interestingly, we find that global translation is altered in <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> knockout (KO) cells and that codons specific for asparagine, histidine and tryptophan change their translation speed in the KO relative to wild-type (WT) cells. Finally, we show that eEF1A-KMT4, together with eEF1A-KMT2 and two yet uncharacterized MTases, constitute a novel KMT family, defined by a common sequence motif which is required for MTase activity.</p>

        <title>Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing</title>
        <p>Cells for ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing were processed essentially as described (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In brief, cells were treated with 100 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for 1 min, washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 100 Î¼g/ml CHX and subsequently lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 100 Î¼g/ml CHX). For ribosome profiling, lysates were subsequently treated with 250 U RNase I (Ambion) for 10 min at 22Â°C and shaking at 1400 rpm. The digestion was stopped by addition of 100 U SUPERase In RNase inhibitor (Ambion). Ribosomes were separated on a 10â50% (w/v) sucrose density gradient in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 12 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT and 100 Î¼g/ml CHX for 3 h at 35 000 rpm and 4Â°C in a TH-641 rotor (Thermo Scientific). Gradients were fractionated at 0.75 ml/min with continuous monitoring of OD<sub>254</sub> on a density gradient fractionator (Isco) coupled to a SYR-101 syringe pump (Brandel). Sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) was added immediately to 1% and 400 Î¼l fractions were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80Â°C until further processing. Monosome fractions were pooled, RNA isolated and separated on 15% polyacrylamide gels (8 M urea, 90 mM Tris-borate, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 8.0). Ribosome footprints were excised between 28 nucleotide (nt) and 32 nt RNA size markers. Sequencing libraries from ribosome footprints were generated essentially as described (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), except for ligation to a preadenylated 3â²-adapter (5â² rAppNNNNCTGTAGGCACCATCAAT/3ddC/ 3â²) in a reaction containing 200 000 U T4 RNA ligase 2 (truncated, NEB), 25% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 10 U SUPERase In RNase inhibitor for 4 h at 22Â°C. The first four bases of the 3â²-adapter were randomized to minimize ligation bias (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
        <p>RNASeq libraries were prepared from cells lysed similar to ribosome profiling samples. RNA was isolated from cleared lysates by addition of 1% SDS (w/v) and 5 min incubation at 65Â°C with intermittent vortexing followed by three rounds of extraction using 10:1 acidâphenol pH 4.3 and bromochloropropane. Total RNA was precipitated and 5 Î¼g used for library generation with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiScanSQ generating 50 nt single-end reads. Data were mapped to the hg38 transcriptome (UCSC knownCanonical) and counts generated using a custom script. Differential gene expression analysis for footprints and mRNA was performed using the DESeq2 R-package with a P-adjusted threshold of 0.05 and a log<sub>2</sub> fold change threshold of 0.5 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Translationally regulated genes were defined as differentially expressed based on the ribosome profiling data and having a log<sub>2</sub> fold change of the footprints at least twice as high as in the mRNA data. Genes differentially expressed on the transcript level exclusively were defined accordingly, but taking mRNA reads as the basis. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment was determined using GOrilla (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). For the determination of A-site codon occupancy we used a published strategy (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Briefly, 29â31 nt reads translating the 0-frame were used with an A-site offset of 15 nt from the start of the read. A-site codon occupancy was normalized to the adjacent unread codons in the +1 +2 and +3 positions relative to the A-site. Ribosome occupancy at the +1 position, was consequently normalized to the neighboring +2 +3 and +4 positions. Ribosome occupancy of the first 15 codons of each transcript was not taken into account for all analyzes to exclude influences of sample preparation. The sequencing data of the ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing experiments are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (Accession number: GSE97140).</p>

<italic>ECE2/EEF1AKMT4</italic> gene structure</title>
        <p>During our efforts to identify novel human KMTs, the protein denoted ECE2 caught our interest, since it contains a putative 7BS MTase domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) that is somewhat related to eEF1A-KMT2, an eEF1A specific KMT (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Human ECE2 is currently annotated as a multidomain protein encoded by 22 exons localized as two clusters separated by a large intron on human chromosome 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The first cluster, represented by the three 5â² proximal exons, encodes the 7BS MTase domain (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), while the second, downstream exon cluster, consisting of 19 exons, encodes transmembrane and peptidase domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>). The ECE2 peptidase is responsible for generating the regulatory peptide endothelin 1 from a larger precursor (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). According to the current gene annotation, the <italic>ECE2</italic> gene encodes shorter isoforms that represent the separate MTase or transmembrane/peptidase moieties, in addition to the full-length protein. Intriguingly, while the existence of such shorter isoforms is well supported by EST in human and mouse, the existence of the full-length protein is not supported, since ESTs spanning both the MTase and transmembrane/peptidase regions have not been detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Also, in lower animals, such as fruit fly and nematode, potential orthologs of the MTase and peptidase are present, but are encoded by two different genes. Finally, this MTase was detected in a very recent study that used a chemical proteomic profiling approach to identify human MTases at the protein level, but the data did not support the existence of MTase/peptidase fusion proteins (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Thus, the available data suggest that the current <italic>ECE2</italic> gene annotation should be modified, thus considering the exon clusters encoding the MTase and transmembrane/peptidase moieties as two separate genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As will become evident from subsequent sections, this MTase represents an eEF1A-specific KMT, which we in agreement with the current nomenclature have named and hereafter refer to, as eEF1A-KMT4 (gene name <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic>).</p>

        <p>For functional characterization of the eEF1A-KMT4 protein, the <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> gene was disrupted in HAP-1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. To assure abrogation of gene function, guide RNAs were designed to target a segment upstream of a previously described key motif denoted âPost Iâ, localized in the second Î²-strand in the canonical 7BS topology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The last residue of motif Post I is universally conserved as an acidic amino acid in the 7BS superfamily and has been suggested to stabilize the interaction with AdoMet by hydrogen bonding (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The three-dimensional (3D) structure of eEF1A-KMT4 in complex with AdoHcy has been solved (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and the location and orientation of the corresponding acidic residue (D88), relative to AdoHcy, clearly supports this notion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). A clone that was found (by DNA sequencing) to contain a 17 nt deletion at the target site was used for further work. In this clone, the reading frame of the gene is shifted so that D88 is no longer present (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and a severely truncated version (108 residues) of the eEF1A-KMT4 protein (255 residues) is encoded.</p>
        <p>We have previously shown that several recombinant 7BS KMTs can methylate specific proteins when added to a cellular extract and that KMT substrates can be identified by fractionation of the extract (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Moreover, such methylation is often strongly enhanced in extracts from cells that lack the relevant KMT, due to an increased level of unmethylated substrate (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Thus, to investigate the potential protein MTase activity of eEF1A-KMT4, protein extracts from <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic>-deficient and WT HAP-1 cells were incubated with recombinant eEF1A-KMT4 and [<sup>3</sup>H]AdoMet. Subsequently, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and methylation was visualized by fluorography. Several of the characterized human 7BS KMTs modify nucleotide-binding proteins and the addition of nucleotides such as ATP or GTP to <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation reactions has been shown to enhance methylation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Therefore, we added ATP to the reaction mixture for eEF1A-KMT4-mediated methylation. Notably, these experiments revealed that recombinant eEF1A-KMT4 specifically methylated â¼50 kDa protein substrate in the WT HAP-1 extract and that methylation was enhanced in <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic>-deficient cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the observed activity was due to an <italic>E. coli</italic> MTase co-purifying with eEF1A-KMT4, we assayed the activity of a presumably inactive mutant protein where the key catalytic residue D88 was mutated to alanine (eEF1A-KMT4-D88A). Reassuringly, this single point mutation completely abrogated the activity of the enzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In conclusion, the above experiments establish eEF1A-KMT4 as a protein MTase.</p>

Since eEF1A proteins bind GTP and since we previously observed nucleotide-dependent methylation of eEF1A by other KMTs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), we investigated the effect of adding GTP or ATP to the reaction mixture for eEF1A-KMT4-mediated methylation. Clearly, eEF1A1 was efficiently methylated in the presence of either ATP or GTP, whereas no detectable methylation occurred in the absence of these cofactors and, notably, the stimulatory effect was more pronounced for GTP than for ATP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Therefore, GTP was included in all subsequent methylation assays. Similar to previous observations for related enzymes, we observed considerable automethylation of eEF1A-KMT4, but this activity was independent of the presence of nucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p>

        <p>To identify the residue(s) targeted by eEF1A-KMT4, recombinant eEF1A1 was treated with eEF1A-KMT4 and non-radioactive AdoMet, followed by proteolytic digestion with chymotrypsin and the resulting peptides were analyzed by MS. In this analysis, peptides with di- or trimethylation on K36 were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). To further support the observed eEF1A-KMT4-mediated methylation of K36, this residue was mutated to arginine in eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, and the resulting proteins (denoted eEF1A1-K36R and eEF1A2-K36R) were assessed for eEF1A-KMT4-mediated methylation. Importantly, neither of the two K36R-mutated eEF1A proteins were subject to eEF1A-KMT4-mediated methylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), indicating that K36 is the only residue targeted by eEF1A-KMT4.

        <p>The region surrounding K36 is highly conserved throughout evolution and, consequently, proteolytic peptides from eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 that encompass this residue are indistinguishable by MS. Thus, our observation that a mixture of the various methylated forms of the peptide exists in HAP-1 cells could reflect differences in eEF1A1 versus eEF1A2 methylation at this site <italic>in vivo</italic>. To investigate this, we over-expressed tagged eEF1A proteins in HEK-293 cells and analyzed the methylation status of K36 in affinity purified proteins. This analysis showed that both eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 are methylated on K36 <italic>in vivo</italic> and that the trimethylated form is predominant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To analyze the occurrence and extent of K36 methylation in different mammalian organs, we enriched eEF1A from rat liver, kidney, intestine and brain, followed by an assessment of the methylation state by MS as above. In these organs, we observed high levels of K36 methylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), similarly to our observations from HAP-1 WT cells. In all analyzed organs, the bulk (&gt;90%) of eEF1A was methylated and the trimethylated form was predominant.</p>
        <p>Thus, we have demonstrated that methylation of eEF1A on K36 is dependent on eEF1A-KMT4 and occurs in a wide range of mammalian cell types. Taken together with our findings on eEF1A-KMT4-mediated methylation of eEF1A <italic>in vitro</italic>, these results indicate that eEF1A-KMT4 is necessary and sufficient for methylation of K36 in eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>The absence of eEF1A-KMT4 activity changes cellular mRNA translation</title>
        <p>Since eEF1A-KMT4 targets eEF1A, a key component of the translational apparatus, we sought to explore its impact on translation. To this end, we performed quantitative mRNA translation analysis by ribosome profiling (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), comparing the <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> KO cells to the WT HAP-1 cells. When analyzing mRNA abundance and mRNA translation, we found that translation levels were changed for a large number of genes. While the expression of many genes was mainly changed at the level of transcription, 823 out of 1317 differentially translated genes displayed changes that could not be subscribed solely to altered transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, blue circles and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, genes encoding ribosomal proteins were enriched amongst the upregulated genes, reflected by an over-representation of translation-associated GO terms (e.g. ER/SRP-associated translation; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Furthermore, genes associated with several basic metabolic processes showed increased translation in the <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> KO. Downregulated genes show a less clearly defined GO-term enrichment. Processes such as cell migration and organization of the extracellular matrix were most significantly downregulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Similarly, genes associated with protein folding in the ER and tRNA aminoacylation were enriched among the downregulated ones, thus showing a functional link to the upregulated processes.</p>

        <p>Since the <italic>EEF1AKMT</italic> KO affected translation genes and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and since eEF1A-KMT4-mediated methylation of eEF1A may influence its ability to deliver aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, we compared the transcriptome-wide codon occupancy at A-site in the ribosome in the KO versus the WT HAP-1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). We found that ribosome occupancy, which is a proxy for translation speed, was altered for several codons in the <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> KO relative to the WT. Interestingly, codons that encode the same amino acid generally showed the same trend. This was most apparent for ACC and AAT, which encode asparagine and showed decreased occupancy in the KO cells. Conversely, CAC and CAT, which encode histidine, showed increased A-site occupancy. Furthermore, the effect was observed to a lesser extent for codons corresponding to several other amino acids (decreased A-site occupancy: Asp, Ala, Val, Tyr; increased A-site occupancy: Pro, Leu; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). In addition, the single Trp-encoding codon TGG showed reduced occupancy in the KO cells. However, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases with altered expression or translation levels do not correlate with codons that show changes in codon occupancy. Importantly, when we analyzed the relative codon occupancy of the +1 site, representing the unread codon that follows the A-site, no such effect was observed. Most codons displayed 0.9- to 1.1-fold changes, corresponding to the experimental error of the method (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Furthermore, the +1 codons did, in contrast to the A-site codons, not show similar effects for synonymous codons. This indicates that the observed effect of the <italic>EEF1AKMT</italic> KO on A-site occupancy is specific and that methylation of eEF1A contributes to the fine-tuning of translation rates for a subset of tRNAs.</p>

In addition to eEF1A-KMT4, this family encompasses eEF1A-KMT2, METTL12 and METTL13. eEF1A-KMT2 and eEF1A-KMT4 are single-domain proteins consisting of a core 7BS-MTase domain with short flanking sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). METTL12 has been reported as a mitochondrial protein and, accordingly, carries an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). METTL13 has a unique domain structure, as it consists of two unrelated 7BS MTase domains. The N-terminal MTase domain of METTL13 is closely related to eEF1A-KMT4, whereas the closest human sequence homolog of the C-terminal domain is spermidine synthase, which uses decarboxylated AdoMet as a co-substrate for aminopropylation of putrescine to spermidine (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). eEF1A-KMT2 and eEF1A-KMT4 have now been established as KMTs (present study and (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)), suggesting that also METTL12 and METTL13 may possess KMT activity.

        <p>Second, we generated a sequence alignment of the putative orthologs from various organisms. Strikingly, all these orthologs contain a conserved sequence motif, i.e. [D/E]-K-G-T-X-D (consensus) located directly downstream of the fourth Î²-strand of the 7BS fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). The corresponding segment has been referred to as motif âPost IIâ in other 7BS KMTs and has been linked to substrate specificity. For example, the human members of MTF16, consisting of several established KMTs, have a conserved [D/E]-X-X-[Y/F] motif at the corresponding position (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Also other 7BS KMTs, such as eukaryotic Dot1/DOT1L and bacterial PrmA, display a conserved sequence motif at this position, and residues within this motif have been implicated in catalysis and substrate recognition (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Analysis of the previously reported structure of eEF1A-KMT4 revealed that the [D/E]-K-G-T-X-D motif and the N-terminal extension preceding the core 7BS fold form the walls of a tunnel leading up to the sulfur atom of AdoHcy (corresponding to the methyl bearing sulfur atom of AdoMet) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Thus, the location of this motif in the structure of eEF1A-KMT4 suggests that it is important for the catalytic function of the enzyme.</p>
        <p>To investigate the functional importance of the [D/E]-K-G-T-X-D motif, we individually mutated the relevant side-chain-containing residues in eEF1A-KMT4 (i.e. G131 was excluded) to alanine and assayed the activity of the mutant enzymes on recombinant eEF1A1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). We found that mutation of the charged residues in this motif (i.e. E129, D134 or K130) abrogated enzymatic activity, whereas mutation of remaining residues (i.e. T132 or L133) reduced methylation.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the above bioinformatics analyzes demonstrate that eEF1A-KMT4, together with its paralogs eEF1A-KMT2, METTL12 and METTL13, constitute a subfamily of human MTases with homologs in multiple eukaryotic organisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of a shared [D/E]-K-G-T-X-D motif, corresponding to the previously described and specificity-associated motif Post II. We find that this motif is crucial for enzymatic activity of eEF1A-KMT4, suggesting that also METTL12 and METTL13 are KMTs.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>MTases of the 7BS superfamily have been shown to methylate a wide range of substrates and it has in recent years become clear that several of these enzymes target lysine residues in proteins (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Through the present work, we have established the biochemical function of the yet uncharacterized 7BS MTase eEF1A-KMT4, showing that this enzyme is a KMT specifically targeting K36 in eEF1A, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells. Interestingly, <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> KO caused alterations in the translation of several mRNAs, as well as in the translation rates of codons corresponding to specific amino acids. Moreover, we have noted that eEF1A-KMT4, together with the eEF1A-specific KMT eEF1A-KMT2 and the yet uncharacterized MTases METTL12 and METTL13, form a 7BS MTase family that shares a functionally important sequence motif, indicating that also METTL12 and METTL13 are KMTs.</p>
      <p>Besides possessing a common structural fold, the members of the 7BS class of MTases share several conserved sequence motifs, denoted âIâ, âPost Iâ, âIIâ and âIIIâ. In addition to these general motifs, more closely related 7BS MTases with similar substrate specificities typically share a motif denoted âPost IIâ, localized immediately after Î²-strand 4 of the 7BS fold. For example, several MTases acting on DNA and RNA have a so-called DPPY-motif (consensus [S/N/D]-P-P-[Y/W/F]) at this location (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Also, it has been demonstrated that the ten human MTF16 members share a so-called DXXY-motif (consensus [D/E]-X-X-[Y/F]) at the Post II position (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and several of these enzymes have recently been established as KMTs (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p>
      <p>Moreover, motif Post II is generally conserved between orthologous 7BS KMT enzymes from different organisms. For example, the bacterial PrmA KMTs have a conserved A-N-[I/L] motif at this position, whereas the eukaryotic Dot1 KMTs share a Post II motif with sequence N-N-F-X-F (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Interestingly, the previously characterized 7BS KMTs for which the 3D structure has been determined have an aspartate, glutamate, asparagine or glutamine residue of motif Post II at an equivalent position within the structure and in the immediate vicinity of the methyl group to be transferred from AdoMet to the substrate (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In the case of PrmA and Dot1, the only two 7BS KMTs for which structures of enzyme/substrate complexes are available, this residue has indeed been implicated in substrate recognition (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>â<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Thus, one may speculate that acidic residues within the [D/E]-K-G-T-X-D motif found in the family of KMTs described here (eEF1A-KMT2, eEF1A-KMT4, METTL12 and METTL13) play a similar catalytically important function, since individual replacement of these residues in eEF1A-KMT4 completely abrogated enzymatic activity.</p>
      <p>A ternary complex formed by eEF1A, GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA binds to the ribosome, ensuring the sampling of the anticodon to match the codon in the ribosomal A-site. Subsequently, GTP is hydrolyzed and the correct aminoacyl-tRNA becomes accommodated in the A-site (reviewed in (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>)). During translation tRNAs are recognized by shape and not by sequence. Thus, eEF1A needs to present all tRNAs to the ribosome in a similar manner despite the tRNAs having different primary sequence and being charged with different amino acids. Here, methylation may provide a cellular strategy to tune eEF1A for specific subsets of aminoacyl-tRNAs. We found that the absence of K36 methylation caused a change in the translation rates of specific codons. Interestingly, not all codons respond in a similar way. For example, the codons AAC and AAT (encoding asparagine) showed a lower codon occupancy in the <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> KO cells than in WT, indicating faster translation in the mutant. In contrast, CAC and CAT (encoding histidine) showed an increased A-site occupancy in the KO cells. While for asparagine, aspartic acid, histidine, one isoacceptor dominates the cellular pool, this is not the case for phenylalanine. Furthermore, we did not find a direct link between differential regulation of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and codons with altered occupancy in the <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> KO suggesting that the relationship is more complex. Importantly, translation is a highly optimized process that depends on consistent kinetics; therefore it is likely that its key players were fine-tuned during evolution. Intriguingly, post-transcriptional tRNA modifications show parallels to this theme: the absence of tRNA anticodon modifications alters codon-specific translation dynamics similar to eEF1A methylation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). This suggests that evolution has generated different and independent mechanisms to fine-tune translation and to optimize its kinetics. Nevertheless, the translational responses that we observed in the KO are likely a combination of direct perturbations and downstream effects of these defects. Thus, it will be important to analyze these processes in the future to obtain a detailed molecular understanding of how the different players in translation ensure its optimal dynamics.</p>
      <p>We observed that <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> inactivation had interesting effects on the translation of certain codons and consider it likely that these effects reflect the lack of methylation on K36 in eEF1A. However, one cannot completely rule out the possibility that the <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> KO cells have undergone changes during their generation and cultivation, relative to the âWTâ HAP-1 cells, that are independent of, or secondary to, the <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> gene KO. Thus, to more firmly establish that the observed translation phenotypes are directly caused by the lack of eEF1A-KMT4 activity, one would ideally test if complementation of the KO cells with an ectopically expressed <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> gene would reverse these phenotypes. However, we have experienced that it is difficult to obtain full restoration of methylation by complementation of MTase-deficient HAP-1 cells. For instance, in the case of eEF1A-KMT3 (gene name <italic>EEF1AKMT3</italic>; previously known as <italic>METTL21B</italic>) methylation was only restored to â¼50% of WT levels in the complemented cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
      <p>The methylated lysines on the highly abundant eEF1A protein typically contain several methyl groups each and eEF1A is therefore one of most heavily lysine methylated proteins in the cell, similar to histone proteins. However, despite the recent identification of several eEF1A-specific KMTs, the molecular function(s) of eEF1A methylation remains largely enigmatic, and it has not been firmly established that such methylations are involved in regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that eEF1A methylation may indeed be subject to active regulation. The eEF1A-specific KMT Efm6 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was shown to mediate methylation on K390 and methylation was only present at low levels during normal growth conditions, but could be dramatically increased by <italic>EFM6</italic> over-expression (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Moreover, <italic>EFM6</italic> was recently reported to be upregulated during hypoxia (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate that K390 methylation in yeast is subject to active regulation, and likely modulates eEF1A function during hypoxia and possibly under other stress conditions. Similarly, it was very recently shown that methylation of human eEF1A on K165 was modulated in response to ER stress and altered growth conditions, accompanied by corresponding changes in the expression of the responsible KMT, eEF1A-KMT3 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Here we report that K36 in eEF1A is mostly trimethylated in various tissues, but interestingly a substantial fraction (â¼40%) was un-, mono- or dimethylated in the cancer-derived HAP-1 cells. Future research will likely investigate the potential role of K36 methylation in regulating eEF1A function. However, a first insight may already stem from our ribosome profiling data that show that removal of K36 methylation affects ER related processes, suggesting that methylation at both K36 and K165 are linked to the cellular response to ER stress.</p>
      <p>eEF1A is a highly connected protein (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) with several non-canonical functions beyond its role in delivering aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome. Besides being methylated on a number of lysine residues, eEF1A has also been reported to be subject to acetylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation of lysine as well as phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). For histone proteins, it is well established that combinations of dynamic post-translational modifications (PTMs) constitute a so-called âhistone codeâ, which influences chromatin state and gene activity. Considering the emerging evidence that eEF1A methylation is dynamic and that the protein is extensively modified by other PTMs, a similar âeEF1A codeâ that actively regulates eEF1A function may conceivably exist.</p>
      <p>In recent years, several eukaryotic 7BS KMTs targeting eEF1A have been discovered and these enzymes typically target a single lysine residue. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the enzymes responsible for all the known lysine methylations on eEF1A have now been identified and most of these enzymes are 7BS KMTs. The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 7BS KMTs Efm7, Efm5, Efm4 and Efm6 introduce methylations at K3, K79, K316 and K390, respectively, in eEF1A (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Two of these enzymes are conserved from yeast to humans. eEF1A-KMT2 is the human ortholog of Efm4 and is responsible for methylation of K318 in human eEF1A (corresponding to K316 in yeast eEF1A) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). eEF1A-KMT1 catalyzes methylation at K79 and is the human ortholog of Efm5 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In addition, the human MTF16 member eEF1A-KMT3 was recently shown to catalyze methylation of K165 in eEF1A (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In keeping with this emerging nomenclature for human 7BS KMTs we therefore propose that the protein investigated herein is referred to as eEF1A-KMT4, and is encoded by the novel <italic>EEF1AKMT4</italic> gene that was until now considered to be part of the <italic>ECE2</italic> gene.</p>
