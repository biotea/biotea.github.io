      <abstract>
        <p>Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is the defining constituent of caveolae at the plasma membrane of many mammalian cells. For turnover, CAV1 is ubiquitinated and sorted to late endosomes and lysosomes. Sorting of CAV1 requires the AAA+-type ATPase VCP and its cofactor UBXD1. However, it is unclear in which region CAV1 is ubiquitinated and how ubiquitination is linked to sorting of CAV1 by VCP-UBXD1. Here, we show through site-directed mutagenesis that ubiquitination of CAV1 occurs at any of the six lysine residues, 5, 26, 30, 39, 47, and 57, that are clustered in the N-terminal region but not at lysines in the oligomerization, intramembrane, or C-terminal domains. Mutation of Lys-5â57 to arginines prevented binding of the VCP-UBXD1 complex and, importantly, strongly reduced recruitment of VCP-UBXD1 to endocytic compartments. Moreover, the Lys-5â57Arg mutation specifically interfered with trafficking of CAV1 from early to late endosomes. Conversely and consistently, depletion of VCP or UBXD1 led to accumulation of ubiquitinated CAV1, suggesting that VCP acts downstream of ubiquitination and is required for transport of the ubiquitinated form of CAV1 to late endosomes. These results define the N-terminal region of CAV1 as the critical ubiquitin conjugation site and, together with previous data, demonstrate the significance of this ubiquitination for binding to the VCP-UBXD1 complex and for sorting into lysosomes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Caveolae are invaginations of the plasma membrane that define cholesterol-rich microdomains that are implicated in many physiological processes, including endo- and transcytosis, pathogen entry, lipid regulation, signaling, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). They can bud from the plasma membrane and dock onto endosomes for cargo delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Structurally, they are characterized by a proteinaceous coat that, in contrast to the clathrin coat, stays tightly associated with the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The major constituents of this coat are caveolin proteins that in humans are represented by caveolin-1 (CAV1), caveolin-2, as well as the muscle-specific caveolin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Caveolins are integral membrane proteins with a central hydrophobic hairpin domain inserted inside the membrane and both N and C termini facing the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). The C-terminal cytosolic domain is palmitoylated. The N-terminal cytosolic moiety contains the conserved oligomerization and scaffolding domain (amino acids 61â101) that mediates lipid binding, protein-protein interactions with signaling molecules, and homo-oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). This region alone oligomerizes when incubated as a fragment <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that it mediates caveolar coat assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Preceding the oligomerization domain is the N-terminal region that comprises 60 amino acids in CAV1 and has varying length in the other isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). This N-terminal region is not required for formation of caveolae, suggesting that it has regulatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>CAV1 is inserted cotranslationally into the ER<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> where it rapidly forms SDS-resistant oligomers. During transport through the Golgi apparatus, the oligomers associate with cholesterol and self-assemble to form larger caveolar domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) that subsequently travel between the plasma membrane and endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). When maturation fails in the ER, caveolin is polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In contrast, the plasma membrane and endosomal pools of CAV1 are turned over in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p>
      <p>During the process, CAV1 is modified mostly with monoubiquitin in addition to short ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), consistent with monoubiquitin and short lysine 63-linked chains being signals for endolysosomal sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Consequently, a lysine-less variant of CAV1 that cannot be ubiquitinated fails to be efficiently degraded in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Consistently, CAV1 transport to late endosomes and lysosomes depends on components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway that binds and packages ubiquitinated cargo into intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In addition, however, endosomal sorting of CAV1 requires VCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p>
      <p>VCP (also called valosin-containing protein, p97, or Cdc48) is a multifunctional hexameric AAA+-type ATPase that uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to structurally remodel and segregate protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Its function is best studied during ER-associated degradation where it helps deliver misfolded proteins to the proteasome for degradation in cooperation with its heterodimeric cofactor Ufd1-Npl4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex binds substrate proteins after they have been modified with lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains at the cytosolic side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Upon ATP hydrolysis, VCP segregates the substrates from the membrane to make them available to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In addition, VCP cooperates with alternative cofactors in many other cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These include endosomal trafficking pathways where VCP has been reported to physically interact with clathrin and early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Moreover, VCP is essential for efficient autophagy, a process intimately linked with endosomal trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p>
      <p>We showed recently that VCP binds monoubiquitinated CAV1 and that this complex involves the UBXD1 cofactor that can also be detected at CAV1-containing endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The fact that cellular depletion of VCP or UBXD1, overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of VCP, or pharmacological inhibition of VCP lead to accumulation of CAV1 at the limiting membrane of late endosomes demonstrates that the VCP-UBXD1 complex is required for proper trafficking of CAV1 to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, the functional relationship between CAV1 ubiquitination and its sorting by the VCP-UBXD1 ATPase complex is unknown. Moreover, it is unclear in which of the functional domains CAV1 is ubiquitinated. Here we show that CAV1 is ubiquitinated at lysines within the flexible N-terminal region but not in the other functional domains and that this constitutes the signal for targeting CAV1 from early to late endosomes. Moreover, we provide evidence that the VCP-UBXD1 complex is recruited to endosomes by this specific ubiquitination. Importantly, we show that in the absence of VCP-UBXD1 activity ubiquitinated CAV1 accumulates, thus providing evidence that VCP-UBXD1 binds ubiquitinated CAV1 to facilitate downstream turnover of specifically this form of CAV1.</p>

A construct coding for HA-tagged human CAV1 was generated in two steps. First, a primer pair coding for a single HA tag and flanking the NotI and XhoI restriction sites (5â²-GGCCGCATACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTAGCTAGC-3â² (sense) and 5â²-TCGAGCTAGCTAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTATGC-3â² (antisense)) was annealed and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 + (Invitrogen) vector to yield pcDNA3.1/HA. The human CAV1 cDNA was then subcloned from CAV1-myc into pcDNA3.1/HA using the EcoRI/NotI restriction sites. The pcDNA-CAV1-HA/FRT/TO construct for the generation of stable cell lines was produced by PCR cloning of the CAV1-HA cDNA flanked by the HindIII and BamHI sites (5â²-ATTGAAGCTTGGCACGAGGGGGCCAG-3â² (sense) and 5â²-TACGGATCCCGAGCGGCCGCTATTTC-3â² (antisense)) into the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen).</p>

Stable inducible U2OS cell lines expressing either VCP-myc-strep (U2OS-VCP) or CAV1-HA (U2OS-CAV1-HA) were generated from the U2OS-FRT cells. The pcDNA-VCP-myc-strep-FRT/TO or pcDNA-CAV1-HA-FRT/TO plasmids were transfected according to the protocol of the manufacturer for Flip-In recombination, and single clones were selected. U2OS and HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS in the presence of penicillin/streptomycin. In addition, stable cell lines were supplemented with 4 Î¼g/ml blasticidin S and 130 Î¼g/ml hygromycin B (U2OS-VCP) or 4 Î¼g/ml blasticidin S and 120 Î¼g/ml hygromycin B (U2OS-CAV1-HA). Expression was induced with 1 Î¼g/ml doxycycline. HEK293 and U2OS cells were transfected using the JetPrime (Polyplus) or the JetPEI reagents (Polyplus), respectively. For JetPEI transfection reactions, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium 4 h post-transfection. Cells were analyzed after 24 h.</p>

To investigate the ubiquitination of caveolin-1, the extraction buffer was additionally supplemented with 10 m<sc>m</sc>
<italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) to inhibit deubiquitinating enzymes. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 Ã <italic>g</italic>, 15 min, 4 Â°C), and the protein concentration was determined in a BCA assay (Interchim). Cleared lysates were either directly resolved by SDS-PAGE (13% Tris/glycine or MiniProtean TGX 4â15% Tris/glycine gels, Bio-Rad) and analyzed by Western blotting or subjected to immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation, the protein concentrations were adjusted to 1 mg/ml in extraction buffer, and lysates were supplemented with 1 Î¼g/ml BSA. For the coimmunoprecipitation experiments of CAV1-myc, 200 Î¼g of lysate protein was used, of which 5% was taken as an input sample. The lysates were precleared with 5 Î¼l of Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen) for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with 0.2 Î¼g of anti-myc primary antibody (9E2). Antigen-antibody complexes were captured with 20 Î¼l of Dynabeads protein G at 4 Â°C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times in extraction buffer and eluted by boiling in 2 Ã SDS sample buffer.

            <p>U2OS cells were grown on glass coverslips. 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After blocking with 3% BSA/PBS, the coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies (diluted 1:500 except for mouse anti-myc (1:1000) in 3% BSA/PBS) for 1.5 h and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted 1:500 in 3% BSA/PBS) for 30 min. Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) containing 0.5 Î¼g/ml DAPI. Imaging was performed on an inverted spinning disc confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti with a Yokogawa CSU X-1 spinning disc unit) using a Ã100, 1.49 NA (numerical aperture) or Ã40, 0.95 NA objective. Images were acquired with an Andor iXon X3 EMCCD (electron multiplying charge-coupled device) camera.</p>

            <p>The colocalization between CAV1-HA-positive endosomal structures (Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 488) and ubiquitin, LAMP1, VCP-myc (Alexa Fluor 488), or UBXD1-mCherry signal was analyzed using an ImageJ (1.45 k, National Institutes of Health) routine that is available upon request. Images were acquired as series with equal laser intensities and exposure time. In detail, the image of the CAV1-HA channel was thresholded (mean of HA signal + twice the standard deviation of the HA signal; in the case of the Lamp1 and FK2 colocalization experiment, mean of HA signal + three times the standard deviation of the HA signal) to remove the background signal. To discriminate vesicles in close proximity, the ImageJ Watershed algorithm was used. Vesicles were identified using the Analyze Particles function in ImageJ (Size 10â400 pixels, roundness 0.5â1.0). For each vesicle, the colocalizing signal of ubiquitin, LAMP1, VCP-myc, or UBXD1-mCherry was analyzed individually and considered positive if the signal intensity was above the threshold (mean intensity + three times the standard deviation of the signal over the whole image) and the variation of the signal was not more than three times (four times for colocalization with VCP-myc or UBXD1) greater than the signal variation over the whole picture. For each cell, the total number of vesicles and of vesicles with colocalization was given as a result.</p>

            <title>CAV1 Is Monoubiquitinated in the N-terminal Region</title>
            <p>Human CAV1 is a 178-amino acid protein that contains 12 lysines in four distinct functional domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). To identify the functional acceptor site of ubiquitin in CAV1, we undertook a systematic mutagenesis analysis in which we exchanged individual or groups of lysines to arginines. Mutagenized HA-tagged CAV1 variants were overexpressed in U2OS osteosarcoma cells and lysates analyzed by Western blotting with CAV1-specific antibodies. An experiment summarizing the results is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>. Overexpressed wild-type CAV1 migrated slightly above endogenous CAV1 because of the HA-tag. Importantly, a prominent slower-migrating double band was apparent that we previously showed to correspond to monoubiquitin-modified CAV1 in addition to a minor species above the doublet, most likely representing oligoubiquitinated CAV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). As expected, these bands were absent in lysates from cells expressing a CAV1 variant lacking all 12 lysines (K5â176R). Importantly, mutation of the six lysines that cluster in the N-terminal region (K5â57R) was sufficient to abolish ubiquitination. Conversely, mutation of all lysine residues in the other regions of CAV1 did not affect ubiquitination. To confirm this result and assess subcellular distribution of CAV1 ubiquitination by light microscopy, we transfected the four constructs into U2OS cells and colocalized CAV1 with the endosomal marker GFP-RAB5 or ubiquitin-specific antibodies. In all cases, CAV1 localized to endosomal compartments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M112.429076/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>), as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In the case of CAV1 wild-type and the K65â176R mutant that are both proficient in ubiquitination, frequent colocalization of CAV1-containing vesicles with the ubiquitin signal was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>). Automated image analysis revealed that this was the case for a median of about 20% of CAV1-positive vesicles/cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). In contrast, the ubiquitination-deficient CAV1(K5â176R) and, importantly, also the N-terminal CAV1(K5â57R) mutant displayed a significantly reduced ubiquitin signal on CAV1-positive vesicles, as apparent in micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>) and automated image quantification (<italic>D</italic>). These results demonstrate that the N-terminal region is the exclusive acceptor site for ubiquitination in CAV1 on endosomes.</p>

            <title>Ubiquitination within the N-terminal Region Is Promiscuous</title>
            <p>To assess the relevance of the individual lysine residues within the N-terminal region more exactly, we mutated single residues to arginine and again expressed the constructs in U2OS cells. Western blot analysis revealed that none of the single mutations significantly affected ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). In a converse experiment, we took the lysine-less CAV1(K5-K176R) construct as a template and reintroduced individual lysine residues in the N-terminal region. It should be noted that CAV1(K5â176R) runs slightly faster in SDS gels than the wild-type because of the extent of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and we observed a gradual shift with increasing number of mutations (data not shown). As expected, CAV1(K5â176R) was not ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). Crucially, however, reintroduction of individual lysines at any of the six residues in the N-terminal region resulted in ubiquitination of CAV1, although the lysine at position 39 was ubiquitinated most strongly, whereas position 57 was only ubiquitinated poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). These results, which were again confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M112.429076/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>) and automated quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>), suggest that ubiquitination can occur at any residue of the N-terminal region, although to a lesser extent at its border. The experiment also provided an explanation for the occurrence of the double band for monoubiquitinated wild-type CAV1. We found that single lysine residues at positions 5, 26, or 30 resulted in the upper band of the doublet, whereas ubiquitination at position 39, 47, or 57 resulted in the lower band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). This suggests that formation of an isopeptide bond with ubiquitin causes different migration behavior in CAV1 in SDS gels, depending in which of the two subregions conjugation occurs. Indeed, reintroduction of two lysines at position 30 and 39 in the CAV1(R30,39K) construct resulted in ubiquitination at both sites with similar probability and, consequently, in the occurrence of a double band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p>

            <title>CAV1 Ubiquitination in the N-terminal Region Mediates Recruitment of VCP and UBXD1 to Endosomes</title>
            <p>We next investigated the impact of CAV1 ubiquitination in the N-terminal region on interaction with VCP and UBXD1. To do so, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with CAV1 variants from HEK293 cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). HEK293 cells were used to increase protein yield. We confirmed previous results that both VCP and UBXD1 specifically cosedimented with the CAV1 wild type but not with the lysine-less CAV1(K5â176R) variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Crucially, mutation of the N-terminal region in the K5â57R mutant was sufficient to largely reduce VCP and UBXD1 binding, whereas mutation of all other lysines in the construct CAV1(K65â176R) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>), consistent with CAV1(K65â176R) being ubiquitinated as well as the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>BâD</italic>). Next, we analyzed recruitment of VCP to CAV1 containing endosomes. We were previously unable to detect endogenous VCP or transiently overexpressed VCP on endosomes for technical reasons. We therefore generated stable U2OS cells that overexpressed myc-tagged VCP at low levels upon doxycycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). These cells were transfected with the four different CAV1 variants and induced to express VCP-myc for 1 day. Colocalization of VCP-myc with CAV1-positive vesicles was then determined by immunofluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis. VCP-myc localization to CAV1-positive vesicles was apparent in cells expressing the CAV1 wild type and detected with a median of more than 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). In contrast, transfection of the lysine-less variant CAV1(K5â176K) or the N-terminal lysine mutant CAV1(K5â57R), but not CAV1(K65â176R), significantly reduced localization of VCP to endosomes, as apparent in micrographs and detected by automated quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). Interestingly, localization of VCP to endosomes was not completely abolished under these conditions, suggesting the presence of additional factors that target VCP to endosomes. In a similar manner, we investigated colocalization of transiently overexpressed mCherry-tagged UBXD1 with the CAV1-containing variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>). We confirmed our previous results that UBXD1-mCherry colocalized with CAV1 wild-type but not the lysine-less CAV1(K5â176R) variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Crucially and consistently, however, we found that mutation of K5â57R but not K65â176R in CAV1 was sufficient to abolish recruitment of UBXD1-mCherry to CAV1-containing vesicles. These data suggest that ubiquitination of the N-terminal region of CAV1 mediates recruitment of VCP and UBXD1 to endosomes.</p>

            <title>Ubiquitinated CAV1 Accumulates in the Absence of VCP and UBXD1 Activity</title>
            <p>To address the role of VCP-UBXD1 after binding to ubiquitinated CAV1 in regulating its subsequent turnover, we monitored the ubiquitination status of CAV1 after inactivation of the VCP-UBXD1 complex in two ways. In the first approach, we used siRNA oligonucleotides to deplete VCP or UBXD1. To facilitate the approach, we generated stable U2OS cells that express CAV1-HA upon doxycycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). Cells were either left untreated or treated with control siRNA or siRNA targeting VCP or UBXD1 for a total of 2 days. Expression of CAV1-HA was induced in all cell populations 1 day prior to cell lysis. Western blot analysis of cell lysates confirmed specific and efficient depletion of VCP and UBXD1 in the respective samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>). As before, CAV1-HA and the slower-migrating bands representing ubiquitinated CAV1-HA were detectable in control lysates. Crucially, however, the CAV1 ubiquitination levels were strongly increased in VCP- and UBXD1-depleted cells. Also, the total level of unmodified CAV1 was increased in these samples, consistent with the role of VCP and UBXD1 in CAV1 turnover. To confirm this result, we applied a pharmacological approach with the VCP inhibitor DBeQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). As DBeQ is toxic because of caspase activation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), the treatment could only be extended to 4 h. Nevertheless, accumulation of ubiquitinated CAV1 was observed by Western blot analysis even during this short period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). We compared the effect on the ubiquitination status of CAV1 of these treatments with that of lysosome inhibition. Indeed, bafilomycin A1 or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment led, like VCP or UBXD1 inactivation, to accumulation of ubiquitinated CAV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>D</italic>). In contrast and as expected, proteasome inhibition with MG132 resulted in a general increase of cellular ubiquitin conjugates but left CAV1 ubiquitination unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>D</italic>). We confirmed that CAV1 accumulated in LAMP1-positive compartments upon bafilomycin A1 or DBeQ inhibition but not upon MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>E</italic>) and that these populations were ubiquitinated (data not shown). These data suggest that VCP-UBXD1 acts downstream of CAV1 ubiquitination and, subsequently, helps to clear the ubiquitinated CAV1 population in lysosomes.</p>

            <title>Ubiquitination of the N-terminal Region Is Essential for CAV1 Transport to Late Endosomes</title>
            <p>To test the role of CAV1 ubiquitination and the significance of the N-terminal lysine residues on subsequent transport to late endosomes, we devised automated image analysis to score how efficiently the different CAV1-HA variants reached late endosomes on the basis of colocalization with the late endosome and lysosome marker protein LAMP1. CAV1 wild-type or the three variants K5â57R, K65â176, or K5â176R were expressed in U2OS cells for 24 h. Cells were fixed and stained with HA- and LAMP1-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). CAV1 wild-type as well as the K65â176R variant that both contain the critical lysines in the N-terminal region colocalized frequently and to the same extent with LAMP1, indicating equally efficient transport to late endosomes. In contrast and expectedly, colocalization was reduced significantly for the lysine-less K5â176R variant. Crucially, however, mutation of the lysines in the N-terminal region (K5â57R) was sufficient to cause an equally significant reduction. These results demonstrate that ubiquitination of the N-terminal region of CAV1 is essential for efficient transport of CAV1 to late endosomal compartments.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Our results identify the acceptor site for monoubiquitination within the CAV1 protein at endosomes and thus allow detailed investigation of the functional role of this modification for interaction with the VCP-UBXD1 complex and sorting into late endosomes for subsequent turnover in lysosomes.</p>
      <p>We find that CAV1 is exclusively ubiquitinated in the N-terminal region. Among the six lysines within this region, ubiquitination appears promiscuous. Reintroduction of lysines into the lysine-less CAV1 variant showed that, in principle, ubiquitination can occur at any of the six lysines. Ubiquitination of Lys-57, however, is less efficient, probably because of the fact that this residue is at the border to the oligomerization domain. Our findings are consistent with two large-scale mass spectrometry approaches published during the course of our study, which together identify di-glycine profiles indicative for ubiquitin modification for all six lysines in the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In addition, one of the studies identified modification at residue Lys-176 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We did not find evidence for Lys-176 ubiquitination in Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence microscopy, as monoubiquitination was fully abolished already by the K5â57R mutations that leave Lys-176 intact. One explanation is, therefore, that Lys-176 is not used for monoubiquitination at the endosome but for modification with lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains during ER-associated degradation of misfolded species of CAV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), which cannot be discriminated by the mass spectrometry approach in that study. Interestingly, isopeptide bond formation between ubiquitin and CAV1 resulted in slightly different migration behavior in SDS gels depending on whether ubiquitin is conjugated to Lys-5, Lys-26, or Lys-30 or whether it is conjugated to Lys-39, Lys-47, or Lys-57. The observed double band for monoubiquitinated wild-type CAV1, therefore, indicates an approximate equal probability of ubiquitin conjugation to one or the other sequence segment within the N-terminal region. Interestingly, structure predictions indicate that the second segment comprising Lys-39â57 assumes an amphipathic Î± helix that is tightly associated with the membrane, whereas the first segment is purely hydrophilic and points into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Phosphorylation of tyrosine 14 in this region has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). However, we observed no effect of the phosphorylation-deficient Y14F mutation on ubiquitination levels (data not shown), suggesting that ubiquitination is not regulated by tyrosine 14 phosphorylation. The lysines in the N-terminal region of CAV1 are conserved in zebrafish, chicken, and mouse (data not shown). Moreover, the muscle-specific CAV3 variant that lacks much of the N-terminal region also contains lysine residues equivalent to Lys-47 and Lys-57 in CAV1 plus an additional lysine upstream. This is at least consistent with ubiquitin-mediated regulation being a general feature for caveolin proteins. Conversely, fusion of the CAV1 N-terminal region alone to GFP did not results in detectable monoubiquitination (data not shown), suggesting that this region is not sufficient to trigger ubiquitination and targeting to the endosomal system.</p>
      <p>The identification of the N-terminal region as the ubiquitin acceptor site has functional implications. Given that ubiquitination occurs outside of the oligomerization domain, it is unlikely that ubiquitination interferes with or even directly regulates formation of CAV1 oligomers or larger assemblies. Conversely, the fact that the N-terminal region is not directly involved in oligomerization and may remain accessible in CAV1 oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) suggests that CAV1 can be ubiquitinated while engaged in oligomers. This raises the possibility that oligomerized CAV1 can be targeted for lysosomal turnover through ubiquitination and that ubiquitination may recruit factors such as VCP that assist CAV1 trafficking, possibly by disassembly of caveolar assemblies or CAV1 oligomers.</p>
      <p>In fact, our data show that ubiquitination in the N-terminal region is essential for CAV1 interaction with VCP and UBXD1. More importantly, in this study we show for the first time that VCP, in addition to UBXD1, is recruited to CAV1-containing endosomes and that CAV1 ubiquitination in the N-terminal region constitutes the essential signal for this recruitment. Localization of VCP to endosomes was also reported elsewhere, and it was speculated that this is mediated by ubiquitinated early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). This suggests that ubiquitination of other endosomal proteins can also mediate recruitment of VCP, which would explain the remaining VCP on endosomes in the absence of CAV1 ubiquitination. Besides binding monoubiquitinated CAV1, we provide further evidence that the VCP-UBXD1 complex, in fact, actively controls the turnover of the ubiquitinated form of CAV1. This notion is on the basis of the observation that inactivation of the VCP-UBXD1 complex by siRNA-mediated depletion or pharmacological inhibition of VCP leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated CAV1. This demonstrates that VCP-UBXD1 acts after CAV1 ubiquitination and then allows targeting to downstream steps, presumably by virtue of its protein segregation activity. This order of events is well established for polyubiquitinated substrates of the VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex, for example during ER-associated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). It therefore seems to be a general principle that VCP binds ubiquitinated proteins and directs them for degradation, albeit by different mechanisms and with distinct cofactors. In the case of polyubiquitinated proteins VCP directs them to the proteasome, while in the case of mono- or oligoubiquitinated endosomal proteins it directs them to the lysosome.</p>
      <p>So far it is unclear what exactly the molecular function of VCP is that facilitates endosomal sorting of CAV1. One possibility is that VCP and UBXD1 are recruited to CAV1 to disassemble CAV1 oligomers or larger caveolar assemblies. Protein complex disassembly has been proposed in many cases for VCP/p97 and its homologue Cdc48, including topologically similar remodeling of SNARE (soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment receptor) complexes or segregation of Spt23 dimers in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Here we show that ubiquitination in the N-terminal region of CAV1 is at least compatible with ubiquitination of CAV1 oligomers and therefore consistent with the notion that CAV1 complexes are also disassembled. Given that CAV1 assemblies are believed to induce membrane curvature toward the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), CAV1 oligomer disassembly may indeed be required for sorting of CAV1 into intraluminal vesicles whose formation involve curvature in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Another possibility is that VCP is recruited to CAV1 to modulate the endosomal sorting machinery to release CAV1 or other cargo from the extensive network of protein-protein interactions among these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Further work is required to address this question.</p>
