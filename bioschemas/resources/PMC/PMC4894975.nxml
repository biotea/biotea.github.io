        <p>The V-ATPase is the main regulator of intra-organellar acidification. Assembly of this complex has extensively been studied in yeast, while limited knowledge exists for man. We identified 11 male patients with hemizygous missense mutations in <italic>ATP6AP1</italic>, encoding accessory protein Ac45 of the V-ATPase. Homology detection at the level of sequence profiles indicated Ac45 as the long-sought human homologue of yeast V-ATPase assembly factor Voa1. Processed wild-type Ac45, but not its disease mutants, restored V-ATPase-dependent growth in Voa1 mutant yeast. Patients display an immunodeficiency phenotype associated with hypogammaglobulinemia, hepatopathy and a spectrum of neurocognitive abnormalities. Ac45 in human brain is present as the common, processed â¼40-kDa form, while liver shows a 62-kDa intact protein, and B-cells a 50-kDa isoform. Our work unmasks Ac45 as the functional ortholog of yeast V-ATPase assembly factor Voa1 and reveals a novel link of tissue-specific V-ATPase assembly with immunoglobulin production and cognitive function.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a ubiquitously expressed protein complex, required for luminal acidification of secretory vesicles to acidify the extracellular milieu, compartments of the endocytic pathway including lysosomes, and of the Golgi apparatus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The V-ATPase consists of two multi-protein domains, V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>0</sub>. The peripheral V<sub>1</sub> domain comprises eight subunits (AâH), is localized in the cytoplasm and hydrolyses ATP. The V<sub>0</sub> domain is embedded in the organelle membrane, consists of five subunits (a, d, e, c and câ³) and harbours the rotary mechanism for proton translocation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Human disease mutations in V-ATPase core subunits result in distinct clinical syndromes. In 1999, renal tubular acidosis with deafness was the first phenotype linked to the V-ATPase with mutations in the kidney-specific isoforms <italic>ATP6V1B1</italic> (MIM 267300) or <italic>ATP6V0A4</italic> (MIM 602722) (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In 2000, osteopetrosis (MIM 259700) was linked to the V-ATPase by identification of mutations in <italic>TCIRG1</italic>, encoding the osteoclast-specific a3 subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In 2008, mutations were found in <italic>ATP6V0A2</italic> in a subgroup of cutis laxa syndromes with abnormal protein glycosylation, autosomal recessive cutis laxa type II (MIM 219200&amp;278250). <italic>ATP6V0A2</italic> encodes the a2 subunit, which localizes the V-ATPase complex to the Golgi apparatus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
    <p>In addition to the core V-ATPase subunits, two accessory proteins are known in vertebrates, that is, ATP6AP1 (also known as Ac45) and ATP6AP2 (also known as (Pro-) renin receptor)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In vertebrates, Ac45 is ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in neuronal and (neuro-) endocrine cells and osteoclasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. This accessory subunit of the proton pump guides the V-ATPase into specialized subcellular compartments such as neuroendocrine regulated secretory vesicles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> or the ruffled border of the osteoclast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> thereby regulating its activity. Moreover, the Ac45 protein is involved in membrane trafficking and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane fusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. V-ATPase assembly has been extensively studied in yeast, where Vma21, Vma12 and Vma22 cooperate in the assembly of the V<sub>0</sub> domain in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Additionally, yeast Voa1 has been established as an ER-localized V<sub>0</sub>-assembly factor in 2008. However, no human orthologue has been identified so far<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In human, V-ATPase assembly is hardly studied, and no yeast orthologue of human Ac45 has thus far been identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p>
    <p>In this study, we describe a novel ATP6AP1-linked immunodeficiency and identified disease mutations in <italic>ATP6AP1</italic> in 11 male patients with abnormal protein glycosylation. Yeast V-ATPase assembly factor Voa1 was predicted to be homologous to Ac45, which was confirmed by functional complementation of Voa1 mutant yeast with the processed C-terminal domain of Ac45. Identification of different Ac45 protein isoforms in human brain, liver and B cells indicated the presence of tissue-specific regulation of organelle acidification.</p>

        <title>Identification of mutations in X-linked <italic>ATP6AP1</italic></title>
        <p>In our cohort of unsolved patients with deficient glycosylation of proteins, we performed exome sequencing to identify the causative gene defect. Exome sequencing of a male patient (individual 1.1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) was performed as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. After filtering out poor-quality variants as well as common and synonymous variants (see Methods section), 131 rare missense variants were selected. Based on a recessive inheritance model, two candidate genes remained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>): X-linked <italic>ATP6AP1</italic> with hemizygous variant and <italic>KPRP</italic> on Chr1 with compound heterozygous variants. Of these variants, the c.1284G&gt;A variant in <italic>ATP6AP1</italic> on chrXq28 showed the highest level of conservation (PhyloP 46-way, 5.1) and was predicted to be pathogenic by Sift, Polyphen-2 and MutationTaster. Moreover, no potentially pathogenic variants were identified in <italic>KPRP</italic> in the WES data of patients 2.1 and 6.1. <italic>ATP6AP1</italic> encodes the accessory subunit Ac45 of the V-ATPase complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, the proton pump that has been linked with abnormal glycan processing in the Golgi via mutations in its core subunit <italic>ATP6V0A2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Sanger sequencing confirmed the hemizygous missense mutation (c.1284G&gt;A, p.M428I) in the patient as well as in two affected male family members that became known during the sequencing process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). All maternal alleles showed heterozygosity and healthy males were hemizygous wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>), confirming complete segregation of the c.1284G&gt;A mutation with disease in agreement with X-linked inheritance. Exome and Sanger sequencing of <italic>ATP6AP1</italic> in a cohort of unsolved male patients with abnormal protein glycosylation revealed additional mutations in eight patients from five families (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). Patient 2.1 showed a c.431T&gt;C (p.L144P) missense mutation, heterozygous in the mother and absent from the father and a healthy sister. An additional hemizygous missense mutation (c.1036G&gt;A, p.E346K) was identified by Sanger sequencing in three non-related male sib pairs (families 3â5). Fathers carried wild-type alleles and mothers were heterozygous for the c.1036G&gt;A variant, in agreement with X-linked inheritance. Exome sequencing of patient 6.1 revealed a c. 938A&gt;G (p.Y313C) missense mutation.</p>
        <p>All four missense mutations (L144P, Y313C, E346K and M428I) affect amino acids that are highly conserved down to fruitfly, tetraodon and frog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>). Ac45 homologues in more distantly related species could not readily be retrieved by use of standard BLAST searches. L144P is located in the N-terminal domain, while Y313C, E346K and M428I are located in the processed C-terminal domain of Ac45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Clinical phenotype of Ac45 deficiency</title>
        <p>The dominating clinical symptoms displayed by the present cohort of patients with various <italic>ATP6AP1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) include hepatopathy and immune abnormalities. Recurrent bacterial infections were associated with hypogammaglobulinemia, ranging from plantar abscesses and gastrointestinal infections in family 1 to multiple episodes of childhood pneumonia and purulent otitis media in families 2â6. Several patients were successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. Of note, some of the patients responded very poorly to childhood vaccinations. Hepatopathy ranged from mild hypertransaminasemia to cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure. In addition, gastric problems were noted in the majority of patients and laboratory abnormalities included leukopenia, slightly elevated serum transaminases, low serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and high alkaline phosphatase. The two brothers from family 4 displayed high-normal levels of IgD+/CD27â naÃ¯ve B cells and lowered levels of IgD+/CD27+ intermediate and switched memory B cells, suggesting a problem in B-cell differentiation.</p>
        <p>Patients with the p.E346K substitution (families 3â5) showed in addition splenomegaly, abnormal hepatic histology and neurological symptoms such as epilepsy, mild intellectual disability and behaviour abnormalities. Muscle weakness with mildly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) was demonstrated in a few patients, including patient 6.1. Of note, the presence of the p.E346K mutation predicted a more severe phenotype within the ATP6AP1 disease spectrum, which is in accordance with the early death of two patients (3.2 and 5.1) due to liver failure. Patients from families 1, 2 and 6 display a milder disease course and are currently doing well without cognitive impairment.</p>
        <p>The index family (substitution p.M428I) presented with a milder disease course (oldest patient 34 years of age). All three patients in this kindred presented with sensorineural hearing loss to various extents and hyperopia. The grandmother also presented deafness at older age. The vision abnormality was documented also in patients 3.1 and 4.1 (E346K substitution). Female carriers did not show any obvious clinical symptoms. In the total cohort of patients, only minor clinical symptoms were observed that overlap with symptoms from known genetic defects in the V-ATPase, including deafness (<italic>ATP6V1B1</italic> and <italic>ATP6V0A4</italic>) and muscle weakness, as reported for X-linked Myopathy with Excessive Autophagy (XMEA, MIM 310440) due to mutations in V-ATPase assembly factor <italic>VMA21</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). When performed, radiography showed no signs of osteopetrosis as observed in ATP6V0A3 deficiency. There was no apparent renal phenotype with no signs of metabolic acidosis. Hypokalemia was reported for patients 3.1 and 5.1. In general, no signs for renal tubulopathy as observed in ATP6V0A4 deficiency were seen.</p>

        <title>Liver biopsy findings</title>
        <p>Liver biopsy was performed in six patients and was (near)-normal for patients 1.3 and 2 (with the substitutions p.M428I and p.L144P, respectively), but revealed steatosis, fibrosis and even micronodular cirrhosis in patients with the p.E346K mutation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Electron microscopy was performed in a liver tissue specimen of patient 3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Hepatocytes showed variable translucency due to the presence of noticeable proliferating smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and of numerous alpha-glycogen monoparticles, accumulated within the cell centre. At the periphery, mitochondria were disposed along the plasma membrane (in a mode similar to that observed in glycogen storage diseases). Mitochondria were of usual size but frequently showed cristolysis and occasional absence of cristae. The dense-matrical bodies were preserved. No intra-mitochondrial crystals were noticed. Within hepatocytes, fat globules with the typical shape and size of triglycerides were seen, in variable amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Their sizes varied from small (1.5â6.0ânm) to medium (8.0â20ânm) and rarely large (21â40ânm). Lysosomes (single limit membrane) were identified as typical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, arrows) and atypical lipofuscin bodies. The latter showed a central electron-lucent accumulation with a reticular network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, arrows). Mitochondria were seen occasionally within phagosomes (autophagocytosis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, arrow). No dilated or enlarged Golgi apparatus was detected in hepatocytes.</p>

        <title>Ac45 deficiency alters Golgi processing of protein glycans</title>
        <p>Analysis of protein <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation in serum showed abnormal profiles of transferrin in all studied patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). In addition, mucin type <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation of serum apolipoprotein CIII was abnormal in most patients, showing decreased sialylation. This combination of abnormal profiles is comparable with other defects of Golgi homoeostasis, such as ATP6V0A2-CDG (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In patients 3.2 and 5.1 normal mucin type <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation was observed with even increased sialylation in patient 5.1. This might complicate recognition of Ac45-deficient patients as a genetically determined glycosylation disorder, since highly similar profiles are observed in patients with non-specific liver disease. Considerable variation in glycosylation abnormalities was observed in some of the patients tested (3.1 and 3.2). Mass spectrometry of total serum <italic>N</italic>-glycans revealed minor accumulations of truncated glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) and no overlapping glycan signature could be regarded as specific for Ac45 deficiency. Mass spectrometric analysis of isolated transferrin revealed a clear accumulation of similar types of truncated glycans lacking galactose and sialic acid in all patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Differential processing of Ac45 in liver, brain and B cells</title>
        <p>We studied <italic>ATP6AP1</italic> expression in human fetal and adult tissues. Both in fetal (data not shown) and adult tissues, the highest Ac45 mRNA expression was found in brain and the lowest expression level in liver and duodenum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). To study Ac45 expression at the protein level, we performed western blot analysis of mouse cortex, human brain and liver, and human B cells using an Ac45 antibody directed to the C-terminal half of mouse Ac45. Ac45 is synthesized as a 62-kDa precursor protein (intact-Ac45) that in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells is subsequently processed to its â¼40-kDa cleaved form (cleaved-Ac45 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In mouse and human brain, most Ac45 protein was present in its cleaved â¼40âkDa form, with human Ac45 migrating slightly faster than its mouse counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, lanes 1 and 3). Furthermore, and in-line with earlier studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> neuroendocrine cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, these proteins were <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated as shown by their sensitivity towards endoglycosidase PNGaseF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, lanes 2 and 4). These results are in agreement with the slightly lower molecular mass of human Ac45 as compared with mouse Ac45 and the presence of one extra <italic>N</italic>-glycan on mouse Ac45. In addition, in human brain a thus far unknown 50-kDa form was observed. In human and mouse liver, considerable Ac45 protein expression was observed, predominantly as the 62-kDa intact proteoform. Under the conditions used, this band was insensitive to PNGaseF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). Western blot analysis of primary B-cell isolates as well as B-cell lines (data not shown) revealed Ac45 as an â¼50-kDa protein isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Analysis of Ac45 protein expression in patient liver biopsy material revealed a strong reduction in the expression of the â¼62- and â¼40-kDa Ac45 variants and an additional â¼50-kDa protein was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>
        <p>Subsequently, we performed newly synthesized protein labelling with <sup>35</sup>S methionine in immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH), after transfection with GFP (mock) and wild-type human Ac45 complementary DNA. Immunoprecipitation with the Ac45 antibody revealed a dominant â¼62-kDa newly synthesized endogenous as well as exogenous Ac45 form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). Tunicamycin treatment of the IHH cells as well as PNGaseF digestion after labelling and immunoprecipitation revealed an â¼50-kDa Ac45 form, confirming <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation of the 62-kDa Ac45 isoform. In addition, EndoH sensitivity indicates the presence of high mannose glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Transfection of IHH cells with clinically relevant mutant Ac45 constructs showed similar expression as wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>The subcellular localization of Ac45 in hepatocytes was studied by immunostaining of IHH cells. Ac45 was found to be mainly localized to the ER, and ER-to-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC), but not to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) or components of the endosomal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Human Ac45 is orthologous to yeast Voa1 and Big1</title>
        <p>Orthologs of Ac45 were readily identified by BLAST among the metazoa, including nematodes like <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, but not outside of that taxon, leading to speculations about a role of Ac45 in specialized and complex vacuolar systems in multicellular organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Nevertheless, the degree of sequence identity between vertebrate and invertebrate members of the protein family is relatively low, suggesting a high rate of sequence evolution as an alternative explanation for the inability to detect non-metazoan homologues. Using orthology prediction at the level of sequence profiles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, we detected two <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ac45 homologues: Voa1 and Big1. Voa1's C-terminal transmembrane helix is significantly similar to the C terminus of Ac45 (<italic>E</italic>=9.1eâ5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), while the sequence similarity of Ac45 to Big1 (<italic>E</italic>=3.6eâ10) is mainly restricted to the N-terminal â¼250 amino-acid residues of Ac45 and therewith coincides with the part of Ac45 that is proteolytically cleaved by furin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. No significant sequence similarity could be detected in the dotted lines, or for the comparison of the C-terminal helix of Big1 with Ac45. Both proteins are located in the ER membrane, where Voa1 has been implicated in assembly of the V<sub>0</sub> domain of the V-ATPase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> while Big1 is essential for beta 1,6 glucan synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Phylogenetic analysis shows that <italic>BIG1</italic> and <italic>VOA1</italic> appear the result of a gene duplication in the Saccharomycotina phylum of the Fungi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7B</xref>), indicating that both are orthologous to Ac45. Interestingly, the evolutionarily conserved residues between Voa1 and Ac45 are at a distance of 3â4 amino acids from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) and concentrate on one side of the predicted transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>), potentially forming a conserved interaction interface. Using iterative profile-based homology searches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, we confirmed the homology between the Ac45 and Voa1, Big1, and also detected homologues of Ac45 in major taxa of the eukaryotes, amoebozoa (<italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>), brown algae (<italic>Ectocarpus siliculosis</italic>) and plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7C</xref>). Ac45 orthologs in the model species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (AT3G13410) and <italic>Schizosacharomyces pombe</italic> (<italic>S. pombe</italic>) (SPCC306.06c) have, like Ac45, Voa1 and Big1, been observed in the ER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, indicating that the evolutionary origin of Ac45 lies at the root of the eukaryotes.</p>

        <title>Processed Ac45 functions in place of Voa1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title>
        <p>In yeast, Vma21 and Voa1 are assembly factors of the V-ATPase V<sub>0</sub> domain in the ER membrane. Both are retained in the ER via a C-terminal dilysine motif. When this motif is mutated to diglutamine, the resulting Vma21QQ or Voa1QQ protein is mislocalized to the vacuole with concomitant reduction in V-ATPase assembly and activity. The effect on V-ATPase assembly is cumulative, becoming most apparent when Voa1 is absent (<italic>voa1::H</italic>) or Voa1QQ is expressed in <italic>vma21QQ</italic> cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
        <p>Yeast lacking functional V-ATPase have a characteristic growth phenotype: they are unable to grow on medium buffered to pH 7.5, or medium containing elevated levels of calcium, or a combination of the two stressors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Reduced V-ATPase function can be detected by reduced growth under any of these conditions. A growth assay on rich medium supplemented with 100âmM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was used to assess the ability of human Ac45 to substitute for Voa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). Full-length or processed Ac45 proteins with or without a dilysine motif (KKNN) appended to the C terminus were expressed in a <italic>voa1::H vma21QQ</italic> strain. Cells expressing full-length Ac45 grew poorly, comparable to cells transformed with empty vector or cells expressing Voa1QQ. Adding a dilysine motif to full-length Ac45 did not significantly improve growth. Conceivably, Ac45 function is dependent on proper processing of the protein, which might not be accomplished in yeast. Therefore, simulating a processed Ac45 protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, the C-terminal half of Ac45 was expressed. This processed Ac45 was able to function in place of Voa1, but only when expressed with a dilysine motif (cleaved-Ac45-KKNN in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). By complementation, cleaved-Ac45-KKNN function is comparable to that of Voa1.</p>
        <p>Growth assays were used next to measure the effect of three pathogenic Ac45 substitutions, Y313C, E436K or M428I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, left panels). The mutations were introduced into cleaved-Ac45-KKNN and expressed in <italic>voa1::H vma21QQ</italic> yeast. Growth was tested on rich medium supplemented with 60âmM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and buffered to pH 7.5. Cells expressing Y313C or E346K mutant protein showed a growth defect, with the E346K mutant most severely compromised, exhibiting reduced growth nearing that of yeast having no Voa1. The effect of the M428I substitution was less disruptive and appeared indistinguishable from non-mutated Ac45. To ascertain that the growth defect observed for the Y313C or E346K substitution was not the result of protein instability, membrane proteins from the cells used in the growth assay were examined by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, right panel). While Ac45 protein levels were lower than Voa1, levels for mutated Ac45 proteins were unchanged compared with non-mutated Ac45 protein. Therefore, reduced V-ATPase function observed for the Y313C or E346K mutation cannot be ascribed to decreased protein abundance.</p>
        <p>Since both Voa1 and processed Ac45 require a dilysine motif for function, it is expected that, like Voa1, processed Ac45-KKNN is retained in the ER membrane, while absence of the motif would result in mislocalization to the vacuole. This was tested using GFP-tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Though GFP-tagging slightly reduced fitness of processed Ac45-KKNN on restrictive medium (data not shown), dilysine-dependent ER localization was verified. Together with growth assay results, these results indicate that the human and yeast proteins function about equally well in V<sub>0</sub> V-ATPase assembly in the ER.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Much has been learned about V-ATPase function and assembly by studies in yeast, however, studies in human have been very limited. The clinical symptoms resulting from Ac45 deficiency, mostly affecting the liver, immune system and brain, significantly differ from other known human genetic defects in various V-ATPase subunits. Disease mutations in subunits of the V<sub>0</sub> domain result in, respectively, renal tubular acidosis with deafness (<italic>ATP6V0A4</italic> (MIM 602722) (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>)), osteopetrosis (<italic>TCIRG1</italic> or <italic>ATP6V0A3</italic> (MIM 259700) (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>)) and cutis laxa with abnormal glycosylation (<italic>ATP6V0A2</italic> (MIM 219200&amp;278250) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>)). One subunit of the V<sub>1</sub> domain is linked to human genetic disease (<italic>ATP6V1B1</italic> (MIM 267300)) resulting in renal tubular acidosis with deafness, while previously one of the V-ATPase assembly factors, VMA21, has been linked to XMEA (X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (MIM 310440) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>)). Very recently, mutations in <italic>CCDC115</italic> and <italic>TMEM199</italic>, as predicted orthologs of yeast V-ATPase assembly factors Vma22p and Vma12p, respectively, were identified in patients with liver disease, elevated alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol, mild abnormalities in copper metabolism and various degrees of cognitive impairment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. No immune dysfunction was noticed.</p>
      <p>The combination of clinical symptoms as observed in Ac45-deficient patients is currently poorly understood since research on the functional roles of Ac45 has mainly been focused on neuroendocrine cells and osteoclasts. Certain specific symptoms could be related to other V-ATPase defects or known roles of the V-ATPase complex. These include deafness as reported in family 1, and also reported for ATP6V0A4 and ATP6V1B1 defects. In addition, electron microscopy of a liver biopsy of patient 3.1 suggested evidence for enhanced mitochondrial autophagy and muscle weakness with mildly elevated creatine kinase was found in some patients. This could suggest a partially overlapping disease mechanism with VMA21-deficient XMEA patients. Finally, in two of the patients, decreased enamelization of the teeth was reported, which could correspond with a recently reported role of V-ATPase-mediated acidification in enamelization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Thus, likely at least some of the symptoms are related to V-ATPase dysfunction, which is supported by our studies on V-ATPase restricting growth conditions in yeast.</p>
      <p>Immune and liver dysfunction have not yet been reported in genetic defects of the V-ATPase, although liver disease was recently described for defects in V-ATPase assembly factors TMEM199 and CCDC115 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). The question is why these systems are affected. Possible explanations could include the tissue-specific processing of Ac45 or the existence of additional functions of Ac45 beyond pH regulation via its effect on the V-ATPase. Our studies in human hepatocytes show that Ac45, in contrast to what was observed in neuroendocrine cells, mostly localizes to the early secretory pathway. This is in agreement with the presence of mostly intact-Ac45 carrying non-processed high-mannose glycans. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms driving differential Ac45 glycosylation and processing in brain, liver and immune cells, since tissue-specific forms of Ac45 could suggest a possible mechanism for the tissue-restricted disease symptoms in Ac45-deficient patients.</p>
      <p>Thus far, the relationship of Ac45 with immune deficiency has remained unnoticed. In view of the reported multiple functions of Ac45 in, for example, pH regulation and membrane trafficking and fusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, many possible links exist. Acidification of phagolysosomes in, for example, macrophages is important for killing of internalized microorganisms, while antigen processing is also dependent on acidic pH. Our growth assay in yeast under conditions that are dependent on V-ATPase activity support the notion that the patients' phenotypes could be related to aberrant acidification due to dysfunction of the V-ATPase. Membrane trafficking and fusion events have not only been linked to V-ATPase function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> but also to Ac45 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). These events are reported to be required for B-cell differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, antigen processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> and antibody production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Thus, pathogenic mutations in <italic>ATP6AP1</italic> might affect B-cell function at all these levels, resulting in decreased levels of immunoglobulins and recurrent infections in our patients. The observed hypoglycosylation on serum transferrin in our patients might indicate hypoglycosylation on other proteins as well. Several membrane-bound proteins such as CD19 and CD40 that are involved in B-cell activation are glycosylated, and antigen recognition and antibody production by B cells require fucosylated IgG-BCR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. A glycosylation defect therefore may affect B-cell activation and thus antibody production. To find out which processes, that is, glycosylation, vesicular trafficking and fusion, or pH regulation are mainly affecting antibody production by a defective accessory subunit of the V-ATPase, further studies are required.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have described an important role for Ac45 in intraorganellar pH regulation and membrane trafficking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Identification of processed Ac45 as the functional ortholog of yeast V-ATPase assembly factor Voa1 only when the KKNN ER retention signal is present, indicates the importance of ER localization for its function in yeast, and provides a valuable model to further dissect the different functions and functional domains of Ac45. As the human ortholog lacks this dilysine motif, other mechanisms might account for retention of Ac45 to the ER of specific cell types such as liver cells. Our observation in liver cells that the Ac45 protein is mostly present in its unprocessed form, which in neuroendocrine cells appears to implicate ER localization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, combined with its observed steady-state localization in the early secretory pathway (ER, ERGIC) in hepatocytes, suggests that differential proteolytic processing might represent such a mechanism.</p>
      <p>In summary, the identification of tissue-specific proteolytic processing of Ac45, and the availability of Voa1 mutant yeast as valuable model to further dissect the individual functions of Ac45 will facilitate future research to understand the functional roles and isoforms of Ac45 in the immune system, liver, muscle and brain and its relation to the V-ATPase in human. Screening for abnormal protein glycosylation in plasma of patients with hepatopathy and immune dysfunction with or without neurological symptoms provides a rapid way to identify additional individuals with ATP6AP1 deficiency.</p>

Thus pMR1210 encodes full-length Ac45-KKNN. KKNN was deleted from the C-terminal end of Ac45 in pMR1210, giving pMR1211. The N-terminal half of Ac45 (Q43-V250) was deleted in pMR1210 and pMR1211, resulting in pMR1213 and pMR1214, respectively. Primers designed to produce mutation Y313C, E346K or M428I and pMR1213 template were used to make pMR1213Y313C, pMR1213E346K or pMR1213M428I. pMR092 was made by inserting mGFP5(S65T)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref> into pMR072 between the HA tag and Voa1 S26 using PCR techniques. Inverse PCR with primers encoding K262Q and K263Q mutations and pMR092 template produced pMR1312. pMR1303 and pMR1304 were made from pMR1213 and pMR1214, respectively, by inserting GFP immediately after the HA tag. E346K and M428I mutations were made in pMR1303, resulting in pMR1303E346K and pMR1303M428I, respectively. Coding sequence region in all plasmid constructs was verified by DNA sequencing.</p>

        <title>Yeast growth assay</title>
        <p>Liquid cultures of yeast strains were grown overnight at 30âÂ°C in synthetic minimal medium plus dextrose (SD) supplemented to select for plasmid (-Ura), diluted to 0.4 OD<sub>600</sub> per ml in rich medium (YEPD) buffered to pH 5 with 50âmM succinate/phosphate, and grown until densities reached 1 OD per ml. Cells were pelleted and suspended to 0.8 OD per ml in H<sub>2</sub>O. This suspension and serial 1:8 dilutions were spotted onto YEPD pH 5 and restrictive medium (100âmM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in pH-unadjusted YEPD, or 60âmM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in YEPD buffered to pH 7.5 with 50âmM HEPES).

        <p>Yeast membrane proteins were prepared from glass-bead lysates by centrifugation at 13,000<italic>g</italic> as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The pelleted membrane fraction was solubilized in sample buffer (8âM urea, 5% SDS, 40âmM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 5% Î²-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromophenol blue) to 100 OD<sub>600</sub> equivalents per ml, and 0.5 OD equivalents separated by SDSâPAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and analysed by western blot using a 1:300 dilution of monoclonal anti-HA primary antibody (BioLegend) and a 1:15,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse secondary antibody labelled with IRDye 800CW (LI-COR). Blocking of non-specific binding and incubation with antibody was done in 5% non-fat dry milk, 0.1% TWEEN 20, 0.5âM NaCl, 20âmM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. Wash steps after antibody incubation were in the same buffer but without milk.

        <title>Identification of Voa1 as the yeast ortholog of human Ac45.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview of the regions of Ac45 that are homologous to the yeast proteins Voa1 and Big1 and an alignment of Ac45's and Voa1's C-terminal transmembrane helices (in blue, based on TMHMM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>) and their flanking amino acids. Ac45 and Voa1 are separated by a sequence logo representation of this region among all the homologs that could be detected using JACKHMMER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. A pattern in which the level of sequence conservation in the transmembrane helix peaks every 3â4 amino acids is indicated with arrows. (<bold>b</bold>) Schematic of Voa1 and Ac45 proteins expressed from centromere plasmids in <italic>voa1::H vma21QQ</italic> yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Ac45 proteins are either full length (intact-Ac45) or processed (cleaved-Ac45), with (shown) or without KKNN appended to the natural C terminus. Numbers indicate amino-acid residues. Residues mutated in Ac45 are shown. (<bold>c</bold>) Cleaved-Ac45 can substitute for Voa1 when a C-terminal dilysine motif is present. The <italic>voa1::H vma21QQ</italic> strain was transformed with plasmids coding for the indicated proteins (HA-tagged, diagrammed in (<bold>b</bold>)), Voa1QQ denotes Voa1 with K262Q and K263Q mutations. (<bold>d</bold>) The Y313C or E346K mutation in cleaved-Ac45-KKNN reduces V-ATPase function while protein levels are unaffected. Serial dilution growth test of <italic>voa1::H vma21QQ</italic> yeast expressing the indicated proteins tagged with HA. Restrictive growth is on rich medium adjusted to pH 7.5 and supplemented with 60âmM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Membrane proteins prepared from the same cultures used in the growth test were analysed by western blot using anti-HA antibody to detect Voa1, cleaved-Ac45-KKNN and its mutant forms (band locations marked on the right, molecular mass (kDa) is indicated on the left. (<bold>e</bold>) Voa1 and cleaved-Ac45 require a C-terminal dilysine motif for ER localization. Fluorescent microscopy of live yeast cells showing DAPI stained DNA, GFP, the merged image of both, and cells viewed by differential interference contrast (DIC) to locate the vacuole as apparent indentation. The indicated proteins are N-terminally tagged with HA-GFP and expressed in <italic>voa1::H vma21QQ</italic> yeast cells. Exposure times for GFP images of cleaved-Ac45 were 10 Ã longer than for Voa1 or Voa1QQ. Perinuclear GFP fluorescence indicates ER localization. Mutated and non-mutated cleaved-Ac45-KKNN show the same localization. See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>.</p>
