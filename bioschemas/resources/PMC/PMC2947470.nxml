        <p>ZFP36L1 negatively regulates erythroid differentiation of human hematopoietic progenitors by directly binding the 3â² UTR of Stat5b mRNA, thereby triggering its degradation.

      <abstract>
        <p>ZFP36L1 is a member of a family of CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins (TTP family) able to bind to AU-rich elements in the 3â²-untranslated region of mRNAs, thereby triggering their degradation. The present study suggests that such mechanism is used during hematopoiesis to regulate differentiation by posttranscriptionally modulating the expression of specific target genes. In particular, it demonstrates that ZFP36L1 negatively regulates erythroid differentiation by directly binding the 3â² untranslated region of Stat5b encoding mRNA. Stat5b down-regulation obtained by ZFP36L1 overexpression results, in human hematopoietic progenitors, in a drastic decrease of erythroid colonies formation. These observations have been confirmed by silencing experiments targeting Stat5b and by treating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with drugs able to induce ZFP36L1 expression. Moreover, this study shows that different members of ZFP36L1 family act redundantly, because cooverexpression of ZFP36L1 and family member ZFP36 determines a cumulative effect on Stat5b down-regulation. This work describes a mechanism underlying ZFP36L1 capability to regulate hematopoietic differentiation and suggests a new target for the therapy of hematopoietic diseases involving Stat5b/JAK2 pathway, such as chronic myeloproliferative disorders.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The TTP family of tandem zinc finger proteins includes TTP/ZFP36, TIS11b/ZFP36L1, and TIS11d/ZFP36L2, all of which have been shown to directly bind AU-rich elements (ARE) and promote degradation of the host transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Carballo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Ogilvie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Their central RNA-binding domain interacts with AU-rich elements (UUAUUUAUU), whereas the N- and C-terminal domains recruit enzymes involved in the mRNA degradation pathway. Expression of all TTP family genes can be induced by phorbol esters (TPA) and various other mitogenic stimuli, such as growth factors, in a broad variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Gomperts <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Corps and Brown, 1995</xref>). For ZFP36 and in part also for other members, binding to and destabilization of TNF-Î±, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and Vegf mRNAs has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Carballo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Lai <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Ciais <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, ZFP36 is a transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Murata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2002</xref>) and mitogens induce its rapid nuclear to cytosolic translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Recent publications suggest that TTP family proteins are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), might be targets of the p38 MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Carballo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Mahtani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), and might be involved in the regulation of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Johnson and Blackwell, 2002</xref>). Finally, TTP family members have recently been involved in cell differentiation and cancer. In particular, ZFP36 has been indicated as a critical regulator of dendritic cells maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Emmons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), and it has been demonstrated that targeted disruption of ZFP36L2 results in defective hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Stumpo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and that ZFP36 is suppressed in many cancers, altering tumorigenic phenotypes and patient prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Brennan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The Stat5/JAK2 pathway is widely studied. Its aberrant activation is involved in several diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Benekli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Choudhary <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Kotecha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Wagner and Rui, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Funakoshi-Tago <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and particularly its constitutive activation dependent on JAK2 V617F mutation underlies chronic myeloproliferative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kralovics <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Heller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Guglielmelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Levine and Gilliland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Grimwade <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Conversely, the same pathway is also involved in the control of normal hematopoiesis, because it plays a fundamental role during erythroid maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Grebien <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Olthof <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The Stat5a and Stat5b genes belong to the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) family of transcription factors. The family of Stat genes is believed to originate from successive genome duplication and functional divergence of a single ancestral Stat gene early in vertebrate evolution. A recent duplication of Stat5 is believed to have given rise to the closely related Stat5a and Stat5b homologous genes that encode proteins that in humans are â¼91% identical, the main difference between the two proteins residing in a five-amino acid insertion at the COOH-terminus of Stat5b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Crispi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Stat5a and Stat5b exert redundant yet distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Basham <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) both in physiological and pathological conditions; for instance Stat5b and not Stat5a is responsible for inducing an increase of cell motility and invasiveness in hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The common aspects and the differences between Stat5a and Stat5b's behavior depend on multiple factors such as differences in mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Ambrosio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), activation by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Moucadel and Constantinescu, 2005</xref>), or as we point out in the present work, a different pattern of tissue specific expression.</p><p>The present study has its starting point in the analysis of a gene expression profile of human hematopoietic cell populations (data not shown) that consistently shows that ZFP36L1 expression is substantially low in erythroid progenitors compared with the other hematopoietic cell types. On these premises, the role of ZFP36L1 was evaluated by ectopic expression and gene silencing experiments in human hematopoietic cord bloodâderived CD34+ stem/progenitor cells and on the erythroleukemia cell line carrying the JAK2 V617F mutation, Hel. Such experiments confirmed that ZFP36L1 expression negatively regulates erythroid maturation, and the results were further validated by monitoring the effect of cinnamon-derived polyphenols, a drug able to induce the expression of TTP gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Schoene <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Cao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), on the same cell populations. To investigate the mechanisms underlying such biological behavior, we hypothesized that ZFP36L1 might interfere with Stat5/JAK2 pathway, whose activity is pivotal for erythroid differentiation and survival. We demonstrated that ZFP36L1 and also ZFP36 are able to directly bind the 3â²-untranslated region of Stat5b mRNA, thereby triggering its degradation. As confirmed by gene silencing experiments targeting Stat5b, its down-regulation is sufficient to inhibit the formation of erythroid precursors from CD34+ human stem/progenitor cells. Moreover, the current study demonstrates that at least two members of the TTP family, ZFP36L1 and ZFP36, are capable of acting redundantly, because their common overexpression results in a cumulative effect on Stat5b down-regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell Cultures and Treatments</title><p>The U937 cell line was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Euroclone, Devon, United Kingdom), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and 1 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Euroclone).

To consolidate this observation, we monitored the expression of Stat5a, Stat5b, and ZFP36L1 in a gene expression profile deriving from adult CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells differentiating toward the erythroid lineage at various time points up to 11 d, published on the GEO-Profile database (GDS2431).

The results show that ZFP36, as well as ZFP36L1, determines a decrease of luciferase activity by binding Stat5b 3â²-UTR. Next we assessed whether ZFP36 is also able to interfere with erythroid differentiation. Therefore, ZFP36 was ectopically expressed in CD34+ human stem/progenitor cells that successively underwent a methylcellulose colony assay. The results are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C and show that, compared with the control population, after 2 wk a decrease of erythroid colonies (CFU/BFU-E) is visible, and it is super imposable to that observed in CD34+ cells overexpressing ZFP36L1. On these grounds, the hypothesis that the two proteins could act redundantly was tested. To do so, Hel cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding ZFP36 and ZFP36L1, and the effect on Stat5b expression was monitored by Western blot. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D and demonstrate that although Stat5b expression decreases after transfection of one or the other mRNA binding protein (lanes 2 and 3), their cotransfection (lane 4) is capable of completely abrogating it. To assess whether the effect on Stat5b depends on a synergistic or redundant behavior, we performed another REMSA that is included in the Supplementary Material, showing that ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 bind to Stat5b 3â²UTR with equal affinity. Such observation, together with published data demonstrating that ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 share the domains that recruit deadenylases and therefore trigger mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lykke-Andersen and Wagner, 2005</xref>), suggests that the two proteins are redundant when coexpressed, rather than synergic.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>ZFP36 behaves similarly to ZFP36L1 in binding to and destabilizing mRNAs spanning Stat5b 3â²UTR and in inhibiting erythroid differentiation of CD34+ HSCs.

Starting from chromatin conformation moving downstream toward the role of transcription factors and microRNAs, a wide amount of data has been gathered so far. With the current study we suggest a novel mechanism to control hematopoietic differentiation based on the activity of mRNA-binding proteins whose role, to date, was mostly related to the control of the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Sandler and Stoecklin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Schaljo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In our hypothesis, such proteins act by repressing the development of a specific blood lineage, namely the erythroid, rather than by promoting the differentiation of specific progenitors and precursors as classically described in many studies that focus on the role of transcription factors.</p><p>Starting from the analysis of a gene expression database showing that ZFP36L1 is differentially expressed in the different human blood cell contexts and, particularly, that its expression is consistently low in the erythroid compared with the other lineages (data not shown), we hypothesized that this protein and other members of the same family could play a role during hematopoiesis. By this study we demonstrated that ZFP36L1 and ZFP36 inhibit erythroid development of CD34+ human cord bloodâderived stem/progenitor cells by inhibiting proliferation of erythroid precursors and suggest that this behavior depends on ZFP36L1-mediated Stat5b mRNA degradation. Moreover, we demonstrated that ZFP36L1 and ZFP36 share Stat5b as a common target and are able to directly bind its mRNA on a canonical AREII sequence located in the 3â²-UTR. The inhibition of erythroid colonies formation observed after ZFP36L1 and ZFP36 ectopic expression is statistically significant, and it is coupled to a decrease of precursors' proliferation rather than to apoptosis or differentiation arrest (see Supplementary Material). To associate such observation with the sole down-regulation of Stat5b was not an obvious step, because this gene is highly homologous to Stat5a, and in murine erythropoiesis the proteins Stat5a and Stat5b are capable to some degree of substituting each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Socolovsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Therefore, we monitored the expression of Stat5a and Stat5b in human myeloid cell contexts, at different time points during human erythroid differentiation and then performed gene-silencing experiments targeting Stat5b. The expression analysis revealed that, unlike in murine erythropoiesis, during erythroid differentiation of human CD34+ stem/progenitor cells, a down-regulation of Stat5a expression occurs, whereas Stat5b expression persists at high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Accordingly, the gene silencing approach showed that Stat5b down-regulation is sufficient to impair erythroid maturation. It remains to be elucidated whether the different expression pattern of Stat5a and Stat5b in human erythropoiesis depends on transcriptional or posttranscriptional events. The presented results show that the idea underneath is correct, although a more complete hypothesis that rises from the present study suggests that ZFP36L1, ZFP36, and possibly other members of the same family could have among their targets other members of the Stat5b/JAK2 signal transduction pathway that have not been described in the experiments presented here.</p><p>The relation between ZFP36L1 and Stat5b is also indirectly described in the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) showing that ZFP36L1 ectopic expression results in the increase of transcription factor IRF8. Such a gene is involved at different levels in hematopoietic differentiation as a promoter of specific myeloid and lymphoid lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Qi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Saberwal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Wang and Morse, 2009</xref>) but not the erythroid one, it has been described for being negatively regulated by Stat5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Esashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and is capable of acting as a proapoptotic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2009</xref>). The ability of ZFP36L1 to down-regulate Stat5b, thereby promoting the expression of the proapoptotic factor IRF8, suggests that this gene family encodes proteins that in specific contexts are able to function as tumor suppressors. Such an observation is strengthened by a recently published report that shows that TTP family members are down-regulated in different tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Brennan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Another relevant aspect of the present work resides in the fact that drugs capable of inducing the expression of TTP family genes, such as cinnamon-derived polyphenols, do in fact down-regulate Stat5b expression and exhibit a very strong influence on erythroid maturation of human CD34+ stem/progenitor cells. The effect of cinnamon polyphenols is observed even at low concentrations of drug (0.25 Î¼g/Î¼l), and this efficiency could depend on the fact that they induce expression of both ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 that, as demonstrated by the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D, share the ability to bind Stat5b mRNA and therefore cooperate in promoting its degradation.</p><p>The present study establishes a relation between the TTP family of genes and the Stat5b/JAK2 pathway. Alterations in the genes belonging to such pathway, and precisely the JAK2 V617F mutation that leads to constitutive signal transduction, underlie chronic myeloproliferative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baxter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kralovics <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Levine and Gilliland, 2008</xref>), such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Today there is considerable optimism that these diseases can be successfully treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In fact specific inhibitors of JAK2 kinase activity have been designed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Gozgit <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Hexner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Wernig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and have entered the clinic in Phase I/II trials in PMF and post-PV/ET myelofibrosis. Given the central role of JAK2 signaling to a myriad of cellular processes, there may be significant toxicities associated with JAK2 inhibition, and âoff-targetâ inhibition of JAK1, JAK3, or TYK2 might lead to hematologic, immunologic, and endocrine side effects. Such toxicities could likely preclude their prolonged use; consequently, it is possible that alternative or synergic therapies will have to be developed. On these premises and on the ground of the results presented in this work, we hypothesize an approach for PV, characterized by an increase in absolute quantity of erythroid cells, based on the utilization of drugs that induce TTP gene family expression and that do not present the toxicity problems suggested above, determined by JAK2 inhibitors. TTP-inducing drugs would determine Stat5b down-regulation and would thereby allow decreasing the activity of JAK2-Stat5 pathway without interfering with the activity of other necessary, unmutated tyrosine kinases such as JAK1, JAK3, or TYK2 and others. Such an approach would not likely replace JAK2 inhibitors, but a combined strategy could possibly be useful to lower the dosage of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and therefore limit their toxicity.</p></sec>
