      <abstract>
        <p>The TAF6Î´ pathway of apoptosis can dictate life versus death decisions independently of the status of p53 tumor suppressor. TAF6Î´ is an inducible pro-apoptotic subunit of the general RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription factor TFIID. Alternative splice site choice of TAF6Î´ has been shown to be a pivotal event in triggering death via the TAF6Î´ pathway, yet nothing is currently known about the mechanisms that promote TAF6Î´ splicing. Furthermore the transcriptome impact of the gain of function of TAF6Î´ versus the loss of function of the major TAF6Î± splice form remains undefined. Here we employ comparative microarray analysis to show that TAF6Î´ drives a transcriptome profile distinct from that resulting from depletion of TAF6Î±. To define the <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements responsible for TAF6Î´ alternative splicing we performed a mutational analysis of a TAF6 minigene system. The data point to several new RNA elements that can modulate TAF6Î´ and also reveal a role for RNA secondary structure in the selection of TAF6Î´.</p>

      <p>The TAF6Î´ pathway of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102399.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) can control cell death versus life decisions of human cells <xref rid="pone.0102399-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. TAF6Î´ is a splice variant of the TAF6 protein that is a core subunit of the general RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription factor, TFIID <xref rid="pone.0102399-Bieniossek1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. TFIID nucleates the formation of the Pol II pre-initiation complex and therefore represents a highly regulated step in the gene expression pathway of protein-coding genes <xref rid="pone.0102399-Burley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. TFIID is the major core promoter recognition complex of the Pol II machinery and consists of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a constellation of approximately 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) <xref rid="pone.0102399-Cler1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. TAF6Î´ is an inducible pro-apoptotic isoform of TAF6 that lacks 10 amino acids in its histone-fold domain. In contrast to the major TAF6Î± isoform, TAF6Î´ cannot interact with TAF9 and instead forms a TAF9-lacking complex termed TFIIDÏ that drives a pro-apoptotic gene expression <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The TAF6Î´ pathway has emerged as a model system to investigate the mechanisms that transduce extracellular signals to trigger cellular suicide by impinging on the basal Pol II machinery. Moreover, because the TAF6Î´ pathway induces cell death independently of p53 <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, it represents a potential therapeutic target of strategic value for the killing of tumor cells that frequently lack functional p53 <xref rid="pone.0102399-Vousden1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Modified antisense RNA oligonucleotides that force the splicing machinery to switch from producing a majority of TAF6Î± to producing a majority of TAF6Î´ in living cells trigger apoptosis demonstrating that changes in alternative splicing can trigger the TAF6Î´ pathway of programmed cell death <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Alternative splicing plays a major role in proteomic diversification <xref rid="pone.0102399-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the case of programmed cell death, alternative splicing can control cell life versus death decisions by regulating the balance of anti-apoptotic versus pro-apoptotic splice variants of genes within cell death pathways <xref rid="pone.0102399-Schwerk1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. <italic>Cis</italic>-acting RNA elements can either enhance or silence the selection of alternative splice sites by the spliceosome to control splice site decisions <xref rid="pone.0102399-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These elements are classified upon their effect on a given splicing event and their location. Regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements thus include exonic splicing enhancers (ESE), exonic splicing silencers (ESS), intronic splicing enhancers (ISE), and intronic splicing silencers (ISS). These <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements act to recruit <italic>trans</italic>-acting protein factors, often from the SR protein family <xref rid="pone.0102399-Shepard1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> or the hnRNP family <xref rid="pone.0102399-MartinezContreras1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Layered upon the network of RNA-protein interactions that underpin alternative splicing decisions is the key role of RNA secondary structure within the pre-mRNA that has an impact on splice site recognition by the spliceosome as well as on RNA-protein interactions <xref rid="pone.0102399-Buratti1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-McManus1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Warf1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One important challenge in the study of all alternative splice events is to define the relative biological impact of the gain of the alternative splice form versus the loss of the constitutive form. While the induction of alternative splice variants often have important biological effects, in extreme cases alternative splicing serves only to dampen gene expression, as is the case when these events are coupled to the nonsense-mediated decay pathway <xref rid="pone.0102399-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Pan2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To shed light on the mechanism controlling the TAF6Î´ pathway of apoptosis, here we have compared the transcriptome impacts of loss of function of the major TAF6Î± splice variant via siRNA depletion versus those resulting from the induction of the pro-apoptotic TAF6Î´ splice variant. The results reveal an essential function for TAF6Î´ induction in the reprogramming of a specific pro-apoptotic transcriptome landscape. Despite the importance of inducible TAF6Î´ expression, nothing is currently known about the mechanisms governing alternative TAF6Î´ splicing. We therefore developed and validated a minigene system for the mutational dissection of TAF6 <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements. We report here the first identification of RNA elements that can influence splicing of TAF6Î´.</p>

        <title>SiRNA-mediated depletion of TAF6 causes a loss of viability in human cells</title>
        <p>We have previously analyzed the transcriptome impact of the induction of TAF6Î´ by using microarray experiments <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To define the impact of the loss of total TAF6 protein in human cells we performed transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression following depletion of total TAF6 proteins by siRNA. Importantly, the minor TAF6Î´ protein isoform is not expressed at detectable levels in HeLa cells under normal growth conditions, so that the effects of the siRNA cannot be due to significant reductions in TAF6Î´ protein levels <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102399.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). siRNAs were designed and validated for their ability to reduce TAF6 protein levels. Two siRNAs resulted in reduction of TAF6 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Quantification of TAF6Î± protein levels from three independent experiments using the ImageJ software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) indicated that si1 and si2 typically reduced TAF6Î± protein levels by 70â80% and 40â60%, respectively. To determine the impact of the loss of total TAF6 protein on cell viability we employed the methylene blue colorimetric assay (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">materials and methods</xref>). Both siRNAs that depleted TAF6 resulted in a concomitant loss of cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g001">Fig. 1CâD</xref>). We conclude that TAF6 expression is essential for cell viability in human cells, extending previous results demonstrating that TAF6 is essential for viability in distinct organisms including <italic>S. cerevisae</italic>

We next used si1, the siRNA that most efficiently reduced total TAF6 expression and resulted in the highest loss of viability, to further determine the impact of knock-down of TAF6 on the transcriptome using microarray analysis. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells treated with siRNA directed against TAF6 and from cells treated with control siRNA for microarray analysis <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Noth3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Two time points (48 and 72 hours) were chosen for transcriptome analysis to ensure the detection of the broadest possible number of TAF6-dependent transcripts as well as to ensure measurements before the onset of massive cell death. The levels of TAF6 mRNA were internally controlled in the transcriptome analysis by probes for <italic>taf6</italic> and showed at least 80% reduction at both 48 and 72 hours post-transfection (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Distinct transcriptome impacts of depleting TAF6Î± versus inducing TAF6Î´</title>
        <p>The knock-down of total TAF6 resulted in statistically significant changes in gene expression levels including a global reduction in transcription accompanied by the increase in a minority of mRNA transcripts 48 hours after siRNA transfection and particularly after 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Since siRNA can potentially have off-target effects, we sought to validate the specificity of the siRNA used by comparing the expression of a panel of genes with an independent siRNA directed against TAF6. The genes assayed showed comparable changes in response to treatment with both the most efficient siRNA, si1 and the less efficient siRNA, si2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102399.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). These data are compatible with the interpretation that the gene expression measured by microarray is due largely to specific interference with TAF6 expression. We also compared the changes in gene expression of the 961 previously identified TAF6Î´-dependent transcripts <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> to changes in response to siRNA depletion of total TAF6 and found that the two conditions result in distinct transcriptome landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). To examine more closely the changes resulting from the induction of TAF6Î´ versus depletion of TAF6, we filtered the microarray data to compare the overlap between the two sets of regulated transcripts. Of 961 TAF6Î´-dependent transcripts 128 were also significantly regulated by the siRNA against TAF6 at either 48 or 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Of the 128 regulated transcripts the majority (81) were oppositely regulated (induction versus repression). 44 transcripts were induced by both the loss of TAF6 and the induction of TAF6Î´, and the overlap between these genes was statistically significant (Pâ=â1,05Ã10<sup>â09</sup>, hypergeometric distribution). In contrast, 1513 genes were repressed in the absence of TAF6 and only three transcripts were repressed in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) and there was no statistically significant overlap between repressed genes. The microarray results revealed a minor subset of common effects in the induction of TAF6Î´ versus depletion of total TAF6 transcripts. Importantly, the data also reveal that the induction of TAF6Î´ drives a distinct pro-apoptotic gene expression program and therefore underscore the necessity for TAF6Î´ isoform expression to trigger this specific pathway of apoptosis. To further explore the effects of TAF6 depletion gene ontology analysis was applied. Of the seven pathways that are statistically overrepresented during TAF6 depletion, only three including the integrin signaling pathway, the p53 pathway and apoptosis signaling pathways were also found in the TAF6Î´ transcriptome signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To extent the comparison of gene expression patterns we compared the loss of total TAF6 at the earlier time point of 48 hours of treatment with siRNA, since these changes could potentially represent direct TAF6 target genes, with the gain of TAF6Î´ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102399.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). The data reinforce the distinct impact of TAF6Î´ induction compared to loss of TAF6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102399.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Taken altogether, the microarray data underscore the fact that the simple loss of total TAF6 mRNA does not recapitulate the same transcriptome impact that is observed when splicing of TAF6Î´ is selected at the expense of TAF6Î± expression.</p>

        <title>Development and validation of a minigene system to study TAF6 alternative splicing</title>
        <p>Having established the importance of the induction of TAF6Î´ versus the loss of TAF6Î± in driving a specific transcriptome profile and cell death programme, we next sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control the expression of the minor TAF6Î´ splice variant versus the major TAF6Î± splice variant. We cloned the genomic region from the TAF6 gene that contains part of exon 2, the alternative portion of exon 2, the natural full-length intron 2, and a part of exon 3 into the eukaryotic expression pcDNA3.1+ under the control of the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). No deletions, truncations or other modifications to the short (99 nucelotides) intron were performed so that it retains the full-length endogenous sequence. HeLa cells were chosen as a model to study TAF6 alternative splicing since the pro-apoptotic TAF6Î´ splice variant was originally cloned from a HeLa cell cDNA library <xref rid="pone.0102399-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. PCR primers specific to the transcribed flanking vector sequences were used to amplify exogenous TAF6 transcripts after transient transfection of the minigene into HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). PCR products corresponding to the expected sizes for the minigene products of unspliced pre-messenger, the major TAF6Î± transcript, and the minor TAF6Î´ transcript were detected by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Sequencing of each of these PCR products showed that they corresponded exactly to the expected splice products (B.B., unpublished results). Importantly, the ratio of TAF6Î´ versus total transcripts was found to range from 10% to 20% between independent transfections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g003">Figs. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g004">4A and 4B</xref>), a percentage that corresponds well to the endogenous TAF6 splicing pattern in HeLa cells <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The growth conditions of independent transfections appeared to influence basal levels of TAF6Î´ since biological triplicates within a single wave of transfections were highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g003">Figs. 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g007">7</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that the plasmid minigene system accurately recapitulates endogenous TAF6Î´ splicing patterns in transfected HeLa cells.</p>

        <p>To further characterize the minigene system we tested constructs bearing point mutations within one of the two alternative 5â² splice sites (SSs). When we crippled the proximal (Î±) 5â² SS by mutating the first two nucleotides of the intronic SS from the consensus GT to CA, the transfected minigene spliced uniquely at the alternative distal (Î´) 5â² SS, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, Pko). Likewise, the same crippling mutation of the distal (Î´) 5â² SS resulted in splicing in HeLa cells uniquely at the proximal (Î±) 5â² SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, Dko). We used a web tool <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rulai.cshl.edu/new_alt_exon_db2/HTML/score.html">http://rulai.cshl.edu/new_alt_exon_db2/HTML/score.html</ext-link> provided by Zhang laboratory (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories) to calculate the alternative distal 5â² SS and the constitutive proximal 5â² SS strength scores as 2.8 and 6.4 respectively. These are relatively weak given that a perfect consensus site score is 12.6 and the average value for a constitutive 5â² SS is 8.1. To test the impact of splice site strength we mutated both sites individually to the consensus (AG/GUAAGU). When the proximal 5â² SS is changed to the consensus no residual detection of the alternative Î´ variant was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, Pcons). When the alternative distal 5â² SS was changed to a consensus sequence all of the splice products used the distal site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, Dcons). We conclude that one parameter that impacts the alternative splice site choice of TAF6 is the complementarity of the 5â² SSs to U1 snRNP as expected. We further conclude that the minigene system we developed provides a useful system to dissect the <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements that control the expression of TAF6Î´.</p>
        <p>Having established a minigene system to study TAF6 alternative splicing we next set out to perform a mutational dissection of the RNA elements within the minigene that impact the expression of the pro-apoptotic TAF6Î´ isoform. We have applied a combination of resources to guide our mutational analysis including predictive algorithms for RNA binding proteins and <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements including RESCUE-ESE <xref rid="pone.0102399-Fairbrother1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, ESE finder <xref rid="pone.0102399-Cartegni1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and âSplicing Rainbowâ <xref rid="pone.0102399-Stamm1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. We also considered evolutionary conservation of intronic sequences and employed scanning mutagenesis to identify <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA splicing elements. For simplicity we have subdivided the minigene into several sub-regions and our mutational analysis of each region is presented below.</p>

        <title>Scanning mutagenesis of constitutive exon 2 and exon 3</title>
        <p>To search for <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements we initially performed scanning by mutating blocks of 10 nucleotides within the constitutive portion of exon 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The mutation of two nucleotide blocks Exon 2-1 and Exon 2-3 had no significant effect on the TAF6 splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Another nucleotide block in exon 2, exon 2-2 produced reproducible reductions in the levels of TAF6Î´ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). These results evoke that a possible <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA sequence within the exon 2-2 could favour the selection of the distal (Î´) 5â² SS. We note that in HeLa cells the endogenous basal levels (â¼10%) of TAF6Î´ do not produce detectable TAF6Î´ protein by Western blotting or immunofluorescence with sensitive antibodies, suggesting the exon 2-2 mutation would not be expected to have profound biological impacts.</p>
        <p>We next used the same scanning mutagenesis to query whether exon 3 contained RNA elements important for the selection of TAF6Î´. We mutated three 10 nucleotide blocks near the 3â² SS of our TAF6 minigene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). We found no significant differences in the ratio of TAF6Î´ for any of the three mutations exon 3-1, 3-2 or 3-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). We conclude that the region of exon 3 proximal to intron 2 does not play a major role in the selection of the TAF6Î´ splice variant.</p>

        <title>Targeted mutagenesis of intron 2 of the <italic>taf6</italic> gene</title>
        <p>To begin characterizing intron 2 of the minigene, we first examined sequence homology between the ninety-nine nucleotide long natural human intron 2 and forty-six vertebrate species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>). Minimal informative sequence conservation was found within intron 2, however a small conserved motif that fits the degenerate yUnAy consensus <xref rid="pone.0102399-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> for a human branch point site was identified at nucleotides 153â157 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102399.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). To determine if the adenine at position 156 corresponds to the branchpoint we mutated it to a guanosine. Upon transfection in HeLa cells the mutated minigene showed profoundly reduced splicing activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102399.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). The residual splicing activity is low but detectable and could represent the inefficient use of alternative neighboring adenines. We conclude that adenine 156 is essential for splicing of the TAF6 minigene and most likely represents the major branchpoint site in intron 2.</p>
        <p>To further explore <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements within intron 2 that could impact the selection of the distal 5â² SS, we chose candidate motifs after manual and software-assisted (see above) analysis of potential regulatory sequence motifs. We decided to test the roles of several sequence motifs in the TAF6 minigene system including poly C motifs <xref rid="pone.0102399-ExpertBezancon1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, poly G motifs <xref rid="pone.0102399-SirandPugnet1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and a potential binding site for hnRNPA1 <xref rid="pone.0102399-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> because these motifs have been previously shown to influence alternative splicing. The mutation of a potential hnRNPA1 binding site <xref rid="pone.0102399-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> within intron had no significant effect on the TAF6 splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, koA1). Likewise, a mutation of the CCCC (C<sub>4</sub>) motif at position 175â178 had little effect on TAF6 alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, C<sub>4</sub>-175). The mutation of a C<sub>3</sub> motif at positions 125â127 and C<sub>4</sub> combined significantly reduced levels of the TAF6Î´ splice variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, C<sub>3</sub>-125; C<sub>4</sub>-132). To determine if one of these motifs was more important for TAF6Î´ expression we mutated them individually and found that mutation of C<sub>3</sub>-125 alone caused a small but measurable reduction in TAF6Î´ levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, C<sub>3</sub>-125). Mutation of the C<sub>4</sub>-132 motif alone caused a reduction in TAF6Î´ expression similar to that of the double mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, C<sub>4</sub>-132), suggesting that the C<sub>4</sub>-132 motif plays the predominant role in TAF6Î´ splice site selection. To complete our investigation of poly C motifs, we mutated a C<sub>3</sub> motif at position 91â93 in the minigene and found it produced modestly reduced splice selection of TAF6Î´ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, C<sub>3</sub>-91).</p>
        <p>We next turned our attention to the potential function of three poly G sequences within intron 2 of the TAF6 minigene. The mutation of a G<sub>3</sub> motif at position 113â115 resulted in reduced expression of the TAF6Î´ splice variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, G<sub>3</sub>-113). The mutation of a G<sub>3</sub> motif at position 129â131 had little impact on TAF6 splicing ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, G<sub>3</sub>-129). The mutation of a G<sub>3</sub> motif at position 150â152 generated wild type splicing ratios. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, G<sub>3</sub>-150). Taken together, our analysis of intron 2 of the TAF6 minigene define a putative branchpoint adenosine at position 156 that is essential for splicing, and shows that specific poly C and poly G motifs in the intron can enhance the selection of the pro-apoptotic TAF6Î´ splice form.</p>

        <title>RNA secondary structure at the proximal 5â² splice site can force the selection of TAF6Î´</title>
        <p>We then focused on the alternative exon 2 (exon 2a) a critical region of the minigene because it lies physically between the Î± and Î´ alternative 5â² splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), and because modified antisense RNA oligonucleotides that anneal to it can shift the splicing from the major to the pro-apoptotic Î´ form in living cells <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The ESEfinder algorithm <xref rid="pone.0102399-Cartegni1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> was employed and detected a potential SF2 binding site in exon 2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). To test a potential role for the SF2 motif in the 5â² splice site choice we designed two point mutations to prevent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, SF2-) or enhance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, SF2+) SF2 binding. Upon transfection these mutations both gave strong increases in the levels of the Î´ splice form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), a result not compatible with a role for SF2 binding to this motif. To further dissect the impact of the two-nucleotide mutation within SF2+ that caused a complete reversal of the splicing pattern, we mutated these positions individually. Mutation of position 68 alone had little effect on the splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, A68C). In contrast, mutation of adenosine 73 to guanosine alone resulted in a complete shift towards the usage of the distal Î´ 5â² SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, A73G). Having ruled out a role for SF2, we sought an alternative hypothesis for the strong impact of this mutation. Given the well-documented importance of RNA secondary structure on alternative splicing <xref rid="pone.0102399-Buratti1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-McManus1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Warf1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Roca1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, we employed the M-Fold algorithm <xref rid="pone.0102399-Zuker1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> to test for potential impacts on RNA structure. When compared to the wild type sequence the A73G mutation was predicted to form a stem-loop that based on precedence <xref rid="pone.0102399-Hutton1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> would be stable enough to potentially block U1 snRNP from binding to the proximal 5â² splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, right). To test the hypothesis that mutation A73G reverses TAF6 splicing via the formation of secondary structure we performed further mutagenesis to provide support for the putative G73 - C86 base pair in cells. Mutation of C86U in the wild type context A73 did not change TAF6 splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). We also performed mutations that are predicted to form a stem-loop of equal stability to A73G replacing the natural C86 within position 5 of the proximal 5â² splice site with G to increase its strength. This construct showed less Î´ splicing that the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> mutant A73C-C86U), compatible with a competition between splice site strength and RNA secondary structure in cells. To test whether the potential weak secondary structure formed by the wild type sequence could impact basal TAF6 splicing ratios we performed a series of mutations that would weaken such a potential structure, but found no strict correlation between the stability of such a structure and splice site selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). We conclude that any secondary structure forming with the wild type pre-mRNA under normal cellular conditions is not strong enough to impact selection of the distal 5â² SS. To further confirm the putative structure formed by the A73G mutation we performed mutations that disrupt the structure while leaving the proximal 5â² SS untouched and found no change in splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>, GC 74). Mutations that weaken but do not ablate the putative A73G-induced stem-loop showed intermediate levels of distal 5â² SS usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>, GC 75 &amp; GC 76). A point mutation in the loop of the predicted stem-loop had no effect, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>, GC 78). Taken collectively, these findings indicate that a stem-loop structure competing for the proximal 5â² SS can strongly enhance the use of the distal Î´ 5â² SS.</p>

        <title>Evidence for an exonic splicing silencer in alternative exon 2</title>
        <p>Given that local secondary structure occurs at the proximal 5â² SS, and that it is located only 30 nucleotides from the distal 5â² SS, we postulated that competition between RNA structure and the distal 5â² SS might also play a role in the expression of TAF6Î´. We used the M-Fold algorithm <xref rid="pone.0102399-Zuker1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> to predict potential secondary structures overlapping the distal 5â² SS. The most probable theoretical stem-loop structure predicted could potentially occlude the interaction of U1 snRNP interaction with the distal Î´ 5â² SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). To provide evidence to confirm or exclude the existence of such a stem-loop we constructed a series of minigenes with mutations that would weaken, destroy or maintain it. No correlation was observed between potential stem-loop strength and the splicing outcome, ruling out a major role for such a structure in the regulation of TAF6 alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, however, our mutational analysis revealed that a single nucleotide change (C66U) produced a greater than two-fold increase in the production of the TAF6Î´ splice form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g007">Fig. 7A and B</xref>, C66U). To further delineate the role of cytosine 66 we mutated it to uridine, adenosine and guanosine respectively. Mutations C66U and C66A both resulted in clear increases in TAF6Î´ splice form production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>), even though these nucleotides have distinct hydrogen bonding specificities within RNA secondary structures. C66G had much less effect than these mutations, although the mutation would also be expected to have altered base-pairing within RNA structure. To further dissect a potential regulatory RNA sequence in the region of cytosine 66 we performed further point mutations. Changing adenosine 67 to thymine significantly increased TAF6Î´ splice selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>, A67T). A nearby change, G70T, also increased TAF6Î´ splice selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). In contrast, a slightly more distant mutation C60G did not significantly change the splicing ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). Taken together, the above results suggest that an exonic splicing silencer (ESS) is located in the region of nucleotides 66â70 within the alternative exon of TAF6. We found no evidence that RNA secondary structure within this region plays an important role in splice site choice. The mutational data described above support a hypothetical model for <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements in the regulation of TAF6 alternative splicing that is presented schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g008">Figure 8</xref>.</p>

      <p>TAF6 is a core subunit of the general RNA Pol II transcription factor TFIID <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and has previously demonstrated to be essential for viability in several organisms including the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0102399-Michel1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Poon1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> fruit flies <xref rid="pone.0102399-Aoyagi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> as well as the fresh water fish <italic>Danio rerio</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0102399-Amsterdam1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Here we show for the first time that TAF6 is essential for viability in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Although this result is not unexpected, the significance of the finding derives from the potential of TAF6 as a therapeutic target for numerous diseases that result from deregulated apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0102399-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Many apoptotic genes are required for normal development at the organismal level but tumor suppressors such as BRCA1, PTEN, CDKN2A (ARF/p16INK4), RB1, APC, and p53, Bcl-2 family members, the caspases and death receptors are all dispensable for viability at the cellular level <xref rid="pone.0102399-Ranger1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Vogelstein1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. TAF6 therefore represents a rare class of genes that are essential for cell viability, but also possess splice variants with potent pro-apoptotic activity. As an essential gene with pro-apoptotic potential TAF6 is of high strategic interest in the development of anti-cancer treatments that avoid the development of chemoresistance and to target p53 negative tumors <xref rid="pone.0102399-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Using a minigene system that recapitulates the endogenous TAF6 splicing pattern we identified several <italic>cis</italic>-RNA elements that modulate TAF6Î´ splicing as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102399-g008">Figure 8</xref>. The sensitivity of the proximal 5â² splice site evokes the possibility that the modulation of RNA folding could contribute to the physiological selection of TAF6Î´. Further work will be required to confirm or exclude this hypothesis. The first mapping of the <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA within elements provides the essential groundwork for future studies to identify <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that regulate TAF6Î´ splicing. Indeed, the identification of the important RNA elements will be crucial for both proteomic <xref rid="pone.0102399-Kar1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and genomic <xref rid="pone.0102399-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> approaches to identify <italic>trans</italic>-acting splice regulatory proteins. A limitation of the current study is the fact that the mutations could conceivably differentially alter RNA stability in addition to splice site choice. In addition potential long-range <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements will not have been identified due to the limited size of our TAF6 minigene. Further work will be required to address these possibilities.</p>
      <p>Accumulating evidence points to a potential link between the TAF6Î´ pathway and cancer biology. A cDNA encoding the major TAF6Î± variant was identified in a large-scale screen as being able to increase colony formation in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wan1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Integrative genomic data show that the taf6 gene is amplified in lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0102399-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. TAF6 has been reported as a genomic marker of poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma <xref rid="pone.0102399-AvielRonen1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. TAF6 mRNA was identified as being overexpressed in inflammatory breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0102399-Dressman1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Interestingly, a specific splice variant of TAF6 with an extended exon 2 is reportedly overrepresented in ductal cell carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Taken together these findings suggest that the major anti-apoptotic TAF6Î± splice variant possesses oncogenic potential. In stark contrast, the minor TAF6Î´ splice variant has pro-apoptotic activity evoking a potential tumor suppressor activity <xref rid="pone.0102399-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102399-Wilhelm2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It is conceivable that anti-apoptotic TAF6Î± expression can be decoupled from pro-apoptotic TAF6Î´ in certain tumor types. The mapping of key <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements we present here paves the way to experimentally test the existence of mutations in the essential taf6 gene that could reduce or prevent TAF6Î´ expression in human tumors.</p>
