        <p>Talpid3 and Cep290 promote proper ciliary vesicle formation by regulating centriolar satellite accretion and Rab8a localization.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>We have identified Talpid3/KIAA0586 as a component of a CP110-containing protein complex important for centrosome and cilia function. Talpid3 assembles a ring-like structure at the extreme distal end of centrioles. Ablation of Talpid3 resulted in an aberrant distribution of centriolar satellites involved in protein trafficking to centrosomes as well as cilia assembly defects, reminiscent of loss of Cep290, another CP110-associated protein. Talpid3 depletion also led to mislocalization of Rab8a, a small GTPase thought to be essential for ciliary vesicle formation. Expression of activated Rab8a suppressed cilia assembly defects provoked by Talpid3 depletion, suggesting that Talpid3 affects cilia formation through Rab8a recruitment and/or activation. Remarkably, ultrastructural analyses showed that Talpid3 is required for centriolar satellite dispersal, which precedes the formation of mature ciliary vesicles, a process requiring Cep290. These studies suggest that Talpid3 and Cep290 play overlapping and distinct roles in ciliary vesicle formation through regulation of centriolar satellite accretion and Rab8a.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Centrosomes, composed of two cylindrical centrioles, termed the mother and daughter centrioles, and pericentriolar material (PCM), function as microtubule-organizing centers in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bettencourt-Dias and Glover, 2007</xref>). In cycling cells, the centrosome nucleates the assembly of spindle poles in mitosis, but once cells exit from the cell cycle and enter quiescence, the mother centriole differentiates into a basal body to assemble a primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi and Dynlacht, 2011</xref>). Primary cilia function as cellular antennae, mediating several signaling pathways essential for growth and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although the mechanisms underlying the transition from mother centrioles to the basal bodies of primary cilia remain largely enigmatic, it has been shown that formation of a ciliary vesicle that caps the distal end of mother centrioles occurs at a very early stage in ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sorokin, 1962</xref>). It is thought that the ciliary vesicle initially appears at the distal end of mother centrioles and subsequently fuses with secondary vesicles, leading to the formation of a ciliary sheath around the assembling axoneme and eventually forming a ciliary membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghossoub et al., 2011</xref>). A small GTPase, Rab8a, has been shown to localize to centrosomes and the ciliary sheath, and this protein is required for ciliary membrane formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsiao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murga-Zamalloa et al., 2010</xref>). Rab8a is required for ciliogenesis, and Rabin8 is a known guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hattula et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">KnÃ¶dler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiba et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that Rab8a localizes near centrosomes during the early phase of ciliogenesis, and these Rab8a-containing structures resemble nascent ciliary sheaths, suggesting that Rab8a plays important roles in ciliary vesicle formation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Centriolar satellites are nonmembranous, electron-dense particles surrounding centrosomes in many animal cells, and they have been implicated in dynein-dependent protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>). PCM1, first identified as a component of centriolar satellites, interacts with many proteins, and probably functions as a scaffold protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubo and Tsukita, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, several proteins that localize to centriolar satellites, including PCM1, Cep290, BBS4, Ofd1, and Cep72, are required for cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrante et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stowe et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that centriolar satellites play key roles in cilia formation. Given that PCM1 and Cep290 associate with Rab8a, and loss of these proteins results in mislocalization of Rab8a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsang et al., 2008</xref>), it is possible that centriolar satellites may be necessary for Rab8a to promote cilia assembly.</p><p>We have previously identified a centrosomal protein, CP110, as a suppressor of centriole reduplication induced by prolonged S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). CP110 localizes to the distal end of centrioles and disappears from basal bodies before cilia assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>). CP110 and two associated proteins, Cep97 and Kif24, suppress primary cilia formation, most likely by capping the distal end of the mother centriole and remodeling centriolar microtubules in growing cells able to form cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, CP110 suppresses ciliogenesis through interactions with Cep290 and Rab8a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsang et al., 2008</xref>). These results suggest a functional network of interactions that connect CP110, Cep290, and Rab8a. However, the precise roles of Cep290 and Rab8a in ciliogenesis in mammalian cells have not yet been elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we identified KIAA0586/Talpid3 as a CP110-interacting protein. The <italic>talpid3</italic> mutation in chickens was originally identified on the basis of its limb defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ede and Kelly, 1964</xref>), and later reports showed that this mutant exhibits aberrant Sonic hedgehog activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davey et al., 2006</xref>). Chicken Talpid3 encodes a coiled-coil protein that localizes to centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, developmental studies have shown that loss of Talpid3 in chicken, mouse, and zebrafish abolishes primary cilia formation, resulting in polydactyly, as well as facial, neural, and left/right symmetry defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bangs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben et al., 2011</xref>). However, it remained unclear how Talpid3 functions during cilia assembly. Here, we show that Talpid3 localizes to a ring around the distal end of centrioles, assembling near the distal appendages of mother centrioles. Depletion of Talpid3 results in defects in cilia formation and mislocalization of centriolar satellites and Rab8a, phenocopying the loss of Cep290 and suggesting that Talpid3 and Cep290 share overlapping roles in cilia formation. However, we found that initial ciliary vesicle formation is impaired by depletion of Talpid3, whereas subsequent enlargement of early ciliary vesicles is arrested in Cep290-ablated cells. These data suggest a model in which Talpid3 functions at an initial step of ciliary vesicle formation and Cep290 acts in the maturation of these vesicles, thereby promoting cilia assembly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Talpid3 interacts with a CP110-containing protein complex</title><p>In an effort to identify distal centriolar proteins that play a role in ciliogenesis, we performed a proteomic screen for components of CP110-containing complexes (see Materials and methods). We identified a candidate interacting protein, KIAA0586, which is an orthologue of chicken Talpid3. Talpid3/KIAA0586 is conserved in vertebrates, from humans to zebrafish, but it is absent from insects and worms. Human Talpid3 contains one coiled-coil domain in the central region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201304153/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). To test whether Talpid3 and CP110 interact in cells, we transfected a plasmid expressing Flag-Talpid3 in HEK293 cells, performed anti-Flag immunoprecipitations, and demonstrated that both Flag-Talpid3 and CP110 were coprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We raised antibodies against human Talpid3 that detect the endogenous protein (Fig. S1 A) and showed that both antibodies were specific for Talpid3 by transfecting siRNAs that ablated the full-length protein from crude lysates (Fig. S1 B; and unpublished data). Next, we performed immunoprecipitations and found that endogenous Talpid3 was coimmunoprecipitated with CP110 and Kif24 antibodies, whereas considerably less Talpid3 was precipitated with antibodies against Cep97 and Cep290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Reciprocal immunoprecipitations with a Talpid3 antibody confirmed its interaction with CP110, Cep97, and Kif24, and, to a lesser extent, with Cep290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We also detected Talpid3 in Cep76 immunoprecipitates, although the association was not detected in the reverse direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Moreover, we observed Talpid3 binding to CP110 and Cep97 and weaker interactions with Cep290 and Kif24 in a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line immortalized with telomerase (hTERT-RPE1 or RPE1 hereafter; Fig. S1 C). Collectively, these data indicate that Talpid3 robustly binds to CP110 and more weakly associates with Cep97, Cep290, and Kif24.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Talpid3 interacts with CP110, Cep97, Kif24, and Cep290.</bold> (A) Flag-tagged Talpid3 or Flag alone was expressed in HEK293 cells, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody.

As shown in Fig. S1 D, Flag-Talpid3 exclusively colocalized with glutamylated tubulin at centrosomes. We then performed immunofluorescence experiments using anti-Talpid3 antibodies to assess endogenous Talpid3 localization at different stages of the cell cycle in RPE1 cells. Talpid3 antibodies stained two dots in G1 cells and four dots in G2 and mitotic cells, and in each case, staining overlapped with centrin2, a centriole marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We also detected Talpid3 localization to basal bodies of primary cilia and daughter centrioles in serum-starved RPE1 cells (Fig. S1 E). Talpid3 fluorescence was abolished in Talpid3-depleted cells, indicating that our antibody specifically recognized endogenous Talpid3 in cultured cells (Fig. S1 E). A second Talpid3 antibody also showed centrosomal staining in RPE1 cells (Fig. S1 F). Together, these data suggest that Talpid3 localizes to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle and during ciliogenesis. We co-stained Talpid3 with a subset of centrosome markers and found that Talpid3 staining overlapped with centrin2, a distal-end centriolar marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paoletti et al., 1996</xref>), but not with Î³-tubulin (pericentriolar matrix), C-Nap1 (proximal region), Sas6 (pro-centrioles), or Cep170 (subdistal region; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Next, we obtained super-resolution immunofluorescence images using structured illumination microscopy. Remarkably, these experiments indicated that Talpid3 forms a ring-like structure enveloping CP110 at the extreme distal ends of centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Colocalization studies further showed that Talpid3 formed a ârimâ around the centriolar barrel (visualized with anti-glutamylated tubulin [GT335] and centrin2 antibodies), and nested within, and very close to, the ring formed by Cep164 at the distal appendages in the presence or absence of an axoneme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, BâE</xref>). Collectively, these data confirm that Talpid3 localizes to the distal ends of centrioles, close to other components of CP110-containing protein complexes and near the distal appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Talpid3 localizes to the distal ends of centrioles.</bold> (A) RPE1 cells in diverse stages of the cell cycle were processed for immunofluorescence with anti-Talpid3_2 (red) and anti-centrin (green) antibodies.

Several truncations spanning residues 466â602, which contain a coiled-coil domain (residues 466â500), localized to centrosomes (Figs. S1 G). These data suggest that a central region, including a coiled-coil domain, is important for Talpid3 targeting to centrosomes, in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, we also found that an N-terminal region (residues 1â465) weakly localized to centrosomes (Fig. S1 G), raising the possibility that human Talpid3 localization requires an association with centrosome proteins via two distinct regions within Talpid3.</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of Talpid3 prevents primary cilia formation</title><p>We next investigated the consequences of Talpid3 depletion. Developmental studies of Talpid3 have shown that this protein is required for cilia formation in several vertebrates, including mice, zebrafish, and chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bangs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben et al., 2011</xref>), and therefore, we examined cilia formation in Talpid3-depleted human RPE1 cells. We transfected siRNAs and verified that the levels of Talpid3 protein were reduced by 70â90% in RPE1 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201304153/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). When we acutely ablated Talpid3 using several distinct siRNAs in RPE1 cells and induced cilia formation by serum starvation, we found a significant reduction in primary cilia assembly using four canonical markers, glutamylated tubulin (GT335), detyrosinated tubulin, IFT88, and Arl13b (Fig. S2, B and C; and unpublished data). We also ablated Talpid3 in 3T3 cells using a pool of siRNAs or three distinct siRNAs, and observed modest but significant loss of cilia (Fig. S2, D and E). These data suggest that Talpid3 is required for cilia formation in both human and mouse cells. Because it is known that CP110 prevents unrestrained centriolar elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>) and depletion of CP110-associated proteins, Cep76 or Neurl4, induces aberrant centriole-like structures in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2012</xref>), we next tested whether loss of Talpid3 provokes these phenotypes.

Although the number of CP110 foci was not significantly affected by Talpid3 depletion (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201304153/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S3, A and B</ext-link>), we found that Cep290 fluorescence became dramatically concentrated around centrosomes in Talpid3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>; and Fig. S3 C). In light of our proteomic data and studies showing that Cep290 localizes to centriolar satellites as well as centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sayer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valente et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsang et al., 2008</xref>), we also examined the distribution of PCM1, a canonical centriolar satellite marker essential for cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). We observed that PCM1 granules accumulated around centrosomes when Talpid3 was depleted in RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>; and Fig. S3 D). This phenotype was confirmed by depletion of Talpid3 using additional siRNAs (Fig. S3 E). We also observed this phenotype in Cep290-ablated cells, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stowe et al., 2012</xref>). PCM1 protein levels in lysates were not affected by loss of Talpid3 or Cep290 in serum-starved RPE1 cells, nor did ablation of Talpid3 affect Cep290 abundance (Fig. S3 F). These results suggest that ablation of Talpid3 or Cep290 impacts the localization, but not the abundance, of centriolar satellite proteins. Furthermore, we confirmed this phenotype with another established centriolar satellite marker, the Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) protein, BBS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lopes et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that loss of Talpid3 or Cep290 in quiescent RPE1 cells causes accumulation of centriolar satellites. We next asked how this concentration of centriolar satellites around centrosomes relates to cilia formation in RPE1 cells. We found that accumulation of centriolar satellites negatively correlated with cilia assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>). In contrast, silencing of Talpid3 or Cep290 in HeLa or U2OS cells, which do not form primary cilia, had no effect on the distribution of centriolar satellites around centrosomes (Fig. S3 G). Taken together, these data suggest that (1) defects in cilia formation in Talpid3- or Cep290-depleted RPE1 cells are associated with the inappropriate accumulation of centriolar satellites, and (2) depletion of either protein provokes the accumulation of satellites in cells uniquely able to assemble cilia.</p><p>We performed rescue experiments by expressing full-length mouse Talpid3, or several truncations thereof, in RPE1 cells depleted of endogenous Talpid3. We observed that both phenotypes provoked by Talpid3 silencing, namely defective cilia assembly and aberrant concentration of centriolar satellites around centrosomes, were largely rescued by expression of full-length Talpid3 (Fig. S3, H and I). However, no Talpid3 truncation mutants significantly rescued the phenotypes associated with Talpid3 deletion (Fig. S3, H and I). These data suggest that multiple domains of Talpid3 contribute to its role in regulating a normal distribution of centriolar satellites and cilia formation.</p><p>Our data further suggested that PCM1 associates with a CP110âCep97âTalpid3 complex and that Talpid3 modulates the localization of centriolar satellites through this interaction. However, these findings did not rule out the possibility that Talpid3 depletion resulted in a general disruption of centrosome integrity. We therefore tested whether a subset of centrosome proteins were affected by loss of Talpid3 in quiescent RPE1 cells. We observed no differences in the staining patterns of pericentrin (pericentriolar matrix), rootletin (proximal region of centrioles), centrin (distal region of centrioles), Cep164 (distal appendages of mother centrioles), cenexin (distal and subdistal appendages of mother centrioles), or Cep170 (subdistal appendages of mother centrioles; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201304153/DC1" id="supp5">Fig. S4 A</ext-link>), suggesting that targeting of these proteins to centrosomes was not impacted by the absence of Talpid3.</p></sec><sec><title>Talpid3 and Cep290 are required for proper localization of Rab8a</title><p>Loss of Cep290 or PCM1 has been reported to result in exclusion of Rab8a from the ciliary membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsang et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, another centriolar satellite protein, BBS4, is a component of the BBSome, a core complex of seven BBS proteins that was shown to associate with Rabin8, a GEF for Rab8a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hattula et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>). These observations led us to hypothesize that Talpid3, like Cep290, could control localization of Rab8a during cilia formation. We therefore examined localization of Rab8a to cilia in Talpid3-ablated cells. Interestingly, Rab8a staining of cilia was dramatically reduced upon suppression of Talpid3, similar to Cep290 silencing (Fig. S4, B and C). Exclusion of Rab8a from the ciliary membrane was also observed when Talpid3 or Cep290 was depleted from RPE1 cells stably expressing GFP-Rab8a (GFP-Rab8a-RPE1; unpublished data). These data suggest that Talpid3 affects the localization of Rab8a to the ciliary membrane.</p><p>Recent studies showed that ectopically expressed Rab8a accumulates in the vicinity of centrosomes, shortly after cilia are induced to assemble and before elongation of axonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, ultrastructural studies have shown that ciliary vesicles are formed near mother centrioles at an early stage of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sorokin, 1962</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Rab8a may be required for vesicle docking and ciliary vesicle formation during the early stages of ciliogenesis. We therefore examined targeting of Rab8a near centrosomes at different time points after induction of ciliogenesis by serum starvation. Although the appearance of cilia increased linearly after serum starvation (unpublished data), we found that the number of cells with Rab8a-positive foci adjacent to nonciliated centrosomes peaked at 6 h and diminished by 24 h after serum starvation in control RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). These data confirm that endogenous Rab8a localizes near centrosomes at an early stage of ciliogenesis before assembly of the ciliary axoneme. In striking contrast, Talpid3-depleted cells exhibited a significant diminution in the number of cells with Rab8a-positive foci in the vicinity of centrosomes, 6 h after serum starvation, and we observed a similar effect in Cep290-ablated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). To further confirm this phenotype, we performed live-cell imaging using GFP-Rab8a-RPE1 cells. Fluorescent signals of GFP-Rab8a near centrosomes marked by tgRFP-Centrin2 were monitored after serum starvation. We observed that GFP-Rab8a targets to the centrosome within 20 min after serum starvation in control RPE1 cells, and the GFP-Rab8a signal continues to elongate over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201304153/DC1" id="supp6">Video 1</ext-link>), consistent with an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>).

We ectopically expressed constitutively active (QL) or negative (TN) Rab8a in Talpid3- or Cep290-depleted RPE1 cells and examined cilia assembly and concentration of PCM1-positive granules around centrosomes. Significantly, we found that the constitutively active form of Rab8a rescued defects in cilia formation provoked by Talpid3 or Cep290 loss, but the inactive form of Rab8a did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>), suggesting that GTP-bound, activated Rab8a functions downstream of Talpid3 or Cep290 during cilia assembly. In striking contrast, constitutive activation of Rab8a could not suppress the abnormal accumulation of PCM1 dots at centrosomes caused by ablation of Talpid3 or Cep290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>).

These data indicate that accumulation of centriolar satellites caused by depletion of Talpid3 or Cep290 may impair downstream events associated with Rab8a function.

After 6 h of serum deprivation, we observed ciliary vesicles at the distal tip of mother centrioles in the majority of control cells, suggesting that ciliary vesicle formation is temporally associated with targeting of Rab8a to centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A, E, and G</xref>). We observed two classes of vesicles: larger, capped ciliary vesicles (CCVs) and smaller, primary ciliary vesicles (PCVs) associated with distal appendages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201304153/DC1" id="supp7">Fig. S5, A and B</ext-link>). CCVs sub-tend the entire distal end of mother centrioles, whereas PCVs are considerably smaller and appear to associate primarily with individual (or a subset of) distal appendages. Cells containing CCVs or PCVs were thus scored based on the shape and size of these vesicles, which are sharply circumscribed by lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A, C, D, J, and K</xref>; and Fig. S5, A and B). PCVs are likely to represent the earliest form of ciliary vesicles. Interestingly, in Cep290-depleted cells, vesicles were associated with the distal tip of mother centrioles, but their size was considerably smaller than the CCVs found in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>, compare A with C). Indeed, these PCVs were significantly enriched in Cep290-depleted cells by greater than twofold as compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 G</xref>).</p><p>Our previous experiments demonstrated that loss of Talpid3 and/or Cep290 significantly impaired cilia formation after 24 h of serum deprivation, a point at which &gt;70% of wild-type RPE1 cells are ciliated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>). Therefore, to determine whether the loss of Talpid3 and/or Cep290 leads to a block or delay in vesicle assembly and maturation, we analyzed this population of siRNA-transfected cells by TEM. We found that &gt;60% of control cells were ciliated, and the number of cells with centriolar satellites or ciliary vesicles decreased concomitantly relative to the earlier time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, EâG, and LâN</xref>). However, in Talpid3-ablated cells we found that the overall distribution of cells containing ciliary vesicles and primary cilia, as well as centriolar satellites, was similar to the 6-h time point, suggesting that Talpid3 regulates the dispersal of centriolar satellites, which precedes ciliary vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, EâG, and LâN</xref>). In contrast, after 24 h of serum starvation there was a striking â¼2.5-fold increase in the number of Cep290-depleted cells with ciliary vesicles as compared with the control, accounting for a commensurate lack of cilia in the Cep290-depleted population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, L and N</xref>). Of note, in the majority of Cep290-ablated cells, ciliary vesicles persisted as CCVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 N</xref>). These observations suggest that Cep290 is not rate-limiting for the early events in PCV assembly. Rather, Cep290 might participate in a series of steps associated with the conversion of PCVs to CCVs, as well as further maturation of CCVs, which would eventually encapsulate the growing axoneme by a series of vesicular fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sorokin, 1962</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">1968</xref>). Co-silencing of Talpid3 and Cep290 again provoked vesicular phenotypes similar to Talpid3 knockdown, further supporting an epistatic relationship wherein Talpid3 functions before Cep290 during cilia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, E, G, L, and N</xref>). In contrast, depletion of IFT88, a protein acting at a later stage in the cilia assembly pathway, did not lead to defects in centriolar satellite dispersal or PCV-to-CCV maturation at 6 or 24 h of serum deprivation, but instead, depleted cells showed impaired axonemal elongation (unpublished data), consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joo et al., 2013</xref>).

Talpid3 depletion led to an increase in this latter population in both early (6 h) and late (24 h) stages of cilia formation, as compared with the control, which essentially lacked this population at both stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, E and L</xref>). This result suggests the involvement of Talpid3 in the transition from centriolar satellite accumulation to ciliary vesicle formation, and ablation of this protein essentially inhibits this transition.</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that Talpid3 and Cep290 have overlapping yet distinct roles in cilia assembly. Talpid3, and to a lesser degree, Cep290, are critical for the loss of centriolar satellites, which precedes the formation and/or capture of PCVs. Cep290 also acts subsequently, participating in the transition from PCV to CCV, downstream of centriolar satellite dispersal.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>A model describing the role of Talpid3 and Cep290 in early events of ciliogenesis</title><p>We present a model in which the accumulation of centriolar satellites around the centrosomes in growing cells decreases as cells receive the signal to ciliate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). The loss of satellites is associated with the formation and/or the docking of ciliary vesicles at the distal appendages of the mother centriole, and the subsequent fusion of secondary vesicles leads to the emergence of a capped basal body and a further encapsulated ciliary axoneme. In this setting, distal appendages could serve as a platform onto which vesicles first dock and then fuse. Loss of Talpid3 impairs this process, as evidenced by the accumulation of centriolar satellites and a decrease in the number of cells with ciliary vesicles. It is likely that proteins residing at the distal surface of the centriole/basal body also participate in attachment of the ciliary vesicle, and Talpid3 could play a role here. In this context, it is noteworthy that Talpid3 resides along the ârimâ of the distal end of the centriolar barrel, in close proximity to the distal appendage protein, Cep164 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>).

Even at later stages of cilium induction, Talpid3-ablated cells remain largely arrested in the process of transitioning from a state marked by centriolar satellite accumulation to the next phase of ciliary vesicle formation. In contrast, âcappedâ vesicular structures accumulated in Cep290-depleted cells during these later stages, suggesting a delay at a point subsequent to the dispersal of centriolar satellites. Thus, the early stages of ciliogenesis can be separated into distinct phases involving the loss of centriolar satellites, followed by the formation and docking of a primary ciliary vesicle at the distal appendage, and subsequent fusion with secondary vesicles to enlarge into a continuous vesicle that encapsulates the nascent ciliary axoneme. Our depletion studies thus strongly suggest that Talpid3 and Cep290 participate in overlapping but also distinct stages of cilia formation.</p><p>We note that cells from <italic>Talpid3</italic> mutant chicken embryos did not exhibit an overt accumulation of centriolar satellites, although both mutant embryos and Talpid3-depleted cells exhibited near-complete loss of primary cilia and abnormal microtubular extensions in the absence of vesicle formation (Fig. S5, CâE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2009</xref>). It is likely that divergent findings in the two studies stem from either species-specific or technical differences, such as the use of a null mutant as compared with RNAi-mediated silencing, which was robust but not absolute.</p></sec><sec><title>The intersecting roles of Rab8a, Talpid3, and Cep290</title><p>Our studies also suggest that the regulated targeting and activation of Rab8a to early vesicles could be a pivotal focal point for the control of onset of ciliogenesis. Given that (1) Rab8a accumulates at centrosomes shortly after serum is removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>); (2) Rab8a localization at the centrosome is abrogated by loss of Talpid3 or Cep290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> and Video 1); (3) expression of a constitutively activated form of Rab8a or Rabin8, a GEF for Rab8, in Talpid3- or Cep290-depleted cells rescues ciliogenesis without reversing the accumulation of centriolar satellites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>); and (4) our observation that primary ciliary vesicle docking readily occurs after Cep290 knockdown, but conversion of the ciliary vesicle to fully formed primary cilia is impaired or delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), we suggest that Rab8a acts at a stage of ciliary vesicle formation subsequent to the dispersal of centriolar satellites that could coincide with the enlargement of the ciliary vesicle at the distal tip of the mother centriole. We propose, further, that Talpid3 and Cep290 could act upstream of Rab8a localization and/or activation.</p><p>Because centriolar satellites are known to be involved in trafficking of centrosome proteins, Talpid3 and/or Cep290 might control trafficking of Rab8a to the distal tip of the mother centriole, where ciliary vesicles are formed, through interactions with Rab8a and PCM1. Although we did not detect interactions between Talpid3 or Cep290 and Rabin8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>; and unpublished data), we cannot exclude the possibility that Talpid3 and/or Cep290 regulate other upstream and/or downstream factors of Rab8a. Possible examples include the Cep290-interacting protein Retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR), which is known to function as a GEF for Rab8a in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murga-Zamalloa et al., 2010</xref>), and CC2D2A, a Joubert Syndromeâassociated protein that is required to localize Rab8a to the outer segment of photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachmann-Gagescu et al., 2011</xref>). Additional examples could include Rkip (Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein), Hook2, involved in controlling Rab8a localization during ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baron Gaillard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murga-Zamalloa et al., 2011</xref>), and the BBSome, comprised of proteins defective in Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which interact with PCM1 and Rabin8 and localize to centriolar satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>). Another small GTPase, Rab11, activates Rabin8 during cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">KnÃ¶dler et al., 2010</xref>), and further, Sec15, which is a downstream effector of Rab8 and a component of the exocyst, an evolutionarily conserved complex implicated in intracellular vesicle transport, has been shown to be involved in ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). Talpid3 and/or Cep290 might target one or more of these proteins to regulate ciliary vesicle formation. Future studies will be needed to determine how Talpid3 and Cep290 regulate Rab8a-dependent ciliary vesicle formation.</p><p>Cep290 has also been shown to localize to the transition zone of flagella in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and the primary cilium in mammalian cells using immunoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craige et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kee et al., 2012</xref>). In this setting, it has been postulated that Cep290 tethers the ciliary membrane to transition zone microtubules in mature cilia/flagella. Thus, in addition to the roles we have described here, Cep290 plays an important role much later, after cilia have assembled. However, given that Cep290 also localizes to centriolar satellites, which are primarily observed before the formation of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>), this population of Cep290 is likely to participate during a step distinct from its role in tethering at the transition zone. Our findings indicate that Cep290 participates in the overall process of early ciliation, including centriolar satellite dispersal and PCV-to-CCV transition, which precedes the formation of the transition zone and subsequent elongation of the axoneme. Given that Cep290 is known to associate with a large spectrum of genetic diseases or ciliopathies, including Nephronophthisis, Joubert syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and Meckel-Gruber syndrome, and more than 100 mutations in the <italic>Cep290</italic> gene have been identified thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coppieters et al., 2010</xref>), it is reasonable to postulate that Cep290 functions in multiple ways during cilia formation. It will be interesting to clarify whether each mutation differentially affects the early and late functions of Cep290 during cilia assembly and to determine whether the corresponding ciliopathies result from specific defects in early events in cilium assembly.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and plasmids</title><p>Human RPE1-hTERT, 3T3, 293, U2OS, HeLa, GFP-Rab8a RPE1, and GFP-Rabin8 RPE1 cells (gifts from C.
