        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Through an RNAi-based screen for previously uncharacterized regulators of genome stability, weÂ have identified the human protein C5orf45 as anÂ important factor in preventing the accumulation of DNA damage in human cells. Here, we functionallyÂ characterize C5orf45 as a binding partner of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) damage-sensing complex. Hence, we rename C5orf45 as MRNIP forÂ MRN-interacting protein (MRNIP). We find thatÂ MRNIP is rapidly recruited to sites of DNA damage. Cells depleted of MRNIP display impaired chromatin loading of the MRN complex, resulting in reduced DNA end resection and defective ATM-mediated DNA damage signaling, a reduced ability to repair DNA breaks, and radiation sensitivity. Finally, we show that MRNIP phosphorylation on serine 115 leads to its nuclear localization, and this modification is required for MRNIPâs role in promoting genome stability. Collectively, these data reveal that MRNIP is an important component of the human DNA damage response.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) arise during natural cellular processes, such as immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, replication fork collapse, and meiotic recombination (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kasparek and Humphrey, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Mehta and Haber, 2014</xref>). Likewise, exogenous agents, including ionizing radiation (IR), radiomimetics, and topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as etoposide, also cause DSBs. If left unrepaired, DSBs pose a severe threat to genome stability, leading to chromosomal rearrangements and fragmentation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kasparek and Humphrey, 2011</xref>). DSBs are either repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), an error-prone pathway employed throughout the cell cycle, or homologous recombination (HR), a cell-cycle-phase-specific mechanism that relies on the presence of a correct template sequence on the unaffected sister chromatid (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Chapman etÂ al., 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>The master kinase ATM is potently activated by DSBs, and this process is dependent on the presence of an intact MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">DuprÃ© etÂ al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Paull, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Paull, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</xref>). As such, cells derived from ataxia-telangiectasia-like disease (ATLD) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) patients that express mutant forms of either MRE11 or NBS1, respectively, display greatly reduced ATM activation and a predisposition to cancer development (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Uziel etÂ al., 2003</xref>). In turn, ATM phosphorylates NBS1, and this event is crucial for the formation of IR-induced foci (IRIFs) (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Lim etÂ al., 2000</xref>). Activated ATM then drives the cell-cycle checkpoint response to DSBs via a number of downstream targets, many of which are tumor suppressors, such as TP53, BRCA1, and CHK2.</p>
      <p>Here, we identify an uncharacterized protein, C5orf45, which we rename MRNIP for MRN-interacting protein (MRNIP). We show that MRNIP interacts with the MRN complex in part via a conserved sequence also found within the MRN interaction motif of the DSB-repair-promoting protein CtIP. MRNIP promotes chromatin loading of MRN, and as such, MRNIP-deficient cells exhibit reduced DNA end resection and defects in radiation-induced ATM pathway activation, leading to increased DNA damage and sensitivity to IR. We therefore define MRNIP as a factor involved in cellular responses to DNA damage and highlight that the human genome houses as yet uncharacterized open reading frames with important cellular functions.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <sec id="sec2.1">
        <title>C5orf45 Is a Nuclear Protein that Prevents the Accumulation of DNA Damage</title>
        <p>We recently carried out a genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma-derived cells to identify previously uncharacterized regulators of genome stability, using phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX on Ser139 (Î³H2AX) as a marker of increased DNA damage (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Staples etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Staples etÂ al., 2014</xref>). From this screen, we identified C5orf45, which yielded a relatively high <italic>Z</italic> score of 1.7. C5orf45 is a predicted 40-kDa protein that is well conserved in mammals, flies, fish, and lizards but does not contain any known functional domains and is predicted to be structurally disordered (clustal omega, Pfam, and Phyre, respectively; data not shown), although akin to several intrinsically disordered proteins, an ordered structural conformation could be adopted upon binding an inÂ vivo partner.</p>
        <p>Efficient knockdown of C5orf45 was additionally confirmed in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells using two individual siRNAs that also resulted in an increased proportion of cells with Î³H2AX and 53BP1 foci (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B, respectively), thus validating the initial screen results and reducing the possibility of an off-target effect from a single siRNA. To assess the presence of DNA damage more directly, we next carried out alkaline COMET assays. In agreement with the immunofluorescence data, depletion of C5orf45 with two independent siRNA resulted in a significant increase in COMET tail moment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C), indicating that C5orf45 does indeed have a role in prevention the accumulation of DNA breaks within human cells.</p>
        <p>Due to the lack of good commercial C5orf45 antibodies for immunofluorescence applications, we generated stable HeLa cell lines expressing tetracycline-inducible yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged C5orf45 to further assess its cellular localization. Immunofluorescence analysis of these cell lines revealed that C5orf45 is a nuclear protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D), which is consistent with the presence of a predicted basic nuclear localization motif (NLS) between residues 147 and 150 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D). This was further confirmed in cells expressing ectopic Myc-tagged C5orf45 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>A). Mutation of this motif from RKRK to AAAA (referred to as the 4A NLS mutant) led to a markedly decreased nuclear localization of YFP-C5orf45 compared to wild-type sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D), indicating that this sequence is indeed a functional NLS. We also hypothesized that two additional arginine residues nearby at positions 141 and 154 might play a role in maintaining nuclear localization. Indeed, alanine mutation of these residues on a 4A background (referred to as the 6A NLS mutant) led to an additional decrease in C5orf45 nuclear localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D). Consistent with these data, and the increased amounts of DNA damage in MRNIP-depleted cells, YFP-MRNIP is rapidly recruited to sites of laser-induced DNA damage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E) with similar kinetics to known DNA damage response proteins (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bekker-Jensen etÂ al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Haince etÂ al., 2008</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>C5orf45 Interacts with the MRN Complex</title>
        <p>To gain further insight into the potential role of C5orf45 in the preservation of genome stability through the efficient repair of DNA breaks, we carried out proteomic analyses of purified FLAG-tagged C5orf45 complexes immunoprecipitated from stable cell lines. Among the main potential interactors were all three members of the MRN DSB-sensing complex as well as several substrates of the DDR regulator kinase ATM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). Due to the prevalence of MRN peptides present within the purified C5orf45 complexes, we decided to rename C5orf45 as MRNIP. We also identified peptides from a number of MCM proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A), including MCM8, which promotes MRN-mediated resection of DNA breaks (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Lee etÂ al., 2015</xref>). To validate these potential interactions, we analyzed FLAG-C5orf45 immunoprecipitates and confirmed co-purification of all three MRN complex members (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). This was further confirmed by an interaction between the MRN complex and MRNIP in a stable HEK293 cell line expressing a tetracycline-inducible form of N-terminally FLAG-tagged MRNIP (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>H). Furthermore, we confirmed that MRNIP endogenously co-purifies with MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). This interaction was not enhanced by IR, suggesting a constitutive interaction between MRNIP and the MRN complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C), although we were unable to determine potential direct interactions between MRNIP and the MRN complex due to inadequate amounts of soluble recombinant proteins due to poor expression (data not shown). However, we also detected a dose-dependent interaction between MRNIP and ionizing-radiation-induced phosphorylated NBS1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D), supporting the notion that MRNIP interacts functionally with core components of the DDR.</p>
        <p>As part of our sequence analysis of MRNIP, we identified three SQ motifs at Ser100, Ser115, and Ser143 as potential sites for phosphorylation by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like kinases (PIKKs) ATM, ATR, or DNA-PK. To test whether these residues are phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-MRNIP from cells exposed to IR, excised FLAG-MRNIP bands from SDS-PAGE gels, and analyzed these by mass spectrometry. This revealed a weak phosphorylation on Ser100, with a more-robust phosphorylation on Ser115 (data not shown). To confirm MRNIP phosphorylation, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-MRNIP from stable lines exposed to IR and assessed phosphorylation using an antibody raised against phospho-SQ/TQ peptides. The phospho-SQ/TQ antibody confirmed that MRNIP is phosphorylated, although in contrast to MRNIP-associated NBS1, MRNIP phosphorylation was not radiation dependent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D). Interestingly, cross-reactivity of the phospho-SQ/TQ antibody with MRNIP was not diminished by mutation of either Ser100 or S115 to alanine alone (data not shown) but was reduced in an MRNIP mutant in which all three serine residues at 100, 115, and 143 had been mutated to alanine (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>B). Collectively, these data suggest that MRNIP is constitutively phosphorylated on multiple sites in a potentially redundant manner, albeit via a mechanism that is at present unclear.</p>
        <p>In further support of a functional phosphorylation event at Ser115, alanine substitution of this residue resulted in re-localization of a significant portion of MRNIP from the nucleus to the cytosol (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>C). This is in contrast to Ser100, where a similar alanine substitution had no effect on nuclear localization (data not shown). Additionally, phospho-mimetic mutation of Ser115 to aspartic acid resulted in maintenance of nuclear localization (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>C), suggesting that the presence of a negatively charged amino acid at Ser115 is required for nuclear retention. To determine whether Ser100 and Ser115 phosphorylation are important for the interaction with the MRN complex, we purified wild-type, S100A, or S115A FLAG-MRNIP from tetracycline-inducible HEK293 stable cell lines (we were unfortunately unable to generate stable cell lines expressing similar levels of the S143A mutant; data not shown). Interestingly, alanine substitution of either Ser100 or Ser115 resulted in a moderate decrease in co-immunoprecipitation of MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>E). Because these sites differentially affect MRNIP nuclear localization, we conclude that the observed alteration in MRN interaction is independent of this property. Finally, we investigated whether any of the primary structural features of MRNIP are involved in regulating its interaction with the MRN complex. Immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged 6A NLS mutant revealed that the NLS is not essential for the interaction between MRNIP and the MRN complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>F), and in keeping withÂ this, RAD50 partially relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in cells overexpressing the 6A NLS MRNIP mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>G). Close examination of the MRNIP amino acid sequence revealed that MRNIP contains a short stretch of aminoÂ acids (KELWS) with close homology to the start of a small 25-amino-acid domain in the N terminus of CtIP (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>D), which is involved in the interaction between CtIP and the MRN complex (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Yuan and Chen, 2009</xref>). To assess the potential role of this motif in mediating interaction with the MRN complex, we generated a 25-amino-acid FLAG-tagged deletion mutant of MRNIP encompassing this sequence (Î25). Immunoprecipitation studies revealed a significant decrease in interaction between the Î25 mutant and the MRN complex relative to wild-type MRNIP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>H), suggesting that this sequence may constitute a common MRN interaction motif.</p>

        <title>MRNIP Promotes Efficient Cellular Responses to DNA Breaks</title>
        <p>The MRN complex has a well-established role in ATM activation following DNA damage (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Paull, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Paull, 2015</xref>). Therefore, we examined ATM pathway activation by assessing ATM phosphorylation on Ser1981 and CHK2 on Thr68 via western blotting of extracts from MRNIP-depleted HCT116 cells exposed to IR. Depletion of MRNIP depletion using two independent siRNA resulted in a significant reduction in ATM phosphorylation compared with cells transfected with control non-targeting siRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). Likewise, IR-induced phosphorylation of the ATM target KAP1 was similarly reduced in MRNIP-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A), suggesting that ATM activity is compromised in MRNIP-deficient cells. This is further evidenced by the inability of MRNIP-depleted cells to fully activate a robust IR-induced G2-M checkpoint (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>E). Moreover, MRNIP-depleted cells exhibited reduced IR-induced RAD51 foci formation and defective homology-based repair of DNA breaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D, respectively). Consistent with these data, an increased proportion of MRNIP-depleted cells failed to resolve Î³H2AX foci following exposure to IR and consequently exhibited increased formation of micronuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and 3F, respectively) and increased radiosensitivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>G and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>F), which were comparable to those observed in MRE11-depleted cells (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S1</xref>GâS1J). As activated ATM phosphorylates DNA-PK on Thr2609, an event required for maximal end-joining efficiency and DNA repair (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen etÂ al., 2007</xref>), we hypothesized that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Thr2609 would be defective in MRNIP-depleted cells exposed to IR. Indeed, depletion of MRNIP resulted in a significant decrease in phospho-T2609-positive IR-induced nuclear foci (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2</xref>A and S2B). This phenotype was due to a reduction in the ability of ATM to phosphorylate Thr2609, as co-depletion of MRNIP and ATM failed to cause an additive decrease in Thr2609 foci formation (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>C). The MRN complex has also been implicated in end processing and DNA break tethering during NHEJ-mediated repair, independent of ATM activation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Rass etÂ al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Xie etÂ al., 2009</xref>), although this minor role of the MRN complex within end-joining processes is still poorly defined. Interestingly, MRNIP-depleted cells exhibited a reduced ability to re-ligate a BglII-digested construct by NHEJ (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>D), which was not associated with altered cell-cycle distributions (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>E) and is therefore likely a consequence of reduced MRN activity. Collectively, these data suggest that MRN function is reduced in MRNIP-depleted cells, leading to defective ATM-dependent DNA damage signaling.</p>

        <title>MRNIP Promotes the Chromatin Association of the MRN Complex</title>
        <p>As MRN-dependent resection of DNA breaks is important for robust activation of ATM (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">DuprÃ© etÂ al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Paull, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Paull, 2015</xref>), we next sought to assess whether MRNIP is required for MRN-dependent DNA resection. To achieve this, we used a recently developed system in which resection at specific AsiSi restriction enzyme sites can be quantified by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Zhou etÂ al., 2014</xref>). Similar to RAD50-depleted cells, levels of resection were reduced by approximately 50% in MRNIP-depleted cells compared to cells transfected with a non-targeting control siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). As efficient chromatin association and retention of the MRN complex is important for DNA end resection and subsequent activation of ATM DDR signaling, we assessed chromatin association of the MRN complex by extracting chromatin-bound proteins from MRNIP-depleted cells. Consistent with its nuclear localization, MRNIP was present within the chromatin fraction in a similar abundance to the nucleoplasmic fraction (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S3</xref>A). Interestingly, depletion of MRNIP caused a marked reduction in chromatin-bound MRN in untreated cells and MRN failed to accumulate on chromatin in MRNIP-depleted cells following exposure to IR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B). Consistent with these findings, MRNIP-depleted cells displayed a reduced number of radiation-induced RAD50 foci (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S3</xref>B).</p>
        <p>To investigate the contribution of MRNIP nuclear localization and phosphorylation to its role in promoting MRN chromatin association, we generated HCT116 lines with stably integrated tetracycline-inducible FLAG-WT, FLAG-6A, and FLAG-S115A MRNIP. In agreement with previous results, MRNIP depletion using a siRNA targeted to the 3â² UTR caused a reduction in chromatin-bound MRN, which was rescued by tetracycline-driven induction of wild-type MRNIP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B). However, comparable depletion of MRNIP in nuclear localization-defective FLAG-6A-expressing cells did not rescue MRN chromatin association (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>C). Because RAD50 and NBS1 chromatin association was reduced in FLAG-6A-expressing cells relevant to the wild-type-expressing cells, this phenotype may be somewhat attributable to a dominant-negative effect resulting from small amounts of leaky FLAG-6A expression in the absence of tetracycline. Likewise, MRNIP depletion in the FLAG-S115A cell line hadÂ no additional effect on the already reduced level of MRN on chromatin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). However, the induction of Ser115A-MRNIP caused a marked additional decrease of chromatin-bound MRN, suggesting that Ser115 phosphorylation plays a crucial role in directing MRNIP function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). Consistent with these findings, ectopic expression of wild-type MRNIP, but not the S115A or 6A mutants, was able to rescue DNA damage accumulation, IR sensitivity or HR efficiency induced by depletion of MRNIP with a UTR-directed siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E, 4F, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>C, respectively). Similarly, the Î25 mutant MRNIP, which affects its ability to interact with the MRN complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>H), was also unable to rescue these defects in MRNIP-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E, 4F, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>C, respectively). Collectively, these data reveal that MRNIP, through its interaction with the MRN complex, is required for robust cellular responses to DNA breaks by promoting chromatin association of the MRN complex and subsequent activation of the ATM-signaling cascade.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>During our ongoing characterization of previously uncharacterized genome maintenance factors highlighted by a genome-wide siRNA screen, we identified MRNIP/C5orf45. Here, we demonstrate that C5orf45 is an MRNIP that promotes chromatin association and activity of the MRN complex to facilitate subsequent ATM-mediated DNA damage response signaling and repair. Our data suggest that, although MRNIP is not an essential part of this complex per se, it provides an important accessory role to MRN function. Interestingly, recent findings from others have shown that DNA damage accumulation in NBS1-deficient cells is a consequence of the defective resolution of replication fork intermediates (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bruhn etÂ al., 2014</xref>), and our preliminary data suggest that this may also be true in MRNIP-depleted cells as evidenced by increased amounts of RPA foci in unstressed MRNIP-depleted cells (data not shown) and the presence of MCM factors in purified MRNIP complexes. In this regard, MRNIP may carry out similar biological functions to the ATM-interactingÂ protein ATMIN, which can regulate ATM-mediated responses to replication-associated DNA damage (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Kanu etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt etÂ al., 2014</xref>). It will therefore be interesting in future studies to precisely assess such intermediates and the fate of MRNIP-depleted cells both under non-stressed conditions and in response to various DNA damage and replication-stress-inducing stimuli.</p>
      <p>We also report here that the interaction between MRNIP and the MRN complex is partially facilitated by a small domain with similarity to the MRN-interaction motif found in CtIP, suggesting that this may be a common MRN-interacting motif. We also determine that MRNIP nuclear localization is mediated by a basic NLS, which is in part directed by phosphorylation of MRNIP at Ser115. Although this phosphorylation site is a potential target for PIKKs, we found no evidence for DNA damage responsive phosphorylation of MRNIP at this site. In fact, using an SQ/TQ-specific phospho-antibody, we detected constitutive phosphorylation of MRNIP in the absence of any DNA-damaging stimulus, which was only reduced when all three serine residues at 100, 115, and 143 were mutated to alanine. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Casein kinase 1 (CK1), or CK2 did not result in any discernible alteration to nuclear localization of MRNIP (data not shown). Therefore, the identity of the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation event on MRNIP currently remains elusive; however, further elucidating how phosphorylation of MRNIP impacts its cellular function is certainly worthy of further study. Finally, though neither the 6A NLS nor the Ser115A mutant can rescue damage and repair phenotypes caused by MRNIP depletion, it is important to note that this may represent the consequences of the disruptive effects observed following overexpression of these mutant proteins, namely the cellular re-localization of MRN and/or its displacement from chromatin.</p>
      <p>Consistent with a core role in the repair of DNA DSBs, generation of mice with MRN-null alleles results in early embryonic lethality (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Luo etÂ al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Zhu etÂ al., 2001</xref>). Knockout mice of the MRNIP homolog 3010026O09Rik have been generated as part of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IMKC). In contrast to MRN-null mice, MRNIP-null mice develop to term, an observation in keeping with the relatively normal overall levels of the MRN complex and the considerable residual ATM activation observed in MRNIP-depleted cells. Interestingly, MRNIP mutant homozygote males are completely infertile, a phenotype associated with high levels of DNA damage in the testis (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Lewis and Simon, 2010</xref>). Staining of MRNIP in mouse tissues also showed that MRNIP is highly expressed in the testis, but not the ovary (IMKC data). These phenotypes are therefore consistent with the accumulation of DNA damage in MRNIP-deficient cells. The effects of the genetic ablation of murine MRNIP on tumor incidence in mouse models of cancer and the incidence of tumors in aged MRNIP-null mice might therefore be worthy of investigation.</p>
      <p>Deficiency in DDR proteins is causative for a range of human disorders (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>). This includes the autosomal recessive conditions NBS, ATLD, and NBS-like disorder (NBSLD), where the NBS1, MRE11, and RAD50 genes, respectively, contain loss-of-function mutations (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">OâDriscoll and Jeggo, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Waltes etÂ al., 2009</xref>). Symptoms are more severe in NBS and classical A-T compared to ATLD and NBSLD and include microcephaly, neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and predisposition to cancer. Although comparable to siRNA depletion of MRE11, MRNIP depletion does not phenocopy the drastic loss of MRN components observed in ATLD, NBS, or NBSLD cells; one might expect that any DDR-related disorder resulting from mutation or loss of MRNIP function would have a much milder phenotype than these severe conditions. Nonetheless, our data suggest that disruption to MRNIP function could potentially contribute to genome instability. Analysis of online cancer genomics resources reveals that MRNIP is downregulated in several cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and amplified in 18% of renal clear cell carcinomas, which may be worth further study. In summary, we define MRNIP as a DDR factor that promotes genome stability and highlight that the human genome contains currently uncharacterized proteins with important biological functions.</p>

        <p>Cells were scraped and re-suspended in 300Â Î¼l of buffer I (10Â mM HEPES, 10Â mM KCl, 1.5Â mM MgCl2, 500Â Î¼M PMSF, 1Â mM DTT, and protease inhibitor; Roche) and incubated on ice for 15Â min. Six microliters of 10% Nonidet P-40 were added to the cell lysates and vortexed for 5â10 s. Nuclear pellets were prepared by centrifuging at 6,000Â Ã <italic>g</italic> for 5Â min. The nuclear pellet was re-suspended in 50Â Î¼l of buffer II containing 20Â mM HEPES, 0.42Â M NaCl, 1.5Â mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2Â mM EDTA, and 25% v/v glycerol. After 40Â min, the nuclear extracts were centrifuged at 13,000Â Ã <italic>g</italic> for 10Â min at 4Â°C. The protein concentration of the extracts was determined via Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturerâs instruction. The nuclear extracts were stored at â80Â°C. Linearized pDsRed2ER plasmid substrates were generated by digestion with BglII and purified using QIAGEN gel extraction kit. One hundred fifty nanograms of substrates were incubated with 0, 2, or 4Â Î¼g of nuclear protein extracts in the E-J reaction buffer (1Â mM ATP, 0.25Â mM dNTP, 25Â mM Tris acetate, 100Â mM potassium acetate, 10Â mM magnesium acetate, 1Â mM DTT [pH 7.5]) for 1Â hr at 37Â°C. The reaction was treated with 1Â mg/ml proteinase K at 65Â°C for 30Â min and then electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel. DNA was detected by EtBr staining.</p>

        <title>HR Assay</title>
        <p>Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either pDR-GFP alone, I-SceI plasmid alone, or both plasmids in combination. For rescue experiments, parental DR-GFP U2OS cells or cells stably expressing FLAG-MRNIP were transfected with a control siRNA or a UTR-directed MRNIP siRNA, followed by transfection with an I-SceI expression vector. Twenty-four to seventy-two hours later, cell populations were trypsinized, fixed in ethanol, and immediately processed on a BD LSR II FACS machine for the presence of GFP, using DR-GFP-only transfected cells to set the baseline. Alternatively, U2OS DR-GFP cells were transfected siRNA and 6Â hr later, transfected with a plasmid encoding the I-SceI meganuclease. The next day, the media was refreshed, and after a further 48Â hr, cells were trypsinized and analyzed for GFP positivity by flow cytometry using a Partec CyFlow Cube8 cytometer. At least 100,000 cells were counted per sample.</p>

        <title>Resection Assay</title>
        <p>Quantitation of DSB resection in U2OS ER-AsiSi cells was performed according to the protocol established by the Paull lab (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Zhou etÂ al., 2014</xref>). After 72Â hr post-siRNA transfection, cells were treated with vehicle (ethanol) or 300Â nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Four hours later, cells were trypsinized, re-suspended in a ball of 0.6% agarose, and washed in several buffers over the course of 3Â days. The agar ball was then washed with 0.5Â M EDTA, 2% N-lauroylsarcosine, 1Â mg/ml proteinase-K, 1Â mM CaCl2, pH 8.0 (ESP), 1.85Â M NaCl, 0.15Â M KCl, 5Â mM MgCl2, 2Â mM EDTA, 4Â mM Tris, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.5 (HS), and phosphate buffers before melting and re-suspension in the appropriate restriction enzyme buffer. Genomic DNA (20Â Î¼l) was then either digested or mock digested with 20 units of restriction enzymes (BsrGI or HindIII-HF; New England Biolabs) at 37Â°C overnight. Twenty nanograms of these samples were used in qPCR reactions run on an Abi 7900 Real-Time PCR System. The Ct value of the mock-digested sample was subtracted from the Ct value of the digested sample, and the percentage of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was calculated using the formula: ssDNA%Â = 1/(2Ë(ÎCt â 1)Â + 0.5) Ã 100.</p>

        <title>Alkaline COMET Assay</title>
        <p>COMET assays were performed using the Trevigen kit system according to the manufacturersâ protocol. Briefly, cells were re-suspended at 1Â Ã 10<sup>5</sup> per ml in low-melting-point agarose and transferred to the COMET slide. After setting, slides were incubated for 30Â min in lysis solution and then in unwinding solution for 20Â min. Slides were then electrophoresed at 21Â V for 30Â min before rinsing twice in water and once in 70% ethanol. After drying, cells were stained with SYBR Green and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Tail area and moment were analyzed from 100 cells per condition using COMETScore software from three independent experiments.</p>

        <p>MRNIP Depletion Results in DNA Damage</p>

        <p>(A) Parental HEK293 cells or HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-MRNIP were grown in large-scale culture. Cells were lysed, and FLAG-MRNIP was immunoprecipitated using the FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads. FLAG-MRNIP was eluted using 150Â ng/ml 3Ã FLAG peptide, and the resulting eluates were boiled and resolved by SDS-PAGE and proteomic analysis carried out to identify interacting proteins. The number of unique peptides from putative interactors is shown.</p>

        <p>MRNIP Promotes MRN Chromatin Loading to Facilitate ATM-Mediated DDR Signaling</p>
        <p>(A) Assessment of DNA end resection in U2OS AsiSi cell models (courtesy of GaÃ«lle Legube) transfected with either control siRNA or two individual siRNAs targeting MRNIP, with RAD50 siRNA serving as a positive control. The negative and positive control siRNA data represent cells treated with vehicle (ethanol) or 300Â nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen, respectively, to induce a site-specific DNA break. The average percentage of ssDNA normalized to untreated controls for each siRNA-treated population is shown from three independent experiments with their respective SEMs.</p>
        <p>(B) HCT116 cells were transfected with non-targeting control siRNA or two individual siRNAs targeting MRNIP. After 72Â hr, cells were exposed to IR (5 Gy) and trypsinized after 45Â min. Following collection by centrifugation, cells were fractionated, the chromatin-bound protein fraction resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blots probed with the indicated antibodies. Quantification of these data reveals that MRNIP-depleted cells have between 50% and 80% less chromatin-bound MRN complex compared with control siRNA-transfected cells.</p>
        <p>(C) HCT116 cells stably expressing tetracycline-inducible FLAG-tagged WT or 6A NLS MRNIP were transfected with control siRNA or an siRNA directed against the 3â² UTR of MRNIP. After 24Â hr, either vehicle or tetracycline was added to the cells. After a further 48Â hr, cells were fractionated before chromatin extraction, SDS-PAGE, and blotting using the indicated antibodies. Quantification of these data reveals that cells expressing WT MRNIP exhibit an average 2.7-fold increase in chromatin-bound MRN complex compared with un-induced UTR siRNA-transfected cells, which is not replicated in cells expressing 6A NLS mutant MRNIP.</p>
        <p>(D) HCT116 cells stably expressing tetracycline-inducible FLAG-tagged WT or S115A MRNIP were transfected with control siRNA or an siRNA directed against the 3â² UTR of MRNIP. After 24Â hr, either vehicle or tetracycline was added to the cells. After a further 48Â hr, cells were fractionated before chromatin extraction, SDS-PAGE, and blotting using the indicated antibodies. Quantification of these data reveals that cells expressing WT MRNIP exhibit an average 2.4-fold increase in chromatin-bound MRN complex compared with un-induced UTR siRNA-transfected cells, which is not replicated in cells expressing S115A mutant MRNIP.</p>
