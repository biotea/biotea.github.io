        <p>Epithelialâmesenchymal transition (EMT), crucial during embryogenesis for new tissue and organ formation, is also considered to be a prerequisite to cancer metastasis. We report here that the protein tyrosine phosphatase Pez is expressed transiently in discrete locations in developing brain, heart, pharyngeal arches, and somites in zebrafish embryos. We also find that Pez knock-down results in defects in these organs, indicating a crucial role in organogenesis. Overexpression of Pez in epithelial MDCK cells causes EMT, with a drastic change in cell morphology and function that is accompanied by changes in gene expression typical of EMT. Transfection of Pez induced TGFÎ² signaling, critical in developmental EMT with a likely role also in oncogenic EMT. In zebrafish, TGFÎ²3 is co- expressed with Pez in a number of tissues and its expression was lost from these tissues when Pez expression was knocked down. Together, our data suggest Pez plays a crucial role in organogenesis by inducing TGFÎ² and EMT.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epithelialâmesenchymal transition (EMT) is fundamental during early development for the reorganization of groups of progenitor cells within a preexisting epithelium into complex sets of juxtaposing tissues, thus allowing new inductive patterning events necessary for organogenesis. In addition to the formation of the three germ layers and the neural crest, EMTs give rise to, amongst others, sclerotome from ventral somites; endocardial cushions of the atrio-ventricular (A-V) canal of the heart from the endocardial epithelium; and bones, cartilage, and musculature from cells of the neural plate (for review see <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Savagner, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Shook and Keller, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The process of EMT enables epithelial cells, which are normally constrained by cell-to-cell adherence, to delaminate and take on the invasive and migratory properties that are a feature of mesenchymal cells. Aberrant reactivation of this process in the adult can give rise to undesirable pathological states such as tumor progression, whereby delamination of the tumor cells and acquisition of invasive and migratory properties is the forebear of metastatic disease (for review see <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Thiery, 2002</xref>). Loss of E-cadherin expression facilitates the loss of cell-cell adhesion. This is often achieved during EMT by the induction of repressors of E-cadherin transcription, such as Snail, ZEB1/Î´EF1 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Grooteclaes and Frisch, 2000</xref>), ZEB2/SIP1 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Comijn et al., 2001</xref>), E47 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Perez- Moreno et al., 2001</xref>), Twist (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2004</xref>), and Slug/Snail2 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bolos et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>In vivo, the importance of E-cadherin transcriptional repressors in EMT is demonstrated by the role of Snail in EMT. Snail-null mice cannot complete gastrulation because they fail to down-regulate E-cadherin to undergo EMT (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Carver et al., 2001</xref>). Evidence is also accumulating that indicates a role for Snail and other transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin in cancer progression. In malignant tumors in general, E-cadherin expression correlates with more highly differentiated cancers that exhibit cellâcell adhesion and are less invasive (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Thiery, 2002</xref>). Elevated expression of Snail1, ZEB1, and Twist have been found in metastatic cancer cell lines and invasive human cancers, with concomitant loss of E-cadherin expression in these cell lines and tissues (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Peinado et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). Although these observations clearly illustrate that regulation of E-cadherin and its transcriptional repressors are key elements in embryonal and pathological EMT, the molecular events that initiate the EMT are ill defined.</p>
      <p>The TGFÎ²s are pleiotrophic cytokines that regulate cellular functions ranging from embryonal development to maintaining homeostasis in the adult. The three mammalian TGFÎ² isoforms (TGFÎ²1, TGFÎ²2, and TGFÎ²3) show high sequence homology and have overlapping functions. Most cells, including epithelial cells, make TGFÎ²s and express TGFÎ² receptors (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fleisch et al., 2006</xref>); hence, the TGFÎ²s can act in a paracrine, autocrine, and/or endocrine fashion (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Smith, 1996</xref>). The role of TGFÎ² in EMT, where it regulates cellâcell adhesion, cytoskeletal remodelling, and cell-matrix adhesion, is well documented (for review see <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Zavadil and Bottinger, 2005</xref>). In embryonal development, TGFÎ² plays a role in organogenesis in the late stages of embryogenesis. The requirement for TGFÎ² in EMT in the formation of the endocardial cushions during cardiac valve development (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Romano and Runyan, 2000</xref>) and in EMT involved in palate fusion (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kaartinen et al., 1995</xref>) support a role for TGFÎ² in EMT in vivo. TGFÎ² has also been shown to play opposing roles in oncogenesis and metastasis (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Roberts and Wakefield, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2003</xref>). In the early stages of carcinogenesis, its epithelial growth suppressive properties liken its role to that of a tumor suppressor. However, in tumor cells that have progressed to evade its anti-proliferative effects, apoptosis and anoikis, TGFÎ² can promote oncogenic EMT leading to an increase in invasiveness and motility, the beginnings of metastasis.</p>
      <p>Phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues by tyrosine kinases and the reversal of the process by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) regulate many diverse cellular functions from proliferation to differentiation. The PTP Pez is an intracellular PTP that is located at the adherens junctions (AJ) in endothelial and epithelial cells (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Wadham et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Dominant-negative mutants of Pez induce an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation at the AJ, which together with the observation that Pez directly dephosphorylates Î²-catenin (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Wadham et al., 2003</xref>) suggests that Pez plays a role in regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the AJ. However, Pez can be localized elsewhere in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Wadham et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that it may have other targets and functions apart from regulating the phosphorylation status of the AJ. Here, we show that Pez expression in zebrafish embryos is developmentally regulated and that knocking down its expression results in embryos with defective organ development. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed a role for Pez in regulating TGFÎ² and EMT, processes critical for the formation of new tissues and organs during embryonic development.</p>

        <title>Pez expression is transiently induced at specific stages during zebrafish embryogenesis</title>
        <p>The temporal and spatial expression profiles of a gene in the context of a whole organism can shed light on its physiological function. To assess whether Pez has a developmental role, we examined its temporal and spatial expression profiles during zebrafish embryonal development up to 48 h post-fertilization (hpf) by whole-mount in situ hybridization. With the exception of maternally derived mRNA present up to 4 hpf (unpublished data), Pez expression was not detectable until 16 hpf, at which time it became faintly detectable throughout the embryo (unpublished data). Between 22â24 hpf Pez expression was strongest in the ventricular/subventricular zone of the developing brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), a region rich in proliferating and migrating neuronal progenitors. Pez expression in the brain subsequently declined, with very low levels remaining at 36 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Pez expression was also detected in the somites at 24 hpf, but was no longer detectable by 36 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>; Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705035/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705035/DC1</ext-link>), suggesting that Pez may play a role in the later stages of somite maturation. Transient Pez expression was also observed during cardiac development. Pez expression was visible in the early developing heart tube at 24 hpf, reaching a peak between 42â44 hpf and then rapidly down-regulated, so that by 48 hpf little Pez expression remained (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Another tissue in which Pez expression was observed is the pectoral fin, where little or no Pez expression was detected in the fin bud at 36 hpf, but more sustained expression was observed, between 42 to 48 hpf, the latest time point investigated. These examples of transient Pez expression at specific stages of tissue development suggest that Pez plays a regulatory role in development.</p>

        <p>To determine whether Pez plays a crucial role in the regulation of developmental processes, three different antisense morpholino- oligonucleotides (MOs) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), designed to inhibit translation of Pez protein, were microinjected into zebrafish embryos at the one- to four-cell stage. Embryos injected with a control MO were indistinguishable from uninjected controls, whereas injection with each of the anti-Pez MOs produced identical morphant phenotypes.</p>

        <p>Pez morphants displayed a number of defects in several organs and tissues (summarized in Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705035/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705035/DC1</ext-link>) that correlated with regions of Pez expression (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Most notable was a severe pericardial edema obvious by 2â3 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, B and C; Fig. S2). From in situ hybridization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we had noted that Pez expression generally peaks after the rudimentary tissues and organs have formed, suggesting that Pez may play a role in the development of specific structures within the organs rather than in initiating organ development. In concordance with this hypothesis, the organs were formed in the Pez morphants, but with architectural defects in multiple organs and tissues. Somites and somite boundaries were formed in Pez morphants, but the boundaries were irregular (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). In the ventricular/subventricular zone of the brain, a region with strong Pez expression in wild-type embryos at 24 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), there was an increase in cellular density and expansion of the ventricular zone at the expense of the cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>) in the Pez morphants compared with uninjected or control MO- injected embryos. Similarly, structural defects were observed in the formation of the pharyngeal arches, which included a higher cellular density, shortening, and poor formation of the cartilage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>).</p>
        <p>The severe pericardial edema observed in Pez morphants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, B and C; Fig. S2) is symptomatic of defects in cardiac function. To further evaluate cardiac function in Pez morphants, we used fli1-GFP transgenic zebrafish, which express GFP in the endothelial cells comprising the endocardium (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Lawson and Weinstein, 2002</xref>), to visualize structure and function of the atrium, ventricle, and the atrio-ventricular (A-V) valve in live embryos. By 53 hpf, the developing heart of control-injected embryos had begun to loop and the atrium and ventricle were partially superimposed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 H</xref>). The A-V valves between the two chambers were well developed and opened and shut in synchrony with rhythmic contractions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 H</xref>; Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705035/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705035/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, the heart of Pez morphants remained tubular, suggesting a defect in looping, and they lacked patent A-V valves (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 I</xref>; Video 2), which normally function to prevent regurgitation of blood back into the atrium during rhythmic contractions. We also observed a loss of unidirectional blood flow in the atrium of Pez morphants when the movements of blood cells in the atrium were tracked (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 J</xref>), supporting a lack of functional A-V valve.</p>

        <title>Pez-overexpressing MDCK epithelial cells undergo EMT</title>
        <p>The expression profile of Pez during zebrafish development indicates that its expression is low or absent until required, whereupon it is highly up-regulated in specific tissues and contributes to organogenesis. To elucidate the molecular events induced by such a marked increase in Pez expression, we overexpressed Pez in MDCK epithelial cells and selected for clonal lines (referred to as Pez-MDCK cells). Pez overexpression transformed the normal epithelial morphology of MDCK cells into a fibroblast-like morphology (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), whereas cells transfected with the empty expression vector (vector-MDCK) remained indistinguishable from parental MDCK cells. The transformation to fibroblast-like morphology appeared to occur in two steps: an initial scattering phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, middle) that was evident â¼2â3 wks after transfection and clonal selection was followed by a more spindly and elongated morphology (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, right) typical of epithelial cells that have undergone EMT. The Pez-MDCK cells appeared to have lost cellâcell contact, consistent with loss of junctional E-cadherin visualized by indirect immunofluorescence (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Khew-Goodall and Wadham, 2005</xref>). Total E-cadherin protein expression was examined in four representative Pez-MDCK clones and found to be highly down-regulated compared with a pool of vector-MDCK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), suggesting that the loss of junctional E-cadherin was not merely due to a translocation of the protein away from the cell junctions. Similar results were obtained in a repeat of the experiment in which three individual vector-MDCK clones and another four representative Pez-MDCK clones were analyzed (unpublished data). Analysis of E-cadherin mRNA expression in these clones by qRT-PCR indicated that E-cadherin mRNA was also markedly down-regulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Averaging the data from four independent Pez-MDCK clones and three vector-MDCK clones, a &gt;30-fold reduction in E-cadherin mRNA was observed in Pez-MDCK clones. The Pez-MDCK clones also had markedly up-regulated fibronectin (an extracellular matrix protein secreted by mesenchymal cells) compared with the vector-MDCK clones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). In addition, using a Boyden chamber assay to measure motility, two representative Pez-MDCK clones were found to be highly motile compared with vector-MDCK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). The alteration of cellular morphology accompanying Pez overexpression in MDCK cells, together with the loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and gain of mesenchymal marker (fibronectin) and function (motility), suggests that Pez had induced an EMT.</p>

        <title>PezâMDCK cells express EMT-promoting transcription factors</title>
        <p>Many studies have shown that the loss of E-cadherin expression associated with EMT is a consequence of transcriptional repression of the E-cadherin gene, particularly by the zinc finger transcriptional repressors such as Snail and Slug (for review see <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Peinado et al., 2004</xref>). We compared the mRNA levels of the E-cadherin repressors Snail, Slug, ZEB1, and ZEB2 between Pez-MDCK and vector-MDCK cells. Snail and Slug expression were elevated in all four Pez-MDCK clones analyzed, averaging â¼5- and â¼8-fold higher, respectively, than expression in the vector-MDCK clones (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>), while ZEB1 and ZEB2 were induced â¼9- and â¼30-fold, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>). The marked loss of E-cadherin mRNA along with the induction of expression of the E-cadherin repressors Snail, Slug, ZEB1, and ZEB2 suggest that the Pez-induced reduction in E-cadherin is due to transcriptional repression.</p>

        <title>Pez induces TGFÎ² production</title>
        <p>TGFÎ² has previously been shown to induce an EMT in MDCK and other epithelial cells through induction of all or a subset of the transcription repressors Snail, Slug, ZEB1, and ZEB2 (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Zavadil and Bottinger, 2005</xref>), all of which were induced in Pez-MDCK cells. We therefore investigated the possibility that Pez may be mediating its effects through the action of TGFÎ². By qRT-PCR, we found that the mRNAs for TGFÎ²-1, -2, and -3 were 5, 3, and 15Ã higher, respectively, in the Pez-MDCK cells than in the vector-MDCK cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). To determine whether increased TGFÎ² mRNA expression in the Pez-MDCK cells was accompanied by increased secretion of active TGFÎ² capable of inducing an EMT, conditioned medium from the Pez-MDCK cells cultured for 72 h was collected and used to culture parental MDCK cells. After 1â2 d, parental MDCK cells cultured in Pez-MDCKâconditioned medium began to lose cellâcell contact and scatter, whereas cells cultured in control parental MDCK cell conditioned medium remained unaltered (unpublished data). After 4â6 d in culture in Pez-MDCK conditioned medium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>, Pez CM), the parental MDCK cells underwent a transformation to a spindly fibroblast-like morphology resembling that of Pez-MDCK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and cells treated with rhTGFÎ² (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>, rhTGFÎ²) that have undergone an EMT. In contrast, parental MDCK cells cultured in conditioned medium from parental (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>, parental MDCK CM) or vector-MDCK cells (unpublished data) remained epithelial and indistinguishable from cells cultured in normal medium (unpublished data). These observations suggest that Pez-MDCK conditioned medium contained a soluble factor that was able to promote EMT in a similar fashion to rhTGFÎ², and that this factor was not present at levels sufficient to induce EMT in conditioned medium obtained from parental MDCK or vector-MDCK cells. The transition to a mesenchymal morphology induced by Pez-MDCK conditioned medium was inhibited by the addition of the inhibitor of TGFÎ² receptor kinase activity, SB-431542, and by a blocking pan-TGFÎ² Ab to the Pez-MDCKâconditioned medium, but not by an anti-HGF Ab (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>), suggesting that the EMT-promoting factor secreted by Pez-MDCK cells was active TGFÎ².</p>

        <title>Transient Pez overexpression activates canonical TGFÎ² signaling</title>
        <p>In Pez-MDCK cell lines, Pez expression has persisted over a long period of time, raising the possibility that TGFÎ² secretion and subsequent signaling may be an indirect consequence of Pez overexpression. In mammalian cells, ligand binding to the TGFÎ² receptor triggers downstream signaling by phosphorylation of the R-Smads, which then complex with the coSmad, Smad4, and translocate into the nucleus (for review see <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Massague and Chen, 2000</xref>). To address the kinetics of Pez-induced TGFÎ² signaling, we initially examined the effect of Pez expression on Smad4 nuclear translocation in transient transfection assays at 24 h post-transfection, when at least 50% of the Pez-transfected cells showed elevated Pez expression compared with empty vector-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). In control empty vector-transfected MDCK cells, Smad4 remained predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). In contrast, in MDCK cells transfected with Pez, Smad4 was translocated into the nucleus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>), suggesting that Pez overexpression induces Smad-dependent TGFÎ² signaling. Addition of a neutralising TGFÎ² Ab following Pez transfection blocked nuclear translocation of Smad4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>), confirming that the nuclear localization of Smad4 was TGFÎ² specific. The ablation of Smad nuclear translocation by the exogenous addition of TGFÎ² Ab also indicates that the activation of TGFÎ² signaling by Pez involves the secretion of active TGFÎ².</p>

Examination of Smad4 subcellular localization at 12 h post-transfection showed an increase in nuclear Smad in cells with elevated Pez expression, suggesting that canonical TGFÎ² signaling is induced shortly after Pez expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). The expression of TGFÎ² mRNAs was also assayed by qRT-PCR up to 24 h post-transfection, but no induction was detected (unpublished data), suggesting that TGFÎ² production induced by Pez initially occurs by post-transcriptional mechanisms. No analyses were performed beyond 24 h post-transfection, as Pez expression began to decline after this point (unpublished data), making the interpretation of data obtained beyond 24 h post-transfection equivocal.</p>

        <title>Pez regulates TGFÎ²3 expression in zebrafish embryos</title>
        <p>The induction of TGFÎ² signaling and mRNA synthesis by Pez in vitro prompted us to investigate if this is paralleled in vivo. Published data on the pattern of TGFÎ²3 expression (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheah et al., 2005</xref>) revealed that its expression closely resembled that seen for Pez in zebrafish embryos. We therefore compared the profiles of Pez and TGFÎ²3 expression during zebrafish development and found that they coexpressed in the same subset of cells in the ventricular zone of the brain at 24 hpf (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>) and in the endocardial cells of the heart at 44 hpf (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>). We also noted that TGFÎ²3 was expressed in some tissues where Pez was not expressed, such as in the lens of the developing eye at 24 hpf (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In addition to the co-temporal expression of Pez and TGFÎ²3, the high degree of spatial correlation, particularly in the ventricular zone of the brain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>) and in the heart (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>), is highly consistent with the notion that in these developing tissues Pez may up-regulate TGFÎ²3 expression. To explore this further, we examined the expression of TGFÎ²3 in Pez morphants at 24 hpf. Unlike embryos at later stages of development, the morphology and architecture of the developing brain and heart tube of the Pez morphants at 24 hpf are not overtly different from control MO-injected or wild-type embryos. Although morphologically similar at 24 hpf, expression of TGFÎ²3 was undetectable in the ventricular zone of the brain and the heart tube in the Pez morphants, in contrast to control embryos where TGFÎ²3 was clearly expressed in these tissues (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). It is also worth noting that in the lens of the developing eye where Pez is not expressed, TGFÎ²3 expression was unaffected by knocking down Pez expression (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>EMT is a process shown to be essential for cell movement to facilitate the formation of new tissues and organs during development. Collectively, several lines of evidence generated from this study indicate that Pez is a novel regulator of TGFÎ²-mediated EMT in vitro and of organogenesis during embryonal development. Epithelial MDCK cells overexpressing Pez underwent morphological and functional changes, including the acquisition of cell motility, characteristic of an EMT. The morphological and functional changes were accompanied by and are likely to be a consequence of changes in gene expression typical of EMT, including loss of E-cadherin and up-regulation of the EMT-inducing transcription factors, Snail, Slug, ZEB1, and ZEB2. The transient nature of Pez expression during zebrafish development which correlated with specific stages of organ development suggests that Pez plays a role in regulating organogenesis. This is further supported by data obtained from zebrafish hypomorphic for Pez expression where we observed developmental defects in all organs that expressed Pez during development. Given that Pez can promote EMT in vitro, some or all of the defects observed in these morphant embryos may be due to an inability to induce EMT during organ development.</p>
      <p>The role of TGFÎ² as a driver of developmental EMT is well recognized although little is known of the mechanisms that initiate TGFÎ² activation. In these studies we made several observations suggesting that Pez is a novel inducer of TGFÎ² signaling. In Pez-MDCK cell lines, TGFÎ² secretion is up-regulated to a level capable of promoting EMT. In addition, transient Pez overexpression induces TGFÎ² secretion and canonical Smad-dependent TGFÎ² signaling within 6 h of its expression, suggesting that TGFÎ² signaling is activated as an immediate-early response to Pez expression. The early activation of TGFÎ² by Pez was, however, not accompanied by increases in TGFÎ² mRNAs, suggesting that this initial activation occurs by post-transcriptional mechanisms which may be due to activation of latent TGFÎ² (for review see <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Massague and Chen, 2000</xref>) or de-repression of translation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et al., 2002</xref>). At later stages following Pez expression, TGFÎ² mRNAs were up-regulated as seen in Pez-MDCK cell lines that had undergone an EMT. It is well documented that TGFÎ² induces its own transcription (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Van Obberghen-Schilling et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bascom et al., 1989</xref>) and we suggest that the initial activation of canonical TGFÎ² signaling by Pez acts to induce subsequent de novo synthesis of TGFÎ² mRNAs by an autoinductive mechanism. This is supported by studies in our laboratory showing that exogenous addition of rhTGFÎ²<sub>1</sub> to MDCK cells induced TGFÎ²<sub>2</sub> and TGFÎ²<sub>3</sub> mRNAs after several days of stimulation (unpublished data). Furthermore, in other studies we have also found that the exogenous addition of rhTGFÎ²<sub>1</sub> to MDCK cells induced the downstream effectors of EMT, Snail1 (Fig. S3), ZEB1, and ZEB2 (unpublished data), albeit this also took 3 d or more of continuous stimulation to achieve substantial levels of induction. Together, these observations suggest that Pez initially induces TGFÎ² activation by post-transcriptional mechanisms and the resultant activation of canonical TGFÎ² signaling then acts in an autocrine feed-forward mechanism to activate subsequent transcription of TGFÎ²s and the downstream effectors of EMT. Finally, the high degree of correlation between Pez and TGFÎ²3 expression in the developing brain and heart of zebrafish embryos and the loss of TGFÎ²3 expression in these tissues when Pez was knocked down strongly supports our in vitro data that Pez regulates TGFÎ² production.</p>
      <p>In the developing heart, rhythmic contractions signifying the beginning of cardiac development are evident at â¼22 hpf and development continues for several days (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Beis et al., 2005</xref>). Although Pez expression was evident at 24 hpf, strong expression was not observed until 36 hpf (unpublished data), suggesting that it is not essential for the early stages of cardiac development, a notion supported by the development of atrium, ventricle, and rhythmic contractions in the Pez morphants. Instead, strong Pez expression in the heart coincides with looping of the heart tube and specification of the AV canal, which begin around 36 and 37 hpf, respectively (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Yelon and Stainier, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Walsh and Stainier, 2001</xref>). In the early steps of A-V valve development, the designated endocardial cells of the A-V canal undergo a TGFÎ²-dependent EMT to form the endocardial cushions, which precede formation of the A-V valves (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Romano and Runyan, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Bischoff, 2004</xref>). In zebrafish development, this begins at â¼45â48 hpf when Notch1b expression, which is required in conjunction with TGFÎ² signaling to induce EMT (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Timmerman et al., 2004</xref>), is restricted to the A-V canal (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Westin and Lardelli, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Walsh and Stainier, 2001</xref>). Our studies show that Pez expression persists until â¼48 hpf and in 44-hpf embryos both Pez and TGFÎ²3 colocalize to the endocardium, coinciding precisely with the timing of restricted Notch1b expression at the A-V canal and the onset of EMT. The defects in cardiac valve development and loss of TGFÎ²3 expression when Pez is knocked down strongly suggest that Pez plays a role in initiating TGFÎ²3- induced EMT in cardiac valve development. However, TGFÎ² isoforms have also been found to be expressed in newly formed mesenchyme as a consequence of EMT (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barnett et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Camenisch et al., 2002</xref>) and that they play subsequent roles in further valve development and remodelling. If Pez expression results in activation of latent TGFÎ², Pez may have a more far-reaching role in cardiac valve formation beyond the initial induction of EMT.</p>
      <p>Zebrafish embryos hypomorphic for Pez expression showed a loss of TGFÎ²3 expression and increased cellularity in the ventricular zone of the developing brain at the expense of the cortex, indicative of increased proliferation of the progenitors and/or lack of migration into the cortical region. It is therefore of interest to note that TGFÎ² plays a dual role in neurogenesis of the developing cerebral cortex. It encourages the progenitor cells of the ventricular zone to exit cell cycle, thereby maintaining an appropriate number of cycling cells (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Siegenthaler and Miller, 2005</xref>), and it promotes migration of the post-mitotic cells into the emerging cortex (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Siegenthaler and Miller, 2004</xref>), where they can undergo differentiation into mature neurons. The increase in cellular density and expansion of the ventricular zone observed in the Pez morphants is therefore consistent with a loss of TGFÎ²3 signaling, leading to an inability of the neuronal precursors to exit cell cycle and migrate out of the proliferation zone.</p>
      <p>Although our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that Pez is a crucial regulator of TGFÎ² signaling, the lack of correlation between Pez and TGFÎ²3 expression in some tissues such as the somites suggest that Pez may also mediate its effects by TGFÎ²-independent pathways or through TGFÎ²1- or TGFÎ²2-mediated pathways. Pez expression in the developing somites is restricted to the central mesenchymal cell compartment surrounded by the epithelium (see Fig. S1) and occurs in a very narrow window after all the somites have formed and when EMT and re-epithelialization by mesenchymalâepithelial transition is complete. Consistent with the expression profile of Pez, somite boundaries were formed and maintained in Pez morphants, albeit ragged and uneven in appearance. At this stage, it is unclear what the role of Pez is in somite development and further work is underway to elucidate this.</p>
      <p>Finally, loss of E-cadherin accompanied by induction of its repressors, Snail, Slug, ZEB1, and ZEB2 in various combinations have been observed in a number of epithelial cancer cell lines that have undergone an EMT (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Batlle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Peinado et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, TGFÎ² signaling is emerging as a dual regulator of oncogenesis and metastasis (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Roberts and Wakefield, 2003</xref>). The data reported here suggests that Pez has the potential to play a role in oncogenic EMT. It is therefore of interest to note that (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004</xref>) reported a number of somatic mutations in Pez associated with colorectal cancers, although how these mutations affect Pez expression or function is unknown. Based on our findings here, we would suggest that the mutations may cause changes either in Pez expression or activity that could lead to dysregulation of TGFÎ² signaling.</p>

        <title>Antisense morpholino oligonucleotide injection of zebrafish embryos</title>
        <p>The human Pez mRNA sequence (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="X82676.1">X82676.1</ext-link>) was used to blast the zebrafish EST database for homologous sequences. ESTs spanning the 5â² (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AL914296">AL914296</ext-link>) and 3â² (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BQ285767.1">BQ285767.1</ext-link>) ends of the zebrafish Pez coding sequence were identified. Forward (5â²-TCATGTGTTTGTCTTGTGGAG-3â²) and reverse (5â²-TGCTGGACACCGTGTATCTC-3â²) PCR primers were designed to amplify a 172-bp region spanning the ATG start site. Based on sequence amplified from adult (1 yr) zebrafish cDNA, three independent antisense MOs (GeneTools) (PezMO1-3) were designed to block translation by binding upstream of or spanning the start site. Wild-type or fli1-GFP transgenic zebrafish embryos were collected and injected at one-cell stage with Pez-specific MO or an irrelevant control using standard procedures. 96-hpf embryos were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 16â24 h and either resuspended in 80% glycerol/PBS or embedded in paraffin, and 3-Î¼m sections were cut and stained with hemotoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). For live imaging, embryos were anaesthetised by the addition of 0.003% tricaine methanesulfonate to embryo medium and time-lapse fluorescent images were collected using a microscope (MVX 10; Olympus) illuminated with a mercury lamp. MO sequences were as follows: PezMO1 (nt â40 to â16): 5â²-AGCTTTCCTCTGCGCTTAATCCATG-3â²; PezMO2 (nt â70 to â46): 5â²-CGACCTTCCTCCAACAGAACGATTC-3â²; PezMO3 (nt â19 to +5): 5â²-GGCATGTTGAACCCGCGCCGCGAC-3â² where +1 is the A of the ATG start site. GeneTools standard control MO: 5â²-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3â². All zebrafish manipulations were performed according to guidelines set out and approved by the University of Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee.</p>
        <p>The MOs were injected at 1, 0.75, and 0.5 mM, with survival rates as follows; 1 mM &lt;20%, 0.75 mM â¼20%, 0.5 mM 70â100%. Surviving morphants injected with 0.75-mM MOs had severe defects and were therefore not analyzed further. Approximately 80% of morphants derived from injecting 0.5 mM MOs had defects of varying degrees and were analyzed further. Approximately 100 of each control MO- and Pez MOâinjected embryos were analyzed.</p>

Color and fluorescent images were captured using a microscope (IX81; Olympus) with 10Ã UPLSApo NA 0.4, 20Ã UPLSApo NA 0.75, and 40Ã UAPO/340 NA 1.15w objectives and CC12 (Soft Imaging System, color) and Hamamatsu Orca-ER (fluorescent) cameras, respectively. Videos were generated from a microscope (MVX10; Olympus) and F-view camera (Soft Imaging System). Fluorescence images were acquired using Cell<sup>R</sup> software (Olympus Soft Imaging System), all other images were acquired and processed using the Analysis software (Olympus Soft Imaging System). For immunofluorescence images where comparisons of staining intensities were made, the images were acquired using the same attenuator and exposure settings.</p>
