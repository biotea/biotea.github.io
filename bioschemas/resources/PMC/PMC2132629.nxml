      <abstract>
        <p>Cellubrevin is a ubiquitously expressed membrane protein that is localized to endosomes throughout the endocytotic pathway and functions in constitutive exocytosis. We report that cellubrevin binds with high specificity to BAP31, a representative of a highly conserved family of integral membrane proteins that has recently been discovered to be binding proteins of membrane immunoglobulins. The interaction between BAP31 and cellubrevin is sensitive to high ionic strength and appears to require the transmembrane regions of both proteins. No other proteins of liver membrane extracts copurified with BAP31 on immobilized recombinant cellubrevin, demonstrating that the interaction is specific. Synaptobrevin I bound to BAP31 with comparable affinity, whereas only weak binding was detectable with synaptobrevin II. Furthermore, a fraction of BAP31 and cellubrevin was complexed when each of them was quantitatively immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of fibroblasts (BHK 21 cells). During purification of clathrin-coated vesicles or early endosomes, BAP31 did not cofractionate with cellubrevin. Rather, the protein was enriched in ER-containing fractions. When BHK cells were analyzed by immunocytochemistry, BAP31 did not overlap with cellubrevin, but rather colocalized with resident proteins of the ER. In addition, immunoreactive vesicles were clustered in a paranuclear region close to the microtubule organizing center, but different from the Golgi apparatus. When microtubules were depolymerized with nocodazole, this accumulation disappeared and BAP31 was confined to the ER. Truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of BAP31 prevented export of cellubrevin, but not of the transferrin receptor from the ER. We conclude that BAP31 represents a novel class of sorting proteins that controls anterograde transport of certain membrane proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex.</p>

  <body>
    <p>E<sc>xocytotic </sc>membrane fusion is mediated by a complex of evolutionary-conserved membrane proteins. In neurons, these proteins include the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin (VAMP) and the synaptic membrane proteins syntaxin and synaptosome-associated protein (SNAP)-25.<sup>1</sup> These proteins undergo regulated proteinâprotein interactions that are controlled by soluble proteins including <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor attachment (SNAP) proteins (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">SÃ¶llner et al., 1993<italic>b</italic>
</xref>). Relatives of all of these proteins have been discovered in many eukaryotic cells including yeast, suggesting that intracellular membrane fusions may, at least to a large extent, be mediated by common mechanisms (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ferro-Novick and Jahn, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Rothman, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Scheller, 1995</xref>). Although the molecular details of membrane fusion are not yet understood, it is becoming clear that the components of the fusion apparatus operate by conformation-dependent assembly and disassembly reactions which ultimately lead to the rearrangement of membrane phospholipids (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">SÃ¶llner et al., 1993<italic>a</italic>
</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Calakos et al., 1994</xref>). For these reasons, the interactions between synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin have received considerable attention (for review see <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">SÃ¼dhof, 1995</xref>). These proteins form a tight and stable ternary complex as soon as they have access to each other. Binding probably occurs before or during vesicle docking in preparation for fusion. Incubation with the ATPase NSF and SNAP proteins reversibly disassembles this complex, an event thought to precede membrane fusion (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">SÃ¶llner et al., 1993<italic>a</italic>
</xref>,<italic>b</italic>).</p>
    <p>It is less well understood to what extent synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin interact with other proteins, particularly during stages of their life cycle when they are not bound to each other. It is conceivable that companion proteins exist that assist in sorting to the correct compartment or in positioning at the site of release and that control the availability for entering the fusion complex. For syntaxin, interactions with several other proteins were reported, including synaptotagmin munc-18/rbSEC-1, and the N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">SÃ¼dhof, 1995</xref>). For synaptobrevin, it has recently been observed that most of the protein is associated with synaptophysin, an integral membrane protein of yet unknown function that resides alongside synaptobrevin in the synaptic vesicle membrane (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Calakos and Scheller, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Edelmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Washbourne et al., 1995</xref>). Although the binary interaction of synaptobrevin with synaptophysin is weaker than its ternary interaction with syntaxin and SNAP-25, synaptophysin-bound synaptobrevin is not available for binding to these proteins (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Edelmann et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, synaptobrevin participates at least in two different complexes that are mutually exclusive: one with its partners syntaxin and SNAP-25 during membrane fusion, and another with synaptophysin during vesicle recycling and probably also during biogenesis, i.e., during transport of the proteins from the ER to the nerve terminal.</p>
    <p>It remains to be established whether cellubrevin, a nonneuronal synaptobrevin homologue with widespread distribution, forms partnerships with other proteins with properties similar to the synaptobrevinâsynaptophysin complex. Like synaptobrevins, cellubrevin is a small integral membrane protein with a single transmembrane domain at the COOH-terminal end of the molecule. Cellubrevin colocalizes with the transferrin receptor in fibroblasts and is enriched in purified clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">McMahon et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting that it resides in constitutive trafficking vesicles shuttling mainly between the plasmalemma and the endosomal compartment (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Daro et al., 1996</xref>). Like its neuronal counterparts, cellubrevin is selectively cleaved by clostridial neurotoxins including tetanus toxin. Toxin cleavage impairs exocytosis of recycling vesicles in fibroblasts (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Galli et al., 1994</xref>), whereas fusion of early endosomes appears not to be affected (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Link et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jo et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here we report that cellubrevin interacts specifically with a recently characterized integral membrane protein, BAP31. BAP31 and a related protein (BAP29) were first identified as membrane proteins copurifying with membrane-bound immunoglobulin from lysates of Î² lymphocytes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1994</xref>). Cloning of human and murine BAP31 cDNA showed that BAP31 is an evolutionary-conserved protein which is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adachi et al., 1996</xref>). Several open reading frames encoding for proteins with a similar structure and a significant degree of homology are present in the genome of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, suggesting that BAP31 represents an ancient protein family with basic functions (EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Z28065">Z28065</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Z74120">Z74120</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Z48502">Z48502</ext-link>). BAP31 has a hydrophobic NH<sub>2</sub> terminus with three potential transmembrane domains and a charged Î±-helical COOH terminus that is exposed to the cytoplasm. The COOH terminus ends with a KKXX sequence motif typical for proteins transported back to the ER. Indeed, an immunocytochemical analysis revealed that BAP31 exhibits an ER-like staining pattern (Becker, B., and M. Reth, unpublished observations). We show that BAP31, as a resident of the ER and of ER-derived trafficking vesicles, may control the export of cellubrevin from the ER.</p>

        <p>To generate cellubrevin antibodies, a cDNA was constructed encoding the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal cytoplasmic part of cellubrevin (amino acids [aa] 1â81) devoid of its transmembrane anchor (ceb-cyt). The PCR product was ligated into pTrcHis (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), resulting in a fusion protein containing the amino terminal His(6) tag. After expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the protein was extracted and purified on a nickel resin (Probond; Invitrogen) as described in <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al. (1994)</xref>. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0â500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and concentrated before immunization.</p>
        <p>The same domain of cellubrevin was expressed as glutathione-S-transferase (GST)âfusion protein and purified on glutathioneâSepharose. 20 mg of purified fusion protein were coupled to 1 g (dry weight) CNBrâ Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia Biotech</named-content>., Piscataway, NJ), and used for affinity purification of the antibody. Bound IgGs were eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.7), neutralized with 1 M Tris (pH 9), dialyzed against PBS, and concentrated (Centricon 30; Amicon Inc., Bedford, MA) to yield a final protein concentration of 2â4 mg/ml. For some experiments, the affinity-purified antibodies were biotinylated using sulfo-NHS-Lc biotin (EZ-Link; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pierce">Pierce Chemical Co.</named-content>, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
        <p>Rabbit antibodies against BAP31 were raised using the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic half of the protein (BAP31, aa 137â246) fused to GST as the antigen and then purified with Rivanol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Franek, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adachi et al., 1996</xref>). To remove antibodies reacting with GST, the antibody (10 Î¼l) was diluted (1:2,000) in TBS with Tween-20 [0.1%] and 5% dry milk and then incubated overnight with strips of nitrocellulose loaded with 125 Î¼g of recombinant GST by means of SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer.</p>
        <p>The following antibodies have been described previously: monoclonal antibodies against Rab3 (clone 42.1, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Matteoli et al., 1991</xref>), and Rab 5 (clone 621.1â3, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fischer von Mollard et al., 1994</xref>). Monoclonal antibodies against the transferrin receptor, secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMP) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brand et al., 1991</xref>), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (1D3, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Vaux et al., 1990</xref>), and endoplasmic reticulumâGolgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-53 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 1988</xref>) were given by I. Trowbridge (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA), J.D. Castle (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), S. Fuller (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany), and H.-P. Hauri (Biocenter, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland), respectively. The polyclonal antibody against p58 was a gift of J. Saraste (University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway). Antibodies to Î²-coat proteins (COP) were provided by T. Kreis (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). The polyclonal antibody against calnexin was a gift of A.

        <title>Expression Vectors and Recombinant Proteins</title>
        <p>cDNAs encoding rat synaptobrevin I, II, and cellubrevin were provided by T.C. SÃ¼dhof (University of Texas, Dallas, TX). Full-length or truncated (see above) coding regions were amplified using the PCR with oligonucleotides containing BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The PCR products were further cloned into the BamHIâEcoRI sites of the pGex-2T vector (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia Biotech</named-content>. Inc.). Fusion proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain JM109 and purified as described in <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al. (1994)</xref>. Immobilized proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining and then the concentration of the bound protein was determined by comparison with GST (3â4 Î¼g/Î¼l beads). Recombinant fusion proteins were always used in subsequent binding assays.</p>
        <p>An expression vector coding for full-length cellubrevin in pCMV2 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">McMahon et al., 1993</xref>) was provided by T.C. SÃ¼dhof. cDNA encoding a <italic>myc</italic>-tagged full-length cellubrevin was constructed using a sense primer including a BamHI restriction site, the nucleotide sequence encoding <italic>myc</italic>, and 12 nucleotides of the cellubrevin sequence and then amplified using PCR. The PCR product was subcloned in pCDNA3 and used for transfection of BHK-21 cells.</p>
        <p>For expression, mouse BAP31 cDNA (full length) was cloned in the pA vector (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>). COOH-terminalâtruncated or âmutated BAP31 coding sequences were obtained using the same sense primer with a SalI restriction site and the following antisense primers: 5â² GCGGGATCCTTAGACTGAGGGACCACGTAC 3â² for the BAP31 minus 4 last amino acids (BAP31-KKEE); 5â² GCGGGATCCTTATTCTTTGGTAAGGCCCTC 3â² for the BAP31 minus 24 last amino acids (BAP31-24aa); 5â² GCGGGATCCTTACTCCTCGCTGCTGACTGAGGGACCACGTAC 3â² for the BAP31 in which the two COOH-terminal lysines at -3 and -4 positions were changed in two serines (BAP31 KK/SS). Finally, a construct was made encoding only the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal half of BAP31(aa 1â137) that contained a <italic>myc</italic> epitope at the COOH-terminal end (residue 137; <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR). This cDNA was obtained by PCR using the following antisense primer: 5â² GCGGGATCCTTAGTTCAGGTCCTCCTCGCTGATCAGCTTCTGCTCAAAGGCTTCATT 3â². All antisense primers contain a BamHI restriction site. PCR products were subcloned into the SalIâBamHI sites of the expression vector pA and used for transfection in BHK-21 cells.</p>
        <p>Recombinant wild-type and mutant BAP31 proteins were expressed by in vitro translation in the presence of radiolabeled methionine. cDNAs encoding full-length BAP31 and the NH<sub>2</sub> terminal half of BAP31 (<italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR) were placed under control of the T7 promotor by subcloning into the SalI-BamHI restriction site of pBlueScript SK+. Radiolabeled protein was generated by coupling in vitro transcription translation using the TnT system (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="promega">Promega Corp.</named-content>, Madison, WI) in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and microsomes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Vector without insert was used as a control. Aliquots (5 Î¼l) were diluted 40-fold in extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 75 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4 [unless indicated otherwise]) and incubated for 1 h at 4Â°C. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation (at 90,000 <italic>g</italic>

        <p>For preparation of microsomal extracts, rat liver was homogenized in homogenization buffer (75 mM KCl [unless indicated otherwise] containing 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, and 2 mM EDTA) using a teflonâglass homogenizer and centrifuged at 15,000 <italic>g</italic>

        <p>For the preparation of detergent extracts, the pellets were extracted for 1 h at 4Â°C in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (1 mg/ml of protein) and centrifuged at 90,000 <italic>g</italic>

The beads were washed four times in extraction buffer and resuspended in a small volume of PBS. To elute bound proteins, the immobilized fusion proteins were cleaved from the beads using two NIH U/thrombin (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content>, St Louis, MO) per 100 Î¼l beads for 2 h at room temperature. The supernatant was adjusted to 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1:10 vol was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or immunoblotting.</p>
        <p>For immunoprecipitation, BHK-21 cells (control or transfected) were homogenized in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 1,300 <italic>g</italic>

These amounts of antibody were sufficient for quantitative depletion of the antigen. Next, 30â40 Î¼l of protein GâSepharose slurry (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia Biotech Inc.</named-content>) were added and then the incubation was continued for 1.5 h at 4Â°C.

        <title>Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunocytochemistry of BHK-21 Cells</title>
        <p>BHK-21 cells were routinely grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 2 mM glutamine, Pen/Strep (1:100 final dilution; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO BRL</named-content>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gruenberg et al., 1989</xref>). Tissue culture reagents were from <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO BRL</named-content>. For immunocytochemistry, confluent cells were split (1:10), plated on glass coverslips, and allowed to grow for 18â20 h.</p>
        <p>For transfection experiments BHK-21 cells were split (1:10) 1 d before transfection. The next day, cells were cotransfected with the vectors, encoding for <italic>myc</italic>-tagged cellubrevin and the different BAP31 constructs, or for full-length cellubrevin and <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR using Lipofectamine (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO BRL</named-content>) exactly as described by the manufacturer. After transfection, cells were grown for 24 h in normal medium, plated on glass coverslips, and grown for another 18â20 h. When indicated, cells were treated with 33 Î¼M nocodazole (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content>) for 2 h before fixation. Nontransfected cells were grown on glass coverslips to 50â60% confluency. Cells were rinsed three times for five min with PBS supplemented with 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (PBS<sup>2+</sup>), fixed for 5 min in methanol at â20Â°C and then followed by treatment with acetone for 30 s at â20Â°C. The coverslips were then rinsed several times in PBS<sup>2+</sup> and processed immediately for double labeling immunocytochemistry. All subsequent blocking and incubation steps with primary and secondary antibodies were done in PBS<sup>2+</sup> containing 8% goat serum. For double labeling with mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies, the cells were incubated with a mixture of both primary antibodies followed by washing three times in PBS<sup>2+</sup> and then subsequently incubated with both secondary antibodies (5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl) aminofluorescein (DTAF) in combination with CY3- or lissamineârhodamine conjugates). When biotinylated rabbit anti-cellubrevin antibody was used for double labeling, the cells were first incubated with polyclonal anti-BAP31 and CY3-conjugated donkey antiârabbit antibodies, followed by washing and blocking with PBS<sup>2+</sup> supplemented with 10% rabbit serum for 1 h. After rinsing with PBS<sup>2+</sup>, the cells were incubated in biotinylated anti-cellubrevin followed by FITCâconjugated streptavidin. Controls were included where either one of the first or second antibodies was omitted. At the final step cells were rinsed in PBS and distilled water and mounted in VectaShield (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on a MRC-600 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) attached to a compound microscope (Axiovert; Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Image files were converted using the Confocal Assistant software, and finally processed and annotated using Adobe Photoshop 3.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and PowerPoint 6.0 (Microsoft Corporation, WA).</p>

        <title>Identification of BAP31 As a Major Binding Protein for Cellubrevin</title>
        <p>To search for proteins interacting with cellubrevin, recombinant GSTâcellubrevin fusion protein was immobilized on glutathioneâSepharose and incubated with Triton X-100 extracts of BHK-21 cells. After washing, cellubrevin was released by thrombin cleavage to recover bound proteins. The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. A band with an apparent molecular mass of â¼30,000 eluted from immobilized GSTâcellubrevin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>a</italic>, <italic>arrow</italic>). This band specifically interacts with cellubrevin because it was not detected when beads containing bound GSTâsynaptobrevin II (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>a</italic>) or bound GST (data not shown) were used. No binding was observed in 450 mM NaCl, similar to the synaptobrevinâsynaptophysin interaction (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Edelmann et al., 1995</xref>). To isolate larger quantities, we incubated a Triton X-100 extract of liver membranes with immobilized GSTâcellubrevin and eluted bound proteins with 450 mM NaCl. SDS-PAGE of the concentrated eluate, followed by Coomassie blue staining, revealed that the apparent molecular mass 30,000 band was the only major protein eluted from the column under these conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>b</italic>). The band was excised, further concentrated by electrophoresis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lombard-Platet and Jalinot, 1993</xref>), and digested by trypsin followed by peptide analysis using HPLC and microsequencing. Two peptide sequences were obtained, VNLQNNPGAMEHFHML and AENEVLAMRK. Database searches revealed that the sequences matched with BAP31, an ubiquitously expressed integral membrane protein that has previously been identified as a member of a group of proteins associated with B cell antigen receptor in Î² lymphocytes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adachi et al., 1996</xref>). </p>

        <title>Characterization of the BAP31âCellubrevin Interaction</title>
        <p>The interaction between cellubrevin and BAP31 was further characterized using antibodies specific for BAP31. To determine the influence of ionic strength on the interaction more precisely, immobilized GSTâcellubrevin was incubated with extracts of BHK-21 cells or rat liver containing increasing concentrations of KCl. Binding of BAP31 decreased at KCl concentrations &gt;140 mM and was no longer detectable at 450 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). Next, we tested BAP31 binding to GST-fusion proteins of synaptobrevin I, synaptobrevin II, cellubrevin, and to a cellubrevin-deletion mutant lacking the transmembrane domain (ceb-cyt). The latter mutant was chosen since we found previously that the binding of synaptobrevin to synaptophysin requires the presence of its transmembrane region (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Edelmann et al., 1995</xref>). </p>
        <p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>b</italic> shows that BAP31 binds not only to cellubrevin but also to synaptobrevin I. No binding to synaptobrevin II (in agreement with the data shown above) or ceb-cyt was observed. The lack of binding to synaptobrevin II is not because of inactivation of the protein, since binding of synaptophysin as well as SNAP-25 and syntaxin was observed when incubated with brain extracts (data not shown; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Edelmann et al., 1995</xref>). Also, less BAP31 bound to synaptobrevin I when BHK21 cell extract was used instead of rat liver extract, possibly indicating some species difference between rat and hamster BAP31. To confirm the specificity of the interaction, we tested for several other membrane-bound proteins including the transferrin receptor, SCAMP (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brand et al., 1991</xref>), the small GTPases Rab3 and Rab5, the ER residents calnexin, PDI, and the markers for the intermediate compartment, p58 and ERGIC-53. With exception of small quantities of the transferrin receptor, none of these proteins bound to the immobilized synaptobrevins.</p>
        <p>To further study the binding of BAP31, recombinant [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled BAP31 was generated by in vitro translation. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>a</italic>, recombinant BAP31 bound to immobilized cellubrevin and this binding was salt dependent, very similar to the native protein. Furthermore, the recombinant protein showed the same preference for cellubrevin and synaptobrevin I, although in this case weak binding to GSTâsynaptobrevin II was detectable. Analogous to the native protein, recombinant BAP31 did not bind to cellubrevin lacking its transmembrane domain or to GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>b</italic>, <italic>top</italic>). To investigate which domain of BAP31 is responsible for the interaction we constructed, a BAP31 mutant which lacks the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic portion of the protein (<italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR). The interactions of the mutant protein were very similar to full-length BAP31, suggesting that the transmembrane regions of BAP31 are required for binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>

        <title>Comparison of the Subcellular Membrane Pools Containing BAP31 and Cellubrevin</title>
        <p>The experiments described above demonstrate that the interaction between cellubrevin and BAP31 is very similar to that of synaptobrevin and synaptophysin suggesting that, analogous to the synaptophysinâsynaptobrevin complex, BAP31 may serve as a companion for cellubrevin. However, cellubrevin is known to be concentrated on recycling vesicles distal of the Golgi complex, whereas BAP31 contains a KKXX motif and, in preliminary experiments, appeared to reside primarily in the ER. Interestingly, BAP31 also contains a sequence motif (YDRL) that is known to be responsible for binding the medium chain of AP-2, the adaptor complex involved in recruiting clathrin molecules at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ohno et al., 1995</xref>), raising the possibility that at least a pool of BAP31 may reach post-Golgi compartments and colocalize with cellubrevin. We investigated, therefore, to what extent the subcellular localization of BAP31 overlaps with that of cellubrevin by means of subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry.</p>
        <p>Subcellular fractionation was used as enrichment for recycling organelles in communication with the plasma membrane which are known to contain cellubrevin (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">McMahon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Galli et al., 1994</xref>). First, clathrin-coated vesicles were purified from rat liver (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Maycox et al., 1992</xref>). When the enrichment of cellubrevin and BAP31 during fractionation was monitored by immunoblotting, a clear dissociation between the two proteins was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). Cellubrevin is highly enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles, in agreement with earlier observations (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">McMahon et al., 1993</xref>). However, virtually no BAP31 was detected in the coated vesicle fraction. Second, fractions enriched in early endosomes were prepared by flotation density gradient centrifugation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gorvel et al., 1991</xref>). As expected, cellubrevin and two additional constituents of early endosomes, the small GTPase Rab5 and the transferrin receptor, were enriched in the early endosomal fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>b</italic>). In contrast, most of the BAP31 was recovered in the low density interface of the gradient. </p>
        <p>To enrich the ER and intermediate compartment, we used consecutive Percoll and Nycodenz gradient centrifugation steps (<italic>F3</italic>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 1991</xref>). As shown in Figure 4 <italic>c</italic>, BAP31 cofractionated with proteins p58 and ERGIC-53, two constituents of the intermediate compartment, and with ER proteins PDI and calnexin. In contrast, cellubrevin, SCAMP, and the transferrin receptor, proteins known to localize mainly in compartments at the proximal side of the Golgi complex, were enriched in the F<sub>2</sub> rather than in the F<sub>3</sub> fraction.</p>
        <p>Together, these results suggest that despite their biochemical interaction, the majority of BAP31 and cellubrevin reside on different organelles. To identify these organelles more precisely, we used immunocytochemistry to compare the localization of BAP31 and cellubrevin in BHK-21 cells with each other, as well as with PDI and the transferrin receptor, established markers for the ER and recycling endosomes, respectively. PDI mediates the folding of newly synthetized proteins in the lumen of the ER. It is characterized by the COOH-terminal KDEL ER retention signal and, consequently, its distribution is restricted to the ER (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Vaux et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
        <p>In methanol-fixed BHK-21 cells, BAP31 immunolabeling resulted in a reticular staining pattern that overlapped perfectly with the staining obtained for PDI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <italic>first row</italic>). However, BAP31 staining was extended to a dense cluster of dots in a paranuclear region devoid of PDI staining. Treatment with 33 Î¼M nocodazole, a drug that depolymerizes microtubules, for 2 h at 37Â°C led to the disappearance of the paranuclear cluster and an almost complete colocalization of BAP31 with PDI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <italic>second row</italic>). The transferrin receptor did not colocalize with BAP31, with exception of the paranuclear cluster where extensive overlap was observed. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <italic>third row</italic>). This cluster probably corresponds to vesicles accumulating around the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) where the transferrin receptor is known to be concentrated (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Trowbridge et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Daro et al., 1996</xref>). To establish whether BAP31 and transferrin receptor are indeed overlapping in the same organelle population, cells were again treated with nocodazole to disrupt the MTOC. Clearly different patterns were obtained: a punctate reticular staining for BAP31, and dispersed dots positive for the transferrin receptor. Taken together, we assume that BAP31 is an ER resident that probably shuttles between the ER and the intermediate compartment/<italic>cis</italic>-Golgi complex. The accumulation of BAP31-containing organelles may reflect accumulation of vesicles en route from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, a pathway that is disrupted by nocodazole. Indeed, we observed some overlap between the staining patterns of BAP31 and Î²-coat protein (COP), a component of COP-coated vesicles mainly accumulating in the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi network (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Oprins et al., 1993</xref>; data not shown). </p>
        <p>To perform double labeling for cellubrevin and BAP31, rabbit antibodies for cellubrevin were affinity purified and biotinylated. Cellubrevin immunoreactivity was concentrated in the area of the MTOC. Here it overlaps with BAP31, but in peripheral areas of the cell the staining patterns were different (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>top</italic>), even though a weakly stained reticulum positive for cellubrevin with the reticular ER pattern typical for BAP31 staining was noticeable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>top row</italic>, <italic>arrowheads</italic>). Double labeling for cellubrevin and PDI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>middle row</italic>) confirms that the proteins have different distributions, with PDI being virtually excluded from the region of the MTOC. Only a minor overlap was observed between cellubrevin and Î²-COP in control and nocodazole-treated cells (data not shown). All spots positive for the transferrin receptor were also positive for cellubrevin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>), in agreement with earlier results (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">McMahon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Galli et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Daro et al., 1996</xref>). </p>

        <title>Association of Endogenous BAP31 and Cellubrevin</title>
        <p>The experiments described so far provided evidence that native BAP31 binds with high specificity and efficiency to recombinant cellubrevin, but also showed that the major pools of the two proteins are localized to different compartments. Therefore, we investigated whether complexes of native cellubrevin and BAP31 can be directly isolated from cell extracts using immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified antibodies specific for either cellubrevin or BAP31. Equal amounts of detergent extracts derived from untreated and nocodazole-treated BHK-21 cells were incubated with excess amounts of antibodies, resulting in the disappearance of cellubrevin and BAP31, respectively, from the extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>b</italic>; data not shown). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>a</italic> (<italic>right lanes</italic>), a considerable amount of cellubrevin coimmunoprecipitated with the anti-BAP31 antibody. This amount, however, constituted only a relatively small fraction of the cellubrevin pool in these extracts (compare the amount of cellubrevin precipitated with the anti-cellubrevin and anti-BAP31 antibodies, respectively) which probably reflects cellubrevin pools in the ER that are freshly synthesized and en route to the Golgi apparatus. Coprecipitation was specific since neither PDI nor TfRn or SCAMP, the latter two being integral membrane proteins colocalizing with cellubrevin, were detectable on the beads (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>b</italic>). Also, no differences were observed when the cells were treated with the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole before extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>a</italic>), demonstrating that disruption of the MTOC does not affect the amount of the cellubrevinâ BAP31 complex. </p>

        <title>Perturbation of the Sorting of Cellubrevin by Site-directed Mutagenesis of BAP31</title>
        <p>The picture emerging from the data presented above suggests that cellubrevin interacts with BAP31 only during the early phases of its life cycle, i.e., during export out of the ER. We hypothesized, therefore, that BAP31 may regulate the export of cellubrevin from the ER, by serving as a sorting companion for cellubrevin which delivers cellubrevin to the Golgi and then returns to the ER by retrograde vesicular transport, for instance. To test this idea further, we generated mutants of BAP31 carrying alterations in the cytoplasmic tail, hoping that at least some of them would lead to missorting of the protein and, in turn, affect the distribution of cellubrevin.</p>
        <p>As discussed above, the COOH terminus of BAP31 contains two different sorting motifs, a YDRL motif frequently involved in adaptin binding, and a KKXX motif. To disrupt these signals, the following mutants were constructed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>top</italic>): BAP31 KK/SS in which the penultimate lysines were replaced with serines; BAP31-KKEE in which the last four amino acids were deleted; BAP31-24 aa in which the last 24 amino acids (including both the YDRL and the KKXX motif) were deleted; and <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR in which the entire cytoplasmic domain was deleted. Instead, a <italic>myc</italic>-epitope tag was added for detection since our BAP antibody binds to the cytoplasmic tail. </p>
        <p>In the first series of experiments, we examined whether any of these mutations affects the interaction between BAP31 and cellubrevin. For this purpose, BHK-21 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal <italic>myc</italic>-tagged cellubrevin together with either full-length or mutant BAP31 constructs. Immunoblotting of cell extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>
<italic>b</italic>) showed that all mutant proteins were recognized by the anti-BAP31 antibody and that expression levels were comparable. <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR was also expressed as detected by the <italic>myc</italic>-antibody (data not shown). Equal amounts of each cell extract were immunodepleted using excess amounts of antiâ<italic>myc</italic> monoclonal antibodies and then the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>
<italic>c</italic>). All BAP31 mutants coprecipitated with <italic>myc</italic>âcellubrevin with no difference being observed between the various mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>
<italic>c</italic>). This binding was disrupted upon SDS pretreatment of the cell extracts (data not shown), and likewise for the synaptobrevinâsynaptophysin interaction (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Edelmann et al., 1995</xref>). To test binding of <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR to cellubrevin, cells were cotransfected with cDNAs coding for untagged cellubrevin and <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR. Again, equal quantitative immunoprecipitation from equal amounts of cell extracts were performed with either anti-cellubrevin or anti-<italic>myc</italic> and the immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>
<italic>d</italic>). When anti-<italic>myc</italic> was used as the depleting antibody, a fraction of cellubrevin was found in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>
<italic>d</italic>, <italic>left panel</italic>, beads) but the supernatant was not depleted. Similarly, a fraction of <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR coprecipitated with cellubrevin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>
<italic>d</italic>, <italic>right panel</italic>, <italic>beads</italic>) but again, the majority stayed in the supernatant. These data show that all mutants interact with cellubrevin in a similar manner, but that large pools of both proteins exist in the transfected cells that do not interact with each other.</p>
        <p>Next, we analyzed the distribution of the mutant proteins by immunocytochemistry using confocal laser scanning microscopy. To discriminate between endogenous and transfected BAP31, we used a less sensitive detection method than in the experiment shown in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. Control stainings of nontransfected cells with this procedure confirmed that endogenous BAP31 was barely detectable and that BAP31 staining was dominated by the mutant protein. Transfections with wild-type BAP31 (BAP31wt) and <italic>myc</italic>âcellubrevin resulted in staining patterns indistinguishable from the respective endogenous proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>aâc</italic>, compare with Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Thus, BAP31wt had a marked reticular distribution in addition to the accumulation around the MTOC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>a</italic> and <italic>c</italic>). <italic>myc</italic>âCellubrevin colocalized with BAP31wt in this paranuclear region but was differentially distributed in the cell periphery (see above; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). As described earlier, nocodazole treatment resulted in the disappearance of the MTOC and a dispersed punctate staining pattern for cellubrevin (data not shown). We then studied the distribution of the mutants of BAP31, in which the last four amino acids were modified or deleted (BAP31KK/SS and BAP31-KKEE). No differences in the staining pattern for BAP31 and cellubrevin were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>d</italic> and <italic>e</italic>; data not shown). Similarly, loss of the COOH-terminal 24 amino acids including both sorting motifs did not alter the distribution of the proteins (data not shown), suggesting that signals upstream in the BAP31 sequence contribute to ER retention. </p>
        <p>In contrast, striking alterations were observed in cells transfected with <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR and cellubrevin. When cells were stained for the mutant using <italic>myc</italic>-antibodies, the staining in the cell periphery was still mostly reticular but occasionally larger immunopositive blebs were observed, and the vesicle cluster around the MTOC was less conspicuous with a more fragmented appearance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>g</italic> and <italic>j</italic>). The staining pattern of endogenous BAP31 was identical (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>h</italic> and <italic>i</italic>), demonstrating that the mutant-induced changes are dominant. Double labeling for <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR and calnexin, a resident ER protein, resulted in virtually complete colocalization, confirming that <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR is now restricted to the ER (data not shown). When these cells were analyzed for the distribution of cellubrevin, we noticed a dramatic change in the intracellular distribution of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>jâl</italic>): cellubrevin fully colocalized with <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR. In these cells, blebs positive for <italic>myc-</italic> BAP31TMR seemed to be distinguished by cellubrevin staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, compare <italic>arrowheads</italic> in <italic>j</italic> and <italic>k</italic> with color overlay in <italic>l</italic>). These immunoreactive structures probably mark the boundary between the ER and the intermediate compartment (ER export complexes; see Discussion), since they are also positive for p58, a marker protein of the intermediate compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>arrowheads</italic> in <italic>mâo</italic>).</p>
        <p>These experiments suggest that intact BAP31 is required for exporting cellubrevin from the ER. However, they do not distinguish whether the retention of cellubrevin by <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR is because of a general defect in ER to Golgi traffic, or whether the effect is specific for cellubrevin. To distinguish between these alternatives, we compared the distribution of cellubrevin with that of transferrin receptor in the cells transfected with <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR and cellubrevin. In these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>p</italic> and <italic>q</italic>), the distribution of the transferrin receptor was strikingly different from the reticular pattern of cellubrevin (compare with Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). The transferrin receptor displayed a typical pattern of fine dots concentrated in the perinuclear region, documenting that it is not retained in the ER as is the case for cellubrevin.</p>
        <p>If temporary association with BAP31 is needed for cellubrevin to be exported, it is possible that export becomes rate limiting when excess cellubrevin is produced, resulting in accumulation of cellubrevin in the ER because of saturation of BAP31. Using BHK-21 cells overexpressing myc-tagged cellubrevin, we examined the localization of the protein with respect to ER residents. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>, overexpression of cellubrevin resulted in accumulations of the protein in calnexin-positive reticular structures. These accumulations were significantly more pronounced than those observed with the endogenous protein (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), although not all of the calnexin-positive structures were labeled. Taken together, we conclude that although both cellubrevin and the transferrin receptor are targeted to the same post-Golgi compartments, cellubrevin, but not the transferrin receptor, interacts with BAP31 before or while exiting the ER. </p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we have demonstrated that cellubrevin specifically interacts with BAP31. BAP31 is a resident of the ER that probably shuttles between the ER and the intermediate compartment and/or <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi complex. Our data suggest that BAP31 binds newly synthesized cellubrevin, and perhaps other proteins, to control their export to the Golgi apparatus where these transported proteins reach their final destinations.</p>
      <p>As a resident of the ER, BAP31 does not colocalize with the major pools of cellubrevin. In addition, we found BAP31-positive membranes concentrated in a paranuclear region close to the Golgi apparatus and the MTOC, an area that is devoid of lumenal ER proteins. Proteins involved in endosomal recycling, such as cellubrevin and the transferrin receptor, are also concentrated but, as our analysis indicates, they reside on different vesicle populations. This area apparently serves as a central relay station for trafficking vesicles of different origins and destinations.</p>
      <p>Export from the ER, the first step in the vectorial transport of proteins, commences in specialized regions of the ER. In some cells, e.g., the pancreatic acinar cells, these regions are juxtaposed to the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi network and were originally referred to as transitional elements (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Palade, 1975</xref>). In other cells, they appear to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bannykh et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Presley et al., 1997</xref>). They represent regions of the ER with many budding vesicles that are often adjacent to vesiculo-tubular clusters (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Saraste and Svensson, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Balch et al., 1994</xref>). Budding from the ER involves COPII coat proteins and results in the formation of COPII-coated transport vesicles (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Barlowe et al., 1994</xref>). Before reaching the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi, these transport vesicles pass through vesiculo-tubular clusters that may represent the intermediate compartment, functionally defined as the sorting compartment between the ER and the Golgi complex (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aridor and Balch, 1996</xref>). Here, ER resident proteins are probably sorted out and transported retrogradely to the ER, presumably involving COPI-coated transport vesicles (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aridor and Balch, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bannykh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Schekman and Orci, 1996</xref>). The accumulation of BAP31-containing vesicles around the MTOC, an area devoid of lumenal ER proteins, demonstrates clearly that the protein exits the ER during its life cycle. However, it remains to be established whether it is transported all the way to the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi. Since we found only minor colocalization with the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi marker Î²-COP, its steady-state concentration in that compartment must be low and the time BAP31 resides in these cisternae very short. Additionally, the protein may be sorted out earlier and shipped back to the ER by retrograde transport. It should be emphasized, however, that the evidence that supports recycling of BAP31 from these compartments to the ER is indirect. Thus, we cannot exclude that BAP31 is directed to lysosomes where it is degraded instead of returning to the ER. We regard this as less likely because BAP31 does not exhibit a lysosomal staining pattern and it is completely absent from purified clathrin-coated vesicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p>
      <p>Upon nocodazole treatment, the BAP31 staining in the region of the MTOC disappeared and BAP31 was almost exclusively retained in the ER with no overlap with <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi markers (our unpublished observations). Thus, nocodazole blocks forward transport of BAP31-containing vesicles from the ER to the MTOC, in addition to its inhibition of retrograde transport that is known to be microtubule dependent (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990</xref>). If only retrograde transport was inhibited by the drug, BAP31 would be expected to accumulate in the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi area. Forward transport between the ER and the Golgi dependent on microtubules is in agreement with recent observations (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bannykh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rowe et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Presley et al., 1997</xref>). Nocodazole also disrupted the accumulation of vesicles containing transferrin receptor and cellubrevin in this area (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Daro et al., 1996</xref>), making the differential distribution of BAP31 and cellubrevin more obvious. These findings highlight the role of the MTOC as a central relay station for microtubule-based intracellular vesicle traffic. Apparently, both ER-derived forward trafficking vesicles and plasmalemma- or endosome-derived endocytic vesicles are collected by microtubular transport from the cell periphery and then passage through the area of the MTOC before reaching their destinations at the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-side of the Golgi complex, respectively.</p>
      <p>It remains to be established which domains of BAP31 are responsible for its intracellular sorting. Deletion of the KKXX motif (which functions in the recruitment of COPI proteins), as well as deletion of a longer stretch (including the YDRL motif), had no obvious effects on the localization of the protein. Apparently, the KKXX motif is redundant to another as yet unknown sorting signal, and probably has a secondary signal function in assisting other proteins in the recruitment of COPI. It is possible, however, that mutant BAP31 is associated with endogenous wild-type BAP31 that still contains intact sorting signals. Interestingly, BAP31 remained in the ER even when the entire cytoplasmic tail was deleted, although upon extended culturing, abnormal vesicles were observed and cell viability decreased (see below).</p>
      <p>Although cellubrevin and BAP31 are localized to different subcellular membranes, the interaction between these two proteins is highly specific. Like synaptophysin for synaptobrevin, BAP31 appears to be the dominant binding protein for cellubrevin, clearly exceeding the still elusive putative SNARE partners of the protein. Binding was observed with native as well as with recombinant proteins, suggesting that the interaction is direct and does not require intermediate proteins. Furthermore, binding appears to require the transmembrane domains of both BAP31 and cellubrevin, although electrostatic interactions must also be involved that can be shielded by high ion concentrations. Despite the specificity and affinity of the interaction, only a relatively small proportion of the proteins are complexed in cellular detergent extracts. This finding agrees well with the differential localization of the proteins and indicates they are associated with each other only during the early phase of the intracellular traffic of cellubrevin. Since cellubrevin, like synaptobrevin, is probably synthesized on free ribosomes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kutay et al., 1995</xref>), we assume that it interacts with BAP31 after posttranslational insertion into the ER membrane, although an additional role of BAP31 in membrane insertion of cellubrevin cannot be excluded at present.</p>
      <p>How does BAP31 influence the export of cellubrevin from the ER? Two explanations are possible. First, BAP31 may function as a negative regulator that retains (or even recruits) newly synthesized cellubrevin in the ER until it is released by an unknown regulatory mechanism. Second, BAP31 may function as a positive regulator to which cellubrevin needs to bind to reach the Golgi compartment. According to this scenario, cellubrevin would be unable to leave the ER unless it is recruited by BAP31 into export vesicles, i.e., being actively transported rather than passively sorted by bulk flow.</p>
      <p>According to the first view, BAP31 would bind to cellubrevin and other to be exported proteins and keep them in the ER membrane until they are either assembled with other membrane components or properly folded. However, we found that under all experimental conditions, only a fraction of cellubrevin is associated with BAP31 in detergent extracts. Neither treatment with nocodazole (resulting in a minor increase of cellubrevin in the ER) nor expression of a BAP31 mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain (resulting in retention of cellubrevin in the ER), led to a noticeable increase of cellubrevinâ<italic>myc</italic>âBAP31-TMR complexes relative to the uncomplexed protein pools. Although artefacts can never be excluded when assessing membrane protein complexes in detergent extracts, association of the proteins appears to be low even if they are both confined to the ER. This finding is difficult to reconcile with the negative regulator model. Rather, it suggests that BAP31 may serve as a sorting chaperone that recruits certain classes of membrane proteins into transport vesicles. BAP31 may directly interact with COPII budding components. Alternatively, it may bind (perhaps via its coiled coil regions) to integral membrane proteins that facilitate COPII-mediated export. In fact, there are precedents for protein-assisted export from the ER in yeast. For instance, the protein Erp25p forms a complex with Emp24p that is required for selective export of certain cargo molecules from the ER (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">SchimmÃ¶ller et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Belden and Barlowe, 1996</xref>). Another well-documented case is the yeast gene product Shr3p that, similar to BAP31, resides primarily in the ER and recruits specific amino acid permeases into transport vesicles (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kuehn et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>Deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of BAP31 results in the retention of both BAP31 and cellubrevin in the ER, whereas other proteins such as the transferrin receptor still reach their normal destination beyond the Golgi complex. Moreover, the differences between transferrin receptor and cellubrevin localization are not caused by differences in the turnover rates of the proteins because preliminary observations suggest that their half lives are similar. Thus, these findings document that once the function of BAP31 is impaired, cellubrevin cannot reach its final destination and accumulates in the ER. Precisely how the function of BAP31 is affected by this deletion remains unclear. The deletion mutant still appears to be able to form a complex with cellubrevin, exhibiting properties that are not obviously different from the wild-type complex. We observed, however, that upon extended culturing cells developed abnormal membrane blebs, suggesting a delayed noxious effect of the mutant protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>jâl</italic>). These blebs may represent membrane accumulations at the exit site of the ER (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bannykh et al., 1996</xref>), as suggested by the colocalization of <italic>myc</italic>-BAPTMR with p58 in these blebs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>mâo</italic>) or, alternatively, accumulation of membrane destined for degradation. It is possible that vesicle traffic out of the ER is affected to some extent, which may contribute to the phenotype.</p>
      <p>We conclude that BAP31 is a representative of a novel class of proteins that regulates trafficking of certain membrane proteins out of the ER, either by retaining newly synthetized membrane proteins in the ER or by functioning as a conveyor belt for actively transporting these proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex. This class may include additional proteins such as BAP29 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adachi et al., 1996</xref>) and other members of the BAP family which are specific for different membrane immunoglobulins (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Terashima et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, trafficking of membrane proteins by means of such control proteins may be a common mechanism in eukaryotic cells.</p>

Equal amounts of GST-fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathioneâSepharose and incubated with BHK-21 cell extracts (adjusted to 140 and 450 mM KCl, respectively) at 4Â°C overnight. After washing, the fusion proteins were released by thrombin cleavage and 10% of each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (13% gel) and silver staining. <italic>Asterisks</italic> indicate the positions of synaptobrevin II and cellubrevin, respectively. The <italic>arrow</italic> points to a protein of 30 kD that eluted specifically from the cellubrevin column only when extracts in 140 mM KCl were used. (<italic>b</italic>) Purification of the 30-kD protein by cellubrevin affinity chromatography using elution in high salt buffer. 2.5 ml of glutathioneâSepharose were saturated with GSTâcellubrevin and incubated overnight at 4Â°C with 10 ml of a Triton X-100 extract of rat liver membranes (2 mg protein/ml). After washing, the bound protein was eluted with high salt buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, dialyzed against extraction buffer, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon 10). The purification procedure was repeated several times using fresh extract and the same column. The pooled and concentrated eluates were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE (15% gel). The bands corresponding to 30-kD protein were visualized by staining with Coomassie blue, excised, and further concentrated using a funnel web SDS-PAGE system (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lombard-Platet and Jalinot, 1993</xref>). The main band was excised and subjected to trypsin digestion, followed by peptide separation using RP-HPLC and microsequencing. Two peptide sequences were obtained as indicated.</p>

        <p>Properties and specificity of the cellubrevinâBAP31 interaction. (<italic>a</italic>) The interaction of BAP31 to GSTâcellubrevin (<italic>ceb</italic>) is sensitive to high KCl concentrations. Triton X-100 extracts of BHK-21 cells or of rat liver membranes were prepared in the KCl concentrations indicated. Binding and washing (using the appropriate KCl buffers) were performed as described in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Bound proteins were released by thrombin cleavage and 10% of the eluates were extracted with SDS sample buffer for electrophoresis. The figure shows immunoblot analysis for BAP31. (<italic>b</italic>) BAP31 binds selectively to synaptobrevin I and cellubrevin, and requires the transmembrane domain of cellubrevin for binding. Binding assays using immobilized fusion proteins of synaptobrevin I (<italic>syb I</italic>), synaptobrevin II (<italic>syb II</italic>), cellubrevin (<italic>ceb</italic>) and the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal cytoplasmic part of cellubrevin (<italic>ceb-cyt</italic>) were performed as described in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, except that the material eluted after thrombin cleavage was analyzed by immunoblotting (10% of each eluate/ lane). The eluates were tested for the following proteins: transferrin receptor (<italic>TfR</italic>), secretory carrier associated membrane protein (<italic>SCAMP</italic>), Rab3 (all isoforms), Rab5, calnexin, <italic>PDI</italic>, and p58.</p>

        <p>Mutation or truncation of the COOH-terminal tail of BAP21 does not affect its ability to bind cellubrevin. (<italic>a</italic>) Diagram showing the expression constructs of BAP31 that were used for cotransfection of BHK-21 cells with full-length, <italic>myc</italic>-tagged (<italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic>) or untagged cellubrevin (<italic>d</italic>). The three transmembrane regions are indicated with <italic>I</italic>, <italic>II</italic>, and <italic>III</italic>; the two gray areas correspond to areas with a predicted propensity to form coiled coils. <italic>vim</italic> indicates: region of homology with vimentin. (<italic>b</italic>) Detection of BAP31 expression in PNSs (10 Î¼g protein/lane) of transfected BHK cells. Under these assay conditions, the endogenous protein was below the detection limit. As reference, 10 Î¼g of protein obtained from a fraction enriched in ER (F<sub>3</sub> fraction; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) was analyzed in parallel. The mutants can be distinguished by small differences in electrophoretic mobility. (<italic>c</italic>) BAP31 mutants containing small changes or deletions in the cytoplasmic tail coprecipitate with cellubrevin. BHK-21 cells cotransfected with cDNAs encoding <italic>myc</italic>-tagged cellubrevin and either the wild-type or mutant BAP31 were extracted in extraction buffer, followed by quantitative immunoprecipitation using excess amounts of antiâ<italic>myc</italic> monoclonal antibody. BAP31 mutants and <italic>myc</italic>âcellubrevin were detected by ECL and the diaminobenzidine reaction, respectively. An additional band was detectable in the BAP31 blots that is nonspecific (<italic>asterisk</italic>), and is discriminated from the BAP31 mutants by slight differences in mobility. No binding was observed when only protein GâSepharose beads were used (<italic>protein G</italic>). (<italic>d</italic>) Cellubrevin coprecipitates with a BAP31 mutant protein lacking the entire COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail (<italic>myc</italic>-<italic>BAP31TMR</italic>). Quantitative immunoprecipitation was performed using excess amounts of antiâ<italic>myc</italic> monoclonal antibody (<italic>left</italic>) or affinity-purified antiâcellubrevin antibody (<italic>right</italic>). Approximately 5% of extract and supernatant (<italic>sup</italic>) and one-third of the bead-bound proteins (<italic>bound</italic>) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cellubrevin was detected using affinity-purified and biotinylated rabbit antibody. The immunoprecipitating antibody was visualized using AP conjugated to second antibodies (<italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR, <italic>top left</italic>), or to streptavidin (cellubrevin, <italic>bottom right</italic>). The coimmunoprecipitating protein was visualized using HRP conjugated to second antibodies (<italic>myc</italic>-<italic>BAP31TMR</italic>, <italic>top right</italic>) or to streptavidin (cellubrevin, <italic>bottom left</italic>), followed by ECL. No binding was observed when only protein GâSepharose beads were used (<italic>Protein G</italic>).</p>

        <p>Truncation, but not any other mutation in the cytoplasmic tail of BAP31, results in selective retention of cellubrevin in the ER. BHK-21 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding <italic>myc</italic>-tagged cellubrevin (<italic>myc-ceb</italic>) and with wild-type BAP31 (<italic>aâ c</italic>), BAP31âKKEE (<italic>dâf</italic>), or with plasmids encoding untagged cellubrevin (<italic>ceb</italic>) and <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR (<italic>gâr</italic>). <italic>myc</italic>-tagged cellubrevin and <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR were detected using mouse <italic>myc</italic> monoclonal antibodies. The secondary reagents were: DTAF-labeled donkey antiâmouse antibodies (<italic>a</italic>, <italic>d</italic>, <italic>g</italic>, <italic>j</italic>, <italic>m</italic> and <italic>p</italic>), lissamineârhodamine-labeled donkey antiârabbit (<italic>b</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, <italic>h</italic>, <italic>k</italic>, <italic>n</italic> and <italic>q</italic>). All images were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fields <italic>c</italic>, <italic>f</italic>, <italic>i</italic>, <italic>l</italic>, <italic>o</italic> and <italic>r</italic> are color overlays. Cellubrevin was only retained in the ER in cells cotransfected with <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR (<italic>jâl</italic>). In these panels, intense immunoreactive spots (<italic>arrowheads</italic>) for <italic>myc</italic>-BAP31TMR are seen, as indicated by cellubrevin staining. These spots were also positive for p58 (<italic>arrowheads</italic> in <italic>mâo</italic>), and probably denote material accumulating at ER export sites. In such doubly transfected cells, no punctate colocalization was observed between cellubrevin and the TfR that appeared to be normally sorted (<italic>pâr</italic>). Bars, 20 Î¼m.</p>

        <p>Overexpression of <italic>myc</italic>-tagged cellubrevin results in its partial retention within the ER. BHK-21 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding <italic>myc</italic>-tagged cellubrevin. After fixation, the cells were immunostained for cellubrevin using monoclonal <italic>myc</italic>-antibodies and a rabbit serum specific for calnexin. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> shows detection procedures. Images were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. <italic>Arrowheads</italic> point to areas where cellubrevin is colocalized with calnexin. Bar, 20 Î¼m.</p>
