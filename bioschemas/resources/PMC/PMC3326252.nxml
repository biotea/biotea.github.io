      <abstract>
        <p>Protein misfolding and aggregation are associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntingtonâs disease. The cellular machinery for maintaining proteostasis includes molecular chaperones that facilitate protein folding and reduce proteotoxicity. Increasing the protein folding capacity of cells through manipulation of DNAJ chaperones has been shown to suppress aggregation and ameliorate polyglutamine toxicity in cells and flies. However, to date these promising findings have not been translated to mammalian models of disease. To address this issue, we developed transgenic mice that over-express the neuronal chaperone HSJ1a (DNAJB2a) and crossed them with the R6/2 mouse model of Huntingtonâs disease. Over-expression of HSJ1a significantly reduced mutant huntingtin aggregation and enhanced solubility. Surprisingly, this was mediated through specific association with K63 ubiquitylated, detergent insoluble, higher order mutant huntingtin assemblies that decreased their ability to nucleate further aggregation. This was dependent on HSJ1a client binding ability, ubiquitin interaction and functional co-operation with HSP70. Importantly, these changes in mutant huntingtin solubility and aggregation led to improved neurological performance in R6/2 mice. These data reveal that prevention of further aggregation of detergent insoluble mutant huntingtin is an additional level of quality control for late stage chaperone-mediated neuroprotection. Furthermore, our findings represent an important proof of principle that DNAJ manipulation is a valid therapeutic approach for intervention in Huntingtonâs disease.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The synthesis and maintenance of correctly folded proteins are essential processes within all living cells. The accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins can lead to cell death or dysfunction and as such, protein homeostasis (proteostasis) must be tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B2">Balch <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Members of the HSPA (HSP70) and DNAJ (HSP40) chaperone families are major mediators of protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B44">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>). HSP70 recognizes misfolded proteins and promotes their refolding or degradation in an ATP-dependent manner, while HSP40 proteins enhance this process by delivering clients and stimulating HSP70 ATPase activity through their conserved J-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B44">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>). As such, HSP70 and HSP40 chaperones are powerful modulators of proteome integrity and cell viability.</p><p>Despite the elegant pathways in place to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation, protein folding diseases present a major health burden in an ageing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B2">Balch <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Huntingtonâs disease is one of nine inherited polyglutamine diseases caused by protein misfolding and characterized by the formation of detergent insoluble protein aggregates that coalesce into nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B61">Williams and Paulson, 2008</xref>). At the molecular level, Huntingtonâs disease is caused by a CAG expansion in exon 1 of the <italic>huntingtin</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B54">The Huntingtonâs disease collaborative research group, 1993</xref>). This leads to misfolding of the encoded huntingtin protein, which results in a toxic gain-of-function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B33">Landles and Bates, 2004</xref>). Symptoms typically manifest around mid-adulthood and include psychiatric disturbances, weight loss and a progressive decline in motor and cognitive function. Disease progression typically occurs over 20 years before death with no disease-modifying treatment available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B45">Novak and Tabrizi, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Given that chaperones are powerful modifiers of proteostasis, upregulation of HSP70 and HSP40 chaperones to enhance the refolding capacity, or quality control, of cells is an attractive therapeutic target for Huntingtonâs disease and other polyglutamine diseases. Indeed, over-expression of HSP70 or HSP40 chaperones in cells and flies can potently reduce polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B15">Cummings <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B56">Warrick <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B11">Chan <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, over-expression of HSP40 chaperones has been reported to suppress polyglutamine aggregation more potently than HSP70 chaperones, with members of a DNAJB subfamily of HSP40 molecules proving to be the most powerful modifiers of polyglutamine aggregation in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B20">Hageman <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p><p>HSJ1 is a DNAJB chaperone that is predominantly expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B14">Cheetham <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>) and can suppress polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B57">Westhoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B10">Borrell-Pages <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B28">Howarth <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B20">Hageman <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Alternative splicing produces two isoforms, HSJ1a and HSJ1b, which contain two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) in addition to an N-terminal J-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B13">Chapple <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Both HSJ1 isoforms promote the sorting of ubiquitylated clients to the proteasome, thereby enhancing the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B57">Westhoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). HSJ1a and HSJ1b differ at the C-terminus and only HSJ1a is able to modify polyglutamine aggregation in cells, predominantly due to the prenylation-mediated association of HSJ1b with the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B57">Westhoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B10">Borrell-Pages <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B20">Hageman <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Disappointingly, the over-expression of chaperones has shown limited success in ameliorating polyglutamine disease in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B16">Cummings <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B21">Hansson <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B22">Hay <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B24">Helmlinger <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). However, the ability of HSP40 chaperones to modify polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity in mouse brain is currently unknown. In this study, we assessed the effects of HSJ1a over-expression on disease progression in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntingtonâs disease. R6/2 mice express exon 1 of human <italic>huntingtin</italic> with â¼â200 CAG repeats and recapitulate many molecular and phenotypic features of Huntingtonâs disease over an accelerated time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B38">Mangiarini <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B17">Davies <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Importantly, we show that HSJ1a is able to act at the level of high molecular weight mutant huntingtin complexes to reduce aggregate load and improve neurological performance through a novel chaperone mechanism. This was reliant on ubiquitin chain recognition and client protein binding ability but, surprisingly, was independent of proteasomal targeting. We conclude that our findings are an encouraging proof of principle that the manipulation of DNAJ proteins can improve disease phenotype in the context of the mammalian brain. Furthermore, this suggests that altering levels of DNAJ chaperones pharmacologically could be a promising therapeutic avenue for treatment of Huntingtonâs disease and other polyglutamine diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Production of human HSJ1a transgenic mice</title><p>Human HSJ1a transgenic mice were created by pronuclear injection of B6/CBA F1 blastocysts with the human HSJ1a complementary DNA open reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B12">Chapple and Cheetham, 2003</xref>) driven by the bovine prion protein promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B35">Lemaire-Vieille <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>).

Furthermore, time-resolved FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer demonstrated that human HSJ1a expression also led to increased levels of soluble mutant huntingtin in the cortices of double transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F2">Fig. 2</xref>B). These findings were confirmed by immunoblotting and densitometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F2">Fig. 2</xref>E and F). In contrast, no significant difference was observed in levels of aggregated or soluble mutant huntingtin in cerebellum at any age tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F2">Fig. 2</xref>C and D). This is most likely due to the much lower levels of human HSJ1a in this brain region.

In order to determine whether human HSJ1a reduced general aggregate load or levels of a specific aggregate species, we coupled agarose gel electrophoresis resolution of aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B58">Weiss <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) with immunoblotting. AGERA western blots probed with an antibody raised against mutant huntingtin (S830) revealed smears of detergent insoluble high molecular weight species that increased in both length and intensity with age in R6/2 mice. As expected, wild-type mice had no detectable signal. Interestingly, the high molecular weight smear observed in double transgenic mice was found to be markedly shorter than that observed in R6/2 mice at both 9- and 15 weeks of age, suggesting that HSJ1a reduces the level of high order detergent insoluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F2">Fig. 2</xref>G). Cytoplasmic and nuclear mutant huntingtin inclusions are formed with disease progression in the brains of patients with Huntingtonâs disease and mouse models of Huntingtonâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B17">Davies <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B18">DiFiglia <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). As human HSJ1a was able to reduce levels of high molecular weight aggregates, we reasoned that this might correspond to an alteration in the size of nuclear inclusions. To investigate this, mutant huntingtin immunohistochemistry was performed on 9- and 15-week brain sections and both nuclear inclusion area and incidence were determined using Zeiss Axiovision software. While no inclusions of any kind were observed in wild-type and human HSJ1a transgenic mice, R6/2 mice contained large numbers of both cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions throughout the cortex, which increased in incidence and size between 9- and 15 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F3">Fig. 3</xref>A and B). Quantification of nuclear inclusion area revealed that nuclear inclusions were â¼40% smaller in double transgenic mice compared with R6/2 at 15-, but not 9-weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F3">Fig. 3</xref>C). No significant difference in the incidence of nuclear inclusions was observed between R6/2 and double transgenic mice at either age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F3">Fig. 3</xref>D). Collectively, these data reveal that human HSJ1a reduces levels of higher order detergent insoluble aggregates in R6/2 mice, which correlates with a reduction in nuclear inclusion size but not nuclear inclusion incidence.

Furthermore, S830 immunoprecipitations performed on denatured complexes eluted after HSJ1 immunoprecipitation confirmed that HSJ1a associated with ubiquitylated mutant huntingtin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F5">Fig. 5</xref>C).

These cell lysates were incubated with R6/2 brain lysates from 4-, 9- and 15-week old mice, and immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-myc antibody. As was observed previously in double transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F4">Fig. 4</xref>), human HSJ1a was found to specifically co-immunoprecipitate high molecular weight mutant huntingtin, and not detergent soluble mutant huntingtin, from R6/2 brains in an age-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F5">Fig. 5</xref>D). To further interrogate the possibility that HSJ1a may promote the rapid degradation of soluble mutant huntingtin in mouse brain lysates, we performed <italic>ex vivo</italic> degradation assays using 4-week old R6/2 brain lysates, which contain high levels of soluble mutant huntingtin. We did not observe any degradation of mutant huntingtin in lysates over a 16-h period in the presence of bovine serum albumin or HSJ1a (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/aws022/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 7A and B</ext-link>). To confirm that the proteasome was active in the lysates we added luciferase, a previously described HSJ1a client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B57">Westhoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B28">Howarth <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), to the lysate and measured luciferase activity over the same time course.

These data suggest that a rapid turnover of soluble mutant huntingtin by HSJ1a is not responsible for the failure to detect an association between soluble mutant huntingtin and HSJ1a.</p><p>Interestingly, HSJ1a lacking a functional J-domain (H31Q) showed a reduced ability to bind aggregated mutant huntingtin; however, point mutations that disrupt the function of the UIM domains of HSJ1a [S219A/E222A/S262A/E265A (ÎUIM)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B57">Westhoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) almost completely abolished human HSJ1a mutant huntingtin binding ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F5">Fig. 5</xref>D). The importance of the UIM domains was further confirmed by incubating HSJ1a with R6/2 brain lysates in the presence of different ubiquitin conjugates. We observed that while K48 linked chains and mono ubiquitin were unable to compete with mutant huntingtin for HSJ1a binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F6">Fig. 6</xref>A), the presence of K63-linked ubiquitin chains greatly inhibited the human HSJ1aâmutant huntingtin association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F6">Fig. 6</xref>A and B). Furthermore, human HSJ1a co-localized with K63 ubiquitin immunoreactivity in nuclear inclusions in double transgenic brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aws022-F6">Fig. 6</xref>C), thereby confirming that the human HSJ1aâmutant huntingtin complexes are K63 ubiquitylated <italic>in vivo</italic>.

However, the effect of DNAJ over-expression on polyglutamine disease progression in the mouse brain has remained unknown. Over-expression of human HSJ1a (human HSJ1a/DNAJB2a) reduced mutant huntingtin exon 1 aggregate load in the cortex and striatum of R6/2 mice, but not cerebellum. This is most likely due to the fact that the cerebellar expression of human HSJ1a was much lower than in other brain tissues and suggests that the ability of HSJ1a to modify mutant huntingtin aggregation is dependent on its relative expression. These findings confirm that HSJ1a is a potent modifier of polyglutamine aggregation and, importantly, demonstrate that previous observations in cell culture translate to the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B57">Westhoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B10">Borrell-Pages <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B28">Howarth <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B20">Hageman <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p><p>HSJ1a was previously shown to suppress aggregation in cells by associating with soluble mutant huntingtin, thereby promoting its degradation via the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B57">Westhoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Surprisingly, we found no evidence of an association between HSJ1a and detergent soluble forms of mutant huntingtin in R6/2 brain tissue. It is possible that differences in polyglutamine length and the environment of the mouse brain result in a conformation of soluble mutant huntingtin that is not readily recognized by HSJ1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B29">Jana <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B24">Helmlinger <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Alternatively, soluble mutant huntingtinâHSJ1a complexes may be rapidly degraded in mouse brain tissue making them difficult to detect by co-immunoprecipitation. However, we were also unable to detect soluble HSJ1aâmutant huntingtin complexes from <italic>ex vivo</italic> immunoprecipitations, or an effect of HSJ1a on soluble mutant huntingtin degradation <italic>ex vivo</italic>, which argues against this. While we cannot completely exclude the possibility that soluble HSJ1a:mutant huntingtin complexes are too transient for detection, these data suggest that in R6/2 mice human HSJ1a over-expression reduces aggregate load in a manner independent of soluble mutant huntingtin recognition and proteasomal targeting. This is intriguing given that other mammalian chaperones such as HSP70, HDJ-1 and TRiC have been proposed to suppress aggregation by acting at the level of soluble mutant huntingtin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B52">Tam <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B36">Lotz <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, we found direct evidence that HSJ1a is able to associate with detergent insoluble high molecular weight complexes of mutant huntingtin. Consistent with previous data from cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B57">Westhoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B28">Howarth <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), we found that HSJ1a co-localized with mutant huntingtin inclusions when over-expressed in R6/2 brain tissue. Interestingly, despite the presence of HSJ1a in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, co-localization occurred almost exclusively with nuclear inclusions. This has been observed previously with the chaperones HDJ-1 (DNAJB1), HDJ-2 (DNAJA1), HSC70 (HSPA8), Î±-SGT and Î²-SGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B22">Hay <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and raises the intriguing possibility that cytoplasmic inclusions adopt a conformation or composition that is unfavourable for recognition and binding by chaperones, or that chaperone decorated cytoplasmic inclusions are rapidly removed by autophagy. Furthermore, HSJ1a was found to co-immunoprecipitate insoluble material from R6/2 brain tissue more effectively at 9- and 15-weeks than at 4-weeks of age. While the temporal increase in HSJ1a expression may contribute to this, <italic>ex vivo</italic> immunoprecipitations demonstrated that human HSJ1aâmutant huntingtin complexes were preferentially formed at 9- and 15-weeks, even when equivalent levels of human HSJ1a were added to R6/2 brain lysates. These findings suggest that HSJ1a displays an age-dependent conformational and/or compositional selectivity when binding high molecular weight mutant huntingtin complexes and, coupled with increased HSJ1a expression, most likely explains why aggregate load only shows pronounced reduction in R6/2 mice at 15-weeks of age.</p><p>HSJ1 is distinguished by its N-terminal J-domain and UIMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B13">Chapple <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B44">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>). The accumulation of ubiquitin chains and ubiquitylation of mutant huntingtin inclusions have been reported in Huntingtonâs disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B3">Bence <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B4">Bennett <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B8">2007</xref>). Interestingly, we found that HSJ1a co-localizes with K63 ubiquitylated inclusions in R6/2 brain tissue and that UIM mutants of HSJ1a exhibit a reduced ability to associate with mutant huntingtin. Conversely, a J-domain mutant (H31Q) that is unable to functionally co-operate with HSP70 could still form human HSJ1aâmutant huntingtin complexes. In addition, human HSJ1aâmutant huntingtin complex formation was inhibited in <italic>ex vivo</italic> immunoprecipitations by the addition of K63 but not K48 linked ubiquitin chains, and by the addition of an excess of denatured ovalbumin (a client for HSJ1a binding). Furthermore, human HSJ1a and K63 ubiquitin were both found to co-localize exclusively with nuclear inclusions in double transgenic mouse brains. Taken together, these data suggest that human HSJ1aâmutant huntingtin association requires HSJ1a chaperoning ability and the recognition of K63-ubiquitin chains. Sequential immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the ubiquitylated factor necessary for HSJ1a complex formation is tightly associated with mutant huntingtin. However, whether that factor is mutant huntingtin itself or a tightly sequestered protein is unclear. K63 linked ubiquitin chains have been implicated in the cellular formation of tau and SOD1 inclusions, with K63 positive inclusions preferentially targeted to lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B53">Tan <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). No change in levels of p62 or LC3II were observed upon human HSJ1a over-expression and while p62 was found to associate with human HSJ1a in the presence of mutant huntingtin, this is most likely due to the fact that p62 is present in mutant huntingtin inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B9">Bjorkoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). These data suggest that despite human HSJ1aâmutant huntingtin complex formation occurring in the presence of factors that promote autophagy, HSJ1a-mediated reduction of mutant huntingtin aggregation does not occur primarily through stimulating lysosomal targeting.</p><p>To elucidate how HSJ1a reduces aggregate load in R6/2 mice, we subjected human HSJ1a:mutant huntingtin complexes to closer scrutiny.

Given that levels of detergent soluble mutant huntingtin are significantly increased upon HSJ1a over-expression, it is unlikely that these observations are simply caused by HSJ1a restructuring aggregates into a more compact conformation. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays revealed that, as with other DNAJB chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B20">Hageman <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), HSJ1a effectively suppressed mutant huntingtin aggregation. In addition, while HSJ1a was unable to reverse aggregation, we found that addition of HSJ1a to preformed aggregates <italic>in vitro</italic> did significantly reduce further aggregation. Strikingly, the ability of HSJ1a to suppress mutant huntingtin aggregation was dependent on J-domain and UIM function and suggests that while non-essential for binding, a functional association with HSP70 is necessary to suppress aggregate formation. Interestingly, UIM mutants of HSJ1a significantly increased mutant huntingtin aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is perhaps not surprising given that these mutants retain their ability to interact with HSP70 molecules and may therefore impede HSP70-mediated suppression of aggregation in these reactions. We propose that HSJ1a selectively recruits HSP70 to a subpopulation of mutant huntingtin oligomers through K63 ubiquitin chain recognition and client protein binding. HSJ1a and HSP70 can then act to inhibit inclusion growth by physically blocking sites of polymerization and altering the on and off rates for polymerization. Alternatively, HSJ1a and HSP70 could act to refold mutant huntingtin oligomers into subtly different conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B41">Muchowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B55">Wacker <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). However, if this is the case, the rearrangement of mutant huntingtin must be relatively subtle, as no clear shift in aggregate morphology was detectable by transmission electron microscopy.</p><p>In addition to reducing aggregate load, DNAJ chaperones have been shown to reduce polyglutamine toxicity in cells and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B19">Fayazi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B20">Hageman <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). We found that CNS specific over-expression of human HSJ1a improved activity, grip strength and RotaRod ability in R6/2 mice but did not improve body or brain weight at any age tested. This suggests that HSJ1a modifies disease progression independently of non-neurological symptoms. In addition, phenotypic improvements in R6/2 mice occurred late in disease progression, a time that coincides with optimal human HSJ1a:mutant huntingtin binding and correlates with a pronounced reduction in aggregate load.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that a cystamine-induced increase in levels of HSJ1 transcripts correlates with an improvement in disease progression in Huntingtonâs disease mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B30">Karpuj <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Upregulation of HSJ1b rather than HSJ1a was proposed to be responsible for these beneficial effects by increasing BDNF levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B10">Borrell-Pages <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). We did not observe any change in BDNF transcript or protein levels upon over-expression of human HSJ1a in wild-type mice. However, levels of <italic>BDNF</italic> messenger RNA and protein were partly preserved in R6/2 mice over-expressing HSJ1a. This is most likely a reflection of reduced aggregate load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B63">Zuccato <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) but could also contribute to the behavioural improvements observed in R6/2 mice.</p><p>In summary, our data provide the first evidence to our knowledge that a J-domain chaperone can reduce aggregate load and ameliorate disease progression, albeit modestly, in a mouse model of polyglutamine disease. HSJ1a acts through a previously undescribed chaperone mechanism that is focused at the level of ubiquitylated high molecular weight mutant huntingtin and works to prevent aggregate growth in a manner similar to that described for HSP104-mediated suppression of Sup35 prionogenesis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="aws022-B50">Shorter and Lindquist, 2008</xref>). This is an important proof of principle and shows that increasing levels of DNAJ chaperones can be beneficial in the context of the mammalian brain. As such we propose that efforts to increase HSJ1a expression pharmacologically may be a valid therapeutic strategy in Huntingtonâs disease and other polyglutamine diseases, particularly with regards to improving late stage disease outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>MRC studentship to J.L.; MRC (<award-id>0401350</award-id>, <award-id>0700412</award-id> and <award-id>801314</award-id>); <funding-source>Wellcome Trust</funding-source>; <funding-source>CHDI Foundation and the Huntingtonâs Disease Society of America Coalition for the Cure</funding-source>.</p></sec>
