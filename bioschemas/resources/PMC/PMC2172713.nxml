        <p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicle membranes involves the recruitment of clathrin and AP-2 adaptor complexes to the presynaptic plasma membrane. Phosphoinositides have been implicated in nucleating coat assembly by directly binding to several endocytotic proteins including AP-2 and AP180. Here, we show that the stimulatory effect of ATP and GTPÎ³S on clathrin coat recruitment is mediated at least in part by increased levels of PIP<sub>2</sub>. We also provide evidence for a role of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) via direct stimulation of a synaptically enriched phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type IÎ³ (PIPKIÎ³), in this effect. These data suggest a model according to which activation of PIPKIÎ³ by ARF6-GTP facilitates clathrin-coated pit assembly at the synapse.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Synaptic vesicle (SV)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> membranes are formed and recycled by clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the presynaptic plasmalemma. This process involves the regulated and directed assembly of clathrin, AP180, and AP-2 adaptor complexes along with several accessory proteins at endocytotic âhot spotsâ surrounding the active zone (for review see <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hannah et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Brodin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Slepnev and De Camilli, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Takei and Haucke, 2001</xref>). How precisely coat nucleation is regulated in time and space is unclear, but morphological data suggest that it is a compensatory event tightly coupled to vesicle exocytosis (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gad et al<italic>.</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p>
      <p>Growing evidence implicates membrane lipids, in particular phosphoinositides, in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Jost et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cremona and De Camilli, 2001</xref>). Several endocytotic proteins such as the Î± and Î¼2 subunits of heterotetrameric AP-2 complexes (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gaidarov and Keen, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Rohde et al., 2002</xref>), the ENTH domains of AP180 and epsin (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ford et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Itoh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al<italic>.</italic>, 2001</xref>), and the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the large GTPase dynamin (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Barylko et al., 1998</xref>) can interact directly with phosphoinositides, in particular phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>). Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type IÎ³ (PIPKIÎ³) and synaptojanin 1, the major brain PI(4)phosphate 5-kinase and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> polyphosphoinositide phosphatase, respectively, are concentrated at synapses, where they undergo activity-dependent dephosphorylation (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">McPherson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, elevated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels induced by genetic inactivation of synaptojanin 1 result in the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the synapse (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2000</xref>). These data suggest that clathrin-dependent retrieval of SV membranes may at least in part depend on phosphoinositide metabolism. Given the rapid turnover of phosphoinositides, it seems likely that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis is under tight regulatory control (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cremona and De Camilli, 2001</xref>), thereby linking it to the exo-endocytotic cycling of SV membranes.</p>
      <p>The formation of clathrin-coated endocytotic intermediates has been reconstituted from lysed nerve terminal membranes incubated with brain cytosol and nucleotides (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Takei et al<italic>.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Detailed morphometric analysis by EM revealed that the presence of clathrin/AP-2âcoated buds on native synaptic membranes was potently stimulated by ATP and GTPÎ³S, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Takei et al., 1996</xref>). This effect may be contributed to some extent by an inhibition of clathrin-coated vesicle fission induced by the GTPÎ³S block of dynamin function (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Takei et al., 1996</xref>). However, by analogy to other vesicular transport events, one might also speculate that GTPÎ³S could act in part by locking a small GTPase in the GTP-bound conformation (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Springer et al., 1999</xref>). More specifically, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family members have been implicated in clathrin-coated budding events at the Golgi complex and at the cell periphery (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Stamnes and Rothman, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Traub et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 1997</xref>). ARF has been shown to trigger assembly of vesicle coats onto membranes by directly interacting with coat proteins (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson et al<italic>.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Stamnes and Rothman, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Traub et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Austin et al., 2002</xref>) or by stimulating phospholipase D (PLD) activity (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Ktistakis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arneson et al., 1999</xref>). Additionally, ARF family members have been found to recruit and activate PI kinases, which mediate PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Godi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al., 1999</xref>). However, so far, the physiological role of ARF proteins in the recruitment of clathrin/AP-2 coats at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Kreis, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 1997</xref>) and in SV recycling has remained unclear. Among the different ARF family members known to date, only ARF6 is localized to the plasma membrane, where it has been implicated in regulating actin dynamics and membrane turnover (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">D'Souza-Schorey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Randazzo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2001</xref>). ARF6 has also been demonstrated to regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis from the apical (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Altschuler et al., 1999</xref>) and basolateral surface (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Palacios et al., 2002</xref>) of polarized MDCK cells. Consistent with a putative role of ARF6 in SV recycling, mSec7, a brefeldin Aâinsensitive ARF6-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) has been demonstrated to function at the synapse (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ashery et al., 1999</xref>). Here, we show that activated ARF6 facilitates clathrin/AP-2âcoated pit nucleation from synaptic membranes via the stimulation of PIP<sub>2</sub> production mediated by PIPKIÎ³ activation.</p>

        <title>Clathrin/AP-2 recruitment to synaptic membranes is stimulated by ATP and GTPÎ³S</title>
        <p>Assembly of clathrin- and AP-2âcoated endocytotic intermediates was previously reconstituted from lysed nerve terminal lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction (LP2) membranes incubated with brain cytosol and nucleotides (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Takei et al., 1996</xref>). LP2 membranes mainly consist of synaptic vesicles (SV) and endosomal membranes. Carbonate treatment of LP2 efficiently removed associated clathrin, AP180, and AP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>

(BâE) Washed 4-Î¼g LP2 membranes were incubated with 80 Î¼g rat brain cytosol in the presence or absence of the indicated nucleotides. Membranes were recovered by centrifugation and analyzed by immunoblotting against clathrin heavy chain (HC), Î±-adaptin, AP180, Hsc70, tubulin, endophilin I, PIPKIÎ³, ARF6, and synaptotagmin I as a membrane marker.

(E) Protein recruitment in the presence of the indicated nucleotides and with or without the broad-specificity kinase inhibitor A3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="200301006f1"/></fig> A), enabling us to biochemically analyze membrane recruitment of clathrin/AP-2 coat proteins from added cytosol in vitro (see also <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Haucke and De Camilli, 1999</xref>). To study the nucleotide dependence of clathrin coat recruitment, LP2 membranes were incubated with brain cytosol and re-isolated by centrifugation. Membrane-associated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. A pool of AP-2 and clathrin was found associated with LP2 membranes when the reaction was performed in the absence of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> B). The concomitant presence of 2 mM ATP and 200 Î¼M GTPÎ³S greatly stimulated recruitment of both coat components onto the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, AâC). GTPÎ³S alone was not sufficient to enhance AP-2 and clathrin binding, whereas ATP alone or ATP plus GTP resulted in a small increase of membrane-associated coat proteins. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). By contrast, membrane binding of the cytosolic chaperone Hsc70 (analyzed as a control protein) only required ATP, but was not affected by guanine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> B). The presence of ATP and GTPÎ³S also stimulated recruitment of the monomeric clathrin adaptor AP180 (and PIPKIÎ³; see below for details), whereas the association of tubulin or endophilin with the membrane was not affected by these nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> D). Together, these results confirm earlier morphometric data on the nucleotide-dependent formation of clathrin-coated buds (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Takei et al., 1996</xref>), and suggest that activation of a GTPase is involved in the nucleation of clathrin/AP-2 coats at the presynaptic plasmalemma.</p>
        <p>Because GTPÎ³S alone was not sufficient to stimulate coat recruitment, we hypothesized that the addition of ATP was needed to drive phosphorylation reactions. Indeed, the presence of A3, a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor, potently inhibited ATP/GTPÎ³S-stimulated recruitment of AP-2 and clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> E).</p>

        <title>Clathrin/AP-2 recruitment to synaptic membranes is not inhibited by brefeldin A</title>
        <p>ARF family members have been shown to facilitate vesicle budding by stimulating recruitment of coat components to the membrane (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Springer et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, we tested the effect of brefeldin A (BFA) on clathrin/AP-2 recruitment in our assay. BFA inhibits nucleotide exchange factors acting on ARF family members except most of those specific for ARF6 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Randazzo et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with earlier observations on AP-2 association with the plasma membrane of intact cells (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Kreis, 1992</xref>), no effect on the ATP- and GTPÎ³S-dependent recruitment of AP-2 and AP180 to LP2 membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>)<fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2. </label><caption><p>
<bold>Effect of brefeldin A on clathrin/AP-2 recruitment.</bold> Clathrin/AP-2 recruitment was performed as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> in the presence or absence of ATP/GTPÎ³S and brefeldin A (BFA). Samples were analyzed by quantitative Western blot analysis using antisera against Î±-adaptin, AP180, synaptotagmin I as a membrane marker, and Hsc70 as a control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="200301006f2"/></fig> was seen. When isolated Golgi membranes were used instead of synaptic membranes, addition of BFA completely blocked clathrin binding to the Golgi complex (unpublished data; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Kreis, 1992</xref>). In agreement with these results, it has been found that BFA does not affect SV recycling, the main traffic pathway mediated by clathrin/AP-2 coats at the synapse (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Mundigl et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
        <p>Together, our data implicate a GTPase distinct from ARF1-5 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Randazzo et al., 2000</xref>) in the stimulation of ATP/GTPÎ³S-induced coat recruitment to synaptic membranes. Such a GTPase could be ARF6, the BFA-insensitive ARF family member known to act at the cell surface. Consistent with this possibility, we observed recruitment of a substantial amount of ARF6 along with clathrin, AP180, and AP-2 to LP2 membranes on incubation with cytosol in the presence of ATP and GTPÎ³S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> A).</p>

The subcellular distribution of ARF6 as well as that of other well-characterized synaptic markers was analyzed in fractions of pig brain (obtained by the procedure of <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Maycox et al.

ARF6 was found in synaptosomes (P2) and within synaptosomes was primarily localized to the plasma membraneâcontaining fraction (LP1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> B). The LP2 fraction, mostly comprising SV and endosomal membranes, was highly enriched in the SV protein synaptophysin, but contained only relatively low levels of ARF6. ARF6 was also present (but not enriched) in highly purified clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> B) or whole brain (not depicted). Consistent with these biochemical data, activated HA-tagged ARF6(Q67L) accumulated at synapses in transfected cortical neurons grown in vitro, as demonstrated by its enrichment in synaptophysin-positive structures. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> C). We conclude that ARF6 is present at synapses, where it is found predominantly in plasma membrane fractions from which SV recycling occurs.</p>

        <title>Effect of ARF6 mutants on clathrin/AP-2 recruitment to synaptic membranes</title>
        <p>To investigate directly whether ARF6 can trigger AP-2/clathrin coat formation, we tested recombinant myristoylated ARF6 mutants for their ability to facilitate clathrin/AP-2 recruitment to carbonate-washed LP2 membranes devoid of endogenous membrane-bound ARF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> A). Reactions were performed in the presence of 200 Î¼M GTP instead of GTPÎ³S to prevent generalized activation of all endogenous GTPases. Addition of 1 Î¼M recombinant ARF6(Q67L), an ARF6 mutant locked in the GTP-bound state due to defective GTP hydrolysis, was sufficient to promote recruitment of clathrin, AP-2, and AP180 as efficiently as addition of GTPÎ³S in the absence of exogenous ARF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>

        <title>ARF6-GTP interacts directly with PIPKIÎ³</title>
        <p>To obtain possible insights into the mechanism by which ARF6-GTP stimulates clathrin/AP-2 recruitment to synaptic plasma membranes, we used an affinity purification approach. In pull-down experiments, NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal GST fusion constructs of the constitutively active ARF6(Q67L) or the GTP-binding defective mutant ARF6(T27N) were analyzed for their ability to retain various endocytotic proteins. Considering that ARF1 directly interacts with AP-1 complexes at the trans-Golgi network and AP-3 complexes on endosomal membranes, we initially focused on coat components as putative interactors of ARF6. No association of either ARF6 mutant with clathrin or subunits of AP-2 could be detected. Likewise, we did not detect any interaction of GST-ARF6 with AP180, amphiphysin I, dynamin I, and auxilin, or the SV protein synaptotagmin I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>

        <p>A variety of endocytotic proteins including AP-2 have been found to interact with the membrane via phosphoinositides (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gaidarov and Keen, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ford et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Itoh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Rohde et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, members of the ARF family have been shown to stimulate phosphatidylinositol kinases in different systems (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Godi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Skippen et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether ARF6 interacts with PIPKIÎ³, an isoform of PI(4)P 5-kinase highly enriched in brain (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al., 1998</xref>) and concentrated in the presynaptic compartment (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, GST-ARF6(Q67L) efficiently pulled down PIPKIÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> A). By contrast, little interaction was seen between PIPKIÎ³ and the inactive GDP-bound mutant GST-ARF6(T27N). Similar results were seen if <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated hexahistidine-tagged ARF6 mutants were used instead (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>The interaction between ARF6 and PIPKIÎ³ appeared to be direct because GST-ARF6 bound to radiolabeled PIPKIÎ³ synthesized by coupled transcription/translation in vitro (unpublished data). To determine the isoform specificity for different ARF family members, hexahistidine-tagged myristoylated ARF6(Q67L) or ARF1(Q71L) were compared for their ability to bind to PIPKIÎ³ or the trans-Golgi clathrin adaptor AP-1, a protein complex known to bind to both ARF1 and ARF6 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Austin et al., 2002</xref>). Although both ARF1(Q71L) and ARF6(Q67L) displayed similar affinities for AP-1, as detected by Western blotting of the affinity-purified material for the AP-1 subunit Î³ adaptin, only ARF6 was able to effectively pull-down PIPKIÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> B). By contrast, a control protein (arfaptin2) did not interact with either AP-1 or PIPKIÎ³. Together, these results show that ARF6 specifically binds to PIPKIÎ³ in vitro in a GTP-dependent manner, but not to clathrin/AP-2 coat components.</p>
        <p>To finally determine whether ARF6 associated with PIPKIÎ³ during clathrin/AP-2 recruitment to synaptic membranes, we performed chemical cross-linking experiments. To this aim, LP2 membranes were first incubated with cytosol, ATP, ARF6(T27N)-His<sub>6</sub> or ARF6(Q67L)-His<sub>6</sub>, and GDP or GTP, respectively. 3,3â²-Dithio-bis(propionic acid <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (DTSP), a cleavable amine-reactive cross-linking reagent was added, samples were solubilized under denaturing conditions, and ARF6-His<sub>6</sub> was recovered by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. ARF6(Q67L) but not its inactive GDP-bound counterpart (T27N) became efficiently cross-linked to PIPKIÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> C). No interaction was seen with clathrin, AP180, or any of the individual subunits of the AP-2 adaptor complex. Our combined data suggest that ARF6-GTP directly interacts with PIPKIÎ³ on synaptic membranes.</p>

        <title>ARF6 directly activates PIPKIÎ³ on liposomes</title>
        <p>Given the interaction of ARF6-GTP with PIPKIÎ³, we asked whether ARF6 might regulate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase activity in bovine brain cytosol. To this end, cytosol was incubated with Î³[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P)âcontaining liposomes, and neomycin to prevent PIP<sub>2</sub> degradation. Lipid products were analyzed by TLC, and the amount of incorporated radioactivity was quantified. Addition of 1 Î¼M recombinant myristoylated ARF6(Q67L)-GTP greatly stimulated PI4P 5-kinase activity compared with ARF6(T27N). A slightly less pronounced increase in PI4P kinase activity was seen if wild-type ARF6-GTP was used instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>

Under these conditions (i.e., addition of neomycin), no formation of phosphatidic acid from <sup>3</sup>H-labeled phosphatidylcholine was detectable (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>To analyze whether ARF6 directly activates PIPKIÎ³, we monitored the activity of recombinant PIPKIÎ³-p90 in an in vitro assay using liposomes made of total brain lipids as a substrate. Liposomes were incubated with recombinant PIPKIÎ³ and myristoylated ARF6, or mutants thereof, in the presence of 200 Î¼M GTP and Î³[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. Lipid products were analyzed as described above. Myristoylated ARF6(Q67L) induced a strong increase in kinase activity compared with the basal activity seen in the absence of ARF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> B). A similar (albeit weaker) effect was produced by wild-type ARF6. By contrast, the GTP-binding defective mutant ARF6(T27N) failed to enhance kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> B). The stimulatory effect of ARF6 on PIP<sub>2</sub> generation from total brain lipids was smaller than that observed with liposomes containing high concentrations of PI(4)P (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> A with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> B), presumably due to incomplete substrate saturation of the enzyme. These data suggest that ARF6-GTP stimulates PIPKIÎ³ activity under conditions mimicking physiological substrate levels.</p>
        <p>Although addition of activated ARF6 increased formation of PIP<sub>2</sub> from total brain lipids, no effect on PIP generation was detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> C). Moreover, immunodepletion of PIPKIÎ³ from cytosol almost completely abolished PIP<sub>2</sub> formation (see also <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>), and this defect could not be restored by addition of exogenous ARF6-GTP or mutants thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> C). This indicates that ARF6-mediated stimulation of PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis is indeed primarily due to activation of PIPKIÎ³. In summary, these results demonstrate a direct interaction between activated ARF6 and PIPKIÎ³ in brain cytosol that results in a strong stimulation of PI(4)P 5 kinase activity and PIP<sub>2</sub> formation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present work, we have investigated mechanisms involved in the nucleotide-dependent regulation of clathrin-coated pit nucleation at the synapse. Our results implicate ARF6 in this process and demonstrate two effects of the GTP-bound form of this small GTPase; stimulation of the recruitment of clathrin/AP-2 to presynaptic membranes and binding plus activation of PIPKIÎ³. They also suggest that the two effects are related and that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production by PIPKIÎ³ stimulation represents the major mechanism through which ARF6 enhances clathrin/AP-2 recruitment. The action of GTP-ARF6 on clathrin/AP-2 recruitment mimics the effect of GTPÎ³s, and its effects are antagonized by experimental manipulations that prevent either ARF activation (i.e., dominant-negative ARF6) or PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production and availability (i.e., kinase inhibition, PIPKIÎ³ depletion, and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis by synaptojanin's inositol 5â²-phosphatase domain). These results strongly indicate that enhanced clathrin coat recruitment mediated by a stimulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis plays a major role in the GTPÎ³S-stimulated nucleation of morphologically detectable clathrin-coated pits on synaptic membranes (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Takei et al., 1996</xref>), although a block or delay in fission may also contribute to this ultrastructural change.</p>
      <p>The strong stimulatory effect of ARF6 on PIPKIÎ³ extends to this brain-enriched enzyme a property previously demonstrated for predominantly nonneuronal isoforms of PIPK (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Skippen et al., 2002</xref>). It was also shown that PLD stimulation by ARF family proteins, including ARF6, may play a role in enhanced PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production by generating phosphatidic acid, a reported activator of PI(4)P 5-kinases (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arneson et al., 1999</xref>). This effect may synergize with the direct effect of ARF6 on PIPKIÎ³ in the generation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the synapse. Although ARF6 appears to have a broad distribution in the nervous system, the weak immunocytochemical signal produced by available antibodies to endogenous ARF6 in brain tissue did not allow its reliable subcellular localization. However, transfected activated ARF6(Q67L) appears to be concentrated at synapses, and an ARF6-specific GEF, mSec7, regulates SV traffic (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ashery et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, PIPKIÎ³ is highly expressed in brain (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al., 1998</xref>) and concentrated at synapses (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, our findings, obtained primarily using cell-free systems, are likely to reflect a physiological process occurring in vivo.</p>
      <p>The precise interplay between mSec7 and other brain ARF6-specific GEFs, and their role in the activation of ARF6 at the presynaptic plasma membrane remains to be investigated. It seems possible that ARF6 may synergize with the synaptically enriched focal adhesion protein talin in activating PIPKIÎ³ at the synapse (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>). The finding that enhanced PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production may play a critical role in the recruitment of endocytotic clathrin coats is supported by a large body of data besides those presented here. Biochemical and structural studies have demonstrated an interaction of the clathrin adaptor AP-2, AP180, and dynamin with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Barylko et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gaidarov and Keen, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ford et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Rohde et al., 2002</xref>). Genetic disruption of the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2000</xref>) and other manipulations that disrupt its function and therefore lead to an accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in neurons, enhance the presence of clathrin coats on synaptic membranes both in vivo (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gad et al., 2000</xref>) and in cell-free systems (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). Our data are also consistent with (and further support) recent reports suggesting that ARF6 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Altschuler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Palacios et al., 2002</xref>) and PIPK (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barbieri et al., 2001</xref>) regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis from the plasma membrane.</p>
      <p>As cell fractionation data indicate, neither ARF6 nor PIPKIÎ³ are enriched in crude SV (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>, and this paper). Instead, ARF6 is localized in plasma membrane fractions (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cavenagh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1998</xref>), consistent with a role in priming the membrane for coating. PIPKIÎ³ is found primarily in the cytosol (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>), but as shown by EM (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>) and biochemically (this paper), is recruited by GTPÎ³S, and therefore most likely by ARF6-GTP, to the membranes at which clathrin-coated pits nucleate. A GTPÎ³S-stimulated recruitment of clathrin/AP-2 coats to endosomes was demonstrated by Robinson and coworkers in nonneuronal cells (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 1997</xref>). This âmislocalizationâ of endocytotic clathrin coats was shown to be dependent on enhanced PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production on endosomes, and has been attributed to PLD activation by an ARF GTPase. Excess PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on endosomes can also be generated by overexpression of an active form of ARF6 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2001</xref>). As shown by <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al. (1999)</xref> and by our present results, a major mechanism through which active ARF6 may stimulate PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production is via the recruitment and activation of a PI(4)P 5-kinase activity. We speculate that in neuronal cells, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is segregated at the plasma membrane by the coordinate action of PI(4)P 5-kinases, which are primarily localized at the cell surface, and of the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin, which cleaves PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on endocytotic membranes (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Stefan et al., 2002</xref>). Excess active ARF6âeither because of GTPÎ³S addition or because of mutation that inactivates its GTPase activityâmay alter this balance and lead to an abnormal accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on endosomes.</p>
      <p>It seems particularly interesting that PIPKIÎ³ is stimulated by ARF6, a protein previously implicated in regulating actin dynamics and membrane turnover (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">D'Souza-Schorey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Randazzo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Schafer et al., 2000</xref>). Invaginations of the plasma membrane that resemble those found at synapses after prolonged stimulation (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Takei et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gad et al., 2000</xref>) have been detected in nonneuronal cells on expression of constitutively active ARF6 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">D'Souza-Schorey et al., 1998</xref>) or of an ARF6-specific exchange factor (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Franco et al., 1999</xref>). ARF6 may recruit and activate PIPKIÎ³ at the synapse, thus increasing the local PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration. This, in turn, would facilitate the formation of endocytotic structures like clathrin-coated pits and deeper membrane invaginations from which clathrin-coated vesicle budding can also occur. A number of observations suggest that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is highly interconnected to dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lamaze et al., 1997</xref>). Accordingly, many accessory proteins of the clathrin pathway directly couple endocytotic coat formation to actin rearrangements (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Qualmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Schafer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lee and De Camilli, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Orth et al., 2002</xref>). Endocytotic âhot spotsâ at synapses coincide with actin-rich zones (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Kelly, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gad et al., 2000</xref>), and the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles induced in nerve terminals by the disruption of synaptojanin function correlates with the presence of a meshwork of actin around these vesicles (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gad et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Shupliakov et al., 2002</xref>). ARF6 may regulate actin dynamics through multiple cooperative mechanisms. Via the increase in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production mediated by stimulation of PLD (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1993</xref>) and PIPKs (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al., 1999</xref>; this paper), it enhances the recruitment and activation of actin regulatory proteins including N-WASP and small GTPases of the Rho family (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Takenawa and Itoh, 2001</xref>). It can also directly regulate Rac via its binding to arfaptin 2/Por1 (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Shin and Exton, 2001</xref>). Possibly through its effects on Rac and actin, ARF6 can stimulate formation of macropinosomes (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Thus, ARF6 appears to have a major regulatory role in endocytosis because it can control both clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytotic pathways. It will be critical to further elucidate the localization and regulation of ARF6-GEFs and the effect of synaptic activity on such regulation.</p>
