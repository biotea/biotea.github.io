      <abstract>
        <p id="P2">The TRPA1 ion channel (a.k.a the âwasabi receptorâ) is a detector of noxious chemical agents encountered in our environment or produced endogenously during tissue injury or drug metabolism. These include a broad class of electrophiles that activate the channel through covalent protein modification. TRPA1 antagonists hold potential for treating neurogenic inflammatory conditions provoked or exacerbated by irritant exposure. Despite compelling reasons to understand TRPA1 function, structural mechanisms underlying channel regulation remain obscure. Here, we use single-particle electron cryo-microscopy to determine the structure of full-length human TRPA1 to ~4Ã resolution in the presence of pharmacophores, including a potent antagonist. A number of unexpected features are revealed, including an extensive coiled-coil assembly domain stabilized by polyphosphate co-factors and a highly integrated nexus that converges on an unpredicted TRP-like allosteric domain. These findings provide novel insights into mechanisms of TRPA1 regulation, and establish a blueprint for structure-based design of analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents.</p>

    <p id="P3">Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels play critical roles in somatosensation by serving as sensors for thermal and chemical stimuli<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In mammals, the TRPA1 subtype (so named for its extensive N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain) is expressed by primary afferent nociceptors, where it detects structurally diverse noxious compounds that elicit pain and neurogenic inflammation. Such activators include pungent irritants from mustard, onion, and garlic, as well as volatile environmental toxins and endogenous pro-algesic agents<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. TRPA1 is also activated downstream of phospholipase C-coupled receptors and has been proposed to function as a sensor of noxious cold<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. TRPA1 is associated with persistent pain, respiratory, and chronic itch syndromes<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and is therefore a promising target for treating these and other neurogenic inflammatory conditions. While selective TRPA1 antagonists have been developed, their sites and mechanisms of action remain unclear.</p>
    <p id="P4">Many TRPA1 agonists are potent electrophiles that activate the channel through covalent modification of conserved cysteine or lysine residues within the cytoplasmic N-terminus<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. While these and other functional properties have been gleaned from electrophysiological studies of TRPA1 in whole cells, channel activity is not readily retained in excised membrane patches. This ârun downâ can be mitigated if membranes are excised into solutions containing polyphosphates, suggesting that obligate cytoplasmic co-factors support TRPA1 function in intact cells<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Importantly, robust TRPA1 activity has yet to be demonstrated with purified protein, further suggesting that co-factors are required to stabilize the channel in cell-free systems. Therefore, elucidating the biophysical and structural basis of polyphosphate regulation is key to understanding how TRPA1 is regulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, and how it can be efficiently manipulated in artificial systems for more detailed functional characterization.</p>
    <p id="P5">A transformative step in addressing these questions would be to determine the channelâs three-dimensional (3D) atomic structure. TRP channels have posed particular challenges in this regard, likely reflecting their conformationally dynamic nature and diverse intracellular elements. Electron microscopy provides a potential means to achieve this goal, although for TRPA1 this approach has heretofore yielded densities of relatively low-resolution (~16Ã)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. However, advances in single particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have recently enabled <italic>de novo</italic> structural analysis of TRPV1 to near-atomic (â¤4.0Ã) resolution<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Here, we exploit this approach to determine the structure of the full-length human TRPA1 channel to ~4Ã resolution, revealing the structural basis of subunit assembly, polyphosphate action, and antagonist binding.</p>

      <title>Unique architecture of human TRPA1</title>
      <p id="P6">A screen of TRPA1 orthologues identified the human channel as the top candidate for structural analysis based on particle size and conformational homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Purified, detergent solubilized protein appeared as homogeneous, mono-dispersed particles from which gross architectural features, such as a putative transmembrane core and extensive intracellular domain, could already be discerned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Following exchange into an amphipathic polymer, hTRPA1 samples were imaged using negative stain and single-particle cryo-EM, as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figs. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">5</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. We imaged samples under a variety of conditions, ultimately obtaining high-resolution 3D reconstructions only in the presence of an agonist (allyl isothiocyanate, AITC) or antagonists (HC-030031 with and without A-967079) to 4.24Ã, 3.9Ã, and 4.7Ã, respectively using gold-standard refinement and Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion for resolution estimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figs. 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">5</xref>). Indeed, even two-dimensional (2D) class averages of particles with these additives revealed elements of secondary and tertiary structure, including the channelâs tetrameric organization, well-resolved densities for the putative transmembrane core, and a central stalk flanked by convex stems that transition into a highly flexible crescent-shaped element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figs. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">4b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">5b</xref>). This latter element was routinely observed by negative stain imaging for all orthologues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1b and g</xref>), and is thus a <italic>bona fide</italic> and conserved structural feature. In 3D reconstructions, most side-chains were seen in sufficient detail to allow <italic>de novo</italic> atomic model building, which was initially achieved with samples treated with AITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">6</xref>). High-resolution information suitable for model building spanned residues K446-T1078, excluding only the most distal cytoplasmic regions, a short S1âS2 linker that extends into the extracellular space, and a short helix that links a putative C-terminal Î²-strand to the coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7a, b</xref>). Thus, we have resolved the structure of the vast majority of the transmembrane core and proximal cytoplasmic regions involved in subunit assembly and electrophile detection. Together, these regions represent ~50% of the protein. Except where noted, discussion of the structure pertains to the AITC-treated sample.</p>
      <p id="P7">From a birdâs-eye view, hTRPA1 resembles TRPV1 and distantly related voltage-gated potassium (K<sub>v</sub>) channels: each subunit consists of six transmembrane Î±-helices (S1 â S6) plus a re-entrant pore loop between S5 and S6; homotetramers are formed through âdomain swapâ interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d and e</xref>). Apart from this conserved transmembrane core, hTRPA1 exhibits numerous distinctive features, particularly within the large intracellular N- and C-terminal domains, which together account for ~80% of the channelâs mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). For example, a C-terminal tetrameric parallel coiled-coil mediates extensive subunit interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Also, a domain that contains five ankyrin repeats surrounds the coiled-coil and is linked with another extended feature that forms the crescent-shaped element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). Key cysteines that contribute to activation by electrophiles are located within the pre-S1 region at solvent accessible sites, likely accounting for their relative chemical reactivity. Moreover, these residues are in close apposition to a âTRP-likeâ allosteric modulatory domain characteristic of other TRP channels (but not predicted to exist in TRPA1), providing mechanistic insight into electrophile-evoked channel gating.</p>

    <sec id="S2">
      <title>Coiled-coil and polyphosphate binding</title>
      <p id="P8">A striking feature of the hTRPA1 structure is a well resolved (&lt;4Ã) tetrameric coiled-coil located at the center of the channel, below the ion permeation pore near the C-terminus, where it forms a stalk-like interaction locus for all four subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7c, d</xref>). Although coiled-coils have been shown to mediate subunit assembly for some TRP subtypes, the primary sequence within this region of TRPA1 is predicted to contain Î±-helices, but not a coiled-coil, <italic>per se</italic><sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, our structure reveals side chain interactions at âaâ and âdâ positions throughout the core, consistent with coiled-coil geometry, but distinct from the canonical coiled-coil heptad repeat, where âaâ and âdâ position are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. Instead, TRPA1 contains two glutamines in staggered âdâ positions that may destabilize the structure (Q1047) and/or interact through intra-planar hydrogen bonds (Q1061) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3aâc</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, residues on the exterior surface of coiled-coils (âb, c, eâgâ positions) are commonly polar or charged to facilitate inter-helix and solvent interactions, but here we see a number of hydrophobic or aromatic residues in these locations, of which only half interact with another channel domain (see below). This coiled-coil based mechanism of subunit interaction differs from that seen in TRPV1, where ankyrin repeats on one subunit form contacts with a three-stranded Î²-sheet on the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Thus, TRP channels associate through at least two broad structural mechanisms, irrespective of whether they contain an ARD.</p>
      <p id="P9">Physiological studies have shown that soluble polyphosphates sustain TRPA1 channel activity in excised membrane patches<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Indeed, we found that inclusion of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) throughout channel purification was a prerequisite to obtaining mono-dispersed protein. Nevertheless, a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon has been lacking. Remarkably, we always observed strong densities near the coiled-coil that likely correspond to IP<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7d, e</xref>). Positively charged residues K1046, R1050 and K1048, K1052 from neighboring coiled-coil strands associate with this density <italic>via</italic> four-coordinate charge-charge interactions, consistent with the observation that polyphosphates having at least four phosphate moieties are most effective at supporting TRPA1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the presumptive destabilizing core residue (Q1047) is located between IP<sub>6</sub>-coordinating side chains (K1046 and K1048), and thus inter-helical cross bridging by IP<sub>6</sub> could counteract this glutamine-mediated coiled-coil destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a and d</xref>). This interaction is reminiscent of a previously established role for IP<sub>6</sub> as an essential co-factor for adenosine deaminase<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, and further illustrates how cellular polyphosphates can function as primitive protein stabilization factors<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>

    <sec id="S3">
      <title>Pre-S1, TRP domain, and reactive sites</title>
      <p id="P10">The pre-S1 region connects the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) to S1 and is of particular interest because it contains residues targeted by electrophilic agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. This region consists of two elements, including the pre-S1 helix and a preceding linker region, whose primary sequence yields little insight into its structure or mechanistic connection to channel gating. Our 3D structures reveal an overall topology for the linker consisting of two helix-turn-helix motifs separated by two putative anti-parallel Î²-strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Although TRPA1 was not predicted to contain a TRP domain because it lacks a canonical âTRP boxâ motif, an Î±-helix directly following S6 is structurally and topologically analogous to the TRP domain in TRPV1, although located further below the inner membrane leaflet compared to TRPV1.</p>
      <p id="P11">The linker is integrated with the overlying TRP-like domain through two main structural features: multiple hydrophobic interactions between stacked Î±-helices, and formation of a putative three-stranded Î²-sheet in which two strands are contributed by the linker and one by the sequence following the TRP-like domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). While an analogous three-stranded Î²-sheet in TRPV1 mediates inter-subunit interactions, this putative motif in TRPA1 appears to be a freestanding structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Interestingly, the third Î²-strand connects to a short, poorly resolved Î±-helix that is almost buried in the inner leaflet of the membrane and forms part of a poorly resolved loop connecting the TRP-like domain with the C-terminal coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>). Many TRP channels are modulated by membrane phospholipids (such as PIP<sub>2</sub>)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and this connecting helix in hTRPA1 may provide a structural basis for such regulation.</p>
      <p id="P12">The TRP-like domain in hTRPA1 makes additional contacts with other non-contiguous structures, including the pre-S1 helix and S4âS5 linker, consistent with proposed roles for TRP domains as sites of allosteric modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b, c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In TRPV1, the TRP domain interacts with the pre-S1 helix and S4âS5 linker <italic>via</italic> polar interactions<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, whereas in TRPA1 these interactions are exclusively hydrophobic, and more extensive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b, c</xref>). Nonetheless, our structure suggests that the TRP-like domain in TRPA1 likewise subserves allosteric regulation, which was not readily apparent without a 3D model.</p>
      <p id="P13">Our structure also reveals the spatial distribution within the pre-S1 region of key cysteine and lysine residues that contribute to electrophile sensitivity: C621 resides in the first helix-turn-helix; C641 is located in the first strand of the putative Î²-sheet; C665 is in a flexible loop connecting the Î²-strands to the second helix-turn-helix; and K710 is located within the pre-S1 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Each of these sites is solvent accessible, and their locations within this allosteric nexus makes them well suited to detect reactive chemical agonists and transmit these events to the TRP-like domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4aâc</xref>). For example, C621 is packed in a polar pocket between ankyrin repeat 16 (AR16) and the overlying helix-turn-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, d</xref>). As such, electrophiles may provide a driving force for conformational change that relieves steric hindrance and/or electrostatic repulsion following chemical modification. Additionally, this key cysteine is located at the beginning of an Î±âhelix and adjacent to a lysine, likely reducing the pKa of the thiol moiety to enhance its nucleophilic character<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. We were unable to resolve AITC-mediated adduct formation due to insufficient resolution at these sites (estimated at 4 â 4.5Ã) and/or instability of the resulting modification, and thus this mechanism remains speculative until a <italic>bona fid</italic>e ligand-channel complex can be clearly visualized. Moreover, we have not observed marked conformational changes within this region when comparing structures in the presence of AITC versus antagonists, but this may simply reflect lack of channel activity under conditions amenable to cryo-EM analysis. Additionally, residues in the distal N-terminus (e.g. C421 in mouse TRPA1) or transmembrane core (e.g. S943 and I946 in hTRPA1) may contribute to electrophile sensitivity<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The former region is unresolved in our structure, and the latter residues are unlikely to be directly modified by electrophiles. Among five cysteine and lysine residues in the transmebrane core, three (C727, K771, and C834) face the membrane environment and could therefore be modifiable by lipophilic electrophiles.</p>

Indeed, among vertebrate TRPs, TRPA1 boasts the longest ARD, variably estimated to consist of 14â18 ARs<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. In our raw micrographs (negative stain and cryo-EM) and 2D class averages, the TRPA1 N-terminus is distributed into two distinct densities consisting of well-resolved convex âstemsâ followed by a flexible âcrescentâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a and b</xref>). In all of our 3D reconstructions, we see density for five well-defined ARs (resolved to ~4 â 5Ã) that contribute to the stems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figs. 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">5</xref>). A homology model predicts that the crescent consists of eleven ARs spanning ~100Ã, which may adopt a propeller arrangement that facilitates intersubunit interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P15">In some non-mammalian species, such as insects and snakes, TRPA1 exhibits relatively low sensitivity to electrophiles and is, instead, activated by heat<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>â<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Chimeric and mutagenesis studies have identified regions within the ARD that specify thermal or chemical responsiveness<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, suggesting that the ARD can communicate with the pore. In this regard, packing interactions sterically link the ARs in the stem with the overlying helix-turn-helix motifs of the linker region through hydrophobic and some polar interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This is propagated upwards and terminates within the TRP-like domain, thereby forming a network of packed interactions capable of transducing information from the ARD to the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Also of note are close side chain interactions between the coiled-coil region and AR12, as well as AR16 and first helix-turn-helix, which likely stabilize the well-resolved intracellular stems, contributing to channel assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b, c</xref>). In addition to electrophilic irritants, mammalian TRPA1 can be activated or modulated downstream of phospholipase C-coupled receptors through increased cytosolic calcium or possibly direct interaction with GÎ²Î³. These and other modulatory activities may also be specified by the ARD<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, in which case further mechanistic insights will require high-resolution structures of several TRPA1 species orthologues that include this entire domain.</p>

      <title>Pore and antagonist binding site</title>
      <p id="P16">The central cavity in the ion permeation pathway of AITC-treated hTRPA1 (resolved to 3.5â4.5Ã) grossly resembles that of TRPV1 in exhibiting two major constrictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a, b</xref>). There are, however, some notable differences. For example, the outer pore domain of hTRPA1 contains two pore helices, reminiscent of bacterial voltage-gated sodium channels, where the second helix likely acts as a negatively charged conduit for attracting cations and repelling anions from the channel mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. In contrast, TRPV1 and K<sub>v</sub> channels contain only a single pore helix<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Moreover, the steeper shape of the outer pore region in hTRPA1 is distinct from the wider outer vestibule seen in TRPV1 (closed state) and bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels, but more reminiscent of K<sub>v</sub> channels<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P17">Differences are also seen in the presumptive gates. First, the upper gate in TRPV1 is formed by two residues (G643 and M644), whereas that of hTRPA1 is formed by one (D915). Here, we see a restriction point measuring 7.0Ã between diagonally opposed D915 residues, which is narrower than that seen in TRPV1 (7.6Ã) in the activated state, but potentially wide enough (&gt;6Ã) to accommodate partially dehydrated calcium ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7f</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Interestingly, D915 has previously been implicated in controlling calcium permeability in mouse TRPA1<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Second, the lower gate in TRPV1 is formed by a single constriction in S6 at residue I679, whereas that of hTRPA1 consists of two hydrophobic seals formed by I957 and V961, creating an increasingly constricted funnel whose narrowest point (6.0Ã) is sufficient to block conduction of rehydrated cations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7g</xref>). Thus, we may have caught TRPA1 in an intermediate configuration in which the upper gate is partially open and the lower gate closed. Alternatively, the upper constriction may not constitute a regulated gate due to a more highly scaffolded structure afforded by the second pore helix. Distinguishing between these possibilities will require stabilizing TRPA1 in distinct functional states under conditions amenable to structural analysis.</p>
      <p id="P18">HC-030031 and A-967079 represent the two main classes of TRPA1 antagonists<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. We determined structures of hTRPA1 in the presence of HC-030031, alone, or together with A-967079. Remarkably, the double antagonist structure revealed a unique density within a pocket formed by S5, S6 and the first pore helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7hâj</xref>). This density was not observed in the structure with HC-030031 alone, and thus likely corresponds to A-967079. Phylogenetic comparisons together with molecular modeling have identified six residues required for A-967079 sensitivity<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>â<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>, all of which surround the observed density, as does F909, which is highly conserved and therefore not previously implicated in A-967079 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Indeed, mutation of this residue (F909T) abrogated A-967079 inhibition of AITC-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>), further corroborating assignment of this antagonist site. It has been proposed that A-967079 forms H-bond interactions with S873 and/or T874, which are also located at the bottom of the putative binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Consequently, orientation of the antagonistâs phenyl ring in proximity to F909 may stabilize ligand binding through ÏâÏ interactions. In fact, in the double antagonist structure, F909 and additional key residues move closer to the A-967079 density, suggesting that drug binding occurs via an âinduced fitâ mechanism involving movements in all three aforementioned regions that comprise the pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, compare to AITC model in white).</p>
      <p id="P19">A-967079 may hinder channel activity through coordinated binding to S5, S6, and first pore helix domains, which in TRPV1 are mobile elements involved in gating. As such, A-967079 may act as a molecular wedge to inhibit opening of the lower gate by impeding movement of these elements. In the case of TRPV1, classic vanilloid ligands occupy a site within the lower S2âS4 bundle. Moreover, local anesthetics inhibit Na<sub>v</sub> channels by binding to discrete sites along the S6 pore-lining surface to block the selectivity filter or activation gate<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Therefore, the A-967079 binding pocket described here constitutes a novel pharmacological site. Lastly, the mutations described above do not impair HC-030031 antagonism, suggesting that these two compounds bind to discrete sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9g</xref>). We were unable to identify a second density corresponding to HC-030031, perhaps owing to its lower affinity, leaving its binding site and mechanism of action unresolved.</p>

      <title>Concluding remarks</title>
      <p id="P20">TRPA1 is a sensor for chemical irritants and a major contributor to chemonociception. We now show that key residues involved in irritant detection are solvent accessible and lie within a putative allosteric nexus converging on an unpredicted TRP-like domain, suggesting a structural basis whereby TRPA1 functions as a sensitive, low threshold electrophile receptor. An important next step is to visualize electrophile-evoked conformational changes in hTRPA1 that are associated with gating, a goal that will require robust stabilization of TRPA1 under conditions amenable to structural studies. Our analysis of how IP<sub>6</sub> stabilizes the channel represents a step in this direction. But what physiologic purpose does IP<sub>6</sub> interaction serve? Perhaps by stabilizing the coiled-coil domain, polyphosphates function as second messengers that, together with cytosolic calcium and G-proteins, modulate TRPA1 activity when phospholipase C-coupled receptors hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphospate to generate inositol polyphosphates.</p>
      <p id="P21">Our study uncovers a number of similarities between TRPA1 and TRPV1 that likely represent pan-TRP features<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Both channels assemble as homotetramers that exhibit domain swapping within the transmembrane core, and possess an ion permeation pathway controlled by two restriction points, the lower of which involves a conserved isoleucine residue. Additional modes of intersubunit interactions are facilitated by discrete substructures within the cytoplasmic domain, though the exact nature of these contacts is protein-specific (<italic>e.g</italic>. Î²-strand:ARD interactions, coiled-coil, crescent propeller, etc). These cytoplasmic intersubunit interactions may regulate channel assembly and/or facilitate concerted conformational changes upon co-factor binding or agonist-evoked gating, akin to domain swapping in the transmembrane core. Additionally, an Î±-helix subsequent to S6 (TRP domain or structural analogue) likely operates as a conserved allosteric regulatory structure that engages in extensive interactions with pore-forming domains. High-resolution structures of additional TRP subtypes will no doubt expand on this preliminary list of common and distinct features that account for the great functional diversity of TRP ion channels.</p>

Briefly, orthologues were subcloned into a pCDNA3.1(+) vector containing an N-terminal EGFP tag. 16 hours after transient transfection in the presence of 3 ÂµM ruthenium red (RR), HEK293 cells were washed with PBS, collected in buffer A (50 mM Tris, 37.5 mM sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phytic acid (inositol hexakisphosphate, IP<sub>6</sub>, Sigma), 1Ã complete protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC, Roche), pH 7.5) and lysed by sonication on ice. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation (8000 g Ã 20 min) at 4Â°C and membrane pellets were collected by ultracentrifugation (100,000 g Ã 1 h) at 4Â°C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in buffer B (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM IP<sub>6</sub>, 1Ã PIC, pH 8.0) and membranes were solubilized with 10 mM MNG-3 for 1.5 h at 4Â°C<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. Detergent-insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation as above and the supernatant was separated on a superose 6 column in buffer C (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM IP<sub>6</sub>, 0.5 mM MNG-3, pH 8.0). The eluent from the superose 6 column was passed through a Jasco fluorometer (FP-2020 Plus) fitted with a flow cell, as described in the manufacturerâs instructions. The fluorometer settings were: excitation 488nm, emission 509nm. Based on the FSEC screen, the vampire bat TRPA1 orthologue was initially pursued for structural studies, however, this sample did not show sufficient particle homogeneity nor did it retain the ankyrin repeat domain diffuse skirt subsequent to exchange into amphipols. Therefore, the 10 species orthologues were further screened by negative stain imaging of MBP-tagged constructs to identify the human TRPA1 (hTRPA1) orthologue as the most promising target for structural analysis.</p>

For the remaining density, including the coiled-coil domain, linker between the last ankyrin repeat and the S1 helix, a poly-alanine model was first built and amino acid assignment to the poly-alanine model was then achieved based mainly on the clearly defined side chains densities of bulky residues. The entire model was then manually adjusted to fit the densities. Connectivity and side chain rotamer positions were cross-validated using the two other maps. Clear densities were observed for residues 664â679, 748â763 and 786â802, but the resolutions of these domains are insufficient for atomic model building. The connection between the TRP-like domain and the coiled-coil domain is only partially resolved. At low Ï isosurface, weak densities were seen to link the TRP-like domain to a short helical-like density in the inner leaflet of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>) and then to the coiled-coil domain. We did not attempt to build a model for this linker region. The ~30 remaining most C-terminal residues were not resolved, probably forming part of the crescent density. The first 444 amino acids could not be modeled into the crescent density. Sequence-based prediction identified at least 11 additional ankyrin repeats. A speculative model was built by positioning a sequence based homology model of 11 ankyrin repeats symmetrically into the crescent density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 8e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P32">Following the initial model building and local energy minimization, the entire model was subject to reciprocal space refinement. Amplitudes of the final density map were corrected by a frequency-dependent scaling factor determined by comparing the experimental maps with a reference map calculated from the model<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>, using a program âampcorrâ written by X. Li. A soft-edged mask was generated based on the built atomic model to mask out densities of PMAL-C8, N-terminal crescent density, and other parts where model building was not attempted. The masked maps were put into an artificial unit cell with P1 symmetry and converted to MTZ format using CCP4 program sftools<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>. The resulting reflection files were used to perform maximum likelihood refinement using PHENIX<sup><xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> with secondary structure restraints, reference model restraints, and automatic optimization of experimental/stereochemistry weights. The reference model was generated from the built models using the geometry minimization function in PHENIX. The refined atomic model was further visualized in COOT. A few residues with side chain moving out of the density during the refinement were fixed manually, followed by further refinement following the same procedure. The final structure was validated using MolProbity<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P33">For cross-validation to prevent overfitting, we followed procedures as previously described<sup><xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>. Briefly, the coordinates of the refined atomic structures were displaced randomly by 0.2Ã using PHENIX (PDB Tools) to remove potential model bias. The displaced model was then refined against one of the half maps in reciprocal space. FSC curves were calculated between the resulting model and half map 1 (âworkâ, <italic>i.e</italic>., used for refinement), the resulting model and half map 2 (âfreeâ, <italic>i.e</italic>., not used for refinement), and the resulting model and the summed map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 6</xref>). There is no significant separation between âworkâ and âfreeâ FSC curves suggesting that the model was not overfitted. The final model exhibits good geometry and all refinement parameters are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 6</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P34">Figures were prepared using UCSF Chimera<sup><xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup>, residue interactions were assigned with a 5Ã cutoff, and pore radii were calculated using the HOLE program<sup><xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup>.</p>

        <title>The ion permeation pathway and antagonist binding site</title>
        <p id="P55"><bold>a</bold>, Solvent accessible pathway along the pore of AITC-treated channel mapped with HOLE program. D915 in a loop between the first and second pore helices is the sole contributor to the upper restriction, which is structurally analogous to M644 in TRPV1. In contrast, G914 and N917, structurally equivalent to G643 and D646 in TRPV1, do not appear to contribute to the upper constriction. A string of acidic residues in the second pore helix (E920, E924, E930) likely form a negatively charged conduit to attract cations and repel anions. The lower gate is formed by I957 and V961, the former of which is analogous to I679 in TRPV1. <bold>b</bold>, Radius of the pore as calculated through HOLE program. <bold>c</bold>, Cryo-EM map for the double antagonist-treated sample contains a unique density corresponding to A-967079 (orange) and located within a pocket formed by S5 (yellow), S6 (blue) and the first pore helix (green). Residues implicated in A-967079 antagonism are indicated, many of which line this pocket and undergo subtle conformational changes upon antagonist binding (AITC model shown in white). <bold>d</bold>, Quantification of antagonist-mediated inhibition of AITC-evoked currents in oocytes expressing wild-type or F909T mutant hTRPA1 channels. Responses were first evoked with AITC (200 ÂµM) alone, and then in the presence of A-967079 (10 ÂµM) or HC-030031 (100 ÂµM). Data represent percentage of inhibition of the AITC-evoked maximal current at +80 mV (n = 7 independent cells per group, mean Â± S.E.M, Studentâs t-test).
