      <abstract>
        <p>Chromosomal band 11q13 seems to be one of the most frequently amplified lesions in human cancer, including esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). The oral cancer overexpressed 1 (<italic>ORAOV1</italic>) gene has been identified within this region, but its detailed biological function in human ESCC remains largely unclear. In our clinical samples of stage III ESCC, <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification was observed in 49 of 94 cases (53%). <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification was significantly associated with a poorly differentiated histology and tumors located in the upper or middle esophagus. Patients with <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification tended to have a shorter survival period, although the difference was not significant. To investigate the function of <italic>ORAOV1</italic>, we created <italic>ORAOV1</italic>-overexpressed ESCC cell lines that exhibited increased cellular proliferation and colony formation, compared with <italic>in vitro</italic> controls. <italic>In vivo, ORAOV1</italic>-overexpressed cells exhibited a significantly increased tumorigenicity and a significantly larger tumor volume and poorer differentiation than controls. The peptide mass fingerprinting technique demonstrated that ORAOV1 bound to pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PYCR), which is associated with proline metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Then, <italic>ORAOV1</italic>-overexpressed cell lines were resistant to stress treatment, which was cancelled by <italic>PYCR</italic>-knockdown. In addition, the <italic>ORAOV1</italic>-overexpressed cell line had a higher intracellular proline concentration and a lower ROS level. Our findings indicate that the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene is frequently amplified in ESCC, enhances tumorigenicity and tumor growth, and is associated with a poorly differentiated tumor histology via proline metabolism and ROS production. ORAOV1 could be a novel target for the treatment of ESCC.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Among the malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, esophageal cancer is associated with a poor prognosis despite improvements in surgical techniques, chemotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Neoadjuvant chemo-radiation followed by surgery remains the standard of care for operable disease. Definitive chemo-radiation can be considered for locally advanced tumors, while platinum-based combination chemotherapy is preferable in a first-line metastatic setting. Recently, <italic>HER2-</italic>, <italic>EGFR-</italic>, and <italic>VEGF</italic>-targeted agents have been extensively investigated as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore, several new targets, including <italic>mTOR</italic>- and <italic>MET</italic>-targeted agents, are also being explored [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, none of the molecular-targeted therapies developed to date have enabled a demonstrated improvement in the survival of patients with esophageal cancer. Therefore, the search for novel targeted molecules must be continued.</p>
      <p>Chromosomal band 11q13 seems to be one of the most frequently amplified lesions in human cancer, including esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC), and can be associated with an advanced stage and poor prognosis [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several known cancer-related genes, such as <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>FGF4</italic>, <italic>FGF3</italic>, and <italic>CTTN</italic>, have been mapped to the 11q13 chromosome region [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The oral cancer overexpressed 1 (<italic>ORAOV1</italic>) gene has also been identified within this region and is presumably a candidate treatment target for oral squamous cell cancer [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several studies have shown that <italic>ORAOV1</italic> is related to the cell cycle, apoptosis and angiogenesis [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study has demonstrated that a yeast orthologue of the ORAOV1 protein is related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, the detailed biological functions of <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene in human cancer remain unclear [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, only one report showing a relationship between the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene and ESCC has been published [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification and the clinicopathological features of patients with ESCC and the detailed biological functions of the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene.</p>

        <title>Tissue distribution of <italic>ORAOV1</italic> mRNA in normal human tissue and several human cell lines</title>
        <p>To examine the tissue distribution of <italic>ORAOV1</italic> mRNA, we performed real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for normal human tissues. No high expression levels of <italic>ORAOV1</italic> mRNA were found, even in the tongue, throat, or esophagus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). <italic>ORAOV1</italic> expression was also examined in 37 human cell lines. A very high <italic>ORAOV1</italic> mRNA expression level was observed in several ESCC cell lines (especially, KYSE220 and T.T), whereas the levels in lung cancer, including squamous cell cancer and gastric cancer, were not so high (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p>

        <title><italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene amplification in ESCC cell lines and surgical specimens</title>
        <p>To develop a high-throughput method for detecting <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification in a clinical setting, we verified a real-time PCR-based detection method, the TaqMan Copy Number Assay. Using a cut off of 4 copies, the number was 0.98-3.3 copies in the non-amplified cell lines; however, the number in the <italic>ORAOV1</italic>-amplified cell lines was 4.2-14.4 copies (KYSE140, KYSE180, KYSE220, and T.T). In addition, both primers that we used (intron 2 and intron 3) produced very similar results (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). These results suggested that a DNA copy number assay for the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene was a sensitive and reproducible method. Next, <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification was evaluated using Hs03772057_cn (intron 2) in 94 FFPE samples of stage III ESCC specimens. <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification of more than 4 copies was observed in 49 cases, with a frequency of 53% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Clinicopathological features of <italic>ORAOV1</italic>-amplified ESCC</title>
        <p>We evaluated the clinicopathological features of patients with stage III ESCC according to the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification status. No significant differences in age, sex, or disease stage were seen between patients classified according to the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification status, whereas the histology and tumor location were significantly associated with <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Specifically, patients with <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification tended to have poorly differentiated tumors in the upper or middle region of the esophagus. In addition, we examined the prognostic significance of <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification. Patients with <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification tended to have a shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) after surgery, compared with patients without amplification, although the differences were not significant (median DFS, 11.6 vs. 12.6 months, <italic>P</italic> = 0.50, and median OS, 21.6 vs. 33.7 months, <italic>P</italic> = 0.16, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A and B</xref>).</p>

            <p>A, Proline metabolic pathway during the normal state. Proline is oxidized to P5C by POX, and P5C is recycled back to proline by PYCR via redox transfers or is sequentially converted to glutamate and Î±-ketoglutarate. The metabolism of proline generates electrons to produce ROS and initiates a variety of downstream effects, including the blockade of the cell cycle, autophagy, and apoptosis. Despite its pro-oxidant effects, proline has been shown to protect mammalian cells against oxidative stress. Proline protection has been postulated to involve protein chaperoning, direct scavenging of ROS, and the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. B, Proline metabolic pathway during <italic>ORAOV1</italic> overexpression. ORAOV1 influences PYCR activity; as a result, the intracellular proline level increases and ROS production decreases, thereby promoting tumor progression. GLU, glutamate; Î±-KG, Î±-ketoglutarate.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Chromosomal band 11q13 seems to be one of the most frequently amplified lesions in human cancer, including ESCC, and is associated with an advanced disease stage and a poor prognosis [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene has been identified within this region, but its detailed biological function in human cancer remains largely unclear. Our findings indicate that the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene enhances tumorigenicity and tumor growth and is associated with a poorly differentiated tumor histology in ESCC via proline metabolism and ROS production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show that the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene is associated with proline metabolism and ROS production in human cancer.</p>
      <p>Proline is a multifunctional amino acid with important roles in primary carbon and nitrogen metabolism, osmotic and oxidative stress protection, protein chaperoning, cell signaling, programmed cell death, and nutrient adaption and survival. The metabolism of proline generates electrons to produce ROS and initiates a variety of downstream effects, including blockade of the cell cycle, autophagy, and apoptosis [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Proline is oxidized to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) by proline oxidase (POX), and P5C is recycled back to proline by PYCR via redox transfers or is sequentially converted to glutamate and Î±-ketoglutarate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The effects of POX, as well as its decreased levels in tumors, support its role as a tumor suppressor via ROS production [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite its pro-oxidant effects, proline has been shown to protect mammalian cells, including cancer cells, against oxidative stress. Proline protection has been postulated to involve protein chaperoning, direct scavenging of ROS, and the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our experimental results show that ORAOV1 binds to PYCR1 and PYCR2, that cell survival after stress treatment was significantly higher in <italic>ORAOV1</italic>-overexpressed cell lines than in controls, and that the stress-resistant effect was cancelled by <italic>PYCR</italic>-knockdown. Furthermore, after stress treatment, the intracellular proline concentrations were significantly higher and ROS production was lower in an <italic>ORAOV1</italic>-overexpressed cell line than in the control. These findings indicate that ORAOV1 influences PYCR activity, and as a result, the intracellular proline level increases and ROS production is reduced, thereby promoting tumor progression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Therefore, as was seen in our study, the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene enhances tumorigenicity and tumor growth.</p>
      <p>In our cohort, the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene was amplified in approximately half of the stage III ESCC, and patients with <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification tended to have a shorter OS than patients without amplification, although the difference was not significant. Our experimental findings indicate that the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene enhances tumorigenicity and tumor growth and is associated with a poorly differentiated histology among ESCCs. Thus, these factors might be correlated with a poor prognosis. Although a previous study has shown that <italic>ORAOV1</italic> overexpression is significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stages in ESCC [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], our study is the first report to suggest a possible association with a poor prognosis. However, the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene was identified within chromosomal band 11q13, which includes several known cancer-related genes such as <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>FGF4</italic>, <italic>FGF3</italic>, and <italic>CTTN</italic> [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, patients with <italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification may exhibit the amplification of other cancer-related genes, which might also be related to a poor prognosis.</p>
      <p><italic>ORAOV1</italic> amplification was significantly associated with a poorly differentiated histology and, in our xenograft study, <italic>ORAOV1</italic>-overexpressed cells produced poorly differentiated tumors. The <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene was first identified in oral squamous cell cancer and is frequently amplified, and some previous studies have shown similar results for oral squamous cell cancer [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Recent studies have suggested that ROS is required for differentiation [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene might be related to poorly differentiated tumors via a reduction in ROS production.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the <italic>ORAOV1</italic> gene is frequently amplified in ESCC, enhances tumorigenicity and tumor growth, and is associated with a poorly differentiated histology via proline metabolism and ROS production. Our findings indicate that ORAOV1 might be a novel target for the treatment of ESCC.</p>

Then, after 12 hours of incubation, each of the cell lines (2 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cells) was washed twice with PBS and pelleted using centrifugation. The cell pellets were lysed with 240 Î¼L of methanol and were treated with ultrasonic. Debris was removed by centrifugation, and the proline concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detection and the pre-column derivatization procedure, as previously described [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The experiment was performed in triplicate.</p>
        <p>To measure ROS, the KYSE70 transfectant cell lines were plated onto a 6-cm dish at a density of 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>/dish at 37Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 24 hours of incubation, the culture medium was replaced with 0.5% FBS medium and the cells were treated for 12 hours with or without 50 Î¼M of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Then, CellROX Deep Red Reagent (Invitrogen) was added at a final concentration of 5 Î¼M. After 30 min of incubation at 37Â°C, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed three times with PBS. The cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD FACSCaliburâ¢; BD Biosciences). The experiment was performed in triplicate.</p>

        <p>Continuous variables were analyzed using the Student t-test, and the results were expressed as the average and standard deviations (SD). Dichotomous variables were analyzed using the Fisher exact test. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the time from the surgery until the first observation of disease progression or death from any cause, and the overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the surgery until death from any cause. The DFS and OS curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared among groups using the log-rank test. The statistical analyses were two-tailed and were performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). A <italic>P</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
