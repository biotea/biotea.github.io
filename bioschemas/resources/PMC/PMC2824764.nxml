      <abstract>
        <p>The innate immune response provides a critical defense against microbial infections, including viruses. These are recognised by pattern recognition receptors including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I like helicases (RLHs). Detection of virus triggers signalling cascades that induce transcription of type I interferons including IFNÎ², which are pivotal for the initiation of an anti-viral state. Despite the essential role of IFNÎ² in the anti-viral response, there is an incomplete understanding of the negative regulation of IFNÎ² induction. Here we provide evidence that expression of the Nemo-related protein, optineurin (NRP/FIP2), has a role in the inhibition of virus-triggered IFNÎ² induction. Over-expression of optineurin inhibited Sendai-virus (SeV) and dsRNA triggered induction of IFNÎ², whereas depletion of optineurin with siRNA promoted virus-induced IFNÎ² production and decreased RNA virus replication. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies identified optineurin in a protein complex containing the antiviral protein kinase TBK1 and the ubiquitin ligase TRAF3. Furthermore, mutagenesis studies determined that binding of ubiquitin was essential for both the correct sub-cellular localisation and the inhibitory function of optineurin. This work identifies optineurin as a critical regulator of antiviral signalling and potential target for future antiviral therapy.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Viral infection stimulates the innate immune response to produce various cytokines and chemokines to induce an anti-viral state within the host. The best studied of these are the type I interferons (IFNÎ±/Î²), which are essential for an effective anti-viral response. Our understanding of how IFNÎ² is regulated is not well understood. This study demonstrates that the Nemo-related protein optineurin helps to regulate the levels of IFNÎ² in response to virus infection. We expressed optineurin in cells and found that the cells failed to express IFNÎ² when infected with various RNA viruses. Using biochemical experiments we showed that optineurin interacts with the protein kinase TBK1 and the ubiquitin ligase TRAF3. Furthermore, a mutation in optineurin that prevents the interaction with the small protein modifier ubiquitin (D474N) ablated the negative regulatory function of optineurin. Our findings provide a first example of a role for optineurin in anti-viral signalling and aid in our understanding of the negative regulation of IFNÎ².</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The innate immune response is a highly conserved, first line of defence against microbial pathogens including viruses. To be activated the innate response identifies pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, which are detected by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The different classes of PRRs implicated in the detection of virus include endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLR), cytosolic DexD/H-box retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like helicases (RLH) and cytosolic DNA receptors <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Creagh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>
<xref rid="ppat.1000778-ONeill1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>
<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Yoneyama1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>

Activation of PRRs results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Central to this first line of defence are type I interferons (IFNÎ±/IFNÎ²), which activate transcription of host genes and induce the development of an anti-viral state in the host cell <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Pietras1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Loss of IFNÎ² signalling leads to severe immunodeficiency towards viral infection <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. All of the anti-viral PRRs can induce the transcription of IFNÎ², although the signalling components vary between different PRRs. Common features, however are the recruitment of adaptor proteins (e.g. TLR3 recruits Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor inducing IFNÎ² (TRIF)) to form a scaffold, upon which cellular ubiquitin ligases including TRAF3, and the protein kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and its homologue I-ÎºB kinase (IKKÎµ) are recruited <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Kenny1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>TBK1/IKKÎµ play a central role during the induction of IFNÎ² in response to virus infection, underscored by mouse knockout experiments that demonstrate the loss of virus-triggered IFNÎ² production in TBK1 <sup>â/â</sup> mice <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Currently, the molecular mechanisms that regulate TBK1/IKKÎµ activation are unclear, although recent studies using the small cell permeant inhibitor BX795 suggest that TBK1/IKKÎµ are phosphorylated on Ser172 by an undetermined protein kinase in response to TLR3 signalling <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Phosphorylation of Ser172 leads to an activated form of the kinase that is capable of phosphorylating down-stream substrates including IRF3. Endogenous TBK1/IKKÎµ is found complexed in cells to a number of critical adaptor proteins including TANK <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Pomerantz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, NAP1 <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, SINTBAD <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Ryzhakov1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and the recently described optineurin <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Morton1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These adaptors bind constitutively to TBK1/IKKÎµ and serve to link the kinases to both upstream signalling components as well as down-stream substrates <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Sasai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>
<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These studies suggest that there are distinct TBK1/IKKÎµ complexes within the cell that may respond differently to anti-viral signalling <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Chau1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently various proteins, including A20, SIKE and RNF125, have been demonstrated to negatively regulate IFNÎ² induction by targeting TLR/RLH signalling pathways <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Arimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The TBK1 adaptor protein optineurin (also called NRP (Nemo related protein) and FIP2 (14.7K-interacting protein 2)) inhibits TNFÎ± mediated activation of NFÎºB by competing with Nemo for binding to RIP1 and is implicated in TNFÎ± induced cell death <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Here we describe optineurin as a negative regulator of virus-induced IFNÎ² induction. Optineurin achieves this via an ubiquitin-dependent protein interaction with TBK1, with which it co-localises within the cell. Over-expression of optineurin inhibits IFNÎ² expression, thereby increasing viral titres, whereas optineurin siRNA dramatically enhances the IFN-mediated suppression of virus replication. As such we propose that optineurin may represent a broad ranging inhibitor of pro-inflammatory signalling.</p>

        <title>Expression of optineurin is induced in response to virus infection</title>
        <p>To investigate whether the expression of optineurin is activated in response to viral infection, HEK293 cells were infected with the RIG-I agonist Sendai virus (SeV) and HEK-TLR3 cells were treated with the TLR3 ligand dsRNA (poly-I:C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Using qPCR we found that the abundance of optineurin RNA was increased after 6 hours of SeV infection or dsRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with this we observed increased optineurin protein levels that reached a peak after 12 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Cells that were stimulated with the mitogenic phorbol ester PMA (previously documented to induce the expression of optineurin) <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Schwamborn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> demonstrated similar levels of optineurin induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g001">Figure 1A-B</xref>). To confirm that optineurin protein synthesis was directly activated by virus infection and not indirectly through a response to IFN, we repeated the SeV infections in cells engineered to constitutively express a functional V protein of Parainfluenza virus-5 (PIV5) that blocks IFN signaling (Hep2/PIV5-V cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000778.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Carlos1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and in Vero cells, which lack the genes for type I interferon <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Mosca1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Similar levels of optineurin protein expression were observed in response to SeV infection or PMA treatment in naÃ¯ve cells, PIV5-V expressing cells and Vero cells, despite the inability of these cells to respond to IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000778.s001">S1B</xref>). These data collectively indicate that optineurin expression is increased in direct response to virus infection.</p>

        <title>Over-expression of optineurin inhibits TLR3 and RLH-triggered induction of the IFNÎ² promoter</title>
        <p>Since optineurin levels are induced following viral infection we next sought to determine whether optineurin regulates virus-triggered signalling. Using reporter assays, over-expression of optineurin strongly inhibited IFNÎ² induction in response to SeV infection in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g002">Figure 2A</xref> left). Furthermore, over-expression of optineurin also inhibited dsRNA-induced induction of the IFNÎ² promoter in HEK-TLR3 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g002">Figure 2A</xref> right). To further define the role of optineurin in the RLH-triggered IFNÎ² activation pathway, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding RIG-I or Mda-5. Over-expression of RLHs induced a robust activation of the IFNÎ² reporter, as shown previously <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Sumpter1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Andrejeva1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Consistently, optineurin over-expression inhibited activation of the IFNÎ² promoter in these assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000778.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Importantly, the observed effects were not due to optineurin-mediated effects on RIG-I or Mda-5 protein expression, as demonstrated by western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000778.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Induction of IFNÎ² relies on the co-ordinated action of the transcription factors NFÎºB and IRF3 <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Visvanathan1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Goodbourn1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Goodbourn2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In reporter assays optineurin inhibited SeV-triggered activation of the NFÎºB-dependent PRDII element of the IFNÎ² promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with previous reports of an optineurin-dependent inhibition of NFÎºB <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Importantly, expression of optineurin inhibited SeV-induced activation of PRDIII/I and ISRE (from the ISG54 gene) reporters, both recognised by activated IRF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In similar experiments optineurin had no inhibitory effects on a serum response element reporter (SRE) or a cAMP response element responsive reporter (CRE) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000778.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). In comparison both reporters were successfully inhibited in the presence of known viral antagonists of the MAPK and cAMP pathways, NS5A and NS3, respectively <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Aoubala1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Mankouri1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Macdonald1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p>

            <p>(A) Effect of optineurin on an IFNÎ² promoter driven luciferase reporter (pIFNÎ²-luc) construct. HEK293 or HEK-TLR3 cells were transfected with the IFNÎ² promoter-driven reporter in the presence of increasing amounts of optineurin expression vector and infected with SeV (100 HA units/ml) (left) or stimulated with extracellular poly-I:C (100 Âµg/ml) (right). Cells were lysed after 16 hours treatment and analysed for levels of luciferase. (B) HEK293 cells were transfected with either the PRDII, PRDIII/I or ISRE (from ISG54) reporter constructs in combination with optineurin or an empty expression plasmid and infected with SeV (100 HA units/ml). Cells were lysed after 16 hours treatment and analysed for levels of luciferase. Data for all experiments are presented as fold luciferase from an un-stimulated control lacking optineurin co-expression. Error bars are SEM from three independent experiments. (C) HEK293 cells stably expressing optineurin or an empty plasmid control were infected with SeV (100 HA units/ml) and lysed after 8 hours infection. Lysates were analysed for P-IRF3 (Ser396), IRF3, and optineurin by immunoblot. (D) HEK293/HEK-TLR3 cells expressing optineurin or empty plasmid control were infected with SeV (100 HA units/ml) or treated with poly-I:C (100 Âµg/ml) for 24 hours and IFNÎ² production was determined by ELISA. Error bars are SEM from three independent experiments.</p>

        <p>Western blot analysis revealed that cells expressing optineurin displayed a 60% reduction in IRF3 phosphorylation when infected with SeV and a 50% decrease in IRF3 phosphorylation in response to poly-I:C treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000778.s002">S2C</xref>). Blotting with phosphorylation state-independent antibodies showed similar levels of total IRF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These data imply that in cells overexpressing optineurin the phosphorylation of IRF3 and its subsequent activity are inhibited.</p>
        <p>Consistent with the promoter reporter assays SeV-induced IFN-Î² protein levels were also reduced in HEK293 cells over-expressing optineurin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that optineurin acts specifically as a negative regulator of the IFNÎ² response to RNA-activated antiviral signalling pathways.</p>

        <title>Sub cellular localisation of endogenous optineurin</title>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that optineurin associates with myosin VI and Rab8 <xref rid="ppat.1000778-delToro1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Sahlender1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. These proteins are involved in the transport of vesicles and cargo recruitment. It was plausible that optineurin might regulate innate immune signalling in the endocytic pathway. We therefore investigated the localisation of endogenous optineurin. Consistent with previous findings optineurin was found to localise to a Golgi-associated compartment as demonstrated by co-staining for TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1000778-delToro1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. However, a distinct portion of optineurin localised to a broader cytoplasmic region of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), which did not significantly localise with EEA1 or CD63, markers of early and late endosomes respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>). In addition, we saw no significant co-localisation of optineurin with concanavalin A (ConA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), which suggests that optineurin is not localised to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When optineurin was transiently over-expressed compared to the endogenous distribution we observed increased accumulation of optineurin in TGN46 positive vesicles, suggesting that over-expressing the protein increases optineurin translocation to this compartment (see below).</p>

        <title>Optineurin interacts with TBK1</title>
        <p>We screened likely optineurin-binding partners from the innate anti-viral signalling pathways for an interaction with optineurin by expressing GST-tagged versions of the bait proteins and a HA-tagged optineurin. This successfully detected a constitutive interaction with the protein kinase TBK1, occurring both in the presence and absence of SeV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). These experiments were repeated using dsRNA treatment of HEK293-TLR3 cells to activate TLR3 signalling and a similar constitutive interaction between TBK1 and optineurin was detected (data not shown). We next immunoprecipitated endogenous optineurin from a murine macrophage cell line stimulated with poly-I:C and investigated whether it was capable of interacting with TBK1. The optineurin precipitates contained detectable levels of constitutively bound TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Additionally, an anti-TBK1 antibody successfully immunoprecipitated optineurin from the same lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

        <p>We reasoned that the ubiquitin-binding motif of optineurin might aid in the interaction with binding partners such as TBK1. To address this issue, the interaction between optineurin and TBK1 was further analysed in cells. Cell lines expressing a GST-tagged TBK1 were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged wild type or D474N optineurin and the TBK1 precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads. GST-TBK1 co-precipitated with wild-type optineurin, whereas GST alone did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, GST-TBK1 precipitated substantially less optineurin D474N compared to wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g006">Figure 6B</xref> top panels), with no apparent difference in wild-type and D474N protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g006">Figure 6B</xref> bottom panels). These data suggest that the ubiquitin-binding domain (UBAN) of optineurin may therefore be required for the efficient interaction with TBK1.</p>
        <p>When the sub-cellular distribution of the D474N mutant protein was analysed we observed a dramatic redistribution into a cytosolic-like staining pattern whilst the wild-type optineurin clustered around TGN46 positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This suggests that part of the requirement for optineurin to target to these membranes is fulfilled by an interaction with ubiquitin. Consistent with this we observed a high degree of co-localisation of ubiquitin at these clustered sites of optineurin localisation (data not shown). Additionally, endogenous TBK1 displayed co-localisation with over-expressed wild-type optineurin to these large vesicles, whilst the endogenous TBK1 distribution in D474N over-expressing cells remained diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000778-g007">Figure 7A</xref> lower panels).</p>

Bunyamwera virus is a segmented negative stranded RNA virus and the prototypic member of the <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> family. The NSs protein acts as a potent IFN antagonist and can effectively block induction of IFNÎ² <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>During infection cytokine signalling must be controlled to prevent unwanted tissue damage. Host cells have therefore developed strategies to regulate the level of cytokines produced in response to infection. Critical to this regulation are an increasing number of negative regulatory proteins. The results presented in this paper establish optineurin as a novel regulator of virus-triggered IFNÎ² induction. Over-expression of optineurin inhibited both TLR3 and cytoplasmic helicase (RIG-I/Mda-5) triggered activation of the IFNÎ² promoter and suppressed the ability of a defective Bunyamweravirus to induce IFNÎ². Conversely, cells that were depleted of optineurin by treatment with siRNA were more resistant to SeV and SFV infection, and these cells produced more IFNÎ² upon infection. Previously it has been described that optineurin is induced by inflammatory cytokines including TNFÎ± <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. We have now established that virus infection also markedly increases the amount of optineurin protein present in the cells directly as optineurin expression in cells unable to respond to IFN was still up-regulated by virus infection. Promoter mapping studies suggest this up-regulation is likely to be mediated by NFÎºB <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Sudhakar1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Coupled with the observation that optineurin deficiency did not result in induction of IFNÎ², but rather augmented the virus-induced transcription of IFNÎ², these data indicate that optineurin levels are increased upon virus infection in order for it to contribute to the fine-tuning of the anti-viral response.</p>
      <p>Optineurin has recently been characterised as an NFÎºB-regulated gene product that interacts with the receptor interacting kinase RIP1 in response to TNFÎ± and initiates a negative feedback loop to inhibit NFÎºB signalling <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Sudhakar1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The inhibition of both TNFÎ± and IFNÎ² pathways suggests that optineurin functions as a negative feedback regulator of immune signalling. In this context it will be important to determine the response of optineurin deficient mice to virus infection.</p>
      <p>To establish a molecular mechanism for the regulatory role of optineurin we demonstrated an interaction with the protein kinase TBK1. TBK1 is a ubiquitously expressed kinase and a critical point of convergence for TLR and RLH-triggered induction of IFNÎ², and as such is a likely candidate for regulation. Characterisation of the optineurin-TBK1 interaction suggests that optineurin is a TBK1 adaptor protein. Binding assays indicated that optineurin was constitutively associated with TBK1, akin to known adaptor proteins including TANK-NAP1-SINTBAD <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Chau1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated co-localisation of optineurin and TBK1. Interestingly, quantification of the amounts of optineurin co-localised with TBK1 revealed a significant pool of TBK1 not associated with optineurin, which presumably contained TBK1 complexed with other adaptor proteins (TANK-NAP1-SINTBAD). Morton and colleagues recently identified TBK1 as an optineurin binding partner <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Morton1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Importantly, our findings confirm the constitutive interaction data presented in their study. Moreover, they also identified that optineurin and TANK may share a common binding site on TBK1 <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Morton1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, which supports the theory that there are distinct pools of TBK1 within a cell, each bound by a specific adaptor protein <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Chau1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. TBK1 is closely related to IKKÎµ and is thought to have overlapping functions, including inducing transcription of type I IFN. Both TBK1 and IKKÎµ constitutively interact with TANK-NAP1-SINTBAD <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Chau1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and these adaptor proteins are thought to be essential for the overlapping functions of these kinases. Surprisingly, binding assays demonstrated that optineurin was not able to interact with IKKÎµ <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Morton1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. If this were the case it suggests that optineurin is the first TBK1 specific adaptor protein found to date and that the TBK1-optineurin complex regulates distinct aspects of the response to virus infection.</p>
      <p>It is currently unclear exactly how optineurin regulates the induction of IFNÎ². A clue comes from mutagenesis studies, which demonstrate that the ubiquitin-binding motif (UBAN) within optineurin is essential for inhibitory function, as a mutation within this motif (D474N) profoundly impaired the ability of optineurin to inhibit the induction of IFNÎ². Furthermore, our studies using this mutant highlighted the requirement of this motif for binding to TBK1. Although, the putative TBK1 binding motif within optineurin has been suggested to locate to the amino terminal third of the protein <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Morton1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, our data clearly demonstrate that significantly less optineurin (D474N) is bound by TBK1 compared to wild-type protein. The disparity in findings prompted us to investigate the effect of the D474N mutant on optineurin localisation. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the D474N mutant was not targeted to the same sub-cellular localisation as wild-type protein. Clearly, in this case the ubiquitin-binding motif acts as a potent localisation signal. Moreover, in co-localisation experiments the sites of specific optineurin-TBK1 clustering were lost when optineurin was unable to bind to ubiquitin. Collectively these data suggest that optineurin targets TBK1 to specific sites in the cell and that this is dependent on an interaction with ubiquitin. This was reminiscent of the role of Eps15, which uses an ubiquitin-binding motif to correctly orchestrate formation of protein complexes during receptor tyrosine kinase endocytosis <xref rid="ppat.1000778-deMelker1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and suggests a model where optineurin may bind to specific ubiquitylated targets to orchestrate specific signalling.</p>
      <p>Recent studies suggest that key proteins within the antiviral response are ubiquitylated; including RIG-I and IPS-1 <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Paz1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Gack1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and that several cellular regulators target this ubiquitylation including CYLD, DUBA and RNF125 <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Arimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000778-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Indeed, a mechanism proposed by Zhu and colleagues for the regulation of NFÎºB by optineurin relies on the competitive recruitment of optineurin to polyubiquitylated RIP1 <xref rid="ppat.1000778-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The impact of the D474N mutant on the ability of optineurin to inhibit IFNÎ² induction would argue for a similar mechanism in this case. A role for ubiquitin in the function of optineurin is further strengthened by the observation that optineurin can interact with TRAF3. We speculate that TRAF3 may be required for the polyubiquitylation of optineurin binding partners within the innate signalling pathways, although these targets are not known at this stage. Further studies are needed to ascertain the functional significance of the optineurin-TBK1 sub-cellular targeting and the constituents of any multi-protein complexes, in addition to TRAF3 that contain optineurin. Future studies will undoubtedly identify additional ubiquitylated binding partners for optineurin in antiviral signalling pathways.</p>
      <p>In conclusion this study expands the role of optineurin, beyond the negative regulation of TNFÎ± signalling, to include the regulation of virus triggered IFNÎ² induction. Although, more studies are needed to address the molecular mechanisms by which optineurin regulates the antiviral response, we propose that that optineurin may be a broad-spectrum negative regulator of inflammation.</p>
