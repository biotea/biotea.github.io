      <abstract>
        <p>Intellectual disability and seizures are frequently associated with hypomagnesemia and have an important genetic component. However, to find the genetic origin of intellectual disability and seizures often remains challenging because of considerable genetic heterogeneity and clinical variability. In this study, we have identified new mutations in <italic>CNNM2</italic> in five families suffering from mental retardation, seizures, and hypomagnesemia. For the first time, a recessive mode of inheritance of <italic>CNNM2</italic> mutations was observed. Importantly, patients with recessive <italic>CNNM2</italic> mutations suffer from brain malformations and severe intellectual disability. Additionally, three patients with moderate mental disability were shown to carry <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous missense mutations in the <italic>CNNM2</italic> gene. To elucidate the physiological role of CNNM2 and explain the pathomechanisms of disease, we studied CNNM2 function combining <italic>in vitro</italic> activity assays and the zebrafish knockdown model system. Using stable Mg<sup>2+</sup> isotopes, we demonstrated that CNNM2 increases cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake in HEK293 cells and that this process occurs through regulation of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-permeable cation channel TRPM7. In contrast, cells expressing mutated CNNM2 proteins did not show increased Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Knockdown of <italic>cnnm2</italic> isoforms in zebrafish resulted in disturbed brain development including neurodevelopmental impairments such as increased embryonic spontaneous contractions and weak touch-evoked escape behaviour, and reduced body Mg content, indicative of impaired renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> absorption. These phenotypes were rescued by injection of mammalian wild-type <italic>Cnnm2</italic> cRNA, whereas mammalian mutant <italic>Cnnm2</italic> cRNA did not improve the zebrafish knockdown phenotypes. We therefore concluded that CNNM2 is fundamental for brain development, neurological functioning and Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. By establishing the loss-of-function zebrafish model for CNNM2 genetic disease, we provide a unique system for testing therapeutic drugs targeting CNNM2 and for monitoring their effects on the brain and kidney phenotype.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mental retardation affects 1â3% of the population and has a strong genetic etiology. Consequently, early identification of the genetic causes of mental retardation is of significant importance in the diagnosis of the disease, as predictor of the progress of the disease and for the determination of treatment. In this study, we identify mutations in the gene encoding for cyclin M2 (CNNM2) to be causative for mental retardation and seizures in patients with hypomagnesemia. Particularly, in patients with a recessive mode of inheritance, the intellectual disability caused by dysfunctional CNNM2 is dramatically severe and is accompanied by severely limited motor skills and brain malformations suggestive of impaired early brain development. Although hypomagnesemia has been associated to several neurological diseases, Mg<sup>2+</sup> status is not regularly assessed in patients with seizures and mental disability. Our findings establish CNNM2 as an important protein for renal magnesium handling, brain development and neurological functioning, thus explaining the physiology of human disease caused by (dysfunctional) mutations in CNNM2. CNNM2 mutations should be taken into account in patients with seizures and mental disability, specifically in combination with hypomagnesemia.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Brain defects including seizures, migraine, depression and intellectual disability are frequently associated with hypomagnesemia <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Dimke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Indeed, low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations may cause epileptiform activity during development <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Moser1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Specifically, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> channel transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is essential for brain function and development <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Interestingly, patients with genetic defects in TRPM6, a close homologue of TRPM7, may have neurological complications <xref rid="pgen.1004267-vandeGraaf1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although TRPM6 and TRPM7 share similar Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporting properties, they are differentially expressed and regulated <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Runnels1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. TRPM7 is a ubiquitously expressed protein regulating intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels in a broad range of cells, whereas TRPM6 is localized in the luminal membrane of renal and intestinal epithelia involved in Mg<sup>2+</sup> absorption <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Dimke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Hoenderop1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-Voets1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recently, we have identified mutations in the gene encoding cyclin M2 (CNNM2) in two unrelated families with dominant isolated hypomagnesemia (CNNM2 [MIM 607803]) <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Stuiver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Patients suffered from symptoms associated with low serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels (0.3â0.5 mM) such as tremors, headaches and muscle weakness. The role of CNNM2 in the kidney for the maintenance of serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels can be traced to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), where also TRPM6 is expressed. Here, CNNM2 is present in the basolateral membrane of DCT cells and its expression is regulated by dietary Mg<sup>2+</sup> availability <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Stuiver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-deBaaij1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although CNNM2 has been proposed as a Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter in overexpression studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Goytain1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport could not be directly measured in mammalian cells using patch clamp analysis <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Stuiver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. On the other hand, modelling of the CNNM2 cystathionine Î²-synthase (CBS) domain resulted in the identification of a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP binding site, suggesting a role in Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensing within the cell <xref rid="pgen.1004267-deBaaij2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Consequently, the molecular mechanism explaining the role of CNNM2 in DCT-mediated Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>The <italic>CNNM2</italic> gene is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, most prominently in kidney, brain and lung <xref rid="pgen.1004267-deBaaij2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Although the role of CNNM2 beyond the kidney has never been studied, genome wide association studies have related the <italic>CNNM2</italic> locus to blood pressure, coronary artery disease and schizophrenia, suggesting an important role of CNNM2 in the cardiovascular system and brain <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Ripke1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-NewtonCheh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. CNNM2 is widely conserved among species. In zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), a frequently used model for ion homeostasis and human genetic diseases in general <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-Lieschke1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the <italic>cnnm2</italic> gene is duplicated and two paralogues, <italic>cnnm2a</italic> and <italic>cnnm2b</italic>, are described <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Arjona1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Both paralogues share a high conservation with human <italic>CNNM2</italic> (79% amino acid identity). In detail, transcripts are abundantly expressed in zebrafish brain and in ionoregulatory organs such as kidney and gills, which act as a pseudokidney in fish <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Arjona1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Consistent with the regulation of <italic>CNNM2</italic> transcripts in mammals <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Goytain1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the expression of <italic>cnnm2a</italic> and <italic>cnnm2b</italic> is regulated by Mg<sup>2+</sup>
<italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004267-Arjona1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we aim to elucidate the function of CNNM2 in brain and kidney. Hence, we can demonstrate the genetic origin of symptoms in five unrelated families suffering from a distinct phenotype of mental retardation, seizures and hypomagnesemia, where we have identified novel mutations in the <italic>CNNM2</italic> gene. By combining functional analyses and a loss-of-function approach in the zebrafish model, we provide functional evidence for a key role of CNNM2 in brain development, neurological activity and renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> handling.</p>

Serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels at manifestation were found to be 0.5 mM in both patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004267-t001">Table 1</xref>). Convulsions were refractory to conventional antiepileptic medications. Intravenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation with â¼1 mmol/kg body weight/day was initiated after oral Mg<sup>2+</sup> failed to correct serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels. However, seizure activity continued even in face of normomagnesemia. An extensive analysis for infectious causes or inborn errors of metabolism did not yield any positive results. Ultrasound examination of the kidneys did not reveal nephrocalcinosis, whereas basal ganglia calcifications were noted in early central nervous system (CNS) sonographies. During follow-up, severe developmental delay was noted accompanied by microcephaly (head circumference below third percentile for age and sex in both patients). A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 5.5 years of age in patient F1.1 showed wide supratentorial outer cerebrospinal liquor spaces with failure of opercularization together with a significantly reduced myelinization of the white matter tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g001">Figure 1CâD</xref>). The severe degree of intellectual disability, which became apparent with increasing age comprised major deficits in cognitive function, the inability to verbally communicate, and severely limited motor skills. Both children are not able to perform main activities of daily living and require full-time care by an attendant. Seizure activity is sufficiently controlled in the older brother by valproate and lamotrigine, electroencephalography (EEGs) merely shows generalized slowing, but no epileptic activity. In contrast, the younger sister suffers from ongoing generalized, myoclonic seizures despite antiepileptic treatment with valproate and levetiracetame. Laboratory investigations during follow-up demonstrated persistent hypomagnesemia of â¼0.6 mM despite oral Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation.</p>

(B) Localization of the mutations in the CNNM2 protein structure (Uniprot Q9H8M5). CNNM2 contains a long signal peptide (64 amino acids) that is cleaved at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. The remaining part of the CNNM2 protein is trafficked to the plasma membrane, where it becomes functionally active. White dots show the locations of the mutations. (CâD) MRI of the brain of patient F1.1 (C, T2 weighed images) and patient F2.1 (D, T2 weighed images). Left: Coronal images demonstrating a defect in myelinization of U-fibers (arrows) in patient F1.1 in contrast to a normal myelin pattern in patient F2.1. Center: Coronal T2 weighted images showing widened outer cerebrospinal liquor spaces (dashed arrows) and lack of opercularization (solid arrows) in patient F1.1, whereas a regular brain volume and insular lobe is observed in patient F2.1.

        <p>Patients F2.1, F3.1, and F4.1 presented with seizures during infancy (between 4 and 12 months of age). Laboratory evaluation yielded isolated hypomagnesemia of â¼0.5 mM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004267-t001">Table 1</xref>). Urine analyses demonstrated inappropriate fractional excretion for Mg<sup>2+</sup> in face of persistent hypomagnesemia. In addition, the renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> leak was verified by Mg<sup>2+</sup> loading tests in patients F2.1 and F4.1 as described before <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Walder1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Urinary calcium excretion rates were normal, renal ultrasound excluded the presence of nephrocalcinosis. After acute therapy with intravenous Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the patients received a continuous oral Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation of 0.5 to 1 mmol/kg body weight/day of elemental Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This oral therapy however failed to correct the hypomagnesemia, serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> remained in the subnormal range in all three children. Because of recurrent cerebral seizures, patients F2.1 to F4.1 received diverse antiepileptic medications. Currently only patient F4.1 is still treated with clobazam.</p>
        <p>In all three patients (F2.1 to F4.1), a significant degree of intellectual disability was already noted in early childhood with delayed speech development, but also impaired motor as well as cognitive skills. In addition, patient F4.1 was noted to exhibit disturbed social interaction, abnormal verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as stereotyped behaviour and finally received the formal diagnosis of early onset autism. All three patients F2.1 to F4.1 were not able to attend regular schools. Standardized intelligence testing in patients F2.1 and F3.1 revealed a significant degree of mental retardation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004267-t001">Table 1</xref>). While patients F2.1 and F3.1 are currently living with their parents, patient F4.1 is placed in a home for children with mental illness because of episodes of violence and destructive behaviour. The parents of all three children (F2.1âF4.1) had normal serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels and no signs of intellectual disability.</p>
        <p>Finally, patient F5.1 presented with muscle spasms and dysesthesia in adolescence. Serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels were found to be low (â¼0.6 mM). Because of concomitant borderline hypokalemia, she was suspected to have Gitelman syndrome ([MIM 263800]) and received oral Mg<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> supplements. Also this patient exhibited a mild degree of intellectual disability. Unfortunately, she was not available for further examination.</p>

        <title>CNNM2 mutations in patients with mental retardation</title>
        <p>Common genetic causes of mental retardation were excluded in patients F1.1 and F2.1 by array CGH (comparative genomic hybridization). The presence of two affected siblings together with the suspected parental consanguinity in family F1 suggested an autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance. Therefore, we subjected patients F1.1 and F1.2 to homozygosity mapping which, at a cut-off size of &gt;1.7 megabases (Mb), yielded eleven critical intervals on autosomes with a cumulative size of 62 Mb. The gene list generated from these loci included 322 RefSeq genes and putative transcripts. <italic>CNNM2</italic> in a critical interval of 7.1 Mb on chromosome 10 emerged as the most promising candidate gene because of its known role in Mg<sup>2+</sup> metabolism <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Stuiver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Goytain1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-deBaaij2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Sponder1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Conventional Sanger sequencing of the complete coding region of the <italic>CNNM2</italic> gene revealed a homozygous mutation, c.364G&gt;A, leading to a non-conservative amino acid substitution of glutamate to lysine at position 122 of the CNNM2 protein (p.Glu122Lys, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g001">Figure 1AâB</xref>).

After discovery of this homozygous mutation in patients F1.1 and F1.2, a larger cohort (nâ=â34) of patients with Mg<sup>2+</sup> deficiency of unknown origin was screened for mutations in the <italic>CNNM2</italic> gene. Mutations in heterozygous state were discovered in patients F2.1 to F5.1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004267-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, sequencing of the complete coding region and adjacent exon-intron boundaries did not reveal a second pathogenic allele. Next, we examined the <italic>CNNM2</italic> gene in parents and unaffected siblings of families F2 to F4. The mutations previously identified in our patients were not detected in either of the parents pointing to <italic>de novo</italic> mutational events. Interestingly, patients F2.1 and F4.1 exhibited the same mutation, p.Glu357Lys (c.1069G&gt;A), affecting a highly conserved amino acid residue in the 2<sup>nd</sup> membrane-spanning domain of the CNNM2 protein. Also the p.Ser269Trp (c.806C&gt;G) mutation detected in patient F3.1 affects a highly conserved residue located in the 1<sup>st</sup> transmembrane domain. All three mutations were ranked âprobably damagingâ by Polyphen-2 when tested for functional consequences of the mutations (p.Glu122Lys, p.Ser269Trp and p.Glu357Lys with scores of 0.981, 1.000 and 1.000, respectively). Finally, in patient F5.1 with a late manifestation and putatively milder phenotype, the variant p.Leu330Phe (c.988C&gt;T) was identified in heterozygous state. This variant affects an amino acid residue conserved among mammals, however a phenylalanine appears at this position in certain fish species. The variant is predicted to be possibly damaging by Polyphen-2 with a score of 0.711. None of the identified variants was detected in 204 controls or present in publically available exome data.</p>

        <p>To clarify the function of CNNM2, Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells were transiently transfected with mouse <italic>Cnnm2</italic> or mock constructs and examined for Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport capacity using the stable <sup>25</sup>Mg<sup>2+</sup> isotope.

Dose-response experiments confirmed that the IC<sub>50</sub> of 2-APB inhibition is 22 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). CNNM2-dependent <sup>25</sup>Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake was found to be independent of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>â</sup> availability, when uptakes were performed in N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) or Gluconate buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).

        <title>Disturbed Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and brain abnormalities in <italic>cnnm2</italic> morphant zebrafish larvae</title>
        <p>Patients with mutations in <italic>CNNM2</italic> suffer from hypomagnesemia. Therefore, zebrafish <italic>cnnm2</italic> morphants were tested for disruptions of their Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Extraction of serum from zebrafish embryos is technically not feasible. Thus, total body Mg contents of controls and morphant larvae were examined at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). During these 5 days of zebrafish development, intestinal absorption of Mg<sup>2+</sup> does not take place since larvae do not eat and drink. For that reason, Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is the result of the balance between Mg<sup>2+</sup> excretion, passive Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake from the yolk, Mg<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption in the kidney, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake in the integument, where ionocytes are analogous to renal tubular cells in terms of function and transporter and channel expression <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore, when knocking down a gene involved in active epithelial Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake, disturbances in total body Mg content reliably represent disturbances in active Mg<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption and/or uptake, through pronephric (renal) tubular cells and/or their analogous in the skin, respectively.</p>
        <p>The <italic>cnnm2a</italic> gene, one of the two zebrafish <italic>cnnm2</italic> paralogues, is expressed during early development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Injection in embryos of higher doses than 2 ng of morpholino (MO) blocking <italic>cnnm2a</italic> translation resulted in a significantly reduced survival compared to controls at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). At non-lethal doses of MO (when mortality caused by the <italic>cnnm2a</italic>-MO does not differ significantly from mortality in controls), knockdown of <italic>cnnm2a</italic> resulted in morphological phenotypes characterized by enlarged pericardial cavities and notochord defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g004">Figure 4CâD</xref>). The biochemical equivalency between mammalian CNNM2 and its zebrafish orthologue <italic>cnnm2a</italic> was demonstrated by the fact that co-injection of <italic>cnnm2a</italic>-MO with mouse wild-type <italic>Cnnm2</italic> cRNA induced a rescue of all phenotypes observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Conversely, co-injection with mouse mutant <italic>Cnnm2</italic> cRNA did not result in any rescue. In line with the symptom of hypomagnesemia in patients with mutated <italic>CNNM2</italic>, <italic>cnnm2a</italic> morphants exhibited significantly reduced levels of Mg compared to controls when increasing doses of MO were injected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Total Mg content in <italic>cnnm2a</italic> morphants was restored to control levels when <italic>cnnm2a</italic>-MO was co-injected with cRNA encoding for mouse wild-type CNNM2 and not with mutant <italic>Cnnm2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g004">Figure 4G</xref>).

        <title>Brain abnormalities and increased spontaneous contractions in <italic>cnnm2</italic> morphant zebrafish embryos</title>
        <p>Patients with <italic>CNNM2</italic> mutations suffer from mental retardation and seizures. As the severe neurological phenotype in patients F1.1 and F1.2 was diagnosed early after birth (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004267-t001">Table 1</xref>), we hypothesized that the deleterious effects of mutant <italic>CNNM2</italic> could result from early developmental defects in brain primordia. In zebrafish, the segmental organization of the brain rudiment, and morphologically visible boundaries and primordia are established at 25 hours post-fertilization (hpf). At this stage, maldevelopment of the midbrain hindbrain boundary (MHB) is observed in <italic>cnnm2a</italic> morphant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g006">Figure 6AâB</xref>). Interestingly, these phenotypes could not be rescued by exposure to media with high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), even though these media significantly increased the Mg content of morphant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). More importantly, phenotypes were rescued by co-injection with the mouse orthologue cRNA and not by co-injection with the mutant transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In addition to brain developmental defects, the frequency of spontaneous embryonic contractions was increased in <italic>cnnm2a</italic> morphants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), which could indicate that (motor) neurons are hyperexcitable <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Mahmood1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This phenotype was not rescued by exposure to high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004267-g006">Figure 6E</xref>).

        <p>As our <italic>in vitro</italic> data pointed to a putative interaction between CNNM2 and TRPM7 and zebrafish morphants presented brain developmental defects, the touch-evoked escape behaviour in zebrafish was evaluated, a parameter largely dependent on TRPM7 activity in sensory neurons and/or brain development <xref rid="pgen.1004267-SaintAmant1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-Low1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, a severe brain phenotype consisting of cerebral seizures, mental retardation and brain malformations in patients with hypomagnesemia was shown to be caused by mutations in <italic>CNNM2</italic>. Our experiments established <italic>CNNM2</italic> as a new essential gene in brain development, neurological functioning and Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. This notion is supported by the following observations; <italic>i</italic>) hypomagnesemic patients with <italic>CNNM2</italic> mutations suffer from seizures, mental disability, and if mutations are present in recessive state, brain malformations are observed in addition; <italic>ii</italic>) Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation does not improve the neurological phenotype of the patients; <italic>iii</italic>) CNNM2 increases Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake in HEK293 cells, whereas mutant CNNM2 does not; <italic>iv</italic>) knockdown of CNNM2 orthologues in zebrafish results in impaired development of the brain, abnormal neurodevelopmental phenotypes manifested as altered locomotor and touch-evoke escape behaviours, and Mg wasting; <italic>v</italic>) the zebrafish phenotype can be rescued by injection of mouse <italic>Cnnm2</italic> cRNA.</p>
      <p>In addition to the previously reported dominant mode of inheritance <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Stuiver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, the genetic findings in our patients support heterogenous patterns of inheritance. In family F1, a recessive mode of <italic>CNNM2</italic> inheritance was observed. The homozygous CNNM2 p.Glu122Lys mutation in this family resulted in the manifestation of a neonatal onset and a considerably more severe cerebral involvement than in the remaining patients. Yet, a central nervous system (CNS) phenotype with seizures and intellectual disability, which was not reported previously, represented the cardinal clinical symptom in all of our patients. Seizures constituted the major symptom at manifestation coinciding with hypomagnesemia, but were also seen during follow-up despite Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation. Pronounced Mg<sup>2+</sup> deficiency reflected by severely low serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels clearly represents a promotive element in the development of seizures. However, the persistence of seizure activity despite Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation might point to a genuine disturbance in brain function caused by defective CNNM2. Accordingly, the extent of hypomagnesemia found in the two siblings with the recessive mutation, F1.1 and F1.2, was identical to other patients (F2.1âF5.1) with heterozygous CNNM2 mutations and a milder neurological phenotype. Continuous oral Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation stabilized serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels in the subnormal range, however a complete normalization of Mg<sup>2+</sup> metabolism could not be achieved in any of the patients.</p>
      <p>In three out of five families (F2, F3 and F4), the mutation of the patient was not present in the parents. This finding supports the recent advancements evidencing that <italic>de novo</italic> mutations provide an important mechanism in the development of mental disability disorders <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Veltman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Remarkably, the same <italic>de novo</italic> p.Glu357Lys mutation was identified in two unrelated individuals. Although the mutation rate along the human genome varies significantly <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Hodgkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the chance to observe an identical <italic>de novo</italic> base pair change in two individuals is extremely small, supporting causality of this mutation. The clinical and genetic findings observed in patient F5.1 should be interpreted with caution. Though the p.Leu330Phe variant was not present in controls or exome variant databases, the presence of an innocuous polymorphism cannot be completely excluded. The clinical phenotype with a milder degree of intellectual disability and a later manifestation with hypomagnesemic symptoms during adolescence support a partial loss of CNNM2 function caused by the p.Leu330Phe variant. Unfortunately, the patient was not available for clinical re-evaluation.</p>
      <p>Over the recent years, the function of CNNM2 in the context of Mg<sup>2+</sup> handling has been heavily debated <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Stuiver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Goytain1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Sponder1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, an important question is how CNNM2 mutations cause impaired Mg<sup>2+</sup> metabolism and lead to CNS dysfunction. Functional studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated a putative role in cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport. Overexpression of CNNM2 increased cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake, which was abrogated by introduction of the CNNM2 mutants identified in our patients. The p.Ser269Trp and p.Glu357Lys mutants as well as the previously published p.Thr568Ile mutant <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Stuiver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, all identified in heterozygous state, failed to enhance the cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake, indicating a loss-of-function in mutated CNNM2. The recessively inherited p.Glu122Lys mutant identified in patients F1.1 and F1.2 displayed a small but significant residual function, while Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake was almost completely retained for mutant p.Leu330Phe. Biotinylation experiments demonstrated a trafficking defect of p.Glu122Lys and p.Ser269Trp mutants supporting a loss-of-function nature of CNNM2 mutations. Together, these findings argue for distinct degrees of severity of the disease depending on the number of affected alleles. Furthermore, a small residual function of p.Glu122Lys is in line with the lack of a clinical phenotype in the parents of family F1. The parents, however, declined a thorough evaluation of their Mg<sup>2+</sup> status.</p>
      <p>To further analyze the relevance of CNNM2 for brain and Mg<sup>2+</sup> metabolism deduced from the human disease model, the translation of orthologues of <italic>CNNM2</italic> (<italic>cnnm2a</italic> and <italic>cnnm2b</italic>) was knocked down in zebrafish. In line with the human disease, the concentration of total body Mg was decreased in zebrafish <italic>cnnm2a</italic> and <italic>cnnm2b</italic> morphants when compared to controls. The decrease in total body Mg content is interpreted as a decrease in the renal absorption and/or skin uptake (through ionocytes analogous to renal tubular cells) of the ionic fraction, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, since only Mg<sup>2+</sup> is transported transcellularly and no intestinal Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake takes place in zebrafish larvae. Additionally, Mg losses observed in morphant larvae were rescued by expression of wild-type <italic>Cnnm2</italic>, but not by expression of mutant <italic>Cnnm2</italic>. This demonstrates the specificity of our MO antisense oligos, as well as the functional equivalence between mammalian CNNM2 and its zebrafish orthologues.</p>
      <p>Consistent with the human pathology, knockdown of <italic>cnnm2a</italic> or <italic>cnnm2b</italic> induced brain malformations. Specifically, the brain phenotype observed in <italic>cnnm2b</italic> morphants resembles that found in patient F1.1 showing enlarged outer cerebrospinal liquor spaces. This provides further consistency to link CNNM2 dysfunction with the brain morphological defects found in this homozygous patient. The absence of outer cerebrospinal liquor spaces in the cerebrum of <italic>cnnm2a</italic> morphants shows that <italic>cnnm2</italic> paralogues in zebrafish are a case of subfunctionalization at the level of the cerebrum. CNS malformations were rescued in morphants by co-injection with mouse wild-type <italic>Cnnm2</italic>.</p>
      <p>In homozygous patients, the neurological defects became evident early after birth. In line with a developmental role for CNNM2 within the CNS, gene expression of zebrafish <italic>cnnm2a</italic> and <italic>cnnm2b</italic> peaked within the first 24 hpf. In addition, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization located <italic>cnnm2a</italic> expression specifically in the MHB <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Thisse1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, an organizing center in the neural tube that determines neural fate and differentiation in the CNS during development <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Scholpp1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-Dworkin1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Indeed, the most striking brain developmental defect in our study is maldevelopment of the MHB. These defects were rescued with <italic>Cnnm2</italic> cRNA. Interestingly, the brain phenotypes observed in both zebrafish and patients were independent of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, as Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation was unsuccessful to rescue the phenotypes. Thus, our findings suggest that a brain-specific CNNM2 function is crucial for the development of constitutive regions of the CNS, which in the zebrafish model is illustrated by defects in the MHB.</p>
      <p>At 25 hpf, a time point in which the locomotor behaviour is unaffected by the brain and only depends on signals from the spinal cord <xref rid="pgen.1004267-SaintAmant1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, zebrafish morphant embryos displayed an increased frequency of spontaneous contractions, especially when the MOs were co-injected with mutant <italic>Cnnm2</italic>. This hyperexcitability of motor neurons suggests a function of zebrafish Cnnm2 proteins in the regulation of the activity of the neurological network in the spinal cord or in the synaptic junctions with muscle fibbers. Consistent with these findings, patients with mutations in <italic>CNNM2</italic> presented impaired motor skills, which were severe in the case of homozygous patients.</p>
      <p>In the CNS, TRPM7 is essential during early development <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Jin2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, as it modulates neurotransmitter release in sensory neurons <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Krapivinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-Brauchi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Specifically, when using 2-APB, an inhibitor of TRPM7 <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Chokshi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, CNNM2-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport was abolished in HEK293 cells. Remarkably, in a similar fashion to <italic>trpm7</italic> mutants in zebrafish <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Elizondo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004267-Low1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <italic>cnnm2a</italic> or <italic>cnnm2b</italic> morphants showed weaker touch-evoked escape behaviour compared to controls. In 5 dpf larvae, and unlike in 25 hpf embryos, locomotor behaviours elicited by touch require the involvement of high brain structures <xref rid="pgen.1004267-SaintAmant1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Therefore, it is reasoned that CNNM2 conditions locomotor behaviour with an etiology that can be related to lack of excitation of sensory neurons <italic>via</italic> TRPM7 and/or to the defects in early brain development observed in zebrafish morphant embryos. In kidney, where CNNM2 is expressed at the basolateral membrane in DCT, specific regulation of TRPM7 Mg<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption is unlikely, since TRPM6 is the main Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter in this segment. TRPM7 is a ubiquitously expressed gene regulating cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> metabolism, which is for instance involved in regulation of brain Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Hoenderop1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, one could hypothesize that CNNM2 may regulate other proteins in addition to TRPM7 in kidney for the control of Mg<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption, which remain to be identified.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our findings of <italic>CNNM2</italic> mutations in patients with hypomagnesemia and severe neurological impairment widen the clinical spectrum of CNNM2-related disease. By establishing a zebrafish CNNM2 loss-of-function model of the genetic disease, we provide a unique model for the testing of novel therapeutic drugs targeting CNNM2.</p>

Merlin 1.1.2 (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was used to determine homozygous regions by linkage analysis.

As criteria for subsequent experiments, the dose of MO that caused major effects and induced a percentage of mortality non-significantly different from controls was injected (2 ng for <italic>cnnm2a</italic>-MO and 8 ng for <italic>cnnm2b</italic>-MO). In experiments that implied exposure to high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, the high Mg<sup>2+</sup> medium had a composition of 5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 25 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>. In order to control for the specificity of the MOs blocking the translation of <italic>cnnm2a</italic> and <italic>cnnm2b</italic>, as well as for toxic off-target effects, <italic>in vivo</italic> cRNA rescue experiments were performed <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Eisen1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. For these experiments, mouse wild-type CNNM2 and mutant (p.Glu357Lys) CNNM2 cRNAs were prepared using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cRNAs, in an amount of 50 pg, as based on other studies <xref rid="pgen.1004267-Mahmood1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, were (co)injected together with MOs as described above. Zebrafish embryos and larvae were phenotyped at 25 hpf or 5 dpf, respectively.</p>

        <title>Analysis of phenotypes in embryos and larvae</title>
        <p>For the analyses of brain phenotypes, the brain rudiment of zebrafish embryos at 25 hpf was observed for morphological changes under a Leica MZFLIII microscope (Leica Microsystems Ltd, Heerburgg, Germany). Morphological phenotypes, which also included the brain, were also analysed in larvae at 5 dpf. Embryos or larvae were classified into different classes of phenotypes on the basis of comparisons with stage-matched control embryos of the same clutch. In <italic>cnnm2a</italic> morphant embryos (25 hpf), two phenotype classes were distinguished: class I, normal; and class II, embryos with underdeveloped MHB. In <italic>cnnm2a</italic> morphant larvae (5 dpf), the following classes were distinguished: class I, normal; class II, normal with non-inflated swim bladder; class III, larvae with enlarged pericardial cavity (edema) and non-inflated swim bladder; class IV, larvae with notochord defects, enlarged pericardial cavity and non-inflated swim bladder; and class V, larvae with severely enlarged pericardial cavity, notochord defects and non-inflated swim bladder. In <italic>cnnm2b</italic> morphant embryos (25 hpf), three different phenotypes were distinguished: class I, normal; class II, embryos with underdeveloped MHB; and class III, embryos with underdeveloped MHB and enlarged tectum. In <italic>cnnm2b</italic> morphant larvae (5 dpf), the number of different phenotypes distinguished were four: class I, normal; class II, normal with non-inflated swim bladder; class III, larvae with enlarged pericardial cavity (edema) and non-inflated swim bladder; and class IV, larvae with widened outer cerebrospinal fluid spaces, kidney cysts, severely enlarged pericardial cavity and non-inflated swim bladder. Representative images were obtained with a DFC450C camera (Leica Microsystems Ltd) after anaesthetising embryos or larvae with tricaine/Tris pH 7.0 solution. Prior to anaesthesia and image acquisition, zebrafish embryos were manually dechorionated.</p>

        <p>Zebrafish embryos or larvae were anesthetized with tricaine/Tris pH 7.0 solution and 5â7 individuals were pooled as one sample. Samples were then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80Â°C in order to ensure euthanasia of animals and remained at these storage conditions until the beginning of the analytical procedures.</p>
        <p>Analytical procedures started by quickly washing the samples with nanopure water in order to avoid contamination of remaining waterborne Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The washing procedure was repeated twice. Fish were then dried at 65Â°C for 1.5 hours, at which time 2.5 Âµl of HNO<sub>3</sub> (â¥65%, Sigma) was added to each tube. Samples were digested at 65Â°C during 1.5 hours. After, digested samples were diluted 1â¶10 with 22.5 Âµl nanopure water. The total Mg content in each sample was determined with a commercial colorimetric assay (Roche Diagnostics, Woerden, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer's protocol. Blanks (HNO<sub>3</sub> diluted 1â¶10 with nanopure water) were added during assays and values were equal to zero. Within-run precision and accuracy was controlled by means of an internal control Precinorm (Roche Diagnostics). Samples from embryos exposed to 25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> were further diluted (1â¶20). Furthermore, samples were normalized by protein content, which was determined in 1â¶20 (embryos at 25 hpf) or 1â¶50 (larvae at 5 dpf) diluted samples using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA).</p>

        <p>At 25 hpf, 10 zebrafish embryos per Petri dish (nâ=â30 per experimental condition) were randomly selected. The number of complete body contractions each zebrafish made in 30 second period was counted and was used as indicative of motor neuron activity <xref rid="pgen.1004267-SaintAmant1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

        <p>For the analysis of the touch-evoked escape behaviour, 10 zebrafish larvae per Petri dish (nâ=â30 per experimental condition) were randomly selected. Touch-evoked escape behaviours were elicited by touching a larva in the tail up to 6 times with a pair of forceps at 5 dpf. Three categories were distinguished, responders, late responders and non-responders, to which the following scores were given: 3 points for responders: fish quickly react (swimming or flicking the tail) to the stimuli after 1 or 2 twitches; 2 points for late responders: fish react (swimming or flicking the tail) to the stimuli after 3, 4 or 5 twitches; and 1 point for non-responders: fish do not react to the stimuli after more than 5 twitches. Representative videos were recorded with the system described above.</p>

Statistical analyses were conducted by one- or two-way (for experiments where zebrafish embryos were exposed to different Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, then two factors of variance appear: Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and treatment) ANOVA. Where appropriate, data were logarithmically transformed to fulfil the requirements for ANOVA, but all data are shown in their decimal values for clarity. When data did not comply with the premises of the parametric ANOVA, data were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks. Tukey's post-test was used to identify significantly different groups.
