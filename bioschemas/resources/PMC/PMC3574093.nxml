      <abstract>
        <p>Osterix (Osx/SP7) is a C2H2 zinc finger-containing transcription factor of the SP gene family. <italic>Osx</italic> knockout mice indicate that the gene plays an essential role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Osx are still poorly understood. Here, we report a novel post-translational mechanism for the regulation of Osx in mammalian cells. We found that the stability of endogenous and exogenous Osx reduced after cycloheximide treatment. In cells treated with the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 or lactacystin, both endogenous and exogenous Osx protein expression increased in a time-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays showed that both endogenous and exogenous Osx were ubiquitinated. Six lysine residues of Osx were identified as candidate ubiquitination sites by construction of point mutant plasmids and luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, we confirmed that K58 and K230 are the ubiquitination sites of Osx by Co-IP assays and protein stability assays. Moreover, the Osx K58R and K230R mutations promoted the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers (alkaline phosphatase, collagen I and osteocalcin) and enhanced osteogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells. Taken together, our data indicate that Osx is an unstable protein, and that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in the regulation of Osx and thereby regulates osteoblast differentiation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Bone is continuously destroyed and reformed to maintain constant bone volume and calcium homeostasis in vertebrates throughout their lives <xref rid="pone.0056451-Katagiri1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are specialized cells responsible for bone formation and resorption, respectively <xref rid="pone.0056451-Katagiri1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0056451-Heino1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The proper balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is essential for maintaining bone function. The activation of osteoblasts is regulated at the level of differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells, which is controlled by various transcription factors and signaling proteins, including the Wnt signaling pathway, Indian Hedgehog, Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Osterix (Osx/Sp7) <xref rid="pone.0056451-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Osx, a zinc finger-containing transcription factor, plays a critical role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, as no bone formation occurs in <italic>Osx</italic> knockout mice <xref rid="pone.0056451-Nakashima1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0056451-Baek2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It has been reported that Osx is required for bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and Runx2-induced osteoblast differentiation and bone growth in both postnatal and adult mice <xref rid="pone.0056451-Matsubara1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056451-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. As a gene downstream of Runx2, <italic>Osx</italic> is specifically expressed in osteoblasts and expressed at low levels in prehypertrophic chondrocytes <xref rid="pone.0056451-Nakashima1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The pattern of <italic>Osx</italic> expression in mice indicates that the <italic>Osx</italic> transcript is expressed as early as the commitment time for mesenchymal cells to enter the osteoblast lineage, and expression of <italic>Osx</italic> becomes stronger as osteoblast differentiation occurs. At present, the regulation of Osx is not fully understood, and knowledge of the post-translational regulation of Osx is especially lacking.</p>
      <p>Post-translational modifications are important for regulating the function, localization and turn-over of cellular protein impacting on cellular morphology, activity and interactions within multi-cellular organisms <xref rid="pone.0056451-Voutsadakis1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Ubiquitination is one example of post-translational modifications, and regulates a broad range of cellular processes including metabolic adaptations, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation and also signaling and gene regulation. Ubiquitination of protein substrates proceeds via a step-wise process involving three enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). Poly-ubiquitylated proteins are then targeted to the 26S proteasome for degradation <xref rid="pone.0056451-Ciechanover1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0056451-Varshavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Ubiquitination, along with other post-translational protein modifications such as phosphorylation, hydroxylation and acetylation, is a highly regulated process for the execution of which a multitude of regulators exist <xref rid="pone.0056451-Voutsadakis1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To investigate whether ubiquitination modifications are involved in the regulation of Osx, and whether turn-over of Osx by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a role in osteoblast differentiation, we examined the stability of Osx and investigated the influence of the UPS on the function of Osx. We found that Osx is an unstable protein. In addition, we report here for the first time that the UPS is involved in the regulation of Osx. Moreover, we identified that K58 and K230 are the ubiquitination sites in Osx, and demonstrated that ubiquitination of Osx plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation. These data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) plays a role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation via regulating the expression of Osx. Our results shed some light on the mechanisms of Osx regulation and further elucidation of the regulation of bone metabolism.</p>

To capture the immunocomplexes, 30 Âµl of protein-G agarose beads (Millipore) were added and incubated at 4Â°C for 4 h. The agarose slurry was collected by centrifugation and the supernatants were discarded. The pellets were washed three times with RIPA buffer, then resuspended in SDS gel-loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using anti-Ub or anti-Osxantibody.</p>
        <p>For Co-IP of overexpressed proteins, lysates from HEK 293T cells co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-hOsx and HA-tagged ubiquitin expression plasmids (a generous gift of Dr. X Cao, Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL, USA) were used. The Co-IP was performed as above using anti-Flag antibody to precipitate the immunocomplexes and the anti-HA antibody to perform Western blot analysis.</p>

        <p>To select a suitable cell model, we screened the expression of Osx in various cell lines including human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cells, human lung carcinoma A549 cells, human pancreatic adenocarcinoma SW1990 cells, human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells and Saos-2 cells by Western blot analysis. The expression of Osx was relatively high in Saos-2 cells, which are usually used as a model of osteoblast cells, as well as in A549 and SW1990 cells. However, the expression of Osx was barely detectable in HEK 293T and MG-63 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056451-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

        <title>Identification of the Ubiquitination Sites in Osx</title>
        <p>To address the effects of polyubiquitination of Osx on its activity, it is critical to map the Ub Lys acceptor site(s) of Osx, and characterize the functional effects of eliminating these site(s) on Osx activity. We systematically replaced each of the Osx Lys residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056451-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) with an Arg residue, which would maintain the positive charge but would not serve as an acceptor site for Ub modification. The WT Flag-hOsx plasmid or mutants with different Lys-to-Arg mutations were co-transfected along with Ocn-Luc constructs into the Osx-deficient HEK 293T cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056451-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, overexpression of the K26R, K41R, K45R, K46R, K58R and K230R mutants increased Ocn-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression by more than 2.5-fold, compared with WT Osx, indicating that the Lys-to-Arg mutations at these sites abolish Osx polyubiquitination and degradation, and result in an increased Osx transactivity. Therefore, one or more of these Lys residues are potential Ub acceptor site(s) which mediate Osx polyubiquitination.</p>

      <p>Osx is a master transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation <xref rid="pone.0056451-Nakashima1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrated that Osx is a short-lived protein, and that the UPS is involved in the regulation of Osx. Furthermore, we identified that the K58 and K230 residues are the ubiquitination sites of Osx. Moreover, we demonstrated that ubiquitination of Osx plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation.</p>
      <p>Post-translational modifications of transcription factors such as phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination play a key role in controlling numerous biological events, including cellular energy metabolism, cell-cycle progression and organ development <xref rid="pone.0056451-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. To determine whether ubiquitination is involved in the regulation of Osx, we firstly examined Osx protein stability using CHX treatment. We found that Osx is an unstable protein with a half-life of 12 h. In eukaryotic cells, there are two mechanisms for protein degradation: the lysosome pathway, a nonspecific process, and the UPP <xref rid="pone.0056451-Sorokin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In higher eukaryotes, the vast majority (80â90%) of intracellular proteins are degraded via the UPP <xref rid="pone.0056451-Rock1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056451-Craiu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation is involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, DNA repair, the maintenance of cellular quality control, autophagy, the regulation of transcription and receptor-mediated endocytosis <xref rid="pone.0056451-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0056451-Mayer3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To determine whether the stability of Osx protein is regulated by the UPP, we examined the changes in Osx protein expression in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin. We found that the stability of Osx markedly increased after MG-132 and lactacystin treatment, suggesting that the UPP is, at least in part, responsible for the degradation of Osx.</p>
      <p>In the canonical UPP, substrate proteins are first tagged by multiple ubiquitin molecules and then degraded by the 26S proteasome. The activating enzyme E1 forms a high-energy thioester bond with ubiquitin (Ub), which is then transferred to a reactive cysteine residue of the conjugating enzyme E2. The final transfer of Ub to an Îµ-amino group of a reactive Lys residue of the substrate protein is brought about by E3, the ubiquitin ligase enzyme <xref rid="pone.0056451-Weissman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056451-Hobler1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The identification of ubiquitination sites provides the ultimate proof that the putative substrate is indeed ubiquitinated <xref rid="pone.0056451-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore, we screened for potential ubiquitination sites in Osx by construction of Lys to Arg mutant plasmids and luciferase reporter assays. We found that the K26R, K41R, K45R, K46R, K58R and K230R mutants induced markedly increased Ocn-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression, indicating that these residues may be ubiquitination sites. To further map the ubiquitination sites, we performed Co-IP assays and measured Osx protein stability. These experiments demonstrated that K58 and K230 are the ubiquitination modification sites in Osx. However, the detailed mechanisms of ubiquitination modifications for Osx need to be investigated further.</p>
      <p>Modification of proteins by ubiquitination is a critical regulatory mechanism for various cellular processes <xref rid="pone.0056451-Cai1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To determine the function of the ubiquitination of Osx in osteoblast differentiation, we transfected the WT Flag-hOsx plasmid or K58R and K230R mutants into pluripotent mesenchymal precursor C2C12 cells, which provide a suitable model system to study the early stage of osteoblast differentiation during bone formation <xref rid="pone.0056451-Katagiri2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The mRNA expression levels of osteoblast differentiation markers including <italic>ALP, Col I</italic> and <italic>Ocn</italic> markedly increased in K58R and K230R mutant-transfected cells. Moreover, enhanced ALP activity and increased numbers of mineralized nodules were detected in K58R and K230R mutant-transfected cells, indicating that ubiquitination of Osx plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation. It has been reported that the UPP exerts exquisite control of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vitro and in vivo <xref rid="pone.0056451-Sasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0056451-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Inhibition of the UPP by proteasome inhibitors promotes osteoblast differentiation in vitro and bone formation in vitro and in vivo <xref rid="pone.0056451-Garrett1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Our data suggests that the UPP can control osteoblast differentiation and bone formation through regulation of Osx.</p>
      <p>In summary, we show here for the first time that the UPP is involved in the regulation of Osx. Moreover, we identified that the K58 and K230 residues are the ubiquitination sites of Osx, and demonstrated that ubiquitination of Osx plays a key role in osteoblast differentiation. This study reveals new information on the mechanisms of post-translational regulation by which the UPP regulates the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Osx during osteoblast differentiation.</p>
