      <abstract>
        <p>Heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) is an essential molecular chaperone in eukaryotes involved in maintaining the stability and activity of numerous signalling proteins, also known as clients. Hsp90 ATPase activity is essential for its chaperone function and it is regulated by co-chaperones. Here we show that the tumour suppressor FLCN is an Hsp90 client protein and its binding partners FNIP1/FNIP2 function as co-chaperones. FNIPs decelerate the chaperone cycle, facilitating FLCN interaction with Hsp90, consequently ensuring FLCN stability. FNIPs compete with the activating co-chaperone Aha1 for binding to Hsp90, thereby providing a reciprocal regulatory mechanism for chaperoning of client proteins. Lastly, downregulation of FNIPs desensitizes cancer cells to Hsp90 inhibitors, whereas FNIPs overexpression in renal tumours compared with adjacent normal tissues correlates with enhanced binding of Hsp90 to its inhibitors. Our findings suggest that FNIPs expression can potentially serve as a predictive indicator of tumour response to Hsp90 inhibitors.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The molecular chaperone heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) is responsible for folding, stability and activity of many proteins also known as âclient proteins', including many responsible for tumour initiation, progression and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. This makes the chaperone Hsp90 an attractive target for cancer therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Hsp90 has the ability to bind and hydrolyse ATP, which is essential for its chaperone function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Small molecule inhibitors bind to the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90 and inhibit its chaperone function. Consequently, this prevents Hsp90 interaction with client proteins, leading to their degradation by the proteasome. In contrast to other anticancer drugs, Hsp90 inhibitors simultaneously inhibit multiple drivers of oncogenesis.</p>
    <p>Hsp90 chaperone cycle is tightly regulated by another group of proteins referred to as âco-chaperones'. Their stability does not depend on Hsp90 function but they interact with distinct Hsp90 conformational states, providing directionality to the Hsp90 cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Furthermore, certain co-chaperones, such as HOP and Cdc37<sup>p50</sup> inhibit the Hsp90 chaperone cycle, assisting in delivery of distinct sets of client proteins (steroid hormone receptors and kinases, respectively) to the Hsp90 chaperone machine. In contrast, the co-chaperone Aha1 facilitates energy-intensive conformational changes necessary to establish Hsp90 ATPase competence, markedly increasing the weak endogenous ATPase activity of Hsp90. Aha1 is thus considered to be a crucial component of active Hsp90 chaperone complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
    <p>Here we show that the stability of the tumour suppressor folliculin (FLCN) depends on the chaperone function of Hsp90. Germline mutations and loss of function of FLCN causes BirtâHoggâDubÃ© syndrome, a rare inherited cancer syndrome that predisposes affected individuals to develop kidney tumours, pulmonary cysts and benign skin tumours (fibrofolliculomas)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. FLCN interacts and forms a complex with folliculin-interacting proteins 1 and 2 (FNIP1 and FNIP2, also referred to as FNIPs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The function of FNIPs, however, remains elusive. Our results indicate that FNIPs act as co-chaperones of Hsp90. They inhibit its ATPase activity, âtailoring' Hsp90 to chaperone kinase and non-kinase clients. We have further shown that Aha1 co-chaperone can displace FNIPs and stimulate Hsp90 ATPase activity. Finally, FNIPs also enhance the binding of Hsp90 to its inhibitors such as ganetespib (GB); therefore, overexpression of FNIPs in specific tumours can be an indicator of their response to Hsp90 inhibitors.</p>

        <title>FLCN is a new client of Hsp90</title>
        <p>To determine the binding partners of the tumour suppressor FLCN, we transiently expressed an amino-terminally FLAG-tagged FLCN (FLAGâFLCN) in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and identified its intracellular binding proteins by immunoprecipitating FLAGâFLCN with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We found molecular chaperones heat shock protein-70 (Hsp70) and Hsp90, and their regulators HOP, CHIP and Aha1, and CCT2, CCT4, CCT7 and CCT8, which are members of the chaperonin system TRiC (TCP-1 ring complex), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We validated our data by immunoprecipitating the endogenous FLCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) or the FLAGâFLCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) from HEK293 cells and showed its interaction with the molecular chaperone machineries Hsp70, Hsp90 and a subunit of the chaperonin TRiC, CCT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). We also observed FLCN interaction with the Hsp70 and Hsp90 co-chaperones including HOP, CHIP, Cdc37<sup>p50</sup>, PP5, p23 and Aha1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). In general, molecular chaperones are involved in folding and stability of proteins. We first treated the HEK293 cells with the Hsp70 inhibitor JG-98 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and showed the degradation of FLCN after a 2h treatment in both soluble and insoluble protein fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These data suggest that inhibition of Hsp70 does not lead to an increase in misfolded FLCN but instead to its degradation. The molecular chaperone Hsp90 however is more selective towards its âclient proteins' and is also involved in protecting them from degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Therefore, we treated the HEK293 cells with different inhibitors of Hsp90 such as GB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>), SNX2112 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and PU-H71 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>), to evidence the degradation of FLCN. Previous works have shown that inhibition of Hsp90 generally leads to ubiquitination and degradation of its client proteins in the proteasome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. We investigated this possibility by first demonstrating that inhibition of Hsp90 causes its dissociation from FLCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). We further showed that HEK293 cells treated with 50ânM proteasome inhibitor bortezomib for 2âh before addition of GB blocked FLCN degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). We did not obtain similar results when we treated the cells with the lysosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that the lysosome is not involved in degradation of FLCN. We next immunoprecipitated and salt-stripped (with 0.5âM NaCl) FLAGâFLCN from HEK293 cells treated with either 50ânM bortezomib or 1âÎ¼M GB for 4âh and showed its ubiquitination by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that FLCN is a client of Hsp70 and Hsp90. Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to ubiquitination and degradation of FLCN in the proteasome.</p>

        <title>FNIP1 and FNIP2 facilitate FLCN binding to Hsp90 chaperone</title>
        <p>FNIP1 and FNIP2 are homologous binding partners of FLCN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>; however, their molecular function remains elusive. In addition, FNIP1 was shown to interact with Hsp90, but the significance of this observation was not researched further<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. We first confirmed these data by immunoprecipitating the endogenous FNIP1 and FNIP2 from HEK293 cells and detecting Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We also observed FNIPs interaction with Hsp70 and co-chaperones p23, HOP and Cdc37<sup>p50</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In addition, we co-immunoprecipitated Hsp90 clients such as glucocorticoid receptor (GR), B-Raf, Cdk4 and FLCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We confirmed our data by transiently expressing and immunoprecipitating HAâFNIP1 and HAâFNIP2 from HEK293 cells and then probing for the chaperones, co-chaperone and client proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Previous work has shown that FNIPs are homo- and heterodimer proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. We isolated FNIP1 and FNIP2 homo- and heterodimers by transiently co-expressing cMycâFNIP1/HAâFNIP1, cMycâFNIP2/HAâFNIP2 and HAâFNIP1/cMycâFNIP2 in HEK293 cells. We first immunoprecipitated cMyc-tagged proteins using anti-cMyc agarose affinity gel. We then competed the cMyc proteins from the affinity gel with cMyc peptides. The eluted proteins were dialysed and subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-HA agarose affinity gel. Immunoprecipitated proteins have shown that FNIP1 homodimer has a stronger affinity for binding to Hsp90 and FLCN than FNIP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We next asked whether FNIP1 or FNIP2 are clients or co-chaperones of Hsp90. Treating HEK293 cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor GB did not affect FNIP protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These data suggest that FNIP1 and FNIP2 are co-chaperones of Hsp90. We obtained further evidence by demonstrating a direct interaction between FNIP1 and Hsp90. We were able to bacterially express and purify a small amount of FLAGâFNIP1. Our purified FLAGâFNIP1 can directly interact with bacterially expressed and purified Hsp90Î±âHis<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and FLCNâHis<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Surprisingly, Hsp90Î± and FLCN did not directly interact with each other <italic>in vitro</italic>; however, pre-incubation of Hsp90Î± with FNIP1 facilitated the Hsp90âFNIP1âFLCN complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). It is noteworthy that we were unable to express and purify an adequate amount of FNIP2 protein from bacteria, yeast or baculovirus expression systems for biophysical analysis.</p>
        <p>Hsp90 consists of N (amino), M (middle) and C (carboxy) domains. To determine FNIP and FLCN interaction with these Hsp90 domains, we transiently expressed each domain with FLAG-tag in HEK293 cells. Following IP with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, we observed FNIP1 interaction with the Hsp90Î± M- and C-domains, whereas FNIP2 interacted with only the M-domain of Hsp90Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Association of FLCN with the M- and C-domains of Hsp90Î± was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next determined the region in FNIP1 that interacts with Hsp90. FNIP1 does not have a known functional domain; however, based on previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, we constructed and transiently expressed four regions of HAâFNIP1 designated AâD in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Consistent with the previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, truncation of FNIP1 at the C-terminus (deletion of fragment D) abrogated its interaction with FLCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). However, the concomitant deletion of 300 amino acids (fragment A) from the N-terminus of FNIP1 restored its binding to FLCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This result is not in agreement with the previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and underlies the complexity in FNIP1 binding to FLCN. Our data also indicated that the C-domain of FNIP1 (amino acid 929â1166 or fragment D) preferentially interacts with Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). We confirmed these data by carrying out a reciprocal experiment and co-expressing FNIP1-DâHA and Hsp90Î±âFLAG full-length (wild type) and its different domains in HEK293 cells. We immunoprecipitated FNIP1-DâHA and observed co-IP of Hsp90Î± full length and its M-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). We next bacterially expressed and purified fragment D (FNIP1-DâHis<sub>6</sub>), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b,c</xref>) and examined its affinity for binding to Hsp90Î± <italic>in vitro</italic> by fluorescently labelling FNIP1-DâHis<sub>6</sub> with Texas Red Maleimide, and measured the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> by fluorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2j</xref>). Our bacterially expressed and purified HSP90Î± had ATPase activity. The titration fit to a single-site binding equation with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 1.3Â±0.7âÎ¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). This <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was unaffected by the presence, absence or identity of adenosine nucleotide bound to the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that FNIPs behave as co-chaperones of Hsp90 and they are involved in loading of FLCN to Hsp90.</p>

        <title>FNIPs regulate Hsp90 activity and chaperoning of the clients</title>
        <p>To gain further insight into FNIP1 and FNIP2 function as co-chaperones of Hsp90, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence either <italic>FNIP1</italic> or <italic>FNIP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), or both in HEK293 cells, and monitored the stability and activity of the Hsp90 kinase clients such as B-Raf, Ulk1 and Cdk4, and non-kinase clients, for example, GR, ER and FLCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Silencing either <italic>FNIP1</italic> or <italic>FNIP2</italic> caused a modest decrease in client protein levels. This data suggests that the absence of either <italic>FNIP1</italic> or <italic>FNIP2</italic> allows for compensation by the other FNIP isoform. Silencing of both <italic>FNIP1</italic> and <italic>FNIP2</italic> significantly decreased the stability of the selected kinase and non-kinase client proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We next transiently overexpressed cMycâFNIP1 or cMycâFNIP2 in HEK293 cells and examined the stability and the activity of the Hsp90 clients. Overexpression of FNIPs caused an increase in GR, Ulk1 and FLCN protein levels and hyperphosphorylation of B-Raf and pY416-c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is also an Hsp90 client <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and relies on a âslow' Hsp90 chaperone cycle for proper folding. To examine the effect of FNIPs on Hsp90 chaperone function, we assessed their impact on steady-state expression of CFTR protein in mammalian cells. HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with CFTR, and HAâFNIP1 and HAâFNIP2. Empty plasmid pcDNA3 (empty vector, EV) was used as a negative control. Western blot analysis of these samples using anti-CFTR antibody detected a doublet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), with the upper band representing the mature Golgi-processed glycoform of CFTR found at the cell surface and the lower band an immature core-glycosylated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Overexpression of the FNIPs produced a significant increase in CFTR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These data suggested a reduction in Hsp90 chaperone activity and, therefore, an increase in CFTR expression.</p>
        <p>Hsp90 chaperone function is coupled to its ATPase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. We therefore examined the impact of FNIPs on Hsp90 ATPase activity. We transiently expressed Hsp90Î±âHA in the prostate cancer PC3 cell line and HAâFNIP1, HAâFNIP1-D (amino acids 929â1166) and HAâFNIP2 in HEK293 cells. Proteins were immunoprecipitated, salt stripped and competed off the HA affinity beads with the relevant peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). The quality of the isolated proteins was examined by Coomassie staining of the SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâPAGE). These purified proteins were quantified and used in the molar ratio indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref> of Hsp90Î±:FNIP in the PiPer Phosphate Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in the presence of ATP as substrate as previously described (see Methods)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We measured the ATPase activity of isolated Hsp90Î± <italic>in vitro</italic> as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). GB (10âÎ¼M) inhibited ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Addition of FNIP1, FNIP1-D and FNIP2 also significantly inhibited the ATPase activity of Hsp90Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). Percentage ATPase activity was based on mmol <italic>P</italic><sub>i</sub> per molâmin<sup>â1</sup> for Hsp90Î± alone and in the presence of FNIPs titrated until inhibition was achieved (Hsp90Î±=291.5ânM, FNIP1=189.8ânM, FNIP1-D=899.3ânM and FNIP2=1.6âÎ¼M) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). These data suggest that FNIPs are potent inhibitors of the Hsp90 chaperone cycle.</p>
        <p>Hsp90 is an evolutionarily conserved chaperone and based on structural homology detection methods Lst4 is a potential orthologue of FNIPs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. However, we were unable to detect Lst4âGST interaction with yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90, also known as Hsp82) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In addition, unlike FNIPs, Lst4âGST was unable to inhibit ATPase activity of yHsp90 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4e,f</xref>). We next decided to express <italic>FLAGâFNIP1</italic> and <italic>FLAGâFNIP2</italic> galactose-inducible promoter of <italic>GAL1</italic> in yeast containing either human or yeast Hsp90 as the sole functional Hsp90. Overexpression of FNIPs in yeast containing human Hsp90Î± caused lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). However, overexpression of FNIPs in yeast with only yHsp90 did not cause any growth defects. We examined the expression of the FNIPs in these cells by western blot analysis and were only able to detect FLAGâFNIP1 and FLAGâFNIP2 in yeast expressing Hsp90Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). These data suggest that expression of FNIPs in yeast cause lethality, because they inhibit the essential chaperone function of Hsp90Î±. Taken together, our results suggest that (i) Lst4 is not an orthologue of FNIPs in yeast and (ii) FNIPs probably arose in higher eukaryotes as co-chaperones to inhibit or slow the complex chaperone cycle of Hsp90 in cellular milieu.</p>

        <title>FNIPs compete with the Aha1 co-chaperone for binding to Hsp90</title>
        <p>To determine the effects of FNIPs on Hsp90 interaction with co-chaperones, we used <italic>FNIP1</italic>- and <italic>FNIP2</italic>-specific siRNA to silence expression of these genes in HEK293 cells transiently expressing Hsp90Î±âFLAG. We next immunoprecipitated Hsp90Î±âFLAG from these cells and examined its interaction with selected co-chaperones. Our data show that siRNA-mediated silencing of both <italic>FNIP1</italic> and <italic>FNIP2</italic> increased Hsp90 interaction with the co-chaperones Aha1 and PP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We next transiently overexpressed HAâFNIP1 and HAâFNIP2 in HEK293 cells that also express Hsp90Î±âFLAG. The overexpression of FNIPs compared with the endogenous FNIP1 and FNIP2 were examined by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Following IP of Hsp90Î±âFLAG, we observed a marked reduction in its interaction with the co-chaperones Aha1 and PP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Aha1 is the activator of the Hsp90 ATPase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. We next queried whether Aha1 has the ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp90 that has already bound to FNIP1, FNIP1-D or FNIP2. In agreement with our earlier data, FNIPs inhibited the ATPase activity of Hsp90Î± and, conversely, addition of 1.3âÎ¼M Aha1 to these reactions stimulated Hsp90 ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5bâf</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Aha1 has the ability to displace FNIPs from Hsp90. We obtained additional evidence for this possibility by using the bacterially expressed and purified Hsp90Î±, Aha1âFLAG and FNIP1-D fragment. First, we bound FNIP1-DâHis<sub>6</sub> to Ni-NTA agarose and incubated with 100âng recombinant Hsp90Î±. After washing the agarose with buffer, we added different amounts of Aha1âFLAG. Our data show that addition of 10âng recombinant Aha1âFLAG completely dissociated Hsp90Î± from FNIP1-DâHis<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). We next carried out a similar experiment by first immobilizing Aha1âFLAG onto anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. We then added 100âng recombinant Hsp90Î±, to form an Aha1âHsp90Î± complex. After washing the agarose beads with buffer, we added different amounts of FNIP1-DâHis<sub>6</sub>. We observed that addition of 100âng FNIP1-DâHis<sub>6</sub> disrupted the Aha1âHsp90Î± complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). We repeated the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>, but using bovine serum albumin as a negative control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5gâi</xref>). Our data confirm that Aha1 and FNIP1 compete for binding to Hsp90, either accelerating or decelerating its chaperone cycle. In addition, Aha1 appears to have higher affinity than FNIP1 towards Hsp90, as 10âng of Aha1 was sufficient to displace FNIP1-D from Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>

We examined the impact of FNIPs on Hsp90 binding to ATP or drugs by first overexpressing HAâFNIP1 and HAâFNIP2 in HEK293 cells. Overexpression of FNIPs caused an increase in Hsp90 binding to ATP agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of cMycâFNIP1 and cMycâFNIP2 in HEK293 cells significantly increased the Hsp90 binding to 0.01âÎ¼M biotinylated-GB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>) and 0.01âÎ¼M biotinylated-SNX2112 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e,f</xref>) compared with control (EV).

We therefore asked whether FNIPs are overexpressed in cancer cells and also whether they are contributing to cancer cell sensitivity towards Hsp90 inhibitors. We used prostate (LNCaP), bladder (T24), breast (MCF7), lung (H1299) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29) cancer cell lines. Previous work by Synta Pharmaceuticals Corp. (data available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.syntapharma.com/">www.syntapharma.com/</ext-link>) has established these cell lines' sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitor GB and these are: LNCaP (IC50=8ânM), T24 (IC50=7ânM), MCF7 (IC50=25ânM), H1299 (IC50=6ânM) and HT29 (IC50=50ânM). We first showed that FNIPs were highly expressed in these cancer cells compared with HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). We next immunoprecipitated the endogenous Hsp90 from the above cancer cells and detected its interaction with FNIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>).

        <title>Elevated FNIPs sensitize renal tumours to Hsp90 inhibitor</title>
        <p>To gain further insight into FNIPs expression and sensitivity of tumours to Hsp90 inhibitors, we examined tumours and adjacent normal tissues from patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common type of kidney cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Histopathologically, RCCs are classified into subtypes. We used tumours from patients with clear cell RCC, papillary type I and type II RCC, and oncocytoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10aâd</xref>). Within 10âmin of removal of tumours, by radical or partial nephrectomy, RCC tumours and adjacent normal tissues were dissected into 3âmm<sup>3</sup> pieces followed by protein extraction and drug binding assay. Our data showed that both FNIP1 and FNIP2 were overexpressed in RCC tumours compared with adjacent normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10aâd</xref>). In addition, we discovered that the Hsp90 from RCC tumours had a higher affinity for binding to biotinylated GB compared with the adjacent normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10aâd</xref>). We next showed greater association between Hsp90 and FNIPs compared with normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10e</xref>). This is not surprising, because FNIPs are highly expressed in tumours compared with adjacent normal tissues. However, we found that Hsp90 bound stronger to Aha1 in normal tissues compared with the tumours, even though both tissues expressed equal levels of Aha1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10e</xref>). Our earlier data showed that FNIPs compete with the activating co-chaperone Aha1 for binding to Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). We therefore asked whether addition of purified FNIP1-DâHis<sub>6</sub> to the protein lysates from normal tissues could disrupt the Hsp90âAha1 complex. Addition of 100âng FNIP1-DâHis<sub>6</sub> to protein lysates from normal tissues displaced Aha1 interaction with Hsp90 and also increased Hsp90 binding to 0.1âÎ¼M biotinylated GB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10f</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that FNIPs make renal tumours sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors.

      <p>Germline mutation in the tumour suppressor <italic>FLCN</italic> is responsible for BirtâHoggâDubÃ© syndrome, an inherited kidney cancer syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Previous work has shown that FNIP1 and FNIP2 are critical components of the FLCN complex and are essential for its tumour suppressive function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. However, the exact molecular function of FNIP1 and FNIP2 remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate by MS analysis that FLCN interacts with the molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90, as well as members of the chaperonin system TRiC. Our data have shown that FLCN is a <italic>bona fide</italic> Hsp70 and Hsp90 client, as treating the cells with the Hsp70 inhibitor JG-98 destabilizes FLCN, and furthermore Hsp90 inhibitor treatment GB, SNX2112 or PU-H71 leads to dissociation of FLCN from Hsp90 and consequently its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Based on our current knowledge in the function of TRiCâHsp70âHsp90 proteins and also our findings here, we would like to suggest that TRiC-Hsp70 are involved in âearly' stages of FLCN folding and Hsp90 plays a key role in protecting FLCN from degradation. We further demonstrated that FLCN binding partners FNIP1 and FNIP2 function as co-chaperones of Hsp90. FNIP1 interacts with the M- and C- domains of Hsp90, whereas FNIP2 interacts only with its M- domain. Previous work reported that FNIP1 and FNIP2 exist as a homodimer and a heterodimer, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. We confirmed these data by demonstrating the existence of a FNIP1:FNIP2 heterodimer and its interaction with FLCN. We have also demonstrated that three populations of FNIP1 and FNIP2 interact with Hsp90; however, the FNIP1 homodimer preferentially binds to Hsp90. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data provide additional evidence that recombinant FNIP1 directly interacts with Hsp90; however, FLCN requires the presence of FNIP1 for its binding to Hsp90. These data suggest that FNIP1 and FNIP2, similar to the co-chaperone Cdc37, are involved in âloading' of FLCN and perhaps other client proteins to Hsp90. Approximately 93% of all pathogenic FLCN mutations prematurely truncate the encoded FLCN protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. When experimentally modelled <italic>in vitro</italic>, most mutations analysed appeared to be pathogenic by disrupting stability of FLCN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In addition, FLCN binding to both FNIP1 and FNIP2 is mediated specifically through the C-terminal region of FLCN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Truncating mutations result in loss of the C-terminus of FLCN, abolishing its interaction with FNIP1 and FNIP2, and consequently Hsp90. We speculate that loss of Hsp90 interaction with FLCN is the reason for the instability of the pathogenic FLCN mutants.</p>
      <p>Hsp90 chaperone activity is coupled to its ATPase activity, which is tightly regulated by co-chaperones and posttranslational modification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Our results suggest that FNIP1 is a potent inhibitor of Hsp90 ATPase activity, as 200ânM of FNIP1 inhibits Hsp90 ATPase activity by 50-fold. FNIP2 also has shown inhibitory activity towards Hsp90; however, it required 1.6âÎ¼M of FNIP2 to inhibit the ATPase activity by eightfold. Although we use the term âinhibition' here, FNIPs seem only to be slowing the chaperone cycle. Their effect on Hsp90 is not similar to the small molecule inhibitors of Hsp90 that bind to the N-domain and inhibit Hsp90 chaperone function. The reason for this conclusion stems from our observation that overexpression of FNIP1 or FNIP2 does not lead to degradation of Hsp90 client proteins. In addition, chaperoning of the proteins such as CFTR that require a slow chaperone cycle was enhanced by overexpression of FNIP1 and FNIP2. We have also shown that overexpression of FNIPs enhance Hsp90 binding to GB and SNX2112. Moreover, Hsp90 from kidney tumours bound stronger to GB compared with Hsp90 from adjacent normal tissues. This observation correlated with the overexpression of both FNIP1 and FNIP2 in tumours compared with adjacent normal tissues. Our findings suggest that FNIPs expression level can potentially serve as a predictive indicator of tumour response to Hsp90 inhibitors.</p>
      <p>What is the relationship between FNIPs and Aha1 towards binding to Hsp90? FNIPs bind to the M-domain of Hsp90 and may interfere with the N-domain interaction with the catalytic domain. We also found that FNIPs compete with Aha1 co-chaperone binding to Hsp90. Our data have demonstrated the ability of FNIP1 and Aha1 to compete for binding to Hsp90, fine tuning its chaperone cycle. The competition between Aha1 and FNIPs binding to Hsp90 was also observed in renal tumours and their adjacent normal tissues. We found that Aha1 bound stronger to Hsp90 in normal tissues; however, overexpression of FNIPs appears to displace Aha1 from Hsp90 and increase Hsp90 binding to its inhibitors. Our data are in agreement with previously published work by Workman's laboratory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, suggesting that Aha1 dissociation from Hsp90 plays a role in drug sensitivity. What determines the binding of these proteins to Hsp90? We have already shown that posttranslational modifications of Hsp90 determine its binding to co-chaperones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In addition, our recent work has shown that c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Y223-Aha1 promotes its interaction with Hsp90 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). We therefore suspect similar mechanisms exist between these three proteins, where cross-talk between posttranslational modifications is a determining factor for differential binding of Aha1 and FNIPs to Hsp90.</p>
