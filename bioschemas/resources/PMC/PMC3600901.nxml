        <p>A primary immunodeficiency syndrome caused by loss-of-function mutations in the IL-21 receptor exhibits impaired B, T, and NK cell function.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) represent exquisite models for studying mechanisms of human host defense. In this study, we report on two unrelated kindreds, with two patients each, who had cryptosporidial infections associated with chronic cholangitis and liver disease. Using exome and candidate gene sequencing, we identified two distinct homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the interleukin-21 receptor gene (<italic>IL21R</italic>; c.G602T, p.Arg201Leu and c.240_245delCTGCCA, p.C81_H82del). The IL-21R<sup>Arg201Leu</sup> mutation causes aberrant trafficking of the IL-21R to the plasma membrane, abrogates IL-21 ligand binding, and leads to defective phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT3, and STAT5. We observed impaired IL-21âinduced proliferation and immunoglobulin class-switching in B cells, cytokine production in T cells, and NK cell cytotoxicity. Our study indicates that human IL-21R deficiency causes an immunodeficiency and highlights the need for early diagnosis and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in affected children.</p>

  <body><p>Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by global or selective susceptibility to infectious microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Casanova and Abel, 2007</xref>). Next-generation exome sequencing (NGES) technologies have provided a powerful tool to determine the molecular causes of rare Mendelian disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ku et al., 2011</xref>). In the era of individualized medicine, the genetic etiology of rare disorders may be elucidated, providing a rational basis for tailored therapy.</p><p>IL-21R was originally identified by in silico homology screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ozaki et al., 2000</xref>). IL-21R binds to the common Î³ chain (<italic>IL2RG</italic>, Î³<sub>c</sub>) to transmit signals via JAKâsignal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Spolski and Leonard, 2008</xref>). Immunophenotypic analysis of IL-21Râdeficient mice revealed normal numbers of B, T, and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kasaian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ozaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">FrÃ¶hlich et al., 2009</xref>). However, IL-21 has been shown to regulate proliferation of lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Parrish-Novak et al., 2002</xref>), B cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ettinger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ozaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Recher et al., 2011</xref>), cytotoxicity of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kasaian et al., 2002</xref>), and differentiation of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). To date, no monogenic defects in IL-21 or IL-21R have been reported.</p><p>In this study, we identify loss-of-function mutations in <italic>IL21R</italic> in two kindreds, with two affected siblings each, who had cryptosporidiosis associated with chronic cholangitis and liver disease. Early diagnosis of IL-21R deficiency and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may prevent fatal complications.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Clinical and immunological phenotype of family A</title><p>Patient 1 (P1; A.II-6) was referred as a 4-yr-old boy born to consanguineous parents of Lebanese descent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). He had chronic upper respiratory infections and developed end-stage liver disease. Due to progressive chronic cholangitis and biliary fibrosis, P1 underwent liver transplantation. Pathological analysis of his explanted liver showed complete hepatic cirrhosis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20111229/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>) and purulent cholangitis associated with marked epithelial and lymphoid hyperplasia (Fig. S1 B). Immunostaining was positive for cryptosporidia (Fig. S1 C). Before liver transplantation, immunophenotyping of PBMCs revealed elevated numbers of B cells (2,444 CD19<sup>+</sup> cells/Âµl). Serum immunoglobulin levels were normal with the exception of elevated IgM (3.17 g/liter, normal range: 0.38â1.5) and IgE (1360 IU/ml, normal range: 2â60) levels. His post-transplant clinical course was complicated by abdominal abscesses, pneumonia, recurrent septicemia, systemic cytomegalovirus infection, and subsequent multiorgan failure leading to death on day +542.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Clinical and immunological phenotype, identification of IL-21R deficiency, and protein structure analysis in family A.</bold> (A) Pedigree of family A.

Clinical investigations revealed sinusitis (Fig. S1 D), <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>âassociated gastritis (Fig. S1 E), and esophageal candidiasis (Fig. S1 F). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a markedly increased liver size, dilated biliary tract system, and lymphadenopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Retrograde cholangiography studies confirmed a massive dilatation of the bile duct system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).

In parallel, we conducted SNP-based homozygosity mapping, analyzing genomic DNA from all healthy siblings and both patients (A.II-5, A.II-6), yielding four perfectly segregating regions more than 1 Mbp in size on chromosomes 5, 12 (two intervals), and 16 (largest interval).</p><p>In contrast to the IL-21R<sup>Arg201Leu</sup> mutation (chromosome 16), the variant in <italic>RAB3IL1</italic> (<italic>RAB3A interacting protein [rabin3]-like 1</italic>, chromosome 11) is not located in a homozygous interval and does not segregate with the disease phenotype, as confirmed by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>).

When IL-21 binds to IL-21R, the residue Arg201 is sandwiched between Trp214 and Trp217 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hamming et al., 2012</xref>), two tryptophans in the TrpSerXaaTrpSer (WSXWS) motif that are characteristic of class I cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hilton et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref> (top) depicts the neighborhood of Arg201 in the predicted structure of IL-21R, showing putative hydrogen bonds between Arg201 and a sugar chain attached to Asn73, as well as a hydrogen bond between Arg201 and Glu157. In comparison, the substitution of an uncharged Leu is predicted to break these bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>, bottom). The protein structure validation tool MolProbity in conjunction with Probe reports several severe steric clashes between Leu201 and Trp217, the worst of which is a clash of 1.6 Ã. In contrast, only a single clash of 0.42 Ã is reported between Arg201 and Trp217, suggesting that the Arg201Leu substitution is destabilizing. Moreover, PoPMuSiC uses a different method to predict that the Arg201Leu substitution leads to a destabilizing ÎÎG of 0.36 kcal/mol.</p><p>Because the WSXWS motif has been implicated in proper protein folding and exiting of the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hilton et al., 1996</xref>), we assumed that the IL-21R<sup>Arg201Leu</sup> mutation might result in defective cell membrane trafficking. To test this hypothesis, we studied HeLa cells coexpressing the Î³<sub>c</sub> along with a C-terminal wild-type or mutant (Arg201Leu) IL-21R-eGFP fusion protein using high-resolution confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Wild-type IL-21R-eGFP showed plasma membrane expression and accumulations in perinuclear membrane systems; a characteristic feature also observed for other GFP-tagged cytokine receptors such as IL-4RA, IL-13RA1, and Î³<sub>c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Weidemann et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the subcellular distribution of the mutated IL-21R-eGFP appeared more homogeneous. High-resolution avalanche photodiodes (APD) imaging confirmed trafficking into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the nuclear membrane, indicating misfolding, impaired processing, or misguided trafficking in the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Furthermore, when cells were engineered to express an RFP-tagged JAK3 construct to visualize interaction with Î³<sub>c</sub> at the plasma membrane, colocalization of JAK3 and IL-21R-eGFP could be documented in cells expressing wild-type IL-21R-eGFP, but not in cells expressing the mutant fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). To further assess the consequences for ligand recognition, we used a fluorescently labeled recombinant human (rh) IL-21 protein (IL-21-Atto647N) and measured surface binding by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, top). Only cells expressing Î³<sub>c</sub> and wild-type IL-21R-eGFP, but not cells expressing Î³<sub>c</sub> alone or cells expressing Î³<sub>c</sub> and mutant IL-21R-eGFP, were able to bind the cognate ligand IL-21-Atto647N. The ligand-binding signal for the wild-type receptor clearly correlated with eGFP expression. A similar correlation was seen in respect to eGFP and IL-21R surface expression in wild-type IL-21R-eGFPâtransduced HeLa cells, but not in cells transduced with mutant IL-21R-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, bottom).

However, her posttransplant course was complicated by secondary infections leading to death. P3 and P4 are alive, but too ill for allogeneic HSCT. Therefore, an early diagnosis and HSCT might be of critical importance for IL-21Râdeficient patients to prevent multiorgan complications. Future studies are required to characterize the full clinical and immunological phenotype of this disorder, in particular in subjects not infected with cryptosporidia.</p><p>The discovery and characterization of the first patients with IL-21R deficiency highlight the critical role of IL-21âdependent signaling for the human immune system and expand the spectrum of Î³<sub>c</sub>-related immunodeficiencies. Our study also exemplifies the important role of NGES complemented by cell-based screening assays in the discovery of genetic defects causing novel, rare Mendelian diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Patients.</title><p>Peripheral blood samples of patients, their unaffected first-degree relatives, and healthy volunteers were obtained upon written (parental) consent.
