      <abstract>
        <p>A large number of different pathological L1CAM mutations have been identified that result in a broad spectrum of neurological and non-neurological phenotypes. While many of these mutations have been characterized for their effects on homophilic and heterophilic interactions, as well as expression levels in vitro, there are only few studies on their biological consequences in vivo. The single L1-type CAM gene in Drosophila, <italic>neuroglian</italic> (<italic>nrg</italic>), has distinct functions during axon guidance and synapse formation and the phenotypes of <italic>nrg</italic> mutants can be rescued by the expression of human L1CAM. We previously showed that the highly conserved intracellular FIGQY Ankyrin-binding motif is required for L1CAM-mediated synapse formation, but not for neurite outgrowth or axon guidance of the Drosophila giant fiber (GF) neuron. Here, we use the GF as a model neuron to characterize the pathogenic L120V, Y1070C, C264Y, H210Q, E309K and R184Q extracellular L1CAM missense mutations and a L1CAM protein with a disrupted ezrinâmoesinâradixin (ERM) binding site to investigate the signaling requirements for neuronal development. We report that different L1CAM mutations have distinct effects on axon guidance and synapse formation. Furthermore, L1CAM homophilic binding and signaling via the ERM motif is essential for axon guidance in Drosophila. In addition, the human pathological H210Q, R184Q and Y1070C, but not the E309K and L120V L1CAM mutations affect outside-in signaling via the FIGQY Ankyrin binding domain which is required for synapse formation. Thus, the pathological phenotypes observed in humans are likely to be caused by the disruption of signaling required for both, guidance and synaptogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The L1 family of cell adhesion molecules is well-known for its divergent roles during early nervous system development, specifically for axonal outgrowth, myelination, fasciculation, as well as long term potentiation, synapse formation and maintenance <xref rid="pone.0076974-Lemmon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Kamiguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Ango1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Dityatev1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The overall domain structure is not only conserved between the four vertebrate L1-type proteins (L1CAM, Neurofascin, NrCAM and CHL1), but also across most metazoan phyla <xref rid="pone.0076974-Mualla1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Hortsch1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. L1CAM is comprised of six Immunoglobulin (Ig)- and five Fibronectin (FNIII)-type extracellular domains. The cytoplasmic protein domain contains a highly conserved intracellular FIGQY motif, which interacts with Ankyrin proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). More than 170 pathological mutations have been identified in the human L1CAM gene, which are associated with a broad spectrum of phenotypes. These include mostly neurological defects, such as mental retardation, spasticity and corpus callosum hypoplasia <xref rid="pone.0076974-Schafer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Jouet1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Dahme1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Fransen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Several pathological L1 missense mutations have been studied in vitro, specifically in respect to homophilic and heterophilic interactions, cell surface expression and their effects on neurite outgrowth and axon branching in cell culture <xref rid="pone.0076974-Fransen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Needham1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Schafer2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, the biological in vivo consequences of these mutations at cellular level are less well studied. Various studies found reduced homophilic (H210Q, R184Q, C264Y) and/or heterophilic binding (R184Q), defects in transport (R184Q, W1036L), cell surface expression (C264Y, E309K, Y1070C) and reduced activation of EGFR signaling (E309K and Y1070C) <xref rid="pone.0076974-Fransen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Needham1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Schafer2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>

          <p>(A) Domain structure of L1CAM showing the locations (asterisks) of different pathological mutations. Mutations L120V, R184Q, H210Q, C264Y, and E309K are in the extracellular Immunoglobulin (Ig) like domains, while Y1070C is in the fifth Fibronectin domain. In the L1-4A protein four amino acids in juxtamembrane region (<underline>K</underline>GG<underline>KY</underline>S<underline>V</underline>) are replaced by alanine residues. The L1-1180 protein lacks part of its C-terminus including the FIGQY motif. The domain structure of Neuroglian (Nrg) indicates the site of the S213L mutation in the second Ig like domain of the <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> protein. The genomic pacman P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] rescue construct in the <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> null mutant background expresses neuronal Nrg<sup>180</sup> that lacks the FIGQY motif. (B) Western blots of pupal stages (in %) and adult (1 and 8 days) flies expressing human UAS-human L1CAM with the OK307 Gal4-driver. Antibodies against the intracellular domain of L1CAM detected 200 kDa and 65 kDa bands. Proteolytic L1CAM cleavage increases with the maturation of the fly nervous system during pupal development and reaches its maximum in the adult. (C) Western blot of transgenic expression of wild-type and mutant UAS-L1 constructs in the wild-type background with the OK307 Gal-4 driver. With an antibody against the intracellular domain of L1CAM a 200 kDa band and 65 kDa band was detected for all L1CAM-constructs except for UAS-L1-C264Y. Only the full length 200 kDa L1CAM form was detected for this construct. No L1CAM protein was detectable in OK307 flies, which served as a negative control. Anti-actin labeling was used as a loading control.</p>

      <p>In the central nervous system, the sole L1-type Drosophila <italic>neuroglian</italic> (<italic>nrg</italic>) gene generates two alternately spliced isoforms <xref rid="pone.0076974-Bieber1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Hortsch2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Nrg<sup>180</sup> is expressed exclusively in the nervous system and Nrg<sup>167</sup> mostly in non neuronal tissue. Similar to vertebrates, Nrg plays distinct roles during axonal guidance and synapse formation <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Enneking1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The Ankyrin binding FIGQY motif and the remainder of intracellular domain in the Nrg<sup>180</sup> and Nrg<sup>167</sup> isoforms are encoded by distinct exons allowing the characterization of the role of the FIGQY motif for either isoform separately <xref rid="pone.0076974-Hortsch2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Enneking1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We used the giant fiber (GF) circuit, which mediates the escape response in the fly <xref rid="pone.0076974-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and the larval neuromuscular junction to characterize the role of Nrg and its FIGQY motif at a single cell level in vivo <xref rid="pone.0076974-Enneking1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Using a pacman-based genomic rescue approach, we recently demonstrated that the highly conserved intracellular FIGQY motif of Nrg<sup>180</sup> is required for synapse formation and synapse stability but not for axon growth and guidance in the GF circuit as well as at the larval neuromuscular junction <xref rid="pone.0076974-Enneking1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In contrast, no phenotypes were seen in <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg167<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutants in either model neuron.</p>
      <p>The position of the S213L missense mutation in the second Ig domain of <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> mutants is analogous to the pathological human L1-H210Q mutation <xref rid="pone.0076974-Goossens1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Similar to human L1-H210Q, Nrg-S213L disrupts homophilic binding as well as causes learning and motor defects along with anatomical brain defects <xref rid="pone.0076974-Goossens1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Strauss1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Strauss2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In the GF circuit, <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> mutants exhibit axonal guidance as well as synaptic defects that can be rescued by the transgenic expression of human L1CAM, but not by the expression of the vertebrate paralogs Neurofascin and NrCAM <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This demonstrates a conserved role for L1CAM/Nrg from flies to humans. Finally, we found that the Nrg interaction with Semaphorin 1a has distinctive functions during guidance and synapse formation <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, the GF circuit of Drosophila is a suitable model system for studying L1CAM function and <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> along with <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutants provide a unique opportunity to study pathological L1CAM missense mutations with respect to their effects on guidance and synapse formation in vivo. Here, we investigated the human L120V, E309K, H210Q, Y1070C, C264Y extracellular missense mutations in addition to a L1CAM protein mutated in the intracellular ezrinâmoesinâradixin (ERM) binding site (L1-4A). The human L1 mutant proteins were expressed in both, <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> and <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutant backgrounds to gauge the abilities of these proteins to rescue axon guidance and synapse development defects, respectively <xref rid="pone.0076974-Cheng2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>

The cDNAs for L1CAM, L1-4A and L1-1180 obtained from Vance Lemmon (University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine) were re-cloned into the pUAST vector via <italic>Eco</italic>RI-<italic>Xho</italic>I restriction sites <xref rid="pone.0076974-Cheng2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and transgenic fly lines were established on the second chromosome (Cutaneous Biology Research Center fly core, Mass.

Flies that did not exhibit a DLM response were not included in the characterization of the synaptic defects between the GF and the TTMn. The Following Frequencies were determined as the number of responses in percent of ten trains of ten stimuli at 100 Hz with a two second interval between the trains. For the Response Latencies, individual stimuli were used to determine the time delay between the stimulation of the GFs and the recording of a response in the TTM. The raw data was plotted on a scatter plot in Excel (Microsoft Office 10). Statistical significance was tested with Studentâs t-test in Sigma Plot 12 software. In addition, the average Following Frequencies of all flies, the average Response Latency of all responding flies, as well as the percent of flies that did not exhibit a TTM response when stimulated in the brain were calculated using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 10). Thoracic stimulation was used to directly activate the TTM motor neurons and to confirm that the observed defect was at the GF to TTMn connection and not at the neuromuscular junction, for those animals that didnât show a TTM response with brain stimulation.</p>

        <title>Expression of Human Pathological L1CAM Missense Mutations in the Drosophila Nervous System</title>
        <p>When expressed in different cell lines, several human L1CAM proteins with missense mutations in their extracellular domain are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum <xref rid="pone.0076974-Fransen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Needham1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Schafer2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In order to determine in vivo expression in the Drosophila nervous system, we used the Gal4/UAS system to transgenically express wild-type human L1CAM and L1CAM with pathological extracellular missense mutations (L120V, Y1070C, C264Y, H210Q, E309K and R184Q, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Brand1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Previously it has been shown that expression of L1CAM in Drosophila larvae resulted in a 200 kDa form <xref rid="pone.0076974-Nagaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In Western blots of adult flies using an antibody against the intracellular domain of human L1CAM, wild-type human L1CAM was detected as a 200 kDa band in addition to a more prominent 65 kDa band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). This suggests L1CAM is proteolytically cleaved in adult Drosophila and therefore we determined its cleavage developmentally in pupal stages, as well as in younger (1 day) and older (8 days) adults. During early pupal development the majority of L1CAM can be detected as a 200 kDa band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, as development proceeds the overall amount of L1CAM remained approximately the same, but the ratio of cleaved L1CAM to full length L1CAM increased with maximum cleavage occurring in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In contrast, no difference was seen between one and eight day old adult flies. These results were consistently observed in five independent Western blots. Thus, L1CAM cleavage seems to correlate with the maturation of the nervous system and is dependent on the differentiation status of neurons in the nervous system. Transgenic expression of all tested L1CAM constructs with pathological missense mutations resulted in robust expression in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The 200 kDa form was detected with equal or higher strength when compared to wild-type L1CAM. With the exception of L1-C264Y, the proteolytically cleaved 65 kDa L1CAM product was observed for all human L1CAM proteins with extracellular missense mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Testing the Abilities of Human Mutant L1CAM Proteins to Rescue GF Axonal Guidance Defects in <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> Mutant Background</title>
        <p>We previously showed that the extracellular missense mutation in the second Ig domain of <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) results in GF guidance defects in the brain <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These defects can be rescued by the transgenic expression of human L1CAM in the GF <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Goossens1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In wild-type flies each GF cell body in the brain projected an axon through the cervical connective into the second neuromere of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and made synaptic connections with the TTMn motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g002">Fig. 2</xref> A, B). In <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> mutants one or both GFs were stalled in the suboesophageal ganglion of the brain with a penetrance of approximately 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g002">Fig. 2C, G</xref>), while the remaining GFs, once they exited the brain, continued to grow to the synaptic target area. Expression of UAS-L1 with the OK307 Gal-4 driver in the GF of <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> animals significantly rescued the guidance defects in virtually all specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g002">Fig. 2D, G</xref>). We also expressed human L1CAM with the six extracellular pathological missense mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1</xref> A, L120V, Y1070C, C264Y, H210Q, E309K and R184Q) in the <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> mutant background to test their ability to complement for the loss of homophilic binding of the Nrg<sup>849</sup> protein and to rescue the guidance defects in vivo. In addition, we also expressed UAS-L1-4A in which four amino acids in the juxtamembrane region (<underline>K</underline>GG<underline>KY</underline>S<underline>V</underline>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) were substituted with alanine residues <xref rid="pone.0076974-Cheng2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This ERM-binding site plays an important role in axon branching, but is not required for neurite outgrowth <xref rid="pone.0076974-Cheng2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. To reveal the anatomical guidance phenotypes in the brain, we co-expressed UAS-CD8-GFP as a reporter with the L1-constructs. Additionally, we determined the number of GFs exiting the brain in animals not expressing CD8-GFP by using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy to identify the GFs in the cervical connective. Subsequent dye-injections of the GFs in the cervical connective were performed to confirm that all GFs that exited the brain reached the synaptic target area in the second neuromere of the VNC. We found that Nrg<sup>180</sup>, L1CAM, and L1CAM with L120V and E309K mutations were able to significantly rescue the guidance defects (p&lt;0.05, Chi-square statistical analysis) in <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> animals. In contrast, the expression of L1-C264Y, L1-H210Q, L1-R184Q and L1-4A did not complement the loss of homophilic binding in <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> animals. Although <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> animals expressing L1-Y1070C were statistically insignificant from negative control animals (<italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic>), they were also statistically insignificant from positive control animals (L1CAM in <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> background). Therefore, the observed reduction in the guidance defects suggests that expression of L1-Y1070C is able to partially rescue guidance defects in vivo.</p>

The synaptic GF to TTMn connection in all <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] animals was severely weakened. The inability of the GF synapse to follow multiple stimuli given at 100 Hz in a one-to-one ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>) was associated with an increase of the Response Latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g003">Fig. 3A,C</xref>) and with morphologically defective synaptic terminals that were reduced in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). We have previously shown that pre- and postsynaptic expression of UAS-nrg<sup>180</sup> in the GF circuit using the OK307 Gal4-driver can fully rescue the anatomical and functional synaptic phenotypes of <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutant animals <xref rid="pone.0076974-Enneking1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Here we used expression of human L1CAM and expression of L1-1180, which lacks part of the intracellular domain including the FIGQY motif <xref rid="pone.0076974-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, as positive and negative controls for the effects of expression of human pathogenic L1CAM mutations. We found that transgenic expression of human L1CAM efficiently rescued the synaptic defects in <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076974-t001">Table 1</xref>). The synaptic function was significantly improved in all animals. The average Following Frequency increased from 4% to 98.5%, the average Response Latency decreased from 2.05 ms to 0.87 ms in <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] and the number of animals with no TTM responses upon GF stimulation in the brain decreased from 37% to 0% in animals that express human L1CAM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076974-t001">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the morphology of the synaptic terminals was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).

        <p>Expression of L1-Y1070C, L1-H210Q and L1-R184Q failed to restore the GF synapse function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076974-t001">Table 1</xref>), as well as the GF terminal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). In contrast, expression of L1-L120V, L1-E309K and L1-C264Y significantly improved the functional synaptic defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076974-t001">Table 1</xref>) and morphology (data not shown) in all animals suggesting that outside-in signaling via the FIGQY motif was not disrupted by these mutations. Interestingly, L1-4A expression, unable to rescue the guidance defects of <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> mutants, was able to significantly rescue the synaptic phenotypes of <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g004">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076974-t001">Table 1</xref>) suggesting that the ERM binding site is more critical to GF guidance than for synapse formation.</p>
        <p>Although the average Following Frequency and average Response Latency were significantly improved with the expression of L1-C264Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076974-t001">Table 1</xref>), it is noteworthy that half of the tested GF to TTM connections were functionally normal, while the other half were functionally impaired like <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In order to address this bimodal distribution, we immunohistochemically labeled L1CAM in OK307, UAS-L1-C264Y/+ animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). We found that L1-C264Y protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, green) did localize to the synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, magenta) and was seen inside as well as on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g005">Fig. 5DâI</xref>) but not in negative control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g005">Fig. 5AâC</xref>). However, interestingly in some preparations the expression levels and localization of L1-C264Y protein was different for the individual GFs in the same specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g005">Fig. 5GâI</xref>). While in one GF L1-C264Y protein was strongly labeled in vesicular clusters inside the GF as well as at the terminal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g005">Fig. 5H, I</xref>, left GF), in the other GF only few clusters inside the terminal were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g005">Fig. 5H, I</xref>, right GF). These results suggest that the different protein levels of L1-C264Y at the GF terminals are likely to be the reason that the GF-TTMn synaptic connections were rescued in some but not all <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutant terminals.</p>

        <p>Finally, in order to test if the expression of L1CAM with pathogenic mutations in Drosophila has any dominant negative or poisonous effects in the GF circuit, we determined putative functional defects in a wild type background (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076974-t001">Table 1</xref>). All animals that expressed pathological L1CAM constructs with the OK307 Gal4 driver developed a GF synapse that was functionally similar to animals that expressed wild-type L1CAM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076974-t001">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that the failure of pathological L1CAM constructs to rescue guidance or synaptic phenotypes of <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> or <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutants is due to the loss of a biological function and not due to a dominant negative or poisonous effect.</p>

        <title>Expression and Proteolytic Cleavage of Mutant Human L1CAM Proteins</title>
        <p>Many different pathological L1CAM mutations have been characterized for their effects on homophilic and heterophilic interactions, as well as on their cell surface expression levels in vitro. However, there are only a few studies on their biological consequences in vivo <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Michelson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Here we characterized extra- and intracellular human L1CAM mutations in vivo with respect to expression along with their ability to support axon guidance and synapse formation in the GF circuit of Drosophila.</p>
        <p>In vertebrates, L1CAM is proteolytically cleaved by various enzymes, such as neuropsin, plasmin, ADAM10/17 and a yet unidentified serine protease <xref rid="pone.0076974-Schafer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Lutz1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Maretzky1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Nakamura1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Nayeem1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We found that expression of L1CAM in the Drosophila nervous system resulted in proteolytic cleavage to a 65 kDa fragment detected by antibodies directed against the intracellular L1CAM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). It is important to note that this proteolytic cleavage was not seen in larvae but in adults, suggesting that this cleavage is dependent on the differentiation status of the nervous system <xref rid="pone.0076974-Nagaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We found that the overall ratio of cleaved L1CAM to full-length L1CAM increased from pupa to adult and the cleavage rate remained constant when comparing adults of different ages. However, it remains to be determined if the cleavage in Drosophila occurs at a site homologous to those that have been described in vertebrates and if this particular cleavage is of functional relevance. Although, proteolytic cleavage of Nrg has not yet been described, we have evidence that it does get cleaved (unpublished data, manuscript in preparation). We found that transgenically expressed L1CAM proteins with L120V, Y1070C, H210Q, E309K and R184Q mutations were proteolytically cleaved and had similar or higher expression levels as the wild-type L1CAM-construct. This allowed for a functional analysis of the pathogenic L1CAM mutant proteins in terms of their ability to support axonal guidance and synapse formation in Drosophila mutants.</p>
        <p>The overall L1-C264Y expression was reduced comparatively but in Western blots no cleavage was observed for L1-C264Y protein even with ten heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). This is similar to L1-C264Y expression in the vertebrates. In vitro the C264Y mutation leads to reduced cell surface expression of the mutant protein, while in vivo L1-C264Y protein seems to be absent or below detection threshold at the cell surface <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Michelson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Itoh2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Runker1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Therefore, the absence of L1-C264Y cleavage in the vertebrate nervous system was associated with its lack of cell surface expression <xref rid="pone.0076974-Runker1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, expression of L1-C264Y in Drosophila was able to fully rescue the synaptic defects of half of the GF-TTMn connections in <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] animals suggesting that L1-C264Y protein was expressed at the cell surface. Correlating with the electrophysiological data, we did find that transgenically expressed L1-C264Y protein was present in numerous though not all synaptic terminals at the cell surface as well as in vesicular clusters inside the terminal. Therefore, our results suggest that in the Drosophila GF the pathogenic C264Y mutation not only affects proteolytic processing indirectly by reducing cell surface expression but may also affect it directly in L1-C264Y protein that is expressed at the cell surface.</p>

        <title>L1CAM Mutations in Axon Guidance</title>
        <p>Homophilic L1-L1 interactions mediated by the extracellular Ig-domains are involved in various L1-dependent signaling processes required for axonal growth, guidance and synapse stability <xref rid="pone.0076974-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Enneking1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The S213L mutation in the <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> allele is at a site analogous to the position of the H210Q mutation in humans and both mutations affect homophilic L1 binding <xref rid="pone.0076974-Goossens1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, although L1CAM-H210Q proteins are unable to interact homophilically with each other, they can efficiently bind to wild-type L1CAM <xref rid="pone.0076974-Castellani1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We have shown that Neuroglian is required pre- and postsynaptically for GF synapse formation and that expression of Nrg<sup>180</sup> on either side of <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> mutant synapses can partially rescue the synaptic phenotypes. This suggests that Nrg-S213L similar to L1-H210Q is able to bind to a wild-type extracellular domain <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Enneking1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Here, we tested whether the expression of different pathological mutations can compensate for the loss of homophilic interaction in <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> mutants. Expression of wild-type human L1CAM, as well as L1-L120V and L1-E309K, both of which mediate normal homophilic binding, was able to efficiently rescue the guidance defects of <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Michelson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, previously it was shown that expression of L1-E309K in a null mutant background did not rescue the guidance defects of bristle mechanosensory (BM) neurons <xref rid="pone.0076974-Nagaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This suggests that either the functional Nrg/L1CAM requirements for guidance in BM and GF neurons are different or that homophilic interaction of L1-E309K protein with Nrg<sup>849</sup> protein induces signaling that is sufficient for GF guidance.</p>
        <p>In contrast, several L1-CAM constructs failed to rescue the guidance phenotypes. This may be due to one or a combination of three most likely causes. First, L1CAM missense mutations that severely reduce or prevent cell surface expression of the mutant protein are likely to affect the rescue capacity, e.g. the C264Y mutation <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Michelson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Itoh2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Runker1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Secondly, L1CAM missense mutations that affect homophilic binding are unable to fully complement for the lack of homophilic binding of the Nrg-S213L protein. This appears to be the case for the H210Q, C264Y and R184Q mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Finally, it is conceivable that some pathological missense mutations with normal homophilic binding have impaired outside-in signaling or heterophilic interactions that are required for axon guidance <xref rid="pone.0076974-Nagaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These mutant proteins are also unlikely to rescue the <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> guidance phenotype. Although the L1-Y1070C construct showed a strong improvement in restoring <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> guidance defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), despite its normal homophilic binding capacity, it did not reach statistical significance. However, this mutation has been shown to reduce Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling critical for axon growth in Drosophila <xref rid="pone.0076974-Nagaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In addition, we found that expression of L1-4A failed to rescue the <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> guidance phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The ERM-binding site has been shown to be critical for axon growth and branching in vertebrates <xref rid="pone.0076974-Cheng2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Dickson1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Mintz1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, suggesting it is also required for axon guidance in Drosophila.</p>

        <title>L1CAM Mutations in Synapse Formation</title>
        <p>While many pathological L1CAM mutations have been studied for their effects on neurite outgrowth, axon guidance and branching, virtually no information is available with respect to their impact on synapse development. We have previously demonstrated that intracellular signaling of the Nrg<sup>180</sup> FIGQY motif is essential for synapse formation of the GF, but not for neurite outgrowth or axon guidance <xref rid="pone.0076974-Enneking1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our published results demonstrate that expression of wild-type Nrg<sup>180</sup> on either side of Nrg<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup> synaptic terminals is able to rescue the morphological and functional defects. This finding suggests that transcellular Nrg<sup>180</sup> signaling can superimpose the molecular information to the other synaptic side, which lacks Nrg-FIGQY signaling. However, it remains to be determined if this transcellular interaction is homophilic, heterophilic or both.</p>
        <p>The finding that human L1CAM mutations like L1-L120V, L1-E309K, L1-4A and partially L1-C264Y were able to rescue the synaptic defects of Drosophila <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g004">4</xref>) suggests that they do not affect outside-in signaling via the FIGQY motif. However, the results do not exclude a synaptic function via other signaling mechanisms that are independent of the FIGQY motif and are unaffected in the Nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup> protein. We identified several L1CAM mutations that had expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) comparable to L1CAM wild-type control flies, but did not rescue the synaptic phenotype. Although L1-H210Q protein is able to bind to wild-type L1CAM <xref rid="pone.0076974-Castellani1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, both human L1CAM mutations with disrupted homophilic binding (L1-H210Q and L1-R184Q) were unable to rescue the synaptic defects when expressed pre- and postsynaptically in the GF circuit of <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutant flies. This suggests that L1-H210Q and L1-R184Q may not interact transcellularly with Nrg<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup> and homophilic interactions are also essential for synapse formation. Alternatively, L1-H210Q and L1-R184Q may be able to interact transcellularly with Nrg<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>, which has a wild-type extracellular domain. However, in this scenario the H210Q and R184Q mutations disrupt outside-in signaling processes via the FIGQY motif. The latter hypothesis is supported by our finding that the <italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic> mutants with the analogous L1-H210Q mutation have reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the FIGQY motif and synaptic phenotypes similar to <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutants in addition to guidance defects <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Finally, we found that L1-Y1070C mutant protein failed to rescue the synaptic defects of <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>;P[nrg180<sup>ÎFIGQY</sup>] mutant flies although its homophilic interactions are not affected by the mutation <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Both, Y1070C and E309K mutations have been shown to reduce EGFR signaling to a similar extent <xref rid="pone.0076974-Nagaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, because the L1-Y1070C transgenic expression level was higher than the expression of L1-E309K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076974-g001">Fig. 1</xref> C), the lack of rescue capacity of the L1-Y1070C protein is unlikely to be due to reduced EGFR signaling. This suggests that the Y1070C mutation either affects FIGQY phosphorylation or the localization of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated L1-type protein at the cell surface. Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated L1-type proteins have been shown to localize to distinct areas <xref rid="pone.0076974-Jenkins1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and interestingly, heterophilic binding to Tag-1/Axonin-1 and contactin/F11 are increased for the L1-Y1070C mutant protein <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In summary, we find that extracellular human pathogenic L1CAM missense mutations not only affect adhesive properties but also intracellular signaling pathways distinctly, which are required for axon guidance, synapse formation or both. Mutations that affect homophilic binding are most detrimental because they affect adhesive properties but often also heterophilic interactions and intracellular signaling <xref rid="pone.0076974-Godenschwege1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Fransen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076974-Nagaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In contrast, intracellular mutations as well as extracellular mutations that only affect heterophilic interactions are more likely to only result in a partial loss of L1CAM biological function, which is also reflected by the fact that pathogenic intracellular missense mutations are known to result in less detrimental pathological phenotypes <xref rid="pone.0076974-Fransen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, these types of mutations may affect different biological processes such as guidance and synapse formation distinctively and their characterization in vivo is essential in order to gain a complete understanding of L1CAM function. We find that outside-in signaling via the ERM-motif and via the FIGQY motif are required for GF guidance and synapse formation in Drosophila, respectively. Here, we provided novel evidence that the H210Q, R184Q and Y1070C but not the L120V and E309K L1CAM mutations affect outside-in signaling via the Ankyrin binding domain, which is essential for synapse formation but not for axon guidance. Thus, the broad variability of pathological phenotypes observed between humans with L1CAM mutations is based on the differential effects on distinct signaling pathways required for developmental biological processes.</p>
