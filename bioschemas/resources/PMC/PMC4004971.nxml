        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>SMCHD1 is a structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family protein involved in epigenetic gene silencing and chromosome organisation on the female inactive X chromosome and at a limited number of autosomal loci. Here, we demonstrate that SMCHD1 also has a role in DNA repair of double-strand breaks; SMCHD1 is recruited to sites of laser micro-irradiated damage along with other DNA repair factors, including Ku80 (also known as XRCC5 in mammals) and RAD51. Cells deficient in SMCHD1 show evidence of decreased efficiency of repair and cell viability after DNA damage. We suggest that SMCHD1 responds to DNA double-strand breaks in a manner that is likely to involve its ability to alter chromatin states to facilitate DNA repair.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>SMCHD1 is a non-canonical member of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein family that plays fundamental roles in higher-order chromosome organisation. SMCHD1 shares limited similarity with other SMC proteins, differing in ATPase domain structure and its inability to form a stable multimeric complex. SMCHD1 uniquely affects epigenetic gene silencing, chromosome organisation and CpG DNA methylation on the female inactive X chromosome and at a limited number of autosomal loci (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">Blewitt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Nozawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Gendrel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Arne et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>There is evidence for the participation of cohesin and the SMC5âSMC6 complex in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">Potts et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Stephan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">Watrin and Peters, 2009</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><italic> thaliana</italic> SMCHD1 homologue has been implicated in HR (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">BÃ¶hmdorfer et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show that mammalian SMCHD1 is recruited to laser micro-irradiated DNA damage with dynamics suggestive of a role facilitating both non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and HR-mediated DNA repair. SMCHD1 colocalises with Ku80 (also known as XRCC5 in mammals) at early stages of DNA repair, but can also persist at damage sites for 14âh or longer and colocalise with Rad51. In the absence or depletion of SMCHD1, significantly more DNA double-strand breaks are unresolved, and we observe diminished 53BP1 recruitment and decreased cell viability after DNA damage. These results demonstrate an important role for SMCHD1 in the mammalian DNA damage response. We suggest that SMCHD1 responds specifically to DNA damage in a manner that is likely to involve its ability to alter chromatin states and facilitate repair.</p>

      <title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>Initial recruitment of SMCHD1 to DNA damage exhibits fast dynamics, but SMCHD1 enrichment persists in some cells</title>
        <p>As a first step towards investigating the role of SMCHD1 in DNA repair, we assessed the accumulation of GFP-tagged human SMCHD1 in BrdU pre-sensitised mammalian female SD10 fibroblast cells in response to DSB-inducing laser micro-irradiation (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">Mortusewicz and Leonhardt, 2007</xref>). We verified correct nuclear localisation of SMCHD1âGFP by visualising enrichment on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">Gendrel et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1A</xref>). Using live imaging, we observed BrdU-dependent SMCHD1 enrichment at sites of damage that were first evident after 3âmin and persisted for at least 1âh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1B,C</xref>). Recruitment of SMCHD1 was highly reproducible, with 82% of cells from six biological replicas demonstrating enrichment within 15âmin. Rapid recruitment of SMCHD1 is consistent with a role in the early stages of repair, indeed, longer timecourses additionally demonstrated that SMCHD1 enrichment in some cells was lost by 2 h 45 min (indicative of NHEJ resolution of DSBs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1D, short broad arrow</xref>). However, in other cells SMCHD1 enrichment persisted up to or longer than 14âh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1D</xref>, short thin and long thin arrows, respectively). These observations indicate that whereas SMCHD1 is initially recruited to DNA damage with dynamics consistent with NHEJ, its persistence also suggests a role in later stages of repair.</p>

        <title>SMCHD1 colocalises with Ku80, but at later stages after DNA damage can colocalise with RAD51</title>
        <p>In order to understand the role of SMCHD1 in relation to different stages of DNA repair we utilised immunofluorescence to firstly show that SMCHD1 was recruited to damage sites in G1/S (HR deficient) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2A</xref>) and was not confined to a role in HR. Then, using a combination of live SMCHD1âGFP imaging and fixed immunofluorescence analysis of DNA repair factors, we analysed recruitment of the HR factor RAD51 to sites of damage. RAD51 recruitment is not evident 3âmin after damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2B</xref>), when Î³H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2B</xref>) and SMCHD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1C</xref>) were already enriched. RAD51 showed a faint recruitment to damage after 10âmin, in contrast with strong enrichment of the NHEJ component Ku80 at 10âmin (with Î³H2AX and 53BP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2C,D</xref>). At 1âh after damage [when SMCHD1 enrichment was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1C</xref>)], Ku80 enrichment appeared to be diminished, whereas RAD51 was prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2E,F</xref>). SMCHD1 colocalised with the same DNA damage sites as Ku80, Î³H2AX and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2E,F</xref>) but also with RAD51, which is recruited later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2F</xref>). These data support a role for SMCHD1 in facilitating DNA repair mediated by both NHEJ and HR.</p>

        <p>As the majority of repair in an asynchronous population is mediated by NHEJ, we then analysed Î³H2AX in samples at 10, 20, 30 and 40âmin post-damage using a reduced ionising radiation dose of 2âGy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3C</xref>). In WT MEFs, Î³H2AX fluorescence intensity increased for the first 30âmin, in agreement with the continued expansion of Î³H2AX domains, but at 40âmin early stage repair was evident, because DSBs marked by Î³H2AX had been resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3C</xref>).

        <p>Recruitment of 53BP1 promotes NHEJ by antagonising HR-initiating factors (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Dimitrova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>), but has also been proposed to facilitate HR in G2 cells (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Kakarougkas et al., 2013</xref>). We reasoned that <italic>Smchd1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> MEFs, might therefore also exhibit an altered profile of 53BP1 recruitment to sites of damage. We scored 53BP1 recruitment, with cells categorised as having strong, weak or absent foci 45âmin after 2âGy ionising radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3D</xref>). In the absence of ionising radiation, no 53BP1 foci were observed in almost 95% of WT and <italic>Smchd1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3E</xref>).

In contrast, in <italic>Smchd1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> MEFs, there was a significant reduction to 56% of cells exhibiting strong foci, 27% of <italic>Smchd1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> cells exhibiting weak foci, and 17% of cells with no recruitment of 53BP1 (two-tailed unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0022 when comparing strong foci in WT versus <italic>Smchd1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3E</xref>).

SMCHD1 cells treated with siRNA 1 demonstrated significantly reduced viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3H</xref>), particularly at higher doses of phleomycin (Student's two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test comparing SMCHD1 siRNA and mock siRNA treated cell survival, <italic>P</italic>â=â0.003 at 12.5âÂµg/ml, 0.032 at 25âÂµg/ml and 0.047 at 50âÂµg/ml of phleomycin). SMCHD1 siRNA 2 [RNA reduced to 32% of endogenous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3I</xref>)] also significantly reduced viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3J</xref>) (Student's two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test comparing survival between cells treated with SMCHD1 siRNA and mock siRNA, <italic>P</italic>â=â0.024 at 3.125âÂµg/ml and 0.002 or less at concentrations of 6.25â50âÂµg/ml of phleomycin).</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Although the canonical SMC complexes have a role in HR (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">Potts et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Stephan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">Watrin and Peters, 2009</xref>), here we demonstrate a role for mammalian SMCHD1 in facilitating both NHEJ and HR mediated DNA repair. Depletion of SMCHD1 results in delayed DSB repair and reduced cell viability. The alteration in early repair dynamics, as indicated by Î³H2AX persistence in <italic>Smchd1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs, the initial timing of recruitment of SMCHD1 and its colocalisation with Ku80 are all suggestive of a role facilitating NHEJ. As the majority of cells in an asynchronous population undergo repair by NHEJ, this explains the strong effect of SMCHD1 loss on early stage repair. However, the persistence of SMCHD1 enrichment in some cells, its colocalisation with RAD51 and the alteration of Î³H2AX repair dynamics even 24âh after DNA damage suggests that SMCHD1 also impacts on later phases of DNA repair, including HR. Collectively these findings point to a role for mammalian SMCHD1, potentially by modulating the organisation of chromatin, in facilitating the resolution of DNA damage.</p>

      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
        <p>Cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS, 50âÂµg/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 2âmM L-glutamine, 1Ã non-essential amino acids and 50âÂµM 2-mercaptoethanol in a 37Â°C incubator and under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Details of SD10 fibroblast and MEF line derivation available upon request.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence</title>
        <p>Cells were grown to a sub-confluent monolayer on glass coverslips. If appropriate, cells were subject to damage using ionising radiation (Caesium-137 Graviton), and allowed to recover. Coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilised with 0.5% Triton X-100 and stained as standard. For immunofluorescence including Ku80 or RAD51, pre-extraction was carried out with CSK+R buffer prior to fixation (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">Britton et al., 2013</xref>). Cells were imaged using a Zeiss AX10 microscope equipped with an AxioCam MRM CCD camera and Axiovision software. CellProfiler 2.0 image analysis software was used for automated analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cellprofiler.org">www.cellprofiler.org</ext-link>). Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (1â¶1000, Roche), mouse monoclonal anti-Î³H2AX (1â¶1000, Upstate), rabbit polyclonal anti-53BP1 (1â¶1000, Novus Biologicals), mouse monoclonal anti-Ku80 (1â¶200, Thermo Scientific), rabbit polyclonal anti-Rad51 (1â¶200), Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H and L), and Alexa-Fluor-568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H and L) (1â¶400, Molecular Probes) antibodies were used.</p>

        <title>Laser micro-irradiation</title>
        <p>Cells were seeded in Î¼-dishes (Ibidi), pre-sensitised with 10âÂµg/ml BrdU for 24âh. For cell cycle analysis, 20âÂµl Premo Fucci Cell Cycle Sensor CDT-RFP mix (Life Technologies) was added to the cells in 1âml medium 48âh prior to imaging. Cells were imaged in a humid 37Â°C Tokai chamber under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were damaged using 100% 405-nm laser power, 50 iterations, and a damage focus of either 3-Âµm diameter, or a line of 1Ã100 pixels. Images were captured using 15% 488 laser power with 17 <italic>z</italic>-slices of 0.5-Âµm step size using a PerkinElmer spinning disk confocal microscope, Ã60/1.4 NA oil immersion objective and a Hamamatsu C9100-13 EMCCD camera (either 512Ã512 pixels, or for the 15-h timecourse, 1024Ã1024 pixels). Volocity 6.1.1 software was used for acquisition and analysis, in conjunction with Image JA to produce projected images from composite <italic>z</italic> sections. For colocalisation of SMCHD1âGFP with repair factors by immunofluorescence, damage to cells in a single field of view was followed by a single snapshot confirming recruitment at 10âmin and then immunofluorescence as detailed after 3 or 60âmin, followed by further snapshots using the PerkinElmer spinning disk confocal microscope as detailed.</p>
