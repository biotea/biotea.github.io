      <abstract>
        <p>Canonical Wnt signaling is controlled intracellularly by the level of Î²-catenin protein, which is dependent on Axin scaffolding of a complex that phosphorylates Î²-catenin to target it for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. This function of Axin is counteracted through relocalization of Axin protein to the Wnt receptor complex to allow for ligand-activated Wnt signaling. AXIN1 and AXIN2 protein levels are regulated by tankyrase-mediated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARsylation), which destabilizes Axin and promotes signaling. Mechanistically, how tankyrase limits Axin protein accumulation, and how tankyrase levels and activity are regulated for this function, are currently under investigation. By RNAi screening, we identified the RNF146 RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling that operates with tankyrase to maintain low steady-state levels of Axin proteins. RNF146 also destabilizes tankyrases TNKS1 and TNKS2 proteins and, in a reciprocal relationship, tankyrase activity reduces RNF146 protein levels. We show that RNF146, tankyrase, and Axin form a protein complex, and that RNF146 mediates ubiquitylation of all three proteins to target them for proteasomal degradation. RNF146 is a cytoplasmic protein that also prevents tankyrase protein aggregation at a centrosomal location. Tankyrase auto-PARsylation and PARsylation of Axin is known to lead to proteasome-mediated degradation of these proteins, and we demonstrate that, through ubiquitylation, RNF146 mediates this process to regulate Wnt signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Wnt signaling is a fundamental morphogenetic pathway of metazoans that is deployed in diverse settings throughout development to regulate processes such as cell fate specification, stem cell regeneration, and neuronal migration <xref rid="pone.0022595-Grigoryan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Wnt signaling can become deregulated through multiple mechanisms to produce cancer or other diseases, particularly colorectal cancer for which APC or Î²-catenin is mutated in approximately 95% of tumors <xref rid="pone.0022595-Giles1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Consequently, many mechanisms have evolved to control the level, activity, and subcellular localization of multiple Wnt pathway components <xref rid="pone.0022595-Logan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. For example, Wnt ligands and their access to receptors of the FZD family and coreceptors LRP5 and LRP6 are modulated by decoy receptors, such as SFRP1, and by heparan sulfate proteoglycans, such as glypicans. Intracellularly, the best characterized mode of Wnt signaling regulation is the degradation of Î²-catenin by a protein complex that includes Axin and APC. This complex mediates the phosphorylation of Î²-catenin by CK1 and GSK3, which then signals Î²-catenin ubiquitylation by the SCF<sup>Î²-TrCP</sup> complex to target Î²-catenin to the proteasome for proteolysis.</p>
      <p>Axin protein, present in two isoforms, appears to be the most quantitatively limiting component of the Î²-catenin degradation complex <xref rid="pone.0022595-Salic1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022595-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. When Wnts engage their receptors, LRP5/6 is phosphorylated and recruits Axin into the receptor complex at the plasma membrane, where GSK3 bound to Axin becomes inactivated, thus preventing Î²-catenin degradation <xref rid="pone.0022595-Niehrs1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The critical role of Axin in controlling Î²-catenin levels and Wnt signaling is reflected in the multiple mechanisms of regulating Axin protein abundance in cells. AXIN2 is a direct transcriptional target of TCF/LEF transcription factors, thus generating a negative feedback loop whereby Wnt signaling increases AXIN2 mRNA, and consequently protein, levels to ultimately downregulate Î²-catenin <xref rid="pone.0022595-Jho1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In contrast, AXIN1 is part of a positive feedback mechanism for Wnt signaling since signaling destabilizes AXIN1 protein <xref rid="pone.0022595-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In this mechanism, since AXIN1 phosphorylation by GSK3 normally stabilizes AXIN1 protein, Wnt-induced GSK3 inactivation destabilizes AXIN1. More recently, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) tankyrase was shown to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate (PARsylate) AXIN1 and AXIN2 proteins to mediate their proteasomal degradation <xref rid="pone.0022595-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Small-molecule inhibitors of tankyrases TNKS1 and TNKS2 can downregulate Wnt signaling, and they also block the accumulation of ubiquitylated Axin upon proteasome inhibition. The ubiquitin E3 ligase SMURF2 also has been reported to ubiquitylate and degrade Axin <xref rid="pone.0022595-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Ubiquitylation is a fundamental mechanism for regulating the stability, interaction, and subcellular localization of many proteins, thereby controlling the activity of signaling pathways <xref rid="pone.0022595-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Ubiquitin molecules in polyubiquitin chains can be linked to each other through any one of seven Lys residues (or through the N-terminus), and this linkage type, or mixture of linkage types, can specify the fate of the attached protein. K48- or K11-linked polyubiquitin predominantly targets proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome, whereas K63 linkage typically mediates protein-protein interactions or targets proteins for lysosomal degradation. Ubiquitin E3 ligases confer the substrate specificity of ubiquitylation by binding both the substrate and an ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to substrate. There are more than 600 human E3 ligases, and the largest structural class contains a RING domain that binds an E2. Together, the E2-E3 pair specifies the ubiquitin linkage type synthesized <xref rid="pone.0022595-Deshaies1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>PARsylation can also control the function and localization of some proteins, and there are 17 human PARP family members, including TNKS1 and TNKS2 <xref rid="pone.0022595-Hottiger1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. For example, tankyrase PARsylates TRF1 protein to inhibit its binding to telomeres, and this allows telomerase to access and lengthen telomeres <xref rid="pone.0022595-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Tankyrase-mediated PARslyation may sometimes be linked to ubiquitylation and protein degradation, as mentioned above for the apparent role of tankyrase in promoting the ubiquitylation and proteasome targeting of Axin <xref rid="pone.0022595-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Release of PARsylated TRF1 from telomeres results in TRF1 degradation by the proteasome <xref rid="pone.0022595-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Also, inhibition of tankyrase activity with a small-molecule inhibitor suggests that auto-PARsylation can translocate tankyrase from epithelial cell lateral membranes into the cytoplasm for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation <xref rid="pone.0022595-Yeh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this report, we identify the E3 ligase RNF146 as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling that ubiquitylates and destabilizes Axin and tankyrase. We also show that tankyrase PARsylation activity reciprocally destabilizes RNF146 protein. Both RNF146 and auto-PARsylation activity also prevent tankyrase aggregation at a centrosomal location. Our results suggest that RNF146, tankyrase, and Axin form a complex in which ubiquitylation and PARsylation of all three proteins mediate their proteasomal degradation.</p>

The screen was conducted in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing different luciferase reporters driven by either TCF binding sites or the SV40 promoter, and purified Wnt3a protein was used to stimulate signaling <xref rid="pone.0022595-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A Z-score cutoff of -1.65 was used to identify the top 5.7% of screen hits (37 targeted genes) that reduce Wnt reporter activity (normalized to SV40 reporter activity), and these hits were further limited to 26 genes that did not significantly affect SV40 luciferase activity (Z-score less than 1.7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). When individual siRNAs were tested, four genes, including RNF146, showed at least 3 of 4 siRNAs producing greater than two-fold reduction of Wnt signaling in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022595.s005">Table S1</xref>). Doxycycline-inducible RNF146 miRNA expression also inhibits Wnt signaling, and this effect is rescued by RNF146 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We tested RNAi of these genes for effects on endogenous Wnt target gene expression in PA-1 teratocarcinoma cells, which display autocrine Wnt signaling <xref rid="pone.0022595-DeAlmeida1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and found that multiple siRNAs for only RNF146 inhibit expression of Wnt-activated genes GAD1 and SAX1, as well as enhance expression of Wnt-repressed genes LEFTY1 and LEFTY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

        <title>RNF146 Destabilizes Axin and Cooperates with Tankyrase</title>
        <p>To define the level in the Wnt pathway at which RNF146 functions, we stimulated signaling by overexpressing Wnt coreceptor LRP6 or a constitutively active form of LPR6 in HEK293 cells <xref rid="pone.0022595-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and found that RNF146 siRNAs reduce signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). RNF146 RNAi also inhibits Wnt3a-stimulated Î²-catenin stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and, at least in the absence of Wnt induction, promotes Î²-catenin phosphorylation at sites that mediate its degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We next examined the effects of RNF146 RNAi on proteins that act in the Wnt pathway between LRP6 and Î²-catenin, and found that AXIN1 and AXIN2 steady-state levels are dramatically increased, whereas total and phospho-GSK3Î± and -GSK3Î² levels are not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). RNF146 functions to destabilize Axin with or without induction of signaling by Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), and this appears to be a post-transcriptional effect, since RNAi does not increase AXIN1 or AXIN2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

        <p>Since tankyrases TNKS1 and TNKS2 also positively regulate Wnt signaling by destabilizing Axin <xref rid="pone.0022595-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, we compared the effects of RNF146 and tankyrase RNAi in HEK293 cells. The level of Wnt signaling inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and AXIN1 or AXIN2 stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) are similar for RNAi of RNF146 (lanes 1 and 2), tankyrases (both TNKS1 and TNKS2; lanes 5 and 6), or the combination of RNF146 and tankyrases (lanes 9 and 10), suggesting that RNF146 and tankyrase function together in a linear pathway rather than in parallel pathways that might have additive effects. This result is particularly evident in the presence of AXIN1 RNAi to enhance Wnt3a stimulation and limit the inhibitory effects of RNF146 and tankyrase RNAi to that resulting from only AXIN2 stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), since AXIN1 stabilization is blocked by AXIN1 RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12). Surprisingly, we found that RNF146 RNAi also increases TNKS1 and TNKS2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022595.s001">S1</xref>). Just as for Axin destabilization, RNF146 destabilizes tankyrases independent of Wnt stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and at a post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022595.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Proteasome inhibition can also stabilize tankyrase proteins, though less strongly than RNF146 RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022595.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Temporally, effects on Axin, tankyrase, and Î²-catenin proteins coincide such that induction of RNF146 RNAi maximally stabilizes Axin and tankyrase proteins by 48 h, the same time at which enhanced Î²-catenin phosphorylation becomes apparent, and 24 h after RNF146 protein levels begin to decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

        <p>We generated an antibody against RNF146 protein, and show that tankyrase also destabilizes RNF146 protein. Combined TNKS1 and TNKS2 RNAi increases RNF146 steady-state protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 5 and 6), but does not affect RNF146 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022595.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Tankyrase-mediated degradation of RNF146 protein is independent of Wnt stimulation in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 5) and requires the catalytic activity of tankyrases, since the IWR-2 small-molecule inhibitor of TNKS1 and TNKS2 <xref rid="pone.0022595-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022595-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> also stabilizes RNF146 protein in a dose-dependent manner similar its stabilization of Axin protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Overexpression of TNKS2 in HEK293 cells induces Wnt signaling in the absence of ligand, and also enhances signaling stimulated by Wnt3a protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, RNF146 overexpression does not affect signaling with or without Wnt3a stimulation, but it does further potentiate signaling in combination with TNKS2 overexpression. Combined overexpression of RNF146 and TNKS2 also reduces Axin protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, lanes 23 and 24).</p>
        <p>RNF146 is a predicted ubiquitin E3 ligase that contains a RING domain, presumably binding E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, and a WWE domain <xref rid="pone.0022595-Aravind1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, putatively binding to substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Expression of mutant forms of RNF146 that either delete the RING domain (ÎRING) or replace the putative zinc-coordinating His53 with Ala (H53A) partially suppresses signaling in Wnt3a-stimulated HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) and stabilize Axin and tankyrase proteins with or without Wnt3a induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, lanes 9, 10, 17, and 18, and 3H). The dominant-negative effects of these mutant RNF146 transgenes on Wnt signaling and Axin protein can be reversed by overexpression of wildtype RNF146 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>, lanes 11, 12, 19, and 20), suggesting that the mutant RNF146 proteins may lack ligase activity and compete with wildtype protein for substrate binding. Expression of mutant RNF146 in which the evolutionarily conserved Trp105 in the WWE domain is replaced with Ala (W105A) did not show any of these dominant-negative effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g003">Figure 3EâH</xref>).</p>
        <p>In colorectal cancer cell line SW48, Wnt signaling is activated by Î²-catenin mutation S33Y at a GSK3 phosphorylation site required for Axin-mediated Î²-catenin degradation <xref rid="pone.0022595-Ilyas1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. As expected in these cells, RNF146 RNAi does not inhibit expression of Î²-catenin-activated genes AXIN2 and SP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Colorectal cancer cell line HCT-15 is activated for Wnt signaling by an APC truncating mutation, and signaling is partially inhibited by tankyrase RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). While RNF146 RNAi in HCT-15 cells can stabilize TNKS1 and TNKS2 proteins, it unexpectedly does not stabilize Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) or inhibit Wnt luciferase reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). RNF146 siRNAs have no effect on signaling even in combination with Î²-catenin siRNA at concentrations that only partially inhibit Wnt signaling. Lastly, in the colorectal cancer cell line SW480 that also possesses a truncating APC mutation, tankyrase RNAi stabilizes AXIN1, AXIN2, and RNF146 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, RNF146 RNAi in SW480 cells stabilizes tankyrase proteins but not AXIN1 or AXIN2.</p>

        <p>We used the active GST-tagged RNF146 protein and GST control protein to affinity purify interacting proteins from cell lysates of three cell lines (HEK293, HEK293 activated for Wnt signaling by LRP6 overexpression, and HCT-15). Mass spectrometric identification of protein interactors revealed seven proteins that were identified by at least 10 unique peptides in all three cell lines by GST-RNF146, but were not identified in any of the cell lines using the GST control protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022595.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These specific interacting partners include PARP1 and three other proteins involved in DNA damage response.</p>
        <p>As a complimentary approach to identify RNF146 interacting proteins, we expressed in HEK293 cells RNF146 wildtype and ÎRING proteins, as well the control E3 ligase HECTD1, and immunoprecipitated these HA-tagged proteins from cell lysates. Mass spectrometric identification of proteins in all Coomassie-stained electrophoretic gel bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) yielded TNKS1, TNKS2, PARP1, and PARP2 among the most prevalent proteins captured by RNF146ÎRING but not HECTD1, in addition to 11 other proteins known to bind PARP1/2 or function in DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Most of these protein interactors were also captured by wildtype RNF146 protein, although typically identified by fewer total peptides, suggesting that ubiquitylation by active RNF146 may release interactors from a complex. In contrast, specific interacting proteins that were identified by more peptides after capture by wildtype rather than ÎRING RNF146 include ubiquitin and the HECT-type ubiquitin E3 ligase HUWE1.</p>
        <p>We confirmed by Western analysis that RNF146 binds tankyrase by immunoprecipitating tagged RNF146 expressed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Both wildtype and H53A mutant RNF146 proteins co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous TNKS1, apparently the predominant tankyrase in HEK293 cells, and with overexpressed TNKS2. Note that proteasome inhibitor ALLN weakly stabilizes TNKS2 and RNF146 when both are overexpressed. While we did not identify Axin proteins in the RNF146 affinity purifications for mass spectrometric analyses, we were able to show that at least overexpressed AXIN1 associates with tagged RNF146 and tankyrase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). TNKS1 co-immunoprecipitates with AXIN1, and this interaction does not require the PARP catalytic domain of TNKS1. These complexes can also contain RNF146 or, more abundantly, RNF146ÎRING protein. Overexpressed PARP1, with or without the PARP catalytic domain, is not specifically co-immunoprecipitated with AXIN1, although a small amount is nonspecifically immunoprecipitated under these conditions, with longer photographic exposure time required for detection. RNF146 wildtype and ÎRING proteins can also be identified in the AXIN1 complexes at similar abundance with or without TNKS1 overexpression, suggesting that RNF146 may bind directly to Axin as well as tankyrase.</p>
        <p>Since RNF146 interacts robustly with tankyrase in biochemical and genetic assays, we tested whether RNF146 ubiquitylates tankyrase in cells. Affinity purification of HEK293 cell lysate with the FK2 anti-polyubiquitin antibody, which recognizes multiple ubiquitin linkage types, does not allow detection of endogenous tankyrase or RNF146 by Western analysis, but overexpressed RNF146 shows high-molecular-weight polyubiquitylated species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Since mutant RNF146<sup>H53A</sup> protein displays much less ubiquitylation, most of the ubiquitylation of wildtype RNF146 in cells is likely mediated by auto-ubiquitylation. TNKS2 overexpression alone or in combination with RNF146<sup>H53A</sup> yields little or no polyubiquitylated tankyrase, however co-expression with wildtype RNF146 dramatically ubiquitylates TNKS2. Proteasome inhibitor ALLN partially attenuates RNF146-mediated degradation of total tankyrase protein levels while stabilizing TNKS2 that is polyubiquitylated by RNF146, suggesting that at least some of the ubiquitylated tankyrase is normally targeted to the proteasome. These effects seem to result from specific interactions between RNF146 and tankyrase. Neither tankyrase degradation nor ubiquitylation is observed with overexpression of a different RING-type E3 ligase, AMFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Although overexpressed RNF146 binds co-expressed PARP1, it does not mediate its ubiquitylation or destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To define the ubiquitin linkage types specified by RNF146 on itself or on substrate proteins in cells, we analyzed the high-molecular-weight gel bands of the cell lysates immunoprecipitated for HA-RNF146 wildtype and ÎRING proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) for mass spectrometric peptide signatures of K48-, K63-, or K11-linked polyubiquitin <xref rid="pone.0022595-Phu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. All three ubiquitin linkage types were identified in the RNF146, but not RNF146ÎRING, immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Additional mass spectrometric analyses of these high-molecular-weight fractions revealed that the only proteins displaying appreciably more peptide spectral masses in the RNF146 bands than in the RNF146ÎRING bands were ubiquitin, RNF146, and HUWE1 (data not shown). This suggests that the primary carrier of ubiquitin in these bands is RNF146 and, to a lesser extent, HUWE1. Presumably other ubiquitylated substrates are not observed in the wildtype RNF146 immunoprecipitate because they dissociate from the ligase complex upon ubiquitylation.</p>
        <p>To directly analyze the ubiquitin linkage types ligated onto substrate proteins by RNF146, we overexpressed RNF146 with tankyrase or Axin in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated polyubiquitylated proteins with antibodies specific for K48- or K63-linked polyubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). RNF146 strongly induced both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitylation of TNKS2 protein, whereas AXIN1 showed predominantly K48-linked ubiquitin. As a control for specificity, Î²-catenin in these immunoprecipitates displayed only K48-linked ubiquitin and was not altered by RNF146 overexpression.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>By screening a siRNA library targeting all human ubiquitin E3 ligases, we have identified RNF146 as a new positive regulator of Wnt signaling. RNF146 acts with tankyrase in the constitutive turnover of Axin proteins that maintains low levels of Axin and allows the Wnt receptor-coreceptor complex to initiate signaling by further repressing Axin's function in degrading Î²-catenin. Paradoxically, RNF146 also destabilizes through proteasomal degradation the tankyrase proteins, which are also positive regulators of Wnt signaling <xref rid="pone.0022595-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Upon RNF146 RNAi, the stabilized tankyrase protein relocalizes to a centrosomal location, which might represent aggregated and inactive protein in aggresomes <xref rid="pone.0022595-Wigley1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Transgenic overexpression of tankyrase does not result in centrosomal puncta (<xref rid="pone.0022595-DeRycker1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022595-Sbodio1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and data not shown) however, interestingly, a tankyrase small-molecule inhibitor induced a similar stabilization and relocalization of tankyrase protein, indicating that PARsylation and ubiquitylation act together to maintain both proteasomal degradation and cytoplasmic localization of tankyrase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Since RNF146 seems to be localized to centrosomes, as well as the cytoplasm, this may be a site of tankyrase ubiquitylation and degradation, as it can be for misfolded proteins <xref rid="pone.0022595-Wigley1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>

      <p>RNF146 protein is reciprocally destabilized by tankyrase activity, indicating that PARsylation and ubiquitylation target all three proteins in the RNF146-tankyrase-Axin complex to the proteasome for degradation. Since tankyrase inhibition prevents Axin ubiquitylation <xref rid="pone.0022595-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, PARsylation seems to be a signal for subsequent ubiquitylation, as has been proposed for proteasomal degradation of tankyrase substrate TRF1 <xref rid="pone.0022595-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and tankyrase itself <xref rid="pone.0022595-Yeh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Indeed, purified PAR stimulates RNF146 auto-ubiquitylation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
      <p>During the preparation of this manuscript, Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. reported an independent identification of RNF146 as a regulator or Wnt signaling <xref rid="pone.0022595-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Consistent with our findings, Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. propose that RNF146 ubiquitylates Axin that has been PARsylated by tankyrase to target Axin for proteasomal degradation. We significantly expand the mechanistic understanding of this branch of the pathway to include: (1) RNF146 regulation of tankyrase ubiquitylation, protein stability, and subcellular localization; (2) tankyrase regulation of RNF146 degradation; (3) polyubiquitin linkage types specified by RNF146 on tankyrase, Axin, and itself; (4) RNF146 regulation of autocrine Wnt signaling in teratocarcinoma cells, but not signaling activated by APC or Î²-catenin mutation in multiple colorectal cancer cell lines; and (5) specificity of RNF146 for ubiquitylating and regulating tankyrases and not the related PARP1 protein.</p>
      <p>We show that RNF146 can operate as a single-subunit RING-type E3 catalyzing both ubiquitin-substrate ligation and ubiquitin chain elongation in combination with E1 and E2 enzymes <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that the RING domain is required for function <italic>in vivo</italic>. RNF146 directs the ubiquitylation of tankyrase, Axin, and itself, and the polyubiquitin chains specified are of multiple or mixed linkage types, containing at least K48 and K63 linkages. These different linkage types are consistent with RNF146 controlling both the proteasomal degradation and subcellular localization of tankyrase. We also identified the HECT-type ubiquitin E3 ligase HUWE1 (also known as ARF-BP1 or MULE) as a RNF146 interacting protein that depends on the RING domain of RNF146 for binding and seems to associate with polyubiquitylated RNF146. This suggests that HUWE1 may function as an E4 enzyme in ubiquitin chain elongation for RNF146 substrates. Interestingly, HUWE1 contains a putative ubiquitin-binding UBA domain and a WWE domain.</p>
      <p>While RNF146 RNAi can inhibit autocrine Wnt signaling in teratocarcinoma cells and also stabilize tankyrase proteins in colorectal cancer cells with APC mutation-driven signaling, we find that RNF146 knockdown does not significantly affect Wnt signaling or Axin protein stabilization in the colorectal cell lines tested. In HCT-15 cells, tankyrase RNAi or small-molecule inhibitors increase Axin levels and partially block signaling, suggesting that there may be a functionally redundant ligase in some cell types. While there are other predicted E3s in the human genome with WWE domains, we find no clear RNF146 paralog. Testing combination RNAi of RNF146 and HUWE1 in colorectal cancer cells may be informative.</p>
      <p>RNF146 can also bind PARP1 and PARP2, although apparently with lower affinity than for tankyrase association. PARP1 protein levels are not affected by RNF146 and, since PARP1 protein is localized to the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0022595-Cipriani1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> whereas RNF146 protein is cytoplasmic, RNF146 may not mediate degradation of all PARP family members or of all PARsylated proteins. It will be important to further define the specificity of RNF146 in regulating the activity of different PARP enzymes, as well as to determine whether the other functions of tankyrases in different subcellular locations, such as telomere elongation, are regulated by RNF146.</p>
      <p>The function of RNF146 in mouse development or human disease is currently unknown. The chromosomal region of RNF146 has been linked to breast cancer risk in a Jewish Ashkenazi population, although no mutations in the protein coding region have been identified <xref rid="pone.0022595-Kirchhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022595-Menachem1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. While RNF146 is expressed in all human tissues examined in one study, expression was upregulated in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients <xref rid="pone.0022595-vonRotz1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. It will be interesting to specifically investigate a role for RNF146 in Wnt-dependent developmental and disease processes once mouse knockout strains have been generated.</p>

HA-tagged wildtype and ÎRING RNF146 proteins expressed in HEK293 cells were isolated from 3.5 mg of cell lysate with anti-HA 3F10 affinity matrix (Roche). Affinity purified proteins were concentrated, reduced in sample buffer (Sigma) at 90Â°C for 5 min, and alkylated in 0.176 M n-iospropyl iodoacetamide at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were then separated by 4â20% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and gel bands were excised (spanning the entire gel lanes for GST affinity purifications), destained, and dehydrated as previously described <xref rid="pone.0022595-Phu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega) in ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 overnight at 37Â°C. Peptides were extracted from the gel slices, dried, and subsequently reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid.</p>
        <p>Samples were injected onto a 100 ÂµMÃ100 mm column (BEH, 1.7 ÂµM, Waters Corp) at a flow rate of 1 ÂµL/min using a NanoAcquity UPLC (Waters Corp) and peptides introduced into a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher) via nanospray ionization, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0022595-Phu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Data was collected in data-dependent mode with the parent ion being analyzed in the FTMS and the top 8 most abundant ions being selected for fragmentation and analysis in the LTQ. Tandem mass spectrometric data was analyzed using the Mascot search algorithm (Matrix Sciences). For examining polyubiquitin linkages, the peak areas for ubiquitin -GG signature peptides were extracted within a 10 ppm window using a label free approach <xref rid="pone.0022595-Phu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>

        <p>HEK293T cells integrated with RNF146 miRNA expression construct were seeded in chamber slides and induced for RNAi with 2 Âµg/ml doxycycline for 48 h, or treated with DMSO or 5 ÂµM XAV939 for 16 h. Cells were fixed directly in culture medium with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.075% saponin, then washed and permeabilized with 0.5% Saponin in Dulbecco's PBS. Rabbit anti-TNKS H-350 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse anti-Î³-tubulin GTU-88 (Abcam) antibodies were used for subcellular localization studies. Mouse monoclonal anti-tankyrase 6D790 and BL-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were used for co-localization studies with rabbit monoclonal anti-RNF146 antibody (described above). Secondary detection was with highly cross-adsorbed goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to either ALEXA 488 or ALEXA 555. Slides with coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold containing 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). Images were captured with a Zeiss MRm camera mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M equipped with the ApoTome system. Optical sections were acquired with Axiovision software V4.8.2, and slices were summed using ImageJ (NIH) and combined using Adobe Photoshop Software. For weak tankyrase staining (inset image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022595-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) the brightness was adjusted using the auto levels setting without changing the gamma level.</p>
