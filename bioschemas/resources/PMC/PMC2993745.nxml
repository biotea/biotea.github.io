      <abstract>
        <p>The endocytic and autophagic pathways are involved in the membrane trafficking of exogenous and endogenous materials to lysosomes. However, the mechanisms that regulate these pathways are largely unknown. We previously reported that Rubicon, a Beclin 1âbinding protein, negatively regulates both the autophagic and endocytic pathways by unidentified mechanisms. In this study, we performed database searches to identify potential Rubicon homologues that share the common C-terminal domain, termed the RH domain. One of them, <italic>PLEKHM1</italic>, the causative gene of osteopetrosis, also suppresses endocytic transport but not autophagosome maturation. Rubicon and PLEKHM1 specifically and directly interact with Rab7 via their RH domain, and this interaction is critical for their function. Furthermore, we show that Rubicon but not PLEKHM1 uniquely regulates membrane trafficking via simultaneously binding both Rab7 and PI3-kinase.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Endocytosis involves the intracellular transport of extracellular and plasma membrane substrates to endosomes/lysosomes and is involved in many physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Mukherjee <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Autophagy is also a process in which cytoplasmic constituents, including organelles, are transported within double-membraned autophagosomes to lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Xie and Klionsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Yoshimori and Noda, 2008</xref>). Autophagy has divergent physiological roles in cancer, infection, immunity, and other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mizushima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Many reports suggest there is a common element between the endosomal and autophagic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Simonsen and Tooze, 2009</xref>), but these commonalities have not been fully elucidated.</p><p>Recently, two groups identified an interesting protein, Rubicon, that may link these two pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Matsunaga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Rubicon was identified as a protein that binds to Beclin 1, a tumor suppressor protein and mammalian homologue of the yeast autophagy protein Atg6/Vps30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kihara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>a). Yeast Atg6/Vps30 facilitates two distinctive processes: autophagy and retrograde traffic from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus by two different phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) complexes: class I (Atg14, Atg6, Vps34, Vps15) and class II (Atg38, Atg6, Vps34, Vps15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kihara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001b</xref>). Mammalian Beclin 1 has a similar, albeit distinct, complex organization. One complex consists of Beclin 1, hAtg14L/Atg14/Barkor, hVps34, and p150/hVps15 and acts in autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Itakura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Matsunaga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Another complex contains Beclin 1, UVRAG, hVps34, and p150/hVps15 and functions in the endocytic pathway and autophagosomeâlysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Itakura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). A third Beclin 1 complex includes Rubicon and the UVRAG complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Matsunaga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Knockdown of Rubicon enhances endocytic transport and autophagosomeâlysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Matsunaga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In addition, autophagy is induced even in the absence of nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Matsunaga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Thus, the third complex negatively regulates both the endocytic and autophagic pathways. A Rubicon homologue has not been identified in yeast, suggesting that this potential complex regulatory mechanism is specific to higher eukaryotes. However, it is unclear how Rubicon regulates membrane traffic.</p><p>To further determine the function of Rubicon, we searched mammalian gene databases for Rubicon homologues. As a result, we identified PLEKHM1, which also contains an RH domain and is reportedly a causative gene for osteopetrosis due to mutations, but the mechanisms remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Van Wesenbeeck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Rubicon and PLEKHM1 share a common C-terminal domain, which we termed the RH (Rubicon homologous) domain. Here, we show that the RH domains of Rubicon and PLEKHM1 specifically interact with Rab7, a Rab GTPase that localizes to the late endosome/lysosome. These interactions are necessary for their functions in the endocytic pathway. In addition to binding to Rab7, Rubicon, but not PLEKHM1, also associates with the Beclin 1âPI3-kinase complex. Synchronous associations of Rubicon with the Beclin 1-PI3-kinase complex and Rab7 are necessary to regulate the endocytic and autophagic pathways. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate membrane trafficking toward lysosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells and Transfections</title><p>HeLa, MCF7, human embryonic kidney (HEK)293A, and A549 cells were cultured in DMEM D6546 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37Â°C.

Briefly, to prepare the inactive and active forms of GST-Rab7 by nucleotide exchange, buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mM DTT, 25 mM EDTA, and 12.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) containing 20 Î¼M GDP or GTPÎ³S and buffer 2 (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.6% CHAPS) containing GST-Rab7 were mixed and incubated for 10 min at 30Â°C. Subsequently, MgCl<sub>2</sub> at a final concentration of 10 mM was added to this mixture to stabilize the nucleotides. GDP- or GTPÎ³S-loaded GST-Rab7 was incubated with glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Heathcare Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ) for 1 h at 4Â°C and washed three times with buffer 3 (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.3% CHAPS) and once with buffer 4 (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Next, recombinant PLEKHM1 or Rubicon was added to the GST-Rab7 beads and incubated for 2 h at 4Â°C. Then, the beads were washed three times with buffer 4 and eluted with SDS-sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot Analysis</title><p>Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped, collected by centrifuging at 4Â°C, and then lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 10 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C, and the supernatants were collected. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 3% skim milk in 0.1% Tween-20/TBS and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies. When either the anti-PLEKHM1 antibody or anti-Rubicon antibody was used, the membranes were incubated in Can Get Signal Solution I (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 4Â°C. Immunoreactive bands were detected using horseradish peroxidaseâconjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and luminol solution (ECL plus; GE Healthcare Bioscience).</p></sec><sec><title>Adenoviral Overexpression System</title><p>3xFLAG-hPLEKHM1 was subcloned into the pENTR-1A plasmid (Invitrogen). The cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen) using the Gateway system with LR clonase (Invitrogen). Recombinant adenovirus was prepared with the ViraPower Adenovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adenovirus infections were performed as follows. One day before infection, â¼2 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded into six-well plates and incubated overnight at 37Â°C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. The medium was then replaced with 2 ml of culture medium containing recombinant adenoviruses. After a 12-h incubation, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of culture medium. At 48 h after infection, the cells were used for experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Adenovirus Small Hairpin RNA Expression System</title><p>hPLEKHM1 or hRubicon was knocked down using an adenovirus vector-based shRNA. The RNAi oligonucleotide sequences for hRubicon and GL2 luciferase (negative control) were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Matsunaga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The target sequences for hPLEKHM1 were chosen using the siDirect algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://design.rnai.jp">http://design.rnai.jp</ext-link>) and are located at base pairs 909â931 (5â²-CCGGTCTCTGCAAGAGGTATTGT-3â²). Oligonucleotides pairs were designed from these target sequences based on the Block-iT U6 RNAi Entry Vector Kit (Invitrogen). These pairs were annealed, ligated into the pENTR/U6 vector (Invitrogen), and transferred into the pAd/BLOCL-iT DEST vector (Invitrogen) through an LR recombination reaction (Invitrogen). The recombinant adenovirus was generated using ViraPower Adenoviral technology (Invitrogen). For knockdown analysis, subconfluent A549 cells in 35-mm dishes were infected with adenovirus and transferred to 60-mm dishes after 12 h. After an additional 24 h, the cells were reinfected with the virus. The medium was changed after an additional 12 h.

Furthermore, PLEKHM1 specifically interacted with Rab7 through its RH domain (Supplementary Figure S1A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

However, the mechanisms underlying this causative link have not been elucidated. Moreover, although PLEKHM1 is ubiquitously expressed, its role in other cell types is also unknown. The ability of PLEKHM1 to bind to Rab7, as shown in this study, and to colocalize with late endosomal/lysosomal markers, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Van Wesenbeeck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), suggest that PLEKHM1 functions in the endocytic pathway.</p><p>To determine the role of PLEKHM1 in the endocytic pathway, we first examined the effects of PLEKHM1 overexpression on the degradation of EGFR.

Next, we examined the integrity of the endocytic pathway.

Lysotracker staining showed that the endosomes in PLEKHM1-overexpressing cells were acidic, which suggests that the effects of overexpression on the transport of cargo proteins were not due to increased endosomal/lysosomal pH (Supplementary Figure S3A).

The steady-state EGFR levels were significantly decreased to 40â50% of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), and this decrease was largely due to lysosomal degradation because lysosomal protease inhibitors blocked this decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, C and D).

In contrast, GFP-LC3 colocalized to LAMP1-labeled lysosomes in PLEKHM1-overexpressing cells, suggesting that PLEKHM1 does not affect fusion (Supplementary Figure S3B). To further verify this finding, we examined the effects on PLEKHM1 knockdown on autophagy flux. First, we performed a tfLC3 (GFP-mRFP-LC3) assay in which the ratio of the number of red dots to that of green/red dots represents the efficiency of autophagosomeâlysosome fusion in tfLC3-expressing cells. There were no differences in the ratio between the control and PLEKHM1 knockdown cells (Supplementary Figure S5, A and B). Next, we monitored LC3 flux by immunoblotting. As shown in Supplementary Figure S5, C and D, the increase in the amount of LC3 after treating with protease inhibitors was slightly larger in PLEKHM1 knockdown cells than in control cells, but this difference was significantly smaller compared with Rubicon knockdown cells.

Therefore, we next examined the relationship between the ability of Rubicon to bind to Beclin 1 and to Rab7. First, we determined that neither the Rab7 dominant-negative nor -active mutant affects the interaction between Rubicon and Beclin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Second, we showed that the Rubicon (CGHL) mutants could also bind to Beclin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). These data demonstrate that the interaction with Rab7 is not required for the RubiconâBeclin 1 association. Third, we examined whether Rab7 interacts with Rubicon in the Beclin 1 complex or only with free Rubicon. Pulldown assays with FLAG-Rab7 successfully coprecipitated endogenous Rubicon together with Beclin 1, p150 (hVps15) and hVps34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, B and C).

When the sequence corresponding to this Beclin 1âassociating domain (BA domain) was overexpressed in cells, endogenous Rubicon did not coimmunoprecipitate with Beclin 1, probably due to competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of the BA domain impaired the coimmunoprecipitation of Beclin 1 with Rab7, although it did not affect the ability of Rubicon to bind to Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, A and B). Therefore, Rab7 appears to be the only available binding partner for endogenous Rubicon in cells that overexpress the BA domain. In these cells, EGFR degradation and autophagy are significantly accelerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, C and D; Supplementary Figure S10), similar to previously reported Rubicon knockdown phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Matsunaga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).

Rubicon and PLEKHM1 negatively regulate endosomal transport by binding to Rab7 via their RH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>E). Furthermore, this study provides novel insight into the function of PLEKHM1. These two RH domainâcontaining proteins also have several significant differences. Rubicon must bind to the Beclin 1âPI3-kinase complex in addition to Rab7 for its function, whereas PLEKHM1 only requires Rab7 binding. Rubicon, unlike PLEKHM1, is involved in autophagosome maturation. Both of these proteins localize to endosomes but do not show complete colocalization. Therefore, these two RH domain proteins seem to function through different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>E).</p><p>PLEKHM1 bound not only to wild-type Rab7 and the Rab7QL mutant but also to the Rab7TN mutant in a yeast two-hybrid assay and immunoprecipitation analyses in mammalian cells, suggesting that PLEKHM1 may bind to both the GTP-bound and GDP-bound forms of Rab7. However, the TN mutant is predicted to have reduced affinity for both GDP and GTP and may behave as a nucleotide-free Rab7 depending on the assay conditions. Hence, in order to determine the precise nucleotide dependence, we performed an in vitro GST pulldown assay and found that recombinant PLEKHM1 strongly interacted with GTPÎ³S-loaded Rab7 but only minimally interacted with GDP-loaded Rab7. The data convincingly confirm that PLEKHM1 preferentially binds to the GTP-bound form of Rab7, corroborating our hypothesis that PLEKHM1, like Rubicon, is a Rab7 effector.</p><p>The structure of the RH domain appears to be important for the recognition of Rab7. Point mutations at cysteine residues in the RH domain abrogate the interaction with Rab7, similar to the relationship between Rab3a and its effector Rabphilin3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Stahl <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). The Rab3a-binding site in Rabphilin3a has an architecture that is similar to the RH domain in Rubicon, including a long-Î±-helix-zinc fingerâshort-Î±-helix, in which both the long and short Î±-helices interact with Rab3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Ostermeier and Brunger, 1999</xref>). A mutation in the zinc finger of Rabphilin3a disrupts this configuration and abolishes Rab3a binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Stahl <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Likewise, the RH domain structure may be important for binding with Rab7.</p><p>How do Rubicon and PLEKHM1 negatively regulate EGF and its receptor transport to lysosomes? It was recently determined that Rab7 catalyzes retrograde trafficking from the endosomes to the Golgi apparatus by interacting with a retromer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Rojas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Seaman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Likewise, Rab7 may positively act in the retrieval pathway of EGFR to the plasma membrane. When Rubicon and PLEKHM1 are knocked down, retrieval trafficking to the plasma membrane may be impaired, leading to enhanced trafficking to the lysosomes. Alternatively, Rubicon and PLEKHM1 may compete with other Rab7 effectors that positively function in transport to the lysosomes. The adenovirus protein RIDÎ±, which functionally mimics Rab7 and can directly bind to the Rab7 effectors RILP and ORP1L, enhances the lysosomal degradation of EGFR even at a resting state in the absence of EGF activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Shah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Rab7 functions in many cell types, including osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Given its ubiquitous expression pattern, PLEKHM1 also likely functions as a universal effector of Rab7.</p><p>Previously, it was shown that Rab7 associates with hVps34 and p150 (hVps15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Stein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Cao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that Rubicon mediates this interaction. Notably, the function of Rubicon in the endocytic and autophagic pathways requires binding to both Rab7 and the Beclin 1âPI3-kinase complex. This unique feature may allow Rubicon to control these two membrane trafficking pathways, although its exact function remains unclear. One possibility is that synchronized suppression of these two positive regulators during membrane trafficking guarantees that transport can be stopped at a certain step. Rubicon may also facilitate the recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane through Rab7 and increments of local PI3P (or anchoring PI3-kinase to endosomes by binding to Rab7), causing a secondary reduction in the transport to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Matsunaga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This scenario is analogous to earlier findings that retromer-mediated retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus is PI3P-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Burda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, recycling of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, EGFR, and transferrin receptor is mediated by PI3P-binding protein, SNX1, SNX4, and SNX16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Kurten <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Carlton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Choi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Traer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). A previous report demonstrated that UVRAG, a component of the Beclin 1 complex, binds to the HOPS complex that has GEF activity toward Rab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Therefore, Rubicon may terminate Rab7-dependent processes by modulating UVRAG in the Beclin 1 complex, and this hypothesis is supported by findings that the phenotype of the endocytic pathway in Rubicon knockdown cells is the exact opposite of the UVRAG knockdown phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Matsunaga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Together, our present study provides new insights into the regulation of the endocytic/autophagic pathway. We not only identified new Rab7 effectors but also discovered a direct connection between two key players in membrane traffic, a Rab protein and PI3-kinase. Rab7 and PI3-kinase function at specific stages in a concerted manner through Rubicon.</p></sec>
