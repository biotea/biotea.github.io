      <abstract>
        <p>PICT-1 was originally identified as a tumor suppressor. Here, we found that PICT-1 overexpression triggered pro-death autophagy without nucleolar disruption or p53 accumulation in U251 and MCF7 cells. Truncated PICT-1 fragments 181-346 and 1-346, which partly or totally lack nucleolar localization, showed weaker autophagy-inducing effects than full-length PICT-1 and a well-defined nucleolar mutant (181-479). Furthermore, PICT-1 partly localizes to the nucleolar fibrillar center (FC) and directly binds to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene loci, where it interacts with upstream binding factor (UBF). Overexpression of PICT-1 or the 181-479 mutant, but not the 1-346 or 181-346 mutants, markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of UBF and the recruitment of rRNA polymerase I (Pol I) to the rDNA promoter in response to serum stimulation, thereby suppressing rRNA transcription, suggesting that rRNA transcription inhibition might be an important contributor to PICT-1-induced autophagy. This is supported by the finding that CX-5461, a specific Pol I inhibitor, also induced autophagy. In addition, both CX-5461 and PICT-1, but not the 1-346 or 181-346 mutants, significantly suppressed the activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. Our data show that PICT-1 triggers pro-death autophagy through inhibition of rRNA transcription and the inactivation of AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, independent of nucleolar disruption and p53 activation.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The human âprotein interacting with carboxyl terminus 1â (PICT-1), also known as human glioma tumor suppressor candidate region 2 gene product (GLTSCR2), was originally identified as a 60 kDa (p60) interacting partner of two viral proteins, ICP0 and ICP22 [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. PICT-1 is located in the 1.4 Mb putative tumor suppressor locus of human chromosome 19q, a genetic region which is frequently altered in human tumors, particularly gliomas [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PICT-1 is considered to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene, as its diminished expression or loss is correlated with the highly malignant progression of several cancers [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In support of this hypothesis, research has shown that knockdown of PICT-1 promoted anchorage-independent tumor cell growth and decreased susceptibility to apoptotic cell death in response to apoptosis-inducing stimuli, whereas overexpression of PICT-1 significantly inhibited anchorage-independent tumor cell growth and induced mitochondria-independent cell death [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in these phenomena showed that PICT-1 can regulate the phosphorylation and thus the stability of the well-known tumor suppressor PTEN by direct interaction, indicating that the anti-cancer function of PICT-1 is mediated at least partly through its inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>However, the roles and signaling mechanisms of PICT-1 in healthy and cancer cells are not yet fully understood. For example, previous research has shown that PTEN-mediated cell death is a caspase- and mitochondria-dependent pathway involving p53 activation, in contrast to PICT-1-induced caspase- and mitochondrial-independent cell death, which does not require p53 activation [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, PICT-1 has recently been shown to preferentially localize to the nucleolus [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], suggesting that it may exert an important role in nucleolar function. The nucleolus is best known as a site of rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis, but accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the nucleolus also participates in a diverse array of cell functions such as stress response, the cell cycle, aging processes, cell death, and several human diseases [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation system that facilitates the breakdown of intracellular proteins and organelles. Autophagy is traditionally considered to be a protective mechanism, important for the removal of damaged proteins and organelles and conferring stress tolerance and enhancing cell viability under adverse conditions [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the functional role of autophagy in cell fate remains a contentious subject, with some research supporting the controversial view that autophagy can also serve as a pro-death pathway rather than a pro-survival mechanism under specific conditions [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several recent studies suggest that the nucleolus has a close relationship to autophagic processes. Firstly, a number of cell stressors have been found to induce both nucleolar dysfunction and autophagy [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Secondly, autophagy-related signalling molecules can also regulate ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription and ribosomal biogenesis [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thirdly, and most importantly, knockdown of TIF-IA, which is an essential initiation factor required for rRNA transcription, and POLR1A, a catalytic subunit of rRNA polymerase I (Pol I), induces both nucleolar disruption and the formation of autophagic vesicles, suggesting that these processes are closely associated [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Still, much remains to be discovered about which type of autophagy is induced by nucleolar dysfunction and how about the precise molecular mechanism.</p>
      <p>In the present investigation, we found that overexpression of PICT-1 induces Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway-related pro-death autophagy, without nucleolar disruption or p53 activation. Furthermore, the pro-autophagy effects of PICT-1 overexpression are implicated in its nuclear localization and its rDNA transcription inhibition function. Therefore, our evidence suggests that PICT-1 is a potent regulator of ribosome biogenesis and nucleolus-related autophagy formation.</p>

        <title>The overexpression of PICT-1 induces autophagy formation in cancer cell lines</title>
        <p>Previous research has shown that PICT-1 protein is localized to the nucleolus. However, its nucleolar function and molecular mechanisms of action are still not fully understood. Autophagy is classically considered as a âself-eatingâ process in which a portion of the cytoplasm is sequestered within autophagosomes. The autophagosomes are then delivered to the lysosome, where their cargoes are broken down and the resulting amino acids are made available for reuse by the cell. Autophagy is therefore closely related to protein metabolism and various nutrient limitations [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The nucelolus is the site of ribosome biogenesis, and has been implicated in regulating protein metabolism. In order to investigate whether the nucleolar protein PICT-1 is involved in autophagy, human glioblastoma U251 cells were co-transfected with PICT-1 and GFP-LC3 plasmids, and GFP-LC3 localization was then examined by confocal microscopy. Previous studies reported that LC3-I can be converted to LC3-II during the autophagic process, which promotes the translocation of LC3-II into autophagic vesicles [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For this reason the presence of LC3-II in autophagic vesicles and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II can be used as markers of the induction of autophagy. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, the number of autophagic vesicles displaying a punctate staining pattern for GFP-LC3-II was significantly increased in PICT-1-overexpressing U251 cells in a time-dependent manner compared with control cells. Additionally, the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I was significantly increased in U251 cells transfected with the PICT-1 plasmid in a time-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The protein levels of another two autophagy-related markers Beclin 1 and p62 were also determined by Western blot. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, PICT-1 overexpression significantly increased the level of Beclin 1, but decreased the level of p62. Similar results were observed in MCF7 breast cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). To further confirm these results, U251 cells overexpressing PICT-1 were treated with two autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 10 mM) and bafilomycin (BAF, 100 nM), which are known to inhibit the initiation of autophagosome and the fusion of autophagosome with lysosome, respectively. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>, 3-MA blocked the formation of GFP-LC3 autophagic vesicles induced by PICT-1 overexpression. In contrast, BAF enhanced formation of the punctate LC3. Collectively, these data suggest that PICT-1 overexpression indeed significantly induced autophagy in cancer cells.</p>

        <title>The ability of PICT-1 to induce autophagy is related to its nucleolar localization</title>
        <p>Previous research has identified two classical nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) and a non-classical, unique nucleolar localization sequences (NoLS) on PICT-1 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Based on these findings, we constructed PICT-1 truncation mutants of amino acid (aa) 1-346 (containing the amino-terminal NLS), aa 181-346 (deleting the two NLSs), and aa 181-479 (containing the carboxyl-terminal NLS and the non-classical NoLS) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In agreement with previous reports, we found that both full-length PICT-1 and the 181â479 fragment had a definite pattern of nucleolar localization in MCF7 cells. In contrast, the 181â346 mutant was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Although the 1-346 fragments primarily exhibited nucleolar globular expression, we also observed some diffuse distribution throughout the nucleus. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, the number of autophagic vesicles in cells expressing full-length PICT-1 or the 181â479 fragment was significantly greater than in the cells expressing the 1-346 mutant protein. In contrast, cells expressing the 181-346 fragment had the least number of GFP-LC3-II-positive autophagic vesicles. Western blotting also showed that the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I is significantly higher in cells with full-length PICT-1 or 181â479 overexpression than in cells overexpressing either the 1-346 or 181-346 fragments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). These data indicate that the ability of PICT-1 to induce autophagy depends on its localization to the nucleolus.</p>

        <title>PICT-1 inhibits the transcription of rDNA and proliferation of U251 cells</title>
        <p>The nucleolus is classically considered to be the site of ribosome biogenesis, which includes rDNA transcription, nascent rRNA processing, and the assembly of ribosomal subunits. The ultrastructure of the nucleolus when visualized by electron microscopy is composed of fibrillar centers (FC), dense fibrillar components (DFC), and granular components (GC) [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Transcription of the rDNA gene repeats by Pol I occurs mainly at the border between the FC and DFC, the processing of nascent rRNA occurs largely in the DFC region, while the GC region consists of proteins that are necessary to complete the assembly of ribosomal subunits. Generally, the functions of nucleolar proteins are related to their sub-nucleolar localization. To begin to explore the role of PICT-1 in the nucleolus, the co-localization of PICT-1 with two different sub-nucleolar markers was investigated using confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, PICT-1 shows no co-localization with the GC region marker nucleolin [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], whereas PICT-1 partly co-localizes with the FC marker RPA194 (a subunit of Pol I) in MCF7 cells [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], indicating that PICT-1 might participate in the regulation of rDNA transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p>

        <p>The initial transcriptional product of rDNA is known as 47S pre-rRNA. Processing of rRNA in mammalian cells includes a series of cleavages of the primary 47s transcript and results in producing several intermediate rRNAs, such as 45S, 41S and 36S rRNA, and three mature rRNAs: 18s, 28s and 5.8s (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Because the 5â² external transcribed spacer (5â²-ETS) can be rapidly cleaved from pre-rRNA, the level of 5â²-ETS can be used to assay the rate of rDNA transcription. To investigate the effect of PICT-1 on pre-rRNA transcription, U251 cells were transfected with FLAG-PICT-1 or control plasmid for 48 h, and the amount of 47S, 45S and 41S rRNA was quantified by qPCR using primers described by previous reports [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, both 47S, 45S and 41S pre-rRNA levels were significantly lower in cells transfected with PICT-1 compared with cells transfected with control plasmid, which suggested that PICT-1 overexpression significantly suppresses the transcription of the rDNA gene. Furthermore, U251 cells were transfected with full-length PICT-1 or one of its three truncation mutants and the amount of 47S pre-rRNA was quantified by qPCR. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, a marked decrease in pre-rRNA levels was observed in cells transfected with full-length PICT-1 compared with cells transfected with control plasmid, suggesting that PICT-1 overexpression significantly suppressed the transcription of the rDNA gene. The 181-479 mutant protein had an inhibitory effect on rDNA transcription similar to that of full-length PICT-1, whereas the 1-346 and 181-346 fragments more weakly inhibited rDNA transcription than full-length PICT-1 or the 181-479 mutant.</p>
        <p>To further confirm this inhibitory effect of PICT-1 on rDNA transcription, a pHrD-IRES-Luc plasmid [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] containing the human rRNA promoter sequence was co-transfected into U251 cells together with PICT-1 mutant plasmids, and luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. Similar to the qPCR results, full-length PICT-1 and the 181-479 mutant showed a greater inhibitory effect on rRNA promoter activity compared with either the 1-346 or 181-346 mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because ribosome biogenesis is required for cell growth and proliferation [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we next investigated the effect of PICT-1 truncation mutant overexpression on cell proliferation. As expected, both full-length PICT-1 and the 181-479 mutant exhibited a greater inhibitory effect on proliferation of U251 cells than did the 1-346 and 181-346 mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that PICT-1 overexpression inhibits rDNA transcription and cell proliferation, and that this inhibitory effect is related to its nucleolar localization.</p>

        <title>PICT-1 can bind to rDNA gene loci and regulate Pol I transcriptional machinery activity</title>
        <p>To determine whether PICT-1 directly associates with the rDNA gene, we performed ChIP analysis in U251 cells with multiple PCR primer sets targeting the rDNA loci [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, PICT-1 binding on the entire rDNA gene loci was enriched 2- to 6-fold versus IgG controls, suggesting that PICT-1 might participate in the transcriptional regulation of rDNA by directly binding to the rDNA genetic loci. Transcription of rDNA also requires the assembly of Pol I transcriptional machinery, and the activation of upstream binding factor 1 (UBF1) is a key step in the recruitment of RNA polymerase I to the rDNA loci [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Several rDNA-binding proteins have been shown to regulate the activity of Pol I transcriptional machinery through their interactions with these factors [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We used co-immunoprecipitation assays to determine whether PICT-1 associates with the Pol I transcriptional machinery, and found that PICT-1 specifically interacts with UBF1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) but not with RPA194 (Data not shown). It has previously been reported that the phosphorylation of UBF1 at ser388 is required for its activation, and that phosphorylation of UBF1 is significantly increased in response to growth factor stimulation [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To determine whether PICT-1 can affect UBF1 activation, U251 cells transfected with PICT-1 plasmid for 24 h were starved in serum-free DMEM for another 24 h, and then stimulated with 15% serum for the indicated times. The data depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> show that PICT-1 overexpression markedly suppressed UBF1 phosphorylation at ser388 in response to serum stimulation. We also found that the 181-346 mutant, which lacks both NLSs, showed no obvious inhibitory effect on serum-stimulated UBF1 phosphorylation compared with full-length PICT-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Several studies have shown that the phosphorylation and activation of UBF1 are important for the recruitment of the Pol I complex to rDNA loci and the subsequent transcription of rRNA [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our ChIP assay targeting the rDNA promoter region using the RPA194 antibody showed that full-length PICT-1, but not the 181-346 truncation mutant, significantly suppressed the binding of RPA194 to rDNA loci (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that PICT-1 can bind to rDNA genetic loci and interact with UBF1. PICT-1 overexpression inhibits the activation of UBF1 and the recruitment of Pol I to rDNA loci, thereby impacting rDNA transcription.</p>

        <title>PICT-1-induced autophagy involves rRNA transcription inhibition and the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway</title>
        <p>As described above, the overexpression of PICT-1 can inhibit rRNA transcription and induce autophagy in U251 and MCF7 cells. Here, we also investigated the impact of PICT-1 knockdown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) on rRNA biogenesis and autophagy. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and C, we did not observe significant changes in pre-rRNA level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) and activity of rDNA promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) induced by PICT-1 knockdown. Similarly, we did not observe significant changes in expression levels of autophagy-related markers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) as well as induction of autophagy in U251 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). These results further comfirm that inhibition of rRNA transcription might be a key factor for PICT-1 overexpression-induced autophagy. However, the mechanistic relationship between inhibition of rRNA transcription and autophagy is still elusive. To test our hypothesis, CX-5461 was used to selectively inhibit rRNA transcription and autophagy was subsequently investigated. CX-5461 has been found to selectively block rRNA synthesis by inhibiting nucleolar Pol I polymerase, but it does not inhibit mRNA synthesis (Pol II), DNA replication, or protein synthesis [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. To test whether CX-5461 induces autophagy, U251 cells transfected with GFP-LC3 were treated with CX-5461 and autophagic vesicles were quantified. As we predicted, the number of autophagic vesicles was significantly increased in CX-5461-treated cells when compared with untreated cells in both a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, 6B, 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Consistently, CX-5461 treatment induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in LC3-II and Beclin 1 levels, but a decrease in p62 level in U251 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). U251 cells were also treated with CX-5461 (250 nM) in the presence or absence of 3-MA or BAF, and autophagy was analyzed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>, 3-MA inhibited the formation of GFP-LC3 autophagic vesicles induced by CX-5461, while BAF increased the formation of punctate LC3. These results suggest that CX-5461 can induce autophagy in cancer cells.</p>

To investigate whether CX-5461- or PICT-1-induced autophagy involves the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway, we used Western blots to quantify the phosphorylation levels of the associated proteins. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, PICT-1 overexpression significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K in a time-dependent manner. In addition, overexpression of the 181-479 PICT-1 truncation mutant and full-length PICT-1 significantly reduced the levels of phosphorylated Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K compared with the 1-346 and 181-346 mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), indicating that the nucleolar localization and rRNA transcription-inhibiting ability of PICT-1 are important for the inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling. Similarly, CX-5461 treatment also resulted in decreased phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K compared with untreated U251 cells in both a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>).

        <title>The autophagy induced by PICT-1 is a pro-death process without nucleolar disruption and p53 activation</title>

However, the functions of autophagy induced by PICT-1 overexpression in cancer cells are still unclear.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>, 3-MA treatment markedly attenuated the accumulation of GFP-LC3-II-positive autophagic vesicles in PICT-1 overexpressing cells, indicating that 3-MA inhibited the progress of autophagy by blocking autophagosome formation in the early stages of autophagy. Accordingly, nuclear staining by DAPI showed that cell death rates 48 h after PICT-1 plasmid transfection were significantly attenuated by 3-MA treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). These results suggest that the autophagy induced by PICT-1 overexpression is a growth-inhibiting and pro-death process.</p>

        <p>Several investigations have reported that the nucleolus can serve as a stress sensor, and that its disruption can activate p53-mediated cell death when subjected to DNA damage or Pol I transcription inhibitors [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Moreover, p53 activation has been reported to play a role in the induction of autophagy [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To test whether p53 is essential for PICT-1 induced cell death and autophagy, nucleolar integrity and p53 levels were assayed in U251 cells following either actinomycin D (ActD) treatment or PICT-1 overexpression. Previous studies showed that low-dose Act D can specifically inhibits RNA polymerase I but not RNA polymerase II [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Here, the 47S pre-rRNA and c-myc mRNA were served as Pol I transcript and Pol II transcript, respectively. Both 47S pre-rRNA and c-Myc mRNA are short-lived RNA transcripts (half-lives 20~30 minutes) and have been used for markers to evaluate the Pol I- and Pol II-driven efficiency. In agreement with previous reports [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], treatment with low-dose Act D (5 nM) specifically inhibited RNA polymerase I but not RNA polymerase II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>) caused p53 accumulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>, lower panel) concomitant with nucleolar disruption, as shown by translocation of the nucleolar marker protein nucleolin from nucleolus to nucleoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>, upper panel). However, p53 levels showed no significant increase at 24 h and 48 h after pFLAG-CMrV2-PICT-1 transfection compared with control plasmid transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>, lower panel). In addition, confocal microscopy showed that PICT-1 overexpression did not obviously affect nucleolar structure or integrity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>, upper panel). These results indicate that PICT-1-induced autophagy is a pro-death form of autophagy, which does not involve nucleolar disruption and p53 activation. Furthermore, we performed the experiments in p53-null H1299 lung cancer cell line. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref>, PICT-1 overexpression significantly increased the accumulation of GFP-LC3-II-positive autophagic vesicles in H1299 cells. Accordingly, cell death rates 48 h after PICT-1 plasmid transfection were also significantly increased by PICT-1 overexpression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8G</xref>). In addition, confocal microscopy showed that PICT-1 overexpression did not obviously affect nucleolar structure or integrity of H H1299 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8H</xref>). These results further proved that PICT-1-induced autophagy is a pro-death form of autophagy, which does not involve nucleolar disruption and p53 activation.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The nucleolus is the ribosome factory of the cell, where 47S precursor ribosomal RNAs are transcribed, cleaved, processed, and assembled with ribosomal proteins and 5S RNA to form ribosomal subunits [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In fact, ribosome biogenesis is a time- and space-regulated process tightly controlled by the cell cycle and the cellular microenvironment. Many nucleolar proteins have been found to participate in the regulation of rDNA transcription, pre-rRNA processing, and the assembly or transportation of ribosomal subunits. Dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis caused by the mutation of nucleolar regulatory proteins is associated with several human diseases, such as tumor genesis and progression [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>â<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. PICT-1 has frequently been shown to be deleted or altered in human tumors, especially in gliomas [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Previous research showed that overexpression of PICT-1 inhibited proliferation and enhanced cell death of glioma cells by its direct interaction with and stabilization of PTEN. More recent work suggested that PICT-1 might play an important role in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis. In the present study, a ChIP assay showed that PICT-1 binds to rDNA genetic loci and that its overexpression inhibits the activation of UBF1 and the recruitment of Pol I to rDNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), thereby downregulating the transcription of the rDNA gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Further, the 181-346 and 1-346 mutants that totally or partly lack nucleolus localization displayed markedly weaker inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of UBF1 at ser388 and the transcription of the rDNA gene compared with full-length PICT-1 or the nucleolus-localized 181-479 mutant, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of PICT-1 are related to its nucleolar localization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, the particular protein region of PICT-1 that is responsible for its nucleolar functions still need to be identified in the future study.</p>
      <p>In addition to its function as a ribosome factory, the nucleolus has been linked with numerous cellular activities including cell cycle control, development, viral replication, stress responses, senescence, cell death, and tumerogenesis [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. While several recent studies have shown that the nucleolus also plays a role in autophagy [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], this relationship and the molecular mechanisms involved have not been fully characterized. In the present study, we found that PICT-1 overexpression markedly induced the formation of autophagic vesicles and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in both U251 and MCF7 cells, suggesting that PICT-1 overexpression indeed caused autophagy in cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Nevertheless, the 181-346 and 1-346 mutant PICT-1 proteins, which totally or partially lack nucleolar localization and have a weaker inhibitory effect on rDNA transcription, exhibited significantly reduced abilities to induce autophagy in U251 cells, indicating that the blockade of rRNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis might be important causal factors in PICT-1-induced autophagy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This hypothesis was further supported by the finding that CX5461, a specific inhibitor of Pol I polymerase, also significantly increased the induction of autophagy in U251 cells compared with untreated cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). All of these results suggested that blocking ribosome biogenesis can induce autophagy in cancer cells. In fact, the relationship between inhibition of rDNA transcription and autophagy has been preliminarily investigated by several researchers. They have also found that treatment with Pol I inhibitors such as adriamycin (ADR) and actinomycin D (Act D), or with specific siRNAs for the Pol I transcription co-factor TIF-IA and the Pol I catalytic subunit POLR1A, resulted in significant inhibition of Pol-mediated transcription and autophagy [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>â<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, we hypothesized that PICT-1-induced autophagy might be different from autophagy induced by these rRNA transcriptional inhibitors, because disruption of the nucleolar structure is observed in inhibitor-treated cells [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>â<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that nucleolar disruption leads to translocation of many nucleolar proteins from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. These proteins include nucleophosmin, RPS7, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL23 [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], which can cause the accumulation and activation of p53 by associating with MDM2, thus inhibiting MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. More importantly, p53 activation has been implicated in nucleolar stress-induced autophagy [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, nucleolar disruption-induced autophagy might be a mixed result. One possible cause is the inhibition of ribosomal biogenesis, while another is the translocation of nucleolar proteins; however, it is difficult to distinguish their roles in this process. In the present study, we found that PICT-1 overexpression did not obviously affect the integrity of nucleolar structure and p53 expression levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8H</xref>), indicating that the dysregulation of ribosomal biogenesis is the major cause of PICT-1-induced autophagy. In fact, It has been reported that PICT-1 can directly bind 5S rRNA and is required for the integration of 5S RNP into the ribosome [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, our results together with previous report indicated PICT-1 is an essential regulator of ribosome biogenesis, which regulates ribosome biogenesis not only at the stage of pre-rRNA biosynthesis, but also at the stage of ribosomal subunits assembly.</p>
      <p>The mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway plays a key role in the regulation of not only cell survival and proliferation, but also autophagy [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In the present study we demonstrated that both PICT-1 overexpression and CX-5461 treatment inhibit the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K transduction pathway, indicating that autophagy induced by the inhibition of rRNA transcription also regulates the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. However, the mechanism by which AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway activity is modulated by the dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis is still not entirely clear.</p>
      <p>Depending on the particular cell types and cellular stresses involved, autophagy seems to have different roles, either promoting cancer cell survival or triggering cell death. In our investigation, 3-MA treatment markedly enhanced the rate of cell death induced by PICT-1 overexpression, suggesting that PICT-1-induced autophagy is a pro-death rather than a pro-survival process. Thus, our results reveal that besides its PTEN-dependent anti-cancer effects, PICT-1 can also exhibit tumor suppressor function by triggering a pro-death autophagic process which is involves rRNA transcription inhibition and the inactivation of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K transduction pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p>
