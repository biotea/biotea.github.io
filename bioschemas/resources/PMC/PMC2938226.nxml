      <abstract>
        <p>ERAL1, a homologue of Era protein in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, is a member of conserved GTP-binding proteins with RNA-binding activity. Depletion of prokaryotic Era inhibits cell division without affecting chromosome segregation. Previously, we isolated ERAL1 protein as one of proteins which were associated with mitochondrial transcription factor A by using immunoprecipitation. In this study, we analysed the localization and function of ERAL1 in mammalian cells. ERAL1 was localized in mitochondrial matrix and associated with mitoribosomal proteins including the 12S rRNA. siRNA knockdown of ERAL1 decreased mitochondrial translation, caused redistribution of ribosomal small subunits and reduced 12S rRNA. The knockdown of ERAL1 in human HeLa cells elevated mitochondrial superoxide production and slightly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. The knockdown inhibited the growth of HeLa cells with an accumulation of apoptotic cells. These results suggest that ERAL1 is localized in a small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, plays an important role in the small ribosomal constitution, and is also involved in cell viability.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The circular 16.5 kb human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule encodes 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs and 13 proteins of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system responsible for the production of cellular ATP. All the 13 proteins are considered to be essential subunits of a mitochondrial respiratory chain. The 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs, used for constructing mitochondrial translational machineries, are also essential for synthesis of the proteins encoded by mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Given that majority of ATP production depends on the respiratory chain, maintenance of the mitochondrial genome is critical for individuals to maintain normal health. The mitochondrial respiratory chain consists of five complexes, composed of more than 80 structural proteins. The 13 mtDNA-encoded polypeptides are integral parts of four mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (I, III, IV and V). Complex II is an only respiratory chain complex that lacks mtDNA-encoded subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Synthesis of these 13 proteins is carried out on a specialized translational apparatus located in the mitochondrial matrix. Components of the mitochondrial translational machinery (translational factors, elongation factor and mitoribosomes) are considered to generally resemble the bacterial translational machinery and are distinct from those in cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Mitoribosome in mammalian is a 55S particle composed of a small 28S and a large 39S subunit and contains a much higher number of proteins and RNAs than those of the bacterial 70S ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). All of â¼80 mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are the products of nuclear genes and are imported into the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). To assemble the mitochondrial ribosome, the rRNA synthesis by the mitochondrial transcription machinery needs to coordinate with nuclear expression of the mitoribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Several mutations are reported in the nuclear-encoded translation machinery factors such as elongation factor EFG1 and mitochondrial small ribosomal protein (MRPS16 and MRPS22) of patients with autosomal recessive mitochondrial translation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8â11</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian cells contain up to thousands of copies of mtDNA. mtDNAs are organized in nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which was cloned as a transcription factor for mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), has known to be essential for the maintenance of mtDNA. mtDNA molecules are packaged into nucleoids. TFAM may be a main factor for the packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The nucleoids may dynamically change their structure and distribution within mitochondria undergoing fission and fusion and are involved in a variety of dynamic processes including mitochondrial replication, transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Previously, we isolated ERAL1 as a protein associated with TFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Era (<italic>E. coli</italic> Ras-like protein), is an essential GTP-binding protein and exchanges guanine nucleotide rapidly within seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Era leads to accumulation of an unprocessed precursor of the 16S rRNA. It is shown by electron microscopy that Era locates to the cleft between the head and the platform of the 30S small ribosomal subunit. Furthermore, Era makes contacts with the several assembly elements of the 30S small ribosomal subunit. These observations suggest direct involvement of Era in the functional assembly of the 30S small ribosomal subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryote, depletion and mutation of ERA, a chicken homologue of Era, in chicken DT40 cells led to growth impairment, accompanied by an accumulation of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), suggesting that ERA also plays an essential role in eukaryotic cells. The chicken ERA protein regulates the G1 phase progression via an as yet unknown molecular mechanism, in which an RNA recognition domain of ERA protein was shown to be important. However, there are no investigations on its subcellular localization and function at mitochondria in DT40 cells.</p><p>We have previously found that ERAL1, a human orthologue of ERA, is associated with mitochondrial TFAM protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). ERAL1 has a putative N-terminal mitochondria targeting sequence of 59 amino acids. Here, we first show that ERAL1 is localized in the mitochondrial matrix. Then, we sought to figure out the roles of human ERAL1 in mitochondrial functions. We have examined what mitochondrial components are associated with ERAL1 protein. To know the physiological roles of ERAL1 in mitochondria, we have investigated the mitochondrial functions such as mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROSs) production after siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERAL1. Furthermore, we provide evidence that ERAL1 is required for proper assembly of mitochondrial ribosomal subunits and thus important for mitochondrial translation. Interestingly, the siRNA knockdown of ERAL1 led to cell growth retardation. These results suggest that mitochondrial ribosome-associated ERAL1 plays an important role in mitochondrial function as well as viability of human cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibody</title><p>Anti-hemagglutinin (Anti-HA), TFAM, endonuclease G (EndoG), mitochondrial single-stranded binding protein (mtSSB), leucin rich protein 130 (LRP130), elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu), ERAL1 were raised in our own laboratory.

Briefly, 2 Âµl Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was diluted in 100 Âµl Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Next, 20 pmol ERAL1 or control duplex Stealth RNA (Invitrogen) in 100 Âµl Opti-MEM I were added gently and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Oligomer-Oligofectactamine complexes and aliquots of 2 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> HeLa cells in 2 ml culture medium were combined and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.

The DNA fragment encoding ERAL1, a DNA fragment encoding an HA-tag, and a pcDNA5/FRT vector (Invitrogen) were digested with BamHI and NheI and then were ligated. The vector was named pERAL1-HA. We transfected HeLa/FRP/Tet-on cells with the pERAL1-HA vector and selected cells bearing the transgene in the presence of hygromycin B (200 Âµg/ml) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Submitochondrial localization</title><p>HeLa cells (1 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> cells) cultured in 10-cm dishes were scraped off with a cell lifter, suspended in PBS, precipitated by centrifugation and washed with homogenizing buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose and 1 mM EDTA). The cells were then suspended in four volumes of the same buffer, homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer, and centrifuged at 900<italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10 000<italic>g</italic> for 6 min. The pellet was collected as a crude mitochondrial fraction. The crude mitochondria (20 Âµg) were suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4 and 1 mM EDTA) at 4Â°C for disruption of the mitochondrial outer membranes. After the hypotonic treatment, the mitochondria were precipitated by centrifugation at 10 000<italic>g</italic> for 6 min. The mitochondria were resuspended in hypotonic buffer and then digested with proteinase K (200 Âµg/ml) with or without 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 20 min. The protein was precipitated by the addition of 15% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were solubilized in sample buffer (6% SDS, 150 mM Tris base, 10 mM EDTA and 25% glycerol), separated by SDSâPAGE, and analysed by immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies</title><p>Each step was done at 4Â°C or on ice. Doxycyclin-induced HeLa (ERAL1-HA) cells (1 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> cells) were homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in 2 ml of homogenizing buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose and 1 mM EDTA) and centrifuged at 900<italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant (â¼2 ml) was diluted with 2 ml of 20% Percoll buffer [0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA and 20% Percoll (GE healthcare)], and the sample was overlaid on a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (4 ml of 40% and 4 ml of 20% Percoll buffer) in a 12-ml centrifugation tube. After centrifugation at 24 000 r.p.m. for 1 h using a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter), a mitochondrial band located in the middle of the tube was taken. Two to three milligrams of mitochondrial protein were solubilized in 1 ml of IP buffer (10 mM TrisâHCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% BSA and 0.5% NP-40) containing 40 Âµl of beads coated with anti-HA antibodies and control mouse IgG. After 12 h rotation, the beads were washed four times with wash buffer (IP buffer without BSA) and eluted with 1 M glycine (pH 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation after crosslinking</title><p>All procedures were done at 4Â°C or on ice. Two milligrams of mitochondrial protein were suspended in 1 ml of crosslinking buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM HEPESâKOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA and 25 mM NaCl). Then 27 Âµl of 37% formaldehyde or distilled water (as a control) were added and the mixture was kept on ice for 2 h. After incubation, 125 Âµl of 1M glycine was added to quench the crosslinking reaction, and the sample was centrifuged at 10 000<italic>g</italic> for 1 min to precipitate the mitochondria. The mitochondria were solubilized with 100 Âµl of IP buffer containing 1% SDS. After 10-fold dilution with 1 ml of IP buffer, the immunoprecipitation reaction was done as described above. The immunoprecipitates were heated at 95Â°C for 30 min to cleave the crosslinks and the proteins were separated by 12% SDSâPAGE. Bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDSâPAGE and immunoblotted with each antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>In-gel protein digestion and LC-MS/MS</title><p>A CBB-stained band was excised and the protein was digested with Lysyl Endopeptidase (WAKO, Japan) in digestion buffer (100 mM TrisâHCl, pH 9.0, 0.5% SDS and 1 mM EDTA) for 12 h. The supernatant containing the digested peptides was analysed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) (Agilent 1100 Series an LC/MS system). The peptide masses were assigned to the peptide mass databases using the MASCOT program (MATRIX SCIENCE). All proteins in the SWISS-PROT mammalian database were taken into account. The peptide mass error was limited to 1.0 Da and the MS/MS mass error was limited to 0.8 Da. Only one missed cleavage was accepted.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of ROS production</title><p>The intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration was estimated by means of an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe dye, 2â²7â²-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA) (Invitrogen). H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA was deacetylated intracellularly by non-specific esterase, which was further oxidized by cellular peroxides to the fluorescent compound, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). In brief, cells were incubated with the ERAL1- or control siRNA for 72 h. The cells were then washed in PBS and incubated with 20 ÂµM H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA at 37Â°C for 30 min according to the instructions of the manufacturer. DCF fluorescence was detected using a fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) caliber flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, Flanklin Lakes, NJ, USA). For each sample, 10 000 events were collected.

The existence of a 59-amino acid N-terminal mitochondria targeting sequence was predicted by MitoProt II, a prediction program for mitochondrial localization. The probability of mitochondrial localization is 0.9998 for ERAL1. Then, we produced stable cell lines that express the recombinant full length ERAL1 with a C-terminal HA tag (ERAL1-HA) upon induction by doxycycline addition. The recombinant ERAL1-HA was seen only after the induction by doxycycline-addition at 24 and 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). In immunocytochemistry, the ERAL1-HA was granularly stained with anti-HA antibodies after the induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The HA-staining is completely co-localized with the mitochondria visualized with a MitoTracker Red dye, suggesting that the expressed ERAL1 is exclusively localized at mitochondria.

The HeLa cells were separated into Nuclear (Nu), Mitochondrial (Mt), microsomal (Micro) and cytosolic (Cyt) fractions. Calnexin, histoneH1, mtSSB and TFAM were detected by immunoblotting as markers for endoplasmic reticulum, nuclei, mitochondria and mitochondria, respectively. The mitochondrial fraction contained essentially no histoneH1, a nuclear protein, indicating minimal contamination of the mitochondrial fraction by nuclei (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq305/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). ERAL1-HA was found mostly in the mitochondrial fraction as were TFAM and mtSSB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq305/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>, third lane). TFAM was also very weakly detected in the nuclear fraction. Calnexin was detected in the microsomal fraction. These results suggest again that ERAL1 is localized at mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Submitochondrial localization of ERAL1</title><p>Next we examined the submitochondrial localization of ERAL1-HA. The mitochondrial outer membranes were disrupted by hypotonic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lanes 3 and 4) as verified by the observation that EndoG is localized in the intermembrane space (IMS), was completely digested by proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2</xref>, lane 4). BAP37, which is an inner membrane (IM) protein and largely faces the IMS, was digested by proteinase K. On the other hand, TFAM, which localizes in the matrix, was resistant to the proteinase K digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lane 4 in lower panel), indicating that the IMs were intact. Under these hypotonic conditions, ERAL1 was not cleaved by proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lane 4 in upper panel). When the IMs were solubilized with a non-ionic detergent Triton X-100, both TFAM and ERAL1 were cleaved by proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lane 5). Taken together, these results suggest that ERAL1 is localized in the mitochondrial matrix side of IM.

We performed RNA immunoprecipitation assay to test whether ERAL1 protein associates with mitochondrial ribosome including the mitochondrial ribosome RNA or mitochondrial transcripts <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mitochondrial lysates were prepared using immunoprecipitation buffer. After immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies, RNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitates and the eluted mtRNA was used as a template in the RT reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). As a control, total mtRNA was used in the RT reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 5). First, primer pairs covering 12S rRNA were used in the PCR. A PCR product with a predicted size was obtained for 12S mitochondrial rRNA from the mtRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane5) and the mtRNA obtained from the HA-immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 4). There were no PCR products irrespective of the RT reaction when the template was obtained by immunoprecipitation with control IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2). There were also no PCR products without RT from the HA-immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 3), indicating no DNA contamination. Next we investigated whether ERAL1 protein was associated with the other mitochondrial transcripts. We examined 16 PCR primer sets for mitochondrial genes. Only 12S ribosomal RNA was PCR-amplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). These results suggest that ERAL1 is associated with the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit which contained 12S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA or directly associated with 12S rRNA. The latter is likely based on its homology to bacterial Era and chicken ERA.

The LC-MS/MS analysis revealed three mitoribosomal proteins, presumably indicating the presence of ERAL1 in the small (28S) ribosomal subunits. The second group was proteins which were reported to be associated with human mitochondrial nucleoids. There were factors involved in intra-organellar translation, nucleic acid binding proteins and chaperones/proteases, all of which are expected to associate with ribosomal components or nascent peptides. Several polypeptides known to be involved in metabolism were also identified. In non-cross-linked experiments, we observed that ERAL1 was associated with two tRNA synthetase and Stress70 protein. In summary, many proteins related to chaperons and translation machinery were identified by LC-MS/MS.

Consistent with the stronger decrease of the COX II translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), a COX II protein level was decreased at 48 h after the siRNA transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C).</p><p>Next, to see if the overall decrease of the mitochondrial translation was affected by the amounts of mRNAs, we investigated effects of the ERAL1 depletion on expression of the mitochondrially encoded RNAs. The ERAL1-directed siRNA significantly lowered the mRNA levels of 12S rRNA, COX I, COX II and ND5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D), but at most moderately affected the 16S rRNA, ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, cyt b and ND4L transcripts. This relatively stronger decrease of COX II mRNA might contribute in part to the apparent stronger decrease of the COX II translation. The decrease of 12S rRNA might be caused by disassembly of the mitoribosomes as shown later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). It is currently unknown how the other mRNAs was decreased by the ERAL1 depletion.

To further clarify a role of ERAL1 in the mitochondrial translation, we analysed sedimentation profiles in a sucrose density gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The 3-days treatment with the ERAL1 siRNA significantly decreased ERAL1 in a HeLa cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, panels 1 and 2) as well as COX II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, panels 9 and 10) as expected. Either the amounts or distribution profiles of the other proteins were not changed by the ERAL1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Therefore, the same number of fraction may be comparable before and after the ERAL1 depletion.</p><p>ERAL1 largely co-migrated with the small ribosomal subunit proteins (MRPS22 and DAP3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, panels 1, 3 and 5), suggesting that ERAL1 associates with the small subunit of mitochondrial ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The treatment caused a striking change in the distribution of MRPS22, proteins of the small ribosomal subunits. In spite of the decrease of overall amount, MRPS22 became evident also in fractions 11 and 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, compare panels 3 and 4). Thus, the ERAL1 siRNA treatment shifted the distribution of MRPS22 to heavier fractions. These results suggested that ERAL1 is required for proper assembly of mitochondrial ribosomal small subunits. Conversely, MRPL3 protein were distributed within fractions 9â11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, panels 7 and 8) and the distribution of MRPL3 were barely changed by the ERAL1 depletion. Taken together, we consider that the ERAL1 associates with small ribosomal subunit and ERAL1 depletion compromises assembly of the small ribosomal subunit.</p><p>Next, we investigated the sedimentation profile of 12S rRNA (small subunit) and 16S rRNA (large subunit) in the sucrose density gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and D). Quantitative PCR analysis showed that the amount of 12S rRNA at fraction 7â8 was decreased after ERAL1 depletion. However, the abundance of 12S rRNA at fractions 9â10 was not changed even after the ERAL1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). The relative 12S rRNA distribution is consistent with the results of MRPS22 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and C). The distribution and the total amount of 16S rRNA were little changed even after the ERAL1 depletion, suggesting that the ERAL1 depletion did not affect the assembly of the large subunit itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Taken together, we consider that the ERAL1 depletion affected assembly of the small ribosomal subunit.</p></sec><sec><title>ERAL1 siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced MMP</title><p>The ERAL1 siRNA-mediated inhibition of the mitochondrial translation may influence mitochondrial functions. First, we measured mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (ÎÏm) using JC-1 that is a fluorescent dye sensitive to mitochondrial membrane potential. The ÎÏm value of ERAL1 siRNA transfectants was lower than those of normal as well as control siRNA transfected cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq305/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>). carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP)-treated cells served as a positive control for depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane.</p><p>The lower mitochondrial membrane potential in the ERAL1 siRNA-transfected cells was further confirmed by staining with MitoTracker Red, a fluorescent dye accumulating in mitochondria depending on the mitochondrial membrane potential. HeLa cells were transfected with control and ERAL1 siRNAs for 72 h. The cells pre-treated with MitoTracker Red for 20 min were fixed and then TFAM was stained with anti-TFAM antibodies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq305/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). The fluorescence intensity or pattern of TFAM staining was not changed (upper panel), however the ERAL1 siRNA-mediated knockdown cell were significantly weakly stained with MitoTracker Red (center and lower panels, right), suggesting that the ERAL1 depletion reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of ERAL1 increases mitochondrial ROS</title><p>Stress conditions in mitochondria are frequently associated with elevated levels of ROS. A tight link exists between mitochondrial ROS generation and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. In subsequent experiments, therefore, the production of oxidants was tested by a redox-responsive fluorescent dye H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA to examine whether ERAL1 siRNA knockdown led to the generation of ROS. A statistically significant increase in the fluorescence over the control was seen at 72 h after the siRNA transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).

Up to 2 days after siRNA transfection, there was no significant difference in the growth or morphology of the cells between ERAL1 siRNA and control siRNA transfectants. However, the increase in living cells was markedly suppressed at Day 3 in ERAL1 siRNA-treated cells and this was accompanied by an increment in the population of round and dead cells. These results indicate that ERAL1 is important for the normal cell proliferation and its loss affects mitochondrial functions. We cultured the cells in glucose-free media instead supplemented with galactose to force dependence on oxidative phosphorylation. Even in the galactose culture media, the inhibitory effect of ERAL1 depletion on the cell proliferation was little changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, lower panel), raising the possibility that the inhibition of the cell proliferation is not much dependent on the mitochondrial dysfunction.

One of primary roles of ERAL1 may be in the formation of functional ribosomal small subunits and might be involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and associated with the mitochondrial ribosome during the assembly, rRNA folding and RNA modification.</p><p>A direct link between mitochondrial transcription and translation has been demonstrated in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. An amino-terminal domain of mitochondrial RNA polymerase (Rpo41p) is a binding site for Nam1p that is proposed to deliver newly synthesized RNAs to the inner mitochondrial membrane and promote subsequent interactions between gene specific translational activators and ribosomes. Thus the processes of transcription and translation are physically and functionally coupled in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>Proteins co-immunoprecipitated with ERAL1 included putative nucleoid proteins in addition to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and several translation-associated proteins in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Nucleoids are dynamic structures containing mtDNA and proteins, which are involved in maintenance, replication and transcription of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Coupling of transcription and translation in human mitochondria has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). There has been reported interaction of mitochondrial RNA polymerase with a mitoribosomal protein MRPL12. This interaction was shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to stimulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In a recent report on proteins associated with mitochondrial nucleoids, 15 mitoribosomal proteins were identified along with assorted factors that also function in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). These results raise the possibility that mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and associated factors are coupled with transcription via transcription-related factors such as TFAM also in higher eukaryotes.</p><p>Gohda <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) reported that depletion of chicken ERA protein diminished the growth rate of the cell, accompanied by an accumulation of apoptosis cells. The analysis of cell cycle indicates that the elimination of chicken ERA caused arrest at G1 phase but not at M phase, which suggests a distinct role of chicken ERA in the cell cycle progression from that of bacterial Era protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). They showed that chicken ERA protein was localized in cytosol in DT40 cells and bound to RNA homopolymer (poly-U). Our experiment showed that human ERAL1 was localized at mitochondrial matrix and associated directly or indirectly with 12S mitochondrial rRNA. Depletion of human ERAL1 also diminished the growth rate of HeLa cell probably by apoptosis. In a eukaryotic cell, ERAL1 may be involved in cell viability and apoptosis at least in part through the mitochondrial function.</p><p>The human mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor is essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Rorbach <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) cloned the putative mitochondrial recycling factor, mtRRF and showed that the protein could associate with mitoribosomes. Depletion of mtRRF was lethal, causing initially mitochondrial dysmorphism, aggregation of mitoribosome, elevated mitochondrial ROS and loss of OXPHOS complexes. The phenotypes caused by ERAL1 depletion resemble to those by mtRRF, suggesting that ERAL1 and mtRRF share the some functions or cooperate in mitochondrial ribosomes.</p><p>Mitochondrial nucleoids include not only factors involved in replication and transcription but also structural proteins required for mtDNA maintenance. Recently, Wang and Bogenhagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) reported that EF-Tu, LRP130, ATAD3 and DHX30 were TFAM- and mtSSB-associated proteins. EF-Tu is a translation elongation factor with significant homology to its prokaryote counterparts. Previously we have isolated several proteins such as ERAL1, EF-Tu, LRP130 and Hsp60 by co-immunoprecipitaion with TFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Thus, the nucleoides harbour the proteins related to translation in addition to transcription, replication and mtDNA maintenance.</p><p>In <italic>E. coli</italic> RbfA (ribosome-binding factor A) is essential for cell growth at low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). RbfA is a bacterial cold shock response protein, required for an efficient processing of the 5â² end of the 16S ribosomal RNA during assembly of the small (30S) ribosomal subunit. RbfA binds to the 30S subunit in a position overlapping the binding site of the A and P sites for tRNAs. RbfA has an important role in maturation of the 30S subunit and is involved in translational advantage under conditions of cold shock. It is demonstrated that Era and RbfA have an overlapping function that is essential for the ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Mammalian ERAL1 is also likely to bind 12S rRNA, is associated with the small subunit of mitochondrial ribosome, and is involved in the ribosomal assembly. Considering the importance of ERAL1 for cell viability, it might be also involved in stress response like RbfA.</p><p>Genetic investigation of patients with defective mitochondrial translation led to the discovery of novel mutations in EFG1 in one affected baby and in the mitochondrial EF-Tu in another one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Both patients were affected by severe lactic acidosis and rapidly progressive, fatal encephalopathy. The EFG1-mutant patient had early-onset Leigh syndrome, whereas the EF-Tu mutant patient had severe infantile macrocystic leukodystrophy with micropolygyria. ERAL1 is a mitoribosomal protein which is associated with a small subunit of ribosome. In our immunoprecipitation analysis, we showed the interaction of ERAL1 with EF-Tu. ERAL1 might be involved in the translation reaction itself in addition to the assembly of mitoribosomes.</p><p>DAP3, which exists in the mitochondrial matrix, is involved in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). DAP3 has been reported to be involved in both Î³-interferon and tumour necrosis factor-Î±-induced apoptosis as well as staurosporine-induced mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36 B37 B38">36â38</xref>). hNOA1 (human nitric oxide-associated protein 1) interacts with complex I and DAP3 and regulates mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). ERAL1 is also associated with DAP3 and depletion of ERAL1 causes apoptosis. Accordingly, ERAL1 could be involved in apoptosis through the DAP3 interaction.</p><p>So far, DAP3 has been the only GTP-binding protein found in the small subunit of the mammalian and yeast mitochondrial ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). This protein accounts for the highly specific GTP-binding affinity of small subunits of mitochondrial ribosomes. An immuno-electron microscopic study showed that DAP3 is localized to the base of the lower lobe of the small subunit on the solvent side of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). ERAL1 is associated with the small ribosomal subunit and has a putative GTPase domain. There is the possibility that ERAL1 and DAP3 coordinately regulate the mitochondrial translation and apoptosis.</p><p>DAP3 is located at the lower bottom of the 28S subunit and it is not likely that it would interact with a protein that would bind to the platform of the small subunit. In our experiment by using the sucrose density gradient centrifugation, ERAL1 and DAP3 distributed broadly also in lighter fractions through fractions 1â6. However the distribution of other small subunit protein such as MRPS22 and large subunit protein MRPL3 were located through fractions 9â11. The RNA distribution analysis also showed that the ribosomes were located to fractions 7â9, raising the possibility that some DAP3 protein do not associate with the small ribosomal subunits and conducts another function for example as a death associated protein. We also observed that ERAL1 was associated with DAPK2 (death-associated protein kinase 2) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We speculate that putative free DAP3 binds to free ERAL1 in mitochondria and the two proteins work cooperatively for apoptosis and/or other functions irrespective of the mitochondrial respiratory chain function. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the replacement of glucose by galactose in the culture medium did not augment the growth retardation induced by the ERAL1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A)</p><p>Several mitochondrial ribosome-related genes are known to be associated with mitochondrial disease and diseases characterized by reduced energy metabolism. For example, Weraarpachai <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) have reported that TACO1 protein is a translational activator of COX I. Mutation of the TACO1 gene leads to cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase deficiency and resultantly to late onset Leigh syndrome. The TACO1 protein is associated with EF-Ts and involved specifically in the COX I synthesis.</p><p>LRPPRC (LRP130), which is a yeast translational activator of Pet309 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), was coimmunoprecipitated with ERAL1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Pet309 is a mitochondrial protein needed for the proper splicing and translational initiation of mtDNA-encoded COX mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). These proteins contain PPR motifs that consist of degenerate sequences of 35 amino acids and form antiparallel Î± helices. PPR motif proteins are thought to be involved in post-translational mRNA metabolism, especially in mitochondria and chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Mutations in LRPPRC are found in FrenchâCanadian individuals with Leigh syndrome harbouring an isolated COX deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). LRPPRC is reported to be involved in the stabilization of mRNAs for both COX I and COX III in mammals, without directly affecting their translation, suggesting that this protein is involved in processing of the primary RNA unit or in stabilizing mature transcripts with a very limited sequence selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and translation related proteins should be considered as important candidates for mitochondrial disease, especially when mtDNA mutations have been ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Mutation of ERAL1 also could be a cause of some types of mitochondrial disease.</p><p>ERAL1 may be involved in diverse functions, such as mitoribosome assembly, mitochondrial translation, mitochondrial transcription, proliferation, apoptosis and so on, as a mitoribosome-associated protein and/or free protein.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq305/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Ministry of Education, Science, Technology, Sports and Culture of Japan, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (19209019 and 21590337).
