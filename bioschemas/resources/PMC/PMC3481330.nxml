      <abstract>
        <p>Recently, mutations in the <italic>DNAJC5</italic> gene encoding cysteine-string protein Î± (CSPÎ±) were identified to cause the neurodegenerative disorder adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. The disease-causing mutations (L115R or ÎL116) occur within the cysteine-string domain, a region of the protein that is post-translationally modified by extensive palmitoylation. Here we demonstrate that L115R and ÎL116 mutant proteins are mistargeted in neuroendocrine cells and form SDS-resistant aggregates, concordant with the properties of other mutant proteins linked to neurodegenerative disorders. The mutant aggregates are membrane-associated and incorporate palmitate. Indeed, co-expression of palmitoyltransferase enzymes promoted the aggregation of the CSPÎ± mutants, and chemical depalmitoylation solubilized the aggregates, demonstrating that aggregation is induced and maintained by palmitoylation. In agreement with these observations, SDS-resistant CSPÎ± aggregates were present in brain samples from patients carrying the L115R mutation and were depleted by chemical depalmitoylation. In summary, this study identifies a novel interplay between genetic mutations and palmitoylation in driving aggregation of CSPÎ± mutant proteins. We propose that this palmitoylation-induced aggregation of mutant CSPÎ± proteins may underlie the development of adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in affected families.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> are a group of neurodegenerative disorders, with a hallmark accumulation of autofluorescent lipid- and protein-rich ceroid (lipofuscin) in neurons and other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). NCLs are classified as early infantile, late infantile, juvenile, and adult, depending upon the age of symptomatic onset. The genes affected in different NCLs have been characterized and encode predominantly lysosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>); for example, mutations in the <italic>CLN1</italic> gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme protein palmitoyl thioesterase 1 can cause infantile NCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>); protein palmitoyl thioesterase 1 functions in the removal of fatty acid groups from palmitoylated proteins during their lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Symptoms of adult-onset NCL (ANCL) usually precipitate before the age of 40 and lead to a significant decrease in life expectancy. Unlike other NCLs, which tend to be autosomal recessive, ANCL can be either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Three studies published in 2011â2012 identified mutations in the <italic>DNAJC5</italic> gene encoding cysteine-string protein Î± (CSPÎ±) as the cause of autosomal dominant ANCL in several unrelated families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>CSPÎ± is a ubiquitously expressed DnaJ chaperone protein that regulates proteins involved in secretory vesicle dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Knock-out of CSPÎ± in mice leads to fulminant neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), likely by destabilizing key synaptic proteins such as SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The mutations in CSPÎ± that cause ANCL occur within the highly conserved cysteine-string region, a heavily palmitoylated domain involved in membrane binding and intracellular targeting. The specific mutations identified were a substitution of leucine 115 by arginine (L115R) or a deletion of leucine 116 (ÎL116) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>The cysteine-string domain of CSPÎ± plays a dual role in promoting stable membrane attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). First, the overall hydrophobicity of this region may allow transient membrane interaction of the nonpalmitoylated protein, allowing it to connect with membrane-bound Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) palmitoyltransferases. Subsequent palmitoylation of the cysteine-string domain by specific DHHC proteins promotes stable membrane attachment, facilitating trafficking to secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane. In addition, the cysteine-string domain may also be involved in homodimerization and multimerization of CSPÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p>
      <p>The role of the cysteine-string domain in membrane binding, palmitoylation, and multimerization of CSPÎ± suggests that ÎL116 and L115R mutations may perturb any one of these parameters. However, to date, analysis of the effects of the mutations have mainly used <italic>in silico</italic> modeling. A Kyte-Doolittle algorithm revealed a decrease in hydrophobicity of the cysteine-string domain for the L115R mutant and a smaller nonsignificant decrease for the ÎL116 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Additional <italic>in silico</italic> analysis revealed that both disease-causing mutations reduce the propensity of the cysteine-string domain to move from water to a phosphocholine bilayer interface, reducing the membrane affinity of CSPÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). CSS-Palm software, which is used to identify putative palmitoylation sites, suggested a minimal effect of the mutations on palmitoylation <italic>per se</italic>, possibly with the modification of one cysteine compromised as a consequence of the L115R mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> analysis did not reveal a consistent effect of the mutations on protein aggregation; however, this analysis highlighted the high intrinsic tendency to form antiparallel Î²-sheets species of CSPÎ± and the mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In addition to these <italic>in silico</italic> analyses, some experimental data were presented by NoskovÃ¡ <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), which suggested that the mutants were mislocalized and exhibited a very modest decrease in palmitoylation.</p>
      <p>Although potentially powerful, caution must be exercised when interpreting results of these <italic>in silico</italic> analyses for the following reasons: (i) the structure of the cysteine-string domain is not known, significantly weakening the reliability of nonexperimental measurements; (ii) aggregation propensity is not simply related to the amino acid sequence of CSPÎ± but may also be dependent on the palmitoylation status of the protein and relative cytosol-membrane distribution; (iii) palmitoylation of CSPÎ± is tightly linked with the intrinsic membrane affinity of the cysteine-string domain; (iv) palmitoylation prediction programs do not consider the properties of the individual DHHC proteins that modify CSPÎ±. In short, the <italic>in silico</italic> analyses performed to date may not adequately (if at all) define how the L115R and ÎL116 mutations affect the cellular properties of CSPÎ± and cause autosomal dominant ANCL.</p>

            <p>The human CSPÎ± coding sequence lacking the initiating methionine and flanked by HindIII and BamHI restriction sites was synthesized by GeneArt (Invitrogen). Human CSPÎ± contains an intrinsic HindIII restriction site, and this was removed by introducing a silent mutation (AAGâAAA). This CSPÎ± sequence was inserted in-frame into the pEGFP-C2 vector. To generate myc-tagged constructs, bovine CSPÎ± was excised from a myc-pcDNA3.1 construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) using BamHI and EcoRI enzymes and replaced with the human CSPÎ± coding sequences. HA-tagged DHHC constructs were a kind gift from Masaki Fukata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The sequences of all plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Service, Dundee, UK).</p>

            <p>Gateway-compatible mouse DHHC17/DHHC3 and human CSPÎ± cDNAs were produced by PCR and inserted using Gateway technology into pDONR207 and then into pMetYC-Dest (bait plasmid) and pNX32-Dest (prey plasmid) respectively. After transformation of THY.AP4 and THY.AP5 yeast strains with bait and prey plasmids, respectively, the two strains were mated. Growth of diploid cells was monitored after dropping of 5 Î¼l of each yeast suspension (at <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> 1 or 0.1) on synthetic defined medium plates (1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate, 5 g/liter ammonium sulfate, 20 g/liter glucose, 1.5 g/liter CSM-Ade,-His,-Trp,-Leu,-Ura,-Met drop-out mix, and 20 g/liter agar) and subsequent growth for 4 days at 30 Â°C (for interactions with DHHC17) or 7 days (for interactions with DHHC3). As a loading control and to verify matings, the same amounts were dropped onto plates with synthetic defined medium supplemented with adenine and histidine, and growth was monitored after 3 days at room temperature. Yeast transformations, mating, and sample preparation for Western blotting were performed as described in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>.</p>

            <p>As intracellular targeting of CSPÎ± is dependent upon multiple palmitoylation of the cysteine-string domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), we next examined whether this modification was perturbed for the mutant proteins. The palmitoylation status of CSPÎ± can be readily assessed by its migration profile on SDS gels, as the fully palmitoylated form of the protein migrates approximately 7 kDa heavier than the nonpalmitoylated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The migration of palmitoylated (<italic>p</italic>) and nonpalmitoylated (<italic>np</italic>) bands of wild-type EGFP-CSPÎ± expressed in PC12 cells is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic> (note that we confirm that the upper band is palmitoylated in subsequent figures). Interestingly, for the ÎL116 and L115R mutants there was a clear absence of palmitoylated monomeric forms of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>), and the mutations induced the formation of SDS-resistant aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, quantified in the <italic>right panel</italic>). These aggregates migrated predominantly as two distinct higher molecular mass bands, with the upper band remaining in the stacking gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>). To confirm that aggregation was not dependent on the EGFP tag, myc-tagged forms of the CSPÎ± proteins were also examined, confirming the near absence of palmitoylated monomeric forms of the mutant proteins and formation of high molecular mass aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>).</p>
            <p>In contrast to the L115R mutant, a CSPÎ±(L115A) mutant exhibited the same migration profile on SDS gels as wild-type CSPÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>), demonstrating that the defects in the L115R and ÎL116 mutants likely arise due to a loss of overall hydrophobicity rather than a specific requirement for an intact dileucine motif.</p>
            <p>Finally, we examined whether the mutant aggregates were cytosolic or membrane-associated. For this, transfected PC12 cells were disrupted by freeze/thawing and fractionated into cytosol and membrane fractions by centrifugation. Immunoblotting for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and syntaxin 1A confirmed the successful separation of cytosolic and membrane proteins in supernatant and pellet fractions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>F</italic>). The ÎL116 and L115R aggregates were enriched in the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>F</italic>). To confirm that the aggregates are truly membrane-associated and not pelleting due to their large size, the fractionation protocol was also performed in the presence of Triton X-100 to solubilize bulk cellular membranes. Under these conditions, the majority of the mutant aggregates did not pellet, supporting the idea that they are predominantly membrane-associated in PC12 cells.</p>

            <title>CSPÎ± Mutants Display Efficient Interaction with DHHC Palmitoyltransferases</title>
            <p>The cysteine-string domain of CSPÎ±, where the disease-causing mutations occur, has 14 cysteine residues in a span of 24 amino acids. One possibility to explain the observed aggregation of CSPÎ± mutants is that the mutations prevent palmitoylation of the protein, and aggregation is caused by the presence of many unmodified cysteines. To examine this, we first tested whether the mutations blocked interaction with DHHC palmitoyltransferases. In mammalian cells at least 24 DHHC proteins are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and CSPÎ± can be palmitoylated by DHHC3, DHHC7, DHHC15, or DHHC17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Here, we focused on the interaction of CSPÎ± with DHHC17 and DHHC3; knock-out of DHHC17 led to a complete loss of CSP palmitoylation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The split-ubiquitin system (SUS) was used to study the interaction between CSPÎ± proteins and DHHC17/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). This assay depends on the release of LexA-VP16 transactivator following reassembly of N- and C-terminal halves of ubiquitin, which are fused to the interacting proteins of interest. Reassembled ubiquitin is cleaved by ubiquitin-specific proteases, leading to the release of LexA-VP16. Nuclear translocation of LexA-VP16 allows yeast cells to grow on media lacking adenine and histidine. No major difference was detected in the ability of wild-type CSPÎ± or the ÎL116 and L115R mutants to interact with DHHC17 in the SUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, a CSPÎ± mutant truncated before the cysteine-string domain (amino acids 1â112) displayed a greatly reduced interaction with DHHC17 under stringent conditions (with 200 Î¼<sc>m</sc> methionine), confirming the ability of the system to report reliably on protein-protein interactions. The interaction of CSPÎ± with DHHC3 in the SUS was weaker than with DHHC17. Nevertheless, longer growth times (7 days compared with 4 days for DHHC17) allowed a robust measurement of CSPÎ±-DHHC3 interaction. As with DHHC17, no difference was detected in the ability of wild-type and mutant CSPÎ± proteins to interact with DHHC3; no interaction was detected between DHHC3 and CSPÎ±(1â112) under any conditions.</p>

            <title>Co-expression of Active DHHC Proteins Promotes Aggregation of CSPÎ± Mutants</title>
            <p>The results of the SUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) did not uncover a difference in the interactions of the mutant CSPÎ± proteins with DHHC3 and DHHC17. To investigate palmitoylation of the CSPÎ± mutants further, we co-expressed these proteins with DHHC3 in HEK293T cells. In contrast with PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), overexpressed wild-type CSPÎ± is only weakly palmitoylated in HEK293T cells, but co-expression of specific DHHC proteins (including DHHC3) leads to a large increase in palmitoylation of CSPÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), co-expression of DHHC3 increased palmitoylation of wild-type CSPÎ±, as detected by a shift in migration on SDS gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). Interestingly, the CSPÎ± mutants exhibited a low level of aggregation in HEK293T cells when expressed individually, and this aggregation was markedly increased by co-expression of DHHC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). Note that DHHC3 did not co-aggregate with the mutant CSPÎ± proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>lower</italic>). In addition to promoting aggregation of the CSPÎ± mutants, co-expression with DHHC3 also led to redistribution of the ÎL116 and L115R proteins from the cytosol onto Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). Note that CSPÎ± is not efficiently trafficked onto post-Golgi membranes in this co-expression assay in HEK293T cells, explaining the difference in localization with PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). We also confirmed that the mutant aggregates were membrane-associated following DHHC3 co-expression by cellular fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D</italic>).</p>

            <p>Before proceeding with further analyses of CSPÎ± palmitoylation and aggregation, we examined whether the conditions used in sample preparation for SDS-PAGE (including heating samples to 100 Â°C in 25 m<sc>m</sc> DTT) might be affecting palmitoylation or aggregation of the mutant CSPÎ± proteins. For this, we compared the migration of wild-type and mutant CSPÎ± proteins on SDS gels following preparation in SDS sample buffer containing 1, 5, and 25 m<sc>m</sc> DTT and with or without sample boiling. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>E</italic> shows that there was very little difference in the migration of mutant CSPÎ± proteins under the different conditions tested except for the appearance of a small amount of a band corresponding in size to dimeric CSPÎ± (band slightly below the 175-kDa molecular mass marker) in nonboiled samples, the presence of which was more pronounced with the wild-type protein.</p>
            <p>Having confirmed that palmitoylation and aggregation of the mutant CSPÎ± proteins was not being significantly affected by the sample preparation conditions, we proceeded to examine the effects of DHHC proteins on mutant CSPÎ± aggregation further. We examined whether the increase in aggregation of mutant CSPÎ± proteins occurred with other DHHC proteins and whether it required the palmitoyltransferase activity of these proteins (palmitoyltransferase activity is abolished by mutation of the DHHC motif to DHHS). Indeed, aggregation of the CSPÎ± mutants was promoted by co-expression with DHHC3, DHHC7, and DHHC17 but not by the inactive forms of these palmitoyltransferases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>F</italic>). These findings clearly link palmitoylation by DHHC proteins with the induction of aggregation of CSPÎ± proteins carrying the L115R or ÎL116 mutations.</p>

            <title>Co-aggregation of Mutant and Wild-type CSPÎ± Proteins</title>
            <p>Because mutations in CSPÎ± cause autosomal dominant ANCL, the ÎL116 and L115R mutant proteins are toxic even in the presence of a wild-type copy of the CSPÎ± gene. Therefore, it is possible that the mutant proteins have the capacity to interfere with the function of wild-type CSPÎ±. We examined this by testing whether mutant CSPÎ± proteins induced co-aggregation of wild-type CSPÎ±. For this, HEK293T cells were transfected with myc-tagged wild-type CSPÎ±, DHHC3, and EGFP-tagged wild-type or mutant CSPÎ±. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> shows that in the presence of EGFP-CSPÎ± ÎL116 or L115R mutants, a small fraction of myc-CSPÎ± was recruited into SDS-resistant aggregates. This was not observed following co-expression with either EGFP or EGFP-CSPÎ± wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). This result clearly highlights the potential of mutant CSPÎ± proteins to interfere with the wild-type protein, offering a possible mechanism for the dominant effect of these disease-causing mutants in the development of ANCL.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The link between protein misfolding/aggregation and neurodegeneration is well established for disorders such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The results presented in this study further highlight the correlation between protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, with respect to mutant CSPÎ± and ANCL. Perhaps the most intriguing observation in the present study is the link between aggregation of the mutant CSPÎ± proteins and palmitoylation, highlighting the interplay between genetic mutations and post-translational modification in the induction of protein aggregation. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and proteolytic cleavage can modulate the aggregation of cytotoxic mutant proteins in other neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), and indeed blocking the palmitoylation of mutant Huntingtin increased the formation of inclusions and enhanced toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The present study extends this link between neurodegeneration and palmitoylation and suggests that future success in counteracting ANCL in patients carrying the disease-causing CSPÎ± mutations might be achieved by targeting the palmitoylation machinery.</p>
      <p>It is intriguing that protein palmitoylation is implicated in both infantile and adult-onset forms of NCL, albeit by different mechanisms. A deficiency of the lysosomal thioesterase protein palmitoyl thioesterase 1 causes early onset NCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), and this enzyme is involved in depalmitoylation of proteins during their degradation in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). We speculate that the palmitoylated aggregates of CSPÎ± mutant proteins might be less susceptible to the actions of lysosomal thioesterases, leading to a gradual accumulation of palmitoylated CSPÎ± peptides. Thus, the difference in age of symptomatic onset between the infantile and adult-onset forms of ANCL may reflect a different rate of accumulation of nondegraded palmitoylated peptides: rapid accumulation due to a decreased cleavage of bulk palmitoylated proteins following protein palmitoyl thioesterase 1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and a slower accumulation resulting from a decreased sensitivity of a single protein (mutant CSPÎ±) to lysosomal thioesterases.</p>
      <p>What could be the underlying cause of the observed aggregation of L115R and ÎL116 CSPÎ± mutants? First, it is important to note that wild-type CSPÎ± has an intrinsic tendency to self-associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and indeed SDS-resistant dimers of wild-type CSPÎ± are frequently observed in cellular samples (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>E</italic>). This self-association is dramatically enhanced by the ÎL116 and L115R mutations, leading to the formation of high molecular mass SDS-resistant aggregates that are not observed with the wild-type protein. One possibility to explain these effects is that the mutations promote a restructuring of the cysteine-string domain resulting in added palmitate groups being positioned outside the hydrophobic core of the membrane bilayer. Palmitate chains of different mutant CSPÎ± monomers might then cluster together via lipid-lipid interactions to shield the exposed palmitate chains from water. Indeed, it is possible that the CSPÎ± monomers within the aggregates are not fully palmitoylated. This is implied by the lower [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate signal from aggregates compared with monomeric protein; for example, for the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic> the <sup>3</sup>H signal for the ÎL116 and L115R high molecular mass aggregates was 5.8- and 12.5-fold, respectively, less than that from the corresponding monomers when normalized to protein levels. This difference might suggest that the aggregates contain partially palmitoylated mutant monomers or a mixture of palmitoylated and nonpalmitoylated monomers. At present we remain cautious in our interpretation of the different <sup>3</sup>H signals from monomeric and aggregated protein. In particular, it is not clear whether palmitate turnover on the monomers and aggregates occurs with similar kinetics or even whether the aggregation of mutant CSPÎ± somehow reduces the <sup>3</sup>H signal from associated palmitate chains. Disrupting the mutant CSPÎ± aggregates into their constituent monomers, without perturbing palmitoylation, would provide a clearer indication of the palmitoylation status of individual monomers within the aggregates; this is an area of investigation that we are currently pursuing. Another possibility to explain the palmitoylation-dependent aggregation is that the mutant proteins are intrinsically more prone to self-associate (in their nonpalmitoylated state). In this case, palmitoylation-induced membrane binding might simply concentrate the mutant proteins on cellular membranes facilitating aggregate formation in a manner that does not directly involve palmitate chains. Although this model is supported by the observation that bacterially expressed recombinant CSPÎ± self-associates via a region containing the cysteine-string domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), this does not readily fit with our data showing that the high molecular mass mutant aggregates are disassembled by hydroxylamine treatment.</p>
      <p>Another point of note is that complete knock-out of CSPÎ± in mice causes neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, it is possible that disease occurs in humans carrying the L115R/ÎL116 mutations as a result of reduced levels of wild-type CSPÎ±. However, the finding that CSPÎ± heterozygous knock-out mice have no overt neurodegenerative phenotype might argue against this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Nevertheless, mutant forms of CSPÎ± could exhibit a toxic gain-of-function effect through interfering with the function or trafficking of wild-type CSPÎ±. Indeed, it was suggested that there was a loss of immunofluorescence signal and synaptic targeting of CSPÎ± in cerebral and cerebellar cortex samples from a L115R mutation carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We detected the recruitment of small amounts of myc-tagged wild-type CSPÎ± protein into EGFP-tagged mutant aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), and thus aggregates containing both mutant and wild-type CSPÎ± in the brains of ANCL patients are a possibility. Co-aggregation of wild-type and mutant CSPÎ± may perturb synaptic targeting, leading to destabilization of key synaptic proteins such as the SNARE protein SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The mutant aggregates might also cause cellular toxicity by recruiting and sequestering other key cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p>
      <p>At present we are not certain why NoskovÃ¡ <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) failed to detect a major loss of palmitoylation of mutant EGFP-CSPÎ± constructs in CAD5 cells. However, we note that the authors did not confirm the identity of immunoreactive bands that were proposed to represent palmitoylated and nonpalmitoylated CSPÎ± (for example, by using hydroxylamine treatment). Full-length immunoblots were also not presented in this study, preventing an assessment of protein aggregation, although hydroxylamine treatment of brain samples from an affected individual that lacked CSPÎ± immunoreactivity led to the appearance of an immunoreactive band that may represent a dimeric form of CSPÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, the results presented further highlight the relationship between protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, while revealing a novel role for palmitoylation in driving aggregation of disease-causing mutants.</p>
