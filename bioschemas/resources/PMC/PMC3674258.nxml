      <abstract>
        <p>Regulation of actomyosin dynamics by post-transcriptional modifications in cytoplasmic actin is still poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that dioxygenase ALKBH4-mediated demethylation of a monomethylated site in actin (K84me1) regulates actinâmyosin interaction and actomyosin-dependent processes such as cytokinesis and cell migration. ALKBH4-deficient cells display elevated K84me1 levels. Non-muscle myosin II only interacts with unmethylated actin and its proper recruitment to and interaction with actin depend on ALKBH4. ALKBH4 co-localizes with the actomyosin-based contractile ring and midbody via association with methylated actin. ALKBH4-mediated regulation of actomyosin dynamics is completely dependent on its catalytic activity. Disorganization of cleavage furrow components and multinucleation associated with ALKBH4 deficiency can all be restored by reconstitution with wild-type but not catalytically inactive ALKBH4. Similar to actin and myosin knock-out mice, homozygous Alkbh4 mutant mice display early embryonic lethality. These findings imply that ALKBH4-dependent actin demethylation regulates actomyosin function by promoting actin-non-muscle myosin II interaction.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells. It exists both as monomeric (G-actin) and filamentous (F-actin) actin, and the switch between these two states is highly dynamic. Dynamic actin filament networks are involved in a large variety of cellular functions, including lamellipodium formation, cell motility and cytokinesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The actin networks are maintained through coordinated actions of a large number of regulatory proteins that modulate filament assembly and disassembly, as well as through contractility driven by myosin II motor proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The process of defining the plane and position of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis requires communication between microtubules and the actin cortex and it eventually results in F-actin and NM II assembling into the contractile ring<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The contractile ring is a highly dynamic structure with a rapid turnover of both F-actin and NM II (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Accumulation of F-actin in the contractile ring may occur by nucleation in the furrow or by transport of pre-existing actin filaments nucleated elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. NM II is the major motor protein involved in cytokinesis and its movement along F-actin as well as F-actin depolymerization is required for furrow ingression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Various post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been identified in actin, including N-terminal arginylation, acetylated aspartate residues, phosphorylated tyrosine residues, and methylated histidine and lysine residues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, how these actin PTMs are involved in the regulation of actomyosin dynamics remains largely unknown.</p>
    <p>The superfamily of Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG, Î±-ketoglutarate)-dependent dioxygenases (PF03171) belongs to the non-heme iron protein family, which can hydroxylate inactivated C-H groups. This class of enzymes can catalyse the demethylation of a variety of substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the Fe(II)/2OG dioxygenase AlkB catalyses demethylation of various types of methyl modified DNA bases following exposure to methylating agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Based on sequence homology within the catalytic domain of <italic>E. coli</italic> AlkB, 9 human AlkB homologs have been identified, ALKBH1-8 and the somewhat less conserved FTO (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Like <italic>E. coli</italic> AlkB, ALKBH2 and ALKBH3 have been shown to possess DNA repair activity <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. We have recently demonstrated that FTO and ALKBH5 are RNA m<sup>6</sup>A (N<sup>6</sup>-methyl-adenosine) demethylases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Demethylation of m<sup>6</sup>A appears to be involved in energy homeostasis and implies important roles for FTO and ALKBH5 in obesity, type II diabetes and fertility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The AlkB domain of ALKBH8 has been shown to hydroxylate modified uridine in the wobble-position of certain tRNA isoacceptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. ALKBH1 is the first human AlkB homologue shown to hydroxylate proteins. Like the <italic>S. pombe</italic> homologue, ALKBH1 catalyses demethylation of histone H2A <italic>in vivo</italic> and has been proposed to be involved in neural differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. These findings suggest a very wide functional diversity of mammalian AlkB proteins, with substrates ranging from DNA and RNA to protein. Although ALKBH4 has been demonstrated to decarboxylate 2OG <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, its substrate and biological function in mammalian cells are currently unknown.</p>
    <p>In the present study, we show that ALKBH4 mediates demethylation of actin K84me1 and thereby regulates the actinâmyosin II interaction. In addition, we demonstrate that deletion of ALKBH4 is embryonically lethal and depletion leads to defects in cytokinesis and cell motility.</p>

        <title>ALKBH4 associates with the contractile ring and midbody</title>
        <p>Interestingly, immunofluorescence microscopy, using ALKBH4 antibodies generated for this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1d,e</xref>) revealed a pronounced accumulation of ALKBH4 at contractile ring and midbody structures, as determined by co-localization of endogenous or overexpressed ALKBH4 with the contractile ring/midbody component F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and anillin, an actomyosin scaffold protein and cleavage furrow marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). This staining pattern was also observed in <italic>Alkbh4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup><italic>Cre</italic> mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Consistent with the immunofluorescence analysis, purification of contractile ring and midbody structures from human MRC5 cells demonstrated that a pool of ALKBH4 co-fractionated with the contractile ring and midbody proteins NM II, actin, Î±-tubulin and Plk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that ALKBH4 could be a novel factor involved in cytokinesis. This was further substantiated by mass spectrometric analysis of affinity-purified Flag-GFP-ALKBH4 protein complexes identifying the two key components of the actomyosin-based contractile ring, actin and NM II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). These interactions were confirmed by endogenous and exogenous co-immunoprecipitation of ALKBH4 and actin or NM II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting that ALKBH4 indeed is a <italic>bona fide</italic> component of the actomyosin network. Furthermore, the fact that incubation with magnesium and ATP prevents co-precipitation of NM II with ALKBH4 implies that the interaction between ALKBH4 and NM II is mediated by actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>

        <title>Novel actin K84me1 regulates ALKBH4âactomyosin interaction</title>
        <p>A previously reported two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis approach, followed by immunoblotting using a pan-reactive anti-methyl-lysine mouse monoclonal antibody, revealed the existence of lysine-methylated actin proteins. However, no exact sites were identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Interestingly, the mass spectrometric analysis of ALKBH4 interacting proteins indicates that monomethylated actin (K84me1) was pulled down with ALKBH4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). To further validate and investigate this observation, we generated an actin-K84me1 antibody that specifically recognizes K84-monomethylated actin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>). We then purified HA-Î²-actin from human 293T cells, digested with Asp-N/Arg-C and enriched for potential K84me1 species by peptide immunoprecipitation using the actin-K84me1 antibody, and analysed by mass spectrometry. This mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that actin is indeed methylated on K84 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). We then speculated that ALKBH4 might specifically interact with actin K84me1 and/or actin K84me1 might be an <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate of ALKBH4. By employing two different methylation-deficient actin mutants (K84A and K84R), we confirmed that actin is methylated on lysine 84 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We next examined the methylation profile between F-actin and G-actin in 293T cells. Interestingly, we found that under untreated conditions methylated actin preferentially exists as F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, lanes 1, 2). After forced disassembly of F-actin into G-actin by F-actin depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D (CCD), high levels of K84me1 G-actin were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, lanes 3, 4). This suggests that methylated actin rapidly polymerize into filaments under physiological conditions and/or that demethylation preferentially takes place after filament formation. The expected shift in the F/G-actin ratio following treatment with either CCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, lanes 3, 4) or the F-actin stabilizing drug phalloidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, lanes 5, 6) confirmed efficient fractionation. Immunoblot analyses revealed that substitution of lysine 84 to arginine or alanine or treatment with the global methylation inhibitor AdOx (adenosine-2â², 3â²-dialdehyde) abolished the actinâALKBH4 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a,b</xref>). This demonstrates that methylation of actin is required for efficient binding to ALKBH4. Mutation of lysine 84 to arginine and especially alanine results in a dramatic charge change that could impact the overall properties of actin. To determine if the mutants had retained functionality we tested their ability to polymerize into actin filaments. The F/G-actin fractionation showed that the distribution of G-actin and F-actin were similar in WT, K84A and K84R cells, demonstrating that both mutants could be readily incorporated into actin filaments <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). This is consistent with previous findings in yeast, showing that the K84A mutation had no effect on polymerization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Furthermore, AdOx treatment did not affect actinâs ability to form filaments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3c</xref>). In accordance with our previous data showing a strong interaction between ALKBH4 and actin as well as a clear co-localization of ALKBH4 with F-actin, we observed that, though most ALKBH4 was found in the soluble fraction, a fraction of ALKBH4 sedimented into the insoluble fraction with F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p>

        <title>ALKBH4 promotes actin-NM II binding via actin demethylation</title>
        <p>Though no natural substrate for ALKBH4 has yet been described, we reasoned that as ALKBH4 binds to methylated actin, accumulates at the contractile ring and midbody during cytokinesis, and possesses dioxygenase activity <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, ALKBH4 might mediate the removal of the methyl group on actin K84. To test this hypothesis, we first investigated if the level of actin-K84me1 correlated with expression of ALKBH4. Indeed, ALKBH4 depletion was accompanied by a dramatic increase in actin-K84me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, lane 1 versus 2). Importantly, the increase in methylation was completely prevented by complementation with WT ALKBH4, but not by ALKBH4 containing a mutated catalytic domain (H169A/D171A/H254A (HDH)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, lanes 3â5). Additionally, overexpression of WT ALKBH4 but not the HDH ALKBH4 mutant resulted in a decrease in actin-K84me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Consistent with our findings in human cells, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment of <italic>Alkbh4</italic><sup><italic>L/L</italic></sup> MEF cells (designated <italic>Alkbh4</italic><sup><italic>Î/Î</italic></sup>) resulted in depletion of ALKBH4 and a pronounced increase in actin methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
        <p>It has previously been observed that a substrate may not readily dissociate from a catalytically inactive enzyme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In accordance with this and the possibility of actin being an ALKBH4 substrate, we observed that the actinâALKBH4 interaction was stronger after disruption of the dioxygenase domain in ALKBH4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). These different independent pieces of <italic>in vivo</italic> data presented above makes a strong indication that the actin K84me1 demethylation is dependent on ALKBH4.</p>
        <p>X-ray crystallography and NMR have previously been used to predict the region of actin that binds to NM II (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Interestingly, actin K84 is located within the predicted NM II interacting region, which made us speculate that methylation of K84 may influence the actin-NM II interaction. Intriguingly, and in contrast to ALKBH4 that preferentially binds to methylated actin, NM II does not interact with K84me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Furthermore, employing a methylation-deficient actin mutant, K84R, or inhibiting methylation by AdOx both resulted in increased NM IIâactin interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3b,d</xref>), suggesting that ALKBH4-dependent demethylation of actin-K84me1 promotes binding of NM II to F-actin in the actomyosin network.</p>

        <p>To better understand the functional interplay between components of the actomyosin network, we tested how depletion or inhibition of one component would affect the interaction of the other two. Consistent with the data that non-methylated actin interacts better with NM II, the NM IIâactin interaction was greatly decreased in both ALKBH4-deficient MEF cells and human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). NM II depletion did not influence the binding of ALKBH4 to actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3e</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with the specific NM II inhibitor blebbistatin that inhibits myosin IIâs ability to release phosphate and to bind tightly to actin filaments only affected the NM IIâactin interaction but not the interaction between ALKBH4 and actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3f</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.

        <title>ALKBH4 deficiency affects cleavage furrow organization</title>
        <p>The interaction of ALKBH4 with the actomyosin network and its ability to mediate demethylation of actin K84me1 suggest that ALKBH4 has an important role in cytokinesis. Strikingly, anillin and NM II failed to localize properly in ALKBH4-depleted cells during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The accumulation of the kinases Plk1 and aurora B at the midbody was also severely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4a,b</xref>), suggesting that ALKBH4-deficient cells have a defect in cleavage furrow formation. To investigate if ALKBH4 might also be important for other aspects of actomyosin dynamics than cytokinesis, we decided to study its impact on cell migration. Indeed, we observed a dramatic reduction in the migration ability of <italic>Alkbh4</italic><sup><italic>Î/Î</italic></sup> compared with <italic>Alkbh4</italic><sup><italic>L/L</italic></sup> MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4c</xref>), using the scratch assay method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The cells were kept in low-serum medium to avoid proliferation and cell count after 24âh showed similar cell numbers between 4-OHT treated and untreated MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4d</xref>).</p>
        <p>Defects in the organization of the cleavage furrow may result in cytokinesis failure and formation of multinucleated cells. Indeed, ALKBH4-deficient cells, which exhibit clear defects in the organization of the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), also exhibited a dramatic increase in the frequency of multinucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4e</xref>). Multinucleated cells can result from cytokinesis failure or from a cell fusion event<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. To distinguish between these possibilities, we followed cell division by live cell imaging, which confirmed that multinucleation observed after ALKBH4 depletion originated from aborted cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">3</xref>). Importantly, ALKBH4-deficient cells required much longer time to exit mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5b</xref>). In many cases, cytokinesis eventually failed resulting in refusion of the two new partly separated daughter cells or apoptosis. This is consistent with FACS analyses showing a significant increase in apoptosis and hyperploid cells following ALKBH4 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5c,d</xref>). In addition, we observed that a portion of ALKBH4-depleted cells had more than two centrosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6a</xref>). The increase in centrosome number is likely a consequence of polyploidy caused by cells failing to go through cytokinesis.</p>
        <p>Collectively, these data indicate that ALKBH4 depletion, in addition to impairing the function of the contractile ring and hence disorganize the cleavage furrow, most likely affect a broader range of actomyosin-related functions in the cell.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we have identified a novel post-translational modification on actin, K84 monomethylation, regulated by the previously uncharacterized dioxygenase ALKBH4. Though proteomic analysis using a pan-reactive anti-methyl lysine antibody previously suggested that actin might be methylated, no actual methylated residues were identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Our data demonstrate that ALKBH4-mediated demethylation of actin-K84me1 is important for maintaining actomyosin dynamics supporting normal cytokinesis and cell migration. It is not the first time PTMs of actin has been implicated in regulating cellular functions. Actin arginylation and H73me1 methylation have previously been proposed to regulate intracellular distribution of actin and polymer formation, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.</p>
      <p>The interaction between the two major components of the actomyosin complex, actin and NM II, is regulated by ALKBH4-dependent demethylation of actin and is decreased in ALKBH4-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). These findings are further supported by the fact that NM II can bind more K84R mutant than WT actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3c</xref>). In contrast, ALKBH4 specifically binds to the K84 methylated form of actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>), and catalytically inactive ALKBH4 binds actin stronger than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
      <p>We have attempted to test the <italic>in vitro</italic> demethylase activity of recombinant ALKBH4 or Flag-tagged ALKBH4 purified from human cells using either synthesized methylated peptide or HA-tagged Î²-actin purified from 293T cells. Unfortunately, these purified ALKBH4 proteins did not display vigorous demethylation/hydroxylation under any of the experimental settings examined. This most likely reflects a need for some unknown cofactors or that the F-actin conformation in the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments is incompatible with efficient ALKBH4 demethylase activity. Despite the difficulties of showing <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of ALKBH4, the different independent <italic>in vivo</italic> data presented above makes actin a strong candidate substrate of the ALKBH4 dioxygenase activity.</p>
      <p>The reduced cell migration together with the severe problems associated with cytokinesis in ALKBH4-deficient human and murine cells suggest that ALKBH4-dependent demethylation of actin K84 has a very important role in regulating the actinâNM II interaction and actomyosin function. The facts that (1) cell motility and cytokinesis depend on proper actinâNM II interaction, (2) the actinâNM II interaction is compromised in ALKBH4-deficient cells and (3) NM II accumulation at the contractile ring and midbody is disturbed in ALKBH4-depleted cells, all point to a role of ALKBH4-mediated actin demethylation in promoting the recruitment of NM II to the cleavage furrow, and actin-NM II dependent structures in general. Actin fractionation revealed that, under physiological conditions, methylation of actin is preferentially observed on actin filaments and not monomeric actin.</p>
      <p>With regard to actomyosin dynamics in relation to cytokinesis our findings are consistent with the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>); upon recruitment to the contractile ring and midbody via interaction with methylated actin, ALKBH4 mediates demethylation of actin K84me1 and thus creates a binding site for NM II. Consecutive demethylation of actin moieties in the actin filament could then allow dynamic sliding of NM II along the actin filaments and mediate contraction of the contractile ring, resulting in cleavage furrow ingression and subsequent abscission.</p>
      <p>Similarly to the previously described embryonic lethality of homozygous actin or NM II knock-out mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, homozygous <italic>Alkbh4</italic> knockout was also found to be embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This is in accordance with an essential function of ALKBH4 in regulating actomyosin function and supports our findings of an important role of ALKBH4 in cytokinesis. However, the fact that not all cells appear to have severe cytokinesis defects might suggest that ALKBH4-mediated actin demethylation and perhaps demethylation of yet unknown targets might be important not only for proper cytokinesis but for a far wider range of cellular functions.</p>
      <p>No homozygous actin deletions or nonsense mutations have been described in humans, probably because, like in mice, such deletions or mutations would be lethal. However, several missense mutations have been associated with human diseases including mental retardation and developmental malformations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. In mice, such mutations have been associated with tumourigenesis and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Identification of ALKBH4 as a new regulator of actomyosin function opens up the possibility that ALKBH4 might also be targeted by mutations in developmental diseases and cancer. In conclusion, we propose that the key purpose of actin methylation and demethylation mediated by ALKBH4 is to create âhandlesâ for NM II, to âhold on toâ when âclimbingâ along the actin filament thereby generating contraction of the actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

Peptides were loaded on a pre-column (75âÎ¼m ID packed with 8âcm 10âÎ¼m-C18 resin) and separated on an analytical 75âÎ¼m ID column packed with 11âcm 3âÎ¼m-C18 resin (pre-column: ODS-AQ 12ânM S-10âÎ¼m (YMC Co., Ltd), analytical column: Luna 3âÎ¼m 100âÃ resin (<italic>Phenomenex</italic>)) with anacetonitrile gradient from 0â25% in 60âmin and 25â80% in another 7âmin at a flow rate of 200ânlâmin<sup>â1</sup>. Spectra were acquired in a data-dependent mode: the 10 most intense ions of +2, +3 or +4 charge from each full scan (<italic>R</italic>=70,000) were isolated for HCD MS2 (<italic>R</italic>=17,500) at NEC 27 with a dynamic exclusion time of 150âs. For peptide identification, the MS2 spectra were searched against an EPI-IPI human database (forward+reversed sequences) using Prolucid with 50âp.p.m. mass accuracy for both precursor and fragment ions and considering carbamidomethylation on Cys as a fixed modification and mono-, di- or tri-methylation at Lys as differential modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Search results were filtered using DTASelect 2.0 with 10âp.p.m. mass accuracy for precursor mass and a 1% FDR cutoff at the spectral level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. The Î²-actin K84me1 spectra presented in the figures were annotated using pLabel, requiring 20âp.p.m. accuracy for fragment ions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.
