      <abstract>
        <p id="P4">Factor H (FH) is an abundant regulator of complement activation and protects host cells from self-attack by complement. Here we provide insights into the regulatory activity of FH by solving the crystal structure of the first four domains of FH in complex with its target C3b. FH interacts with multiple domains of C3b, covering a large, extended surface area. The structure indicated that FH destabilizes the C3 convertase by competition and electrostatic repulsion and that FH enables proteolytic degradation of C3b by providing a binding platform for the protease factor I, while stabilizing the overall domain arrangement of C3b. The results offer general models for complement regulation and provide structural explanations for disease-related mutations in both FH and C3b.</p>

    <p id="P5">The efficacy of the complement-mediated immune response relies on a delicate balance between activation and regulation. While the continuous generation of the strong opsonin complement component 3b (C3b) by the alternative pathway (AP) allows a rapid reaction to foreign or abnormal cells, its indiscriminate deposition may potentially cause host tissue damage. Host cells are therefore protected by proteins of the regulator of complement activation (RCA) family, which either impair the generation of new C3b by accelerating the decay of the C3 convertases or act as cofactor for factor I (FI) in degrading existing C3b<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. In addition to cell-surface bound RCA like decay accelerating factor (DAF, also known as CD55 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A000571">http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A000571</ext-link>]), membrane cofactor protein (MCP or CD46 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A000568">http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A000568</ext-link>]) and complement receptor 1 (CR1 or CD35 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A000541">http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A000541</ext-link>]), the soluble and highly abundant regulator factor H (FH) offers an additional layer of protection as it controls the steady-state AP activation in circulation. Furthermore, FH may be recruited to host membranes by recognizing and binding self components, such as glycosaminoglycans, and thereby prevent opsonization of host tissue with low expression of surface RCA<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P6">The importance of FH in maintaining a well-balanced immune response is reflected by the increasing number of diseases with strong association to mutations and polymorphisms in the <italic>CFH</italic> gene, as seen in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN-II)<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Several pathogenic microorganisms evade attack of the complement cascade by expressing structural homologues of FH or recruiting host FH to their surfaces via FH-binding proteins<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Owing to their vital role in immune modulation, therapeutic targeting of FH as well as other RCA proteins is considered important for the treatment of diseases associated with abnormal or loss of complement control<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P7">FH is formed by a linear string of complement-control-protein (CCP) domains that consist of about 60 residues and that are common to all RCA proteins<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The first four domains (CCP1-4) of FH are necessary and sufficient for regulation of complement in the fluid phase, whereas host cell specificity is determined by domains CCP5-20 of FH<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Despite a wealth of functional and structural data on CCP domains of various complement regulators, our understanding of the two molecular mechanisms that protect host cells, referred to as âdecay-acceleration activityâ and âcofactor activityâ, still remains limited.</p>
    <p id="P8">Here we provide insights into the mechanisms of host protection against complement activation by presenting the crystal structure of the four functional domains of FH (CCP1-4) in complex with C3b. By combining our structural model with biochemical and biophysical data as well as with findings from previous mutational studies, we are able to dissect individual processes and correlate disease-related mutations with functional consequences. Furthermore, our findings allow us to extrapolate to other members of the RCA family and develop a more general model for complement regulation.</p>

        <title>Crystal structure of the C3bâFH(1â4) complex</title>
        <p id="P9">For this study, we expressed the N-terminal four CCP domains (amino acid residues 1â246) of FH, hereafter called FH(1â4), which are known to mediate both of the regulatory activities of FH<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This recombinant FH(1â4) bound C3b with an affinity of K<sub>D</sub> = 11 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>) and was functionally active <italic>in vitro</italic> with respect to both decay-acceleration and cofactor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d,e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P10">We crystallized the complex of C3b-FH(1â4) and determined the structure to 2.7-Ã resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The structure revealed a large and discontinuous interface between FH(1â4) and C3b that stretches over a distance of 100 Ã and buries a surface area of ~4,500 Ã<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Despite the putative flexibility between individual CCP domains of FH, FH(1â4) bound to C3b shows only small differences in domain orientations when compared to the solution structures of CCP1-2 and CCP2-3 (ref. <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Tilt angle between CCP1 and CCP2 altered by ~10Â°, which led to closer proximity of CCP1 towards C3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> online). A kink occurred between CCP3 and CCP4 and was responsible for an overall L-shape appearance of FH(1â4), which is consistent with small-angle X-ray scattering data of FH CCP1-5 (ref. <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The structure of C3b revealed its typical arrangement of 12 domains formed by the Î² chain (amino acid residues 1â645) and the Î±â chain (amino acid residues 727â1,641)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, obtained after proteolytic activation of the native C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The core of the structure is formed by eight macroglobulin (MG) domains and a linker (LNK) domain. Inserted between MG7 and MG8 are a âcomplement C1r/C1s, UEGF, BMP1â (CUB) domain and a thioester containing domain (TED), which is responsible for covalent attachment to target surfaces. The C-terminus is extended by a C345C domain, which is common to complement components C3, C4 and C5. Two differences in domain orientations were observed between C3b-FH(1â4) and unbound C3b: the C-terminal C345C domain repositions, which we attribute to crystal packing, and the CUB and TED domains rotate by ~12Â° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 2</xref> online)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The change in CUB and TED was likely due to interactions with FH(1â4); however, variations in CUB-TED positionings have been observed among other structures of C3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> online)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P11">The C3b-FH(1â4) interface consisted of four contact regions spanning the length of FH(1â4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> online). The bottom half of CCP1 and the CCP1-CCP2 linker attached through hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges to the acidic Î±â N-terminal (Î±âNT) region (amino acid residues 727â746) and the MG7 domain in C3b. Antibody binding to MG7-MG8 inhibited the interaction of C3b with both FH(1â4) and full-length FH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> online)<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, which confirms the Î±âNT and MG7 region as a primary binding site for FH<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The second major binding site involves a patch of conserved hydrophobic residues surrounded by hydrophilic residues on CCP2 that interacted with MG6 of C3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> online). At the third site, CCP3 contacted residues of both the Î±â and the Î² chain of C3b and bridged MG2 and CUB, which harbors the three scissile bonds that are cleaved by FI. Interestingly, the hypervariable loop of FH CCP3 (amino acid residues 139â145) that was disordered in the previous NMR structure<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, was ordered in the C3bâFH(1â4) complex and interacted with the CUB domain of C3b. At the fourth and final site, CCP4 formed another bridge between MG1 and TED, which was confirmed by blocking experiments using a TED-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> online). The arrangement of the Î±âNT, MG7, CUB and TED domains are known to substantially change during the conversion of C3 to C3b<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, which clearly explains the specificity of FH for C3b over C3. In summary, the complex revealed an extensive interface that involves multiple domains of C3b and all domains FH(1â4), which is supported by binding studies in this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1bâc</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.4</xref> online) and previous reports<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.</p>

      <sec id="S3">
        <title>Structural basis of decay-acceleration activity</title>
        <p id="P12">The ability of FH(1â4) to dissociate the protease fragment (Bb) from the alternative pathway C3 convertase complex (C3bBb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) suggests competition for the same binding region on C3b. We therefore compared the C3b-FH(1â4) structure with that of the convertase, stabilized by the staphylococcal inhibitor SCIN (C3bBbSCIN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, by superimposing the Î² chain of the C3b molecules from both complexes. The superposition showed a large steric clash between CCP1-2 of FH(1â4) and the Bb fragment of the convertase. The N-linked glycan at Asn-260 in Bb contributed to the observed clash (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref> online). Accordingly, deletion of this glycan by mutation N260D renders the convertase less sensitive to decay acceleration<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. In addition to steric hindrance, the complementary surfaces of FH and Bb are both negatively charged, which implied that electrostatic repulsion contributed to destabilization of the C3bBb complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These results revealed a functional role for CCP1-2 in displacing Bb and a supportive role of CCP3-4 in binding to C3b.</p>
        <p id="P13">In order to propose a general model of decay acceleration, we compared our data with the structure and mutagenesis data of DAF<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The overlay of the functional CCP2-3 domains of DAF onto FH CCP1-2 showed that DAF exhibited similar residues at the C3b contact sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> online). Moreover, residues critical for DAF activity, which are located in the CCP2-3 linker and on the CCP3 surface, faced Bb in the C3bBb complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>)<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Similar to FH, the proposed binding mode of DAF resulted in a steric overlap with Bb. However, the critical residues on DAF facing Bb in the C3bBb complex were predominantly hydrophobic and not negatively charged as in the case of FH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> online). The hydrophobic patch on DAF faced the Î²F-Î±7 loop of the von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain in Bb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,c</xref>). This section of the VWA domain was hidden in the pro-enzyme FB, which possibly explains why DAF binds Bb but not full-length FB<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Putatively, interaction of DAF with this loop may induce a low affinity state of the metal-ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in Bb and thereby disrupt the C3bBb complex, similar to the allostery observed in integrin I domains<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. However, the structural observations do not readily explain the effects of mutations at Lys-298 and Tyr-338 in FB on the decay-acceleration activity of DAF, CR1 and FH<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Possibly, these mutations in the VWA domain, distal from the RCA interaction side, may affect the allosteric mechanism.</p>

        <title>Implications for cofactor activity</title>
        <p id="P14">FH supports two, out of three possible, cleavages in the CUB domain of C3b by FI (between R1281-S1282 and R1298-S1299) that yield the inactive iC3b species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. The crystal structure revealed that FH CCP2-3 bound to C3b adjacent to the CUB domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>) with the hypervariable loop of CCP3 directly contacting CUB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Cleavage site R1281-S1282 was well-exposed, whereas R1298-S1299 was occluded in the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), which confirms the notion that R1281-S1282 is cleaved first and suggests that cleavage of R1298-S1299 requires conformational changes. The strong influence of ionicity for the binding of FI indicates that polar interactions are highly important for this interaction<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. FH CCP1-3 indeed exhibited several conserved and charged patches on its surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> online), which may be involved in the binding of FI. For the FH-homologue vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP), CCP2 was shown to have a dominant role in complement inhibition. Mutation of four residues in CCP2 markedly enhanced cofactor activity, while only moderately increasing the VCP-C3b affinity<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. The equivalent residues in FH (Gln101, Ile106, Asp112 and Asp119) were fully exposed and found adjacent to conserved patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), which suggests a role for these four residues in the binding of FI. Furthermore, studies on cobra-venom factor (CVF) indicated that the C345C domain of C3b may contribute to this interaction<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. These data suggest that FI binds the C3b-FH complex at the area formed by CCP1-3 of FH and C345C and CUB of C3b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> online). Besides providing a platform for FI, FH may have a putative second role in cofactor activity: we hypothesize that the bridge formed by CCP4 between TED and the core of C3b may maintain the position of TED while the connecting CUB domain undergoes further cleavage. This suggested function is supported by disease-related mutations in either FH CCP4 (refs. <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and in TED of C3b<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, which indicates a functional importance for RCA interactions with TED.</p>

        <title>Mapping of disease-related mutations</title>
        <p id="P15">The complex structure provides a structural basis for understanding the effects of six disease-related mutations that can be found in domains CCP1-4 of FH. In a first step, we examined those three mutations (R60G, P204L, K206Î) that are directly located at the C3b-FH(1â4) interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). In case of the aHUS-related mutant R60G<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, a salt bridge between the guanidium group of Arg60 in FH CCP1 and the acidic Asp732 of Î±âNT in C3b was lost by the mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref> online). In FH CCP4, the backbone amide of Lys206 formed a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of Glu1138 in TED, whereas the lysine side chain formed an intra-molecular salt bridge with the carboxylate of Glu213 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref> online). The MPGN-II-associated deletion of this residue is likely to severely alter the local structure in CCP4, which would explain the reduced binding to C3b and loss of regulatory functions of FH<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. In the aHUS-related mutant P240L<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, the <italic>cis</italic>-peptide conformation of Pro240 is likely to be essential for binding of CCP4 into a pocket formed by both MG1 and TED of C3b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref> online) and its mutation may directly affect the C3b-FH interaction. The remaining three mutations (V44I, R35H and R109L) were not located at the C3b-FH interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8d,e</xref> online). The V44I mutant is not only associated with AMD and MPGN-II<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> but was recently found to show a strong association with polypodial choroidal vasculopathy<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. Val44 is part of the hydrophobic core of the CCP1 domain and may therefore affect domain stability. Indeed, NMR studies demonstrated an effect on thermal stability of V44I , whereas only subtle structural differences could be detected between wild-type and mutant proteins<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Arg35 of the aHUS-related mutation R35H<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> was solvent-exposed and located on the bottom part of CCP1 opposite to the C3b-interaction surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8d</xref> online). Though little structural rearrangements have been observed for the R35H mutant<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, its localization on the putative FI-interaction face of FH may affect the binding to FI. The mutation R109L has been found in two patients with MPGN-II<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. As the hydrophobic portion of the arginine side chain was buried in the hydrophobic core of the CCP2 domain packing against the conserved Trp116 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8e</xref> online), this mutation possibly affects the folding or stability of CCP2.</p>
        <p id="P16">Recently, a number of aHUS-linked mutations were also described for C3<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>; they showed large effects on C3b-MCP and smaller effects on C3b-FH binding. Mutations R570Q or R570W, A1072V, Q1139K were all located at the C3b-FH interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and decreased the binding of FH by 10â50 %<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. In case of R570Q and R570W, the replacement of Arg570 may lead to a loss of electrostatic interactions (at 4 Ã distance) with Glu98 of FH (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8f</xref> online). In the A1072V mutant, the bulkier side chain of valine may sterically hinder interactions with Tyr225 of FH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8g</xref> online) and reduce C3b-FH binding. Mutation Q1139K introduces a positive charge that possibly leads to a salt bridge between Lys1139 and the preceding Asp1138 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8h</xref> online) and likely modifies the interactions with FH. Other mutations in the TED domain, such as D1093N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), may not be connected with FH(1â4) but rather with the secondary C3b binding site at CCP19-20 (ref. <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P17">Tight regulation of the complement response on host cells and in circulation is critical for providing selectivity against foreign cells and preventing complement-mediated tissue damage. Considering their essential role in immune response and the increasing number of diseases with known or suspected involvement of complement regulators, detailed knowledge about the underlying molecular processes is very much desired. Our data is of high importance, in this respect, as it yields the first structure of C3b in complex with a complement regulator. It not only provides an insight into the function of the most abundant regulator, FH, but also allows us to develop more general models of complement regulation. In agreement with previous observations<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, the N-terminal four out of 20 CCP domains of FH were functionally sufficient and showed both decay acceleration and cofactor activity. Fragment FH(1â4) bound C3b in an extended configuration, which results in a remarkable long contact interface that covers the whole flank of C3b. The interface involved all four N-terminal CCP domains of FH and multiple domains of C3b including Î±âNT, MG1, 2, 6 and 7, CUB and TED. Despite this large interface, the binding affinity of the two molecules was rather low, with a K<sub>D</sub> of 11 ÂµM. This result is in good agreement with a previous study that compared the binding affinities of several FH fragments to C3b and is in a similar range as FH(19â20) but much weaker than full-length FH<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P18">The structure of the C3b-FH(1â4) complex provides a molecular basis for understanding the two regulatory mechanisms, decay-acceleration and cofactor activity, by which proteins of the RCA family protect host cells. Based on the structure comparison of C3b-FH(1â4) and C3bBb<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, we conclude that decay acceleration is mainly mediated by the first two N-terminal CCP domains of FH, which bind the Î±âNT, MG2 and MG6-7 domains of C3b. These domains likely dislocate the Bb protease fragment by electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance from the convertase. The conserved location of functional residues in the homologous domains CCP2-3 of DAF suggest that similar displacement effects also play a role in case of this regulator<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Nevertheless, DAF and FH may differ in their precise mechanisms of dislocating Bb from C3b, as a direct interaction with Bb was only observed for DAF but not for FH<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. We therefore hypothesize that DAF interacts with the Î²F-Î±7 loop of the VWA domain in Bb and hence induces a low-affinity conformation of the MIDAS that mediates binding of Bb to the C-terminus of C3b. More structural data, such as C3b-DAF and DAF-Bb complexes, are needed to understand the difference in the precise mechanisms of DAF and FH.</p>
      <p id="P19">Our data further suggest that the cofactor activity of FH in the conversion of C3b to iC3b is based on two essential mechanisms. Firstly, FH provides a contact interface for the initial binding of the protease FI to the C3b-regulator complex and brings it into close proximity of the CUB domain of C3b. The four N-terminal CCP domains of FH bind alongside the CUB domain of C3b. The structural arrangement suggests that FI may bind CCP1-3 of FH and C345C of C3b, which is supported by VCP mutagenesis data<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and CVF chimeras<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Though FI is reported to directly yet weakly bind to C3b in the absence of FH, the binding affinity substantially increases after adding FH<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. The newly formed extended binding site between FH and C3b is likely to largely improve FI-binding affinity and, as a consequence, the cleavage rate. Secondly, FH enables the sequential cleavage of C3b via stabilization of the TED-CUB arrangement with respect to the core of the C3b molecule. We show that domain CCP4 bridges the TED and MG1 domains of C3b and argue that these interactions will keep TED in place during the cleavage by FI. In contrast to FH, MCP does not bind to the Î±âNT region of C3b, which explains its lack of decay acceleration activity<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The cofactor activity of MCP, on the other hand, may be mediated in a similar way as that of FH. Recent binding experiments of disease-related mutations indicate that MCP also binds C3b via MG6 and TED<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Several of the C3 mutants that showed significant reduction in C3b-MCP binding have mutations such as R570Q, R570W, A1072V and Q1139K that are all at the C3b-FH interface<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. However, the exact binding arrangement is likely to be different between the two regulators, since the C3b binding site in domain CCP4 of MCP, as derived from mutagenesis studies<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, does not coincide fully with the corresponding site in FH CCP4.</p>
      <p id="P20">Factor H has experienced an increasing interest in biomedical sciences during the past decade as it became evident that mutations and polymorphisms of this regulator are strongly associated with diseases such as aHUS, AMD and MPGN-II<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. In case of AMD, FH is even considered the most consistent genetic risk factor<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. While some effects may be attributed to altered glycosaminoglycan binding or changes in the secondary C3b binding site on CCP19-20, a number of mutations are located in CCP1-4 and were therefore mapped on the C3b-FH(1â4) structure. Our analysis indicates that disruption of specific contacts (such as salt bridges) or the induction of local conformational changes may significantly alter the C3b-FH interface. The specific yet rather weak interaction between C3b and FH(1â4) may be essential for a fast and selective complement regulation, but also makes FH prone to functional interference by even small modifications in its sequence. The described mutations are therefore likely to weaken the affinity, which may lead to a loss of regulatory activity and, finally, to apparent disease states.</p>
      <p id="P21">In conclusion, our structural data provide an important framework for understanding the two key molecular mechanisms of host protection by RCA proteins, decay acceleration and cofactor activity. We also offer a base for explaining the functional consequences of individual mutations related to dysfunctional complement regulation and associated diseases. In this respect, this study may pave the way for developing therapeutics that are directed at modulating complement activation.</p>

On-chip formation and decay of the C3 convertase was observed by injecting an equimolar mixture of factor B and factor D (100 nM each) on immobilized C3b (see <bold>Supplementary Methods</bold>) for 2 min at a flow rate of 10 Âµl/min in HBS-Mg<sup>2+</sup> buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% Tween-20, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4).

(<bold>bâc</bold>) Direct binding between soluble FH(1â4) and surface-bound C3b. Injection of the FH fragment (0.08â20 ÂµM) leads to the formation of a short-lived 1:1 complex with C3b, which features a binding affinity of K<sub>D</sub> = 11 Â± 2 ÂµM. Data are representative of five experiments with different surface densities of C3b (3,000â7,000 RU; resonance units). (<bold>d</bold>) FH(1â4) features a comparable decay acceleration activity as full-length FH when injected onto surface-based C3 convertase (C3bBb). Additional details and control injections for the decay acceleration assay can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> online. Data are representative of three independent experiments. (<bold>e</bold>) The cofactor activity of FH(1â4) is similar to that of FH: incubation of C3b with FI and increasing amounts of either FH(1â4) or FH(1â20) leads to the generation of iC3b as visible by the degradation of the Î±â chain to three fragments of 43, 46, and 68 kDa, respectively. Data are representative of more than five individual experiments.</p>
