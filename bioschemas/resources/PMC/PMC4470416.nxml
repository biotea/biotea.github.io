      <abstract>
        <p>Mutations in <italic>C19orf12</italic> have been identified in patients affected by Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA), a clinical entity characterized by iron accumulation in the basal ganglia. By using western blot analysis with specific antibody and confocal studies, we showed that wild-type C19orf12 protein was not exclusively present in mitochondria, but also in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and MAM (Mitochondria Associated Membrane), while mutant C19orf12 variants presented a different localization. Moreover, after induction of oxidative stress, a GFP-tagged C19orf12 wild-type protein was able to relocate to the cytosol. On the contrary, mutant isoforms were not able to respond to oxidative stress. High mitochondrial calcium concentration and increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced apoptosis were found in fibroblasts derived from one patient as compared to controls. C19orf12 protein is a 17 kDa mitochondrial membrane-associated protein whose function is still unknown. Our <italic>in silico</italic> investigation suggests that, the glycine zipper motifs of C19orf12 form helical regions spanning the membrane. The N- and C-terminal regions with respect to the transmembrane portion, on the contrary, are predicted to rearrange in a structural domain, which is homologs to the N-terminal regulatory domain of the magnesium transporter MgtE, suggesting that C19orf12 may act as a regulatory protein for human MgtE transporters. The mutations here described affect respectively one glycine residue of the glycine zipper motifs, which are involved in dimerization of transmembrane helices and predicted to impair the correct localization of the protein into the membranes, and one residue present in the regulatory domain, which is important for protein-protein interaction.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The acronym NBIA identifies a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous rare pathological conditions, characterized by progressive extra-pyramidal disorders and by evidence of focal iron accumulation in the brain, especially in basal ganglia, and globus pallidus, observed in MRI studies.</p>
      <p>Recently, thanks to the identification of new disease genes in these years there has been an increasing knowledge about NBIA, but pathomechanisms underlining these disorders are still not completely clear. Up to now 10 genes have been associated with specific forms of NBIA (Kalman et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Only two forms inherited as autosomal dominant and recessive traits respectively are caused by mutations in genes coding for proteins directly involved in iron metabolism: neuroferritinopathy due to ferritin light chain gene (<italic>FTL)</italic> (MIM#606159) mutation (Chinnery et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and aceruloplasminemia linked to mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene (CP) (MIM#117700) (McNeill et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>The other forms with autosomal recessive or X-linked transmission are due to mutations in genes (Rouault, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) coding for proteins with a variety of functions including: Coenzyme A biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, autophagy, and still unknown roles.</p>
      <p>This is the case for the <italic>C19orf12</italic> gene, coding for a mitochondrial membrane protein, which mutations are responsible for a form of disease called MPAN for Mitochondrial membrane Protein Associated Neurodegeneration (Hartig et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Mean age at onset is 9 years and the clinical phenotype is characterized by: progressive spastic para and tetraparesis, generalized dystonia, optic atrophy, motor axonal neuropathy, and psychiatric signs. T2-weighted MRI reveals hypointensities in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Mutations of <italic>C19orf12</italic> were also found in a patient with Parkinson disease (Hartig et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and post mortem examination of the brain of one MPAN patient revealed Lewy bodies, tangles, spheroids, and tau pathology, indicating a possible overlap between NBIA and more common neurodegenerative diseases. There is no direct link between <italic>C19orf12</italic> mutations and the clinical phenotype of the patients, although preliminary evidence suggests for this gene a role in lipid homeostasis (Hartig et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Recently, a Drosophila model (Iuso et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) has been generated, which shows neurological problems that can resemble the clinical features present in patients.</p>
      <p>To gain insight into the functional properties of wild-type and mutant encoded proteins, corresponding to homozygous mutations Q96P and G58S, identified in two affected patients (Panteghini et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we performed immunolocalization and confocal assays under normal and stress conditions. Since no structural information are available on <italic>C19orf12</italic>, we also exploited molecular modeling techniques and we predicted that the protein has transmembrane helices with glycine-zipper motifs and a soluble domain that is homologous to the N-regulatory domain of bacterial MgtE transporter. The mutations identified in the patients are predicted to structurally destabilize both the glycines of the transmembrane zipper motif and the soluble domain, where the Q96P especially may impair the helical structure of the fourth Î±-helix of the homology model, which correspond to helix Î±6 of the bacterial domain.</p>

        <title>Cloning procedures and plasmid vectors mutagenesis</title>
        <p>Human <italic>C19orf12</italic> was cloned in the pCMV-AC-GFP (OriGene) vector containing a C-terminal green fluorescent protein. cDNA was amplified by PCR from pCMV-AC-GFP construct with primers carrying c-myc tag (underlined sequence) described below, and cloning in the pcDNA3.1(-), in order to obtain a recombinant protein with a smaller tag than the GFP-one. The cDNA was PCR amplified with these primers:</p>
        <p>Fw: 5â²-TCTGCCGCCGCGATCGCCATGGAGA-3â²</p>
        <p>Rv: 5â²-CGGTTATCACAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATGAGCTTTTGCTCGTCATCATACTGGATCTCGG-3â²</p>
        <p>The mutant versions corresponding to the G58S and Q96P were obtained by site directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit Stratagene). The corresponding modified primers used to generate mutated allele are as follows:</p>
        <p>G58S Fw: 5â²-GGGGGTTTGGTGGGCAGCCCACCGGGACTCGCC-3â²</p>
        <p>G58S Rv: 5â²-GGCGAGTCCCGGTGGGCTGCCCACCAAACCCCC-3â²</p>

        <p>Q96P Rv: 5â²-GGCTTCGTTAAAGAGCCTCTGTGGCTCGGCAGGGGG-3â²</p>
        <p>We use also a vector containing the mkate2 red fluorescent protein (Envrogen) additionally to the GFP in order to perform live imaging experiments. Cloning Procedures and Plasmid Vectors pmKate2-N-c19orf12 was obtained as follows. The two original plasmids pCMV6-AC-GFP and pmKate2-N contained appropriate restriction sites to allow cloning in the EcoRI-XhoI for the first one and EcoRI-SalI for the second one. XhoI and SalI produce compatible cohesive ends and produce recleavable ligation products. All cloned fragments were sequenced to check the absence of mutations. Restriction-enzyme digestions, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> transformation, and plasmid extractions were performed with standard methods.</p>

        <p>HeLa and HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Euroclone), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were seeded 36 h before transfection onto round glass coverslips for imaging or 13-mm diameter petri dishes for aequorin experiments, or in 10-cm petri dishes for immunoblot and fractionation experiments. Cells were allowed to grow to 50% confluence, then transfected with a standard calcium phosphate procedure (Sambrook and Russell, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and used in the experiments 36-h post-transfection.</p>

        <p>HeLa cells were co-transfected with wild-type or mutant C19orf12 fused in frame with mkate2 fluorescent marker and with the ER marker GFPâSec61-Î². Thirty six hour after transfection, cells were stained with the mitochondrial dye Mitotracker Deep Red 200 nM in PBS for 10 min at 37Â°. After washing cells were imaged with and LSM510 confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63X/1.4 n.a. Oil objective and acquired with a pixel size of 142 nm.</p>

        <p>HeLa cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged C19orf12 wild-type or mutant chimeras and the mitochondrial marker mtDsRed using calcium phosphate method. Thirty six hour after transfection, time-lapse recording were performed with a Nikon Swept Field Confocal equipped with CFI Plan Apo VC60XH objective (numerical aperture, 1.4) (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA) and an Andor DU885 electron multiplying charge- coupled device (EM-CCD) camera (Andor Technology Ltd, Belfast, Northern Ireland), the overall image sampling was below the resolution limit (X and Y pixel size: 133 nm). Coverslips were placed in an incubated chamber with controlled temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> and humidity; images were then acquired with a differential frequency during the experiment: cells were placed in 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> KRB and basal fluorescence images were acquired for 5 min; then cells were stimulated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (500 Î¼M final), and fluorescence images were acquired for 1 h and 30 min.</p>

        <title>Image analysis</title>
        <p>Acquired images were then analyzed by using open source software Fiji. Images were corrected for spectral bleedthrough using the Spectral Unmixing plugin (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/spectral-unmixing.html">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/spectral-unmixing.html</ext-link>). Then, single cells were analyzed, and, for each of those, the Manders' overlap coefficient was obtained using the JACOP plugin (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/jacop.html">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/jacop.html</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>Isolated mitochondria from cultured cells were obtained according to the protocol described (Fernandez-Vizarra et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in 100 ml of potassium phosphate buffer [(PP) buffer, 20 mM, pH 7.8, KCl 150 mM] and sonicated 10 s for three times at 10 Amp. The suspension was centrifuged at 164000 g for 30 min at 48C. Supernatant (mitochondrial matrix and inter-membrane space) was collected, and pellet (mitochondrial membranes) was resuspended in 100 ml of PP buffer.</p>

        <p>Hek cells (Wieckowski et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline medium, pelleted by centrifugation at 500 Ã g for 5 min, resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose and 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4) and gently disrupted by dounce homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 600 Ã g for 5 min to remove cellular debris and nuclei, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 10.300 Ã g for 10 min to pellet crude mitochondria. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 100.000 Ã g for 1 h in a Beckman 70 Ti rotor at 40C to pellet microsomes, which were resuspended in homogenization buffer. The mitochondrial pellet, resuspended in isolation medium (250 mM mannitol, 5 mM Hepes (pH7.4), and 0.5 mM EGTA) was layered on top of 8 ml of Percoll medium [225 mM mannitol, 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, and 30% Percoll (v/v)] in a 10-ml polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 30 min at 95.000 Ã g. A dense band containing purified mitochondria, recovered approximately 3/4 down the tube, was removed, diluted with isolation medium, washed twice by centrifugation at 6.300 Ã g for 10 min to remove the Percoll, and finally resuspended in isolation medium. MAM, removed from the Percoll gradient as a diffuse white band located above the mitochondria, were diluted in isolation medium and centrifuged at 6.300 Ã g for 10 min. The supernatant containing MAM was centrifuged at 100.000 Ã g for 1 h in a Beckman 70 Ti rotor, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in the homogenization buffer.</p>
        <p>The quality of the preparation was checked by western blot analysis using different markers for the fractions obtained: IP3R was used as marker of ER, tubulin as marker of cytoplasm and the Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) as marker for mitochondria.</p>

        <p>To demonstrate sub-cellular localization we performed Western-blot analysis on HeLa cells transfected with MYC-tagged <italic>C19orf12</italic> cDNA. Western-blot analysis showed that wild-type <italic>C19orf12</italic> gene product was present into the mitochondrial membranes but also in the lysate and cytosol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p>

        <p>Because of its putative function in lipid metabolism (Hartig et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) we reasoned that the protein could have additional sub-cellular localizations. To demonstrate this we isolated different HEK293 fractions containing: crude mitochondria, pure mitochondria, membrane associated mitochondria (MAM), and ER.</p>
        <p>Western-blot analysis of the different sub-cellular fractions using a specific C19orf12 antibody, indicated that the wild-type protein was present in both mitochondria and ER (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) under naÃ¯ve condition. Moreover, a small fraction of the protein was also detected in the MAM, which represent physical association between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum important for the transport of phospholipids (Patergnani et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Marchi et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
        <p>Antibodies specific to proteins known to be located into different sub-cellular compartments were used as controls. In particular, Inositol 3 Phosphate receptor 3 (IP3R3) was used as marker of ER, tubulin as marker of cytoplasm and the VDAC as marker for mitochondria.</p>
        <p>To understand the localization of the mutant C19orf12 proteins, we performed Western-blot analysis on HeLa cells transfected with <italic>C19orf12</italic> versions, carrying the point mutations G58S and Q96P. The level of overexpression of Myc-tagged versions in relation to endogenous C19orf12 was evaluated by Real-time PCR and an histogram is reported in Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>.</p>
        <p>In the presence of G58S mutation, located in the predicted transmembrane domain, the mutant protein is also found in the mitochondrial matrix (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). On the contrary the Q96P mutation has no effect on the localization of the protein, which is mainly present in the mitochondrial membranes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) as observed for the wild-type protein.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of autophagy</title>
        <p>In order to understand the nature of the aggregates formed by the wild-type protein, surrounding mitochondria, we performed colocalization study using the specific autophagy marker LC3. Confocal live imaging of LC3 vesicles and C19orf12 displayed that the C19orf12 redistribution induced by oxidative stress inversely correlated. Indeed while H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced aggregates formation it also reduces the amount of LC3 vescicles (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2A</xref>). The amount of colocalized dots increased about 50% in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2Aiv</xref>). Overall 3D confocal microscopy display that only a minor proportion of LC3-EGFP puncta co-localize with C19orf12-mKate2 aggregates after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2B</xref>). Nonetheless, the effect of C19orf12 on autophagy was evaluated. Coexpression of the autophagic reporter LC3-EGFP and of C19orf12-mKate2 displays a higher amount of EGFP punctae (autophagosomes) compared to cells expressing the autophagic marker with the pmKate2 empty vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). This data was corroborated by analysis of endogenous LC3 marker. Overexpression of the EGFP tagged wild type C19orf12 induce the conversion of the autophagic marker LC3 heavy form (LC3I) to the light form (LC3II) compared to cells transfected with the empty EGFP vector, indicating the elevation of basal autophagic levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). In both assays the LC3 conversion was further stimulated when inducing autophagy by exposing cells to EBSS medium. The promoted conversion of LC3 induced by C19orf12-EGFP overexpression did not appear as a blocked autophagic flux. In fact, overexpression of this plasmid was sufficient to induce a reduction of the autophagic marker p62. This protein is usually required for autophagosome formation and its levels are expected to decrease during autophagy due to degradation of autophagosome content (Klionsky et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Indeed treatment with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl lead to impaired acidification of autophagosomal content and inhibition of autophagosome degradation, with concomitant LC3 conversion and p62 accumulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>).</p>

In support of this observation, the overexpression of the vectors carrying the mutant forms G58S and Q96P was unable to induce LC3 conversion suggesting a localization dependent role for C19orf12 in regulation of autophagy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p>

        <p>We carried out both secondary structure prediction of the full <italic>C19orf12</italic> sequence and modeling of the predicted soluble region (<italic>C19orf12<sub>1â40/81â151</sub></italic>) to both understand functional and structural properties of the wild-type protein and the effects of the mutations. C19orf12 was predicted to contains two Î±-helices located in the trans-membrane (TM) region (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">3</xref>) rich in glycine residues, of which several have been found mutated in MPAN patients: G58S (Panteghini et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), G53R, G65E, G69R, (LandourÃ© et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) <italic>C19orf12</italic> contains in the transmembrane helix glycine zipper motifs, (GxxxGxxxG) (Kruer et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The most significant glycine zipper patterns in proteins that have been reported so far are (G,A,S)XXXGXXXG and GXXXGXXX(G,S,T) (Kim et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The first motif (AXXXGXXXG) corresponding to the sequence <sub>50</sub>AFVG<bold>G</bold>LVG<bold>G</bold><sub>58</sub> where both G53R and G58S mutations occur is located in close proximity to the first TM Î±-helix. The second motif <sub>61</sub>GLAV<bold>G</bold>GAV<bold>G</bold>GLL<bold>G<sub>73</sub></bold> is longer and contains two of those repeats, with the mutations G65E and G69R. The N- and C-terminal residues (C19orf12<sub>1â41/77â151</sub>) are predicted to rearrange in a soluble three-dimensional (3D) domain homologous to the N-regulatory domain of the bacterial Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters of the MgtE (Maguire, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Payandeh et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the MgtE transporters, this domain forms a right-handed superhelical structure that includes 10 helices per two turns.</p>
        <p>Our model does not provide a reliable prediction for the first 14 amino acids of <italic>C19orf12</italic>, which would correspond to the first two helices of the right-handed superhelical motif due to poor sequence similarity with known structures of MgtE-like transporter. The rest of the domain is well conserved with respect to the bacterial homologs and in this region the Q96P is located in the middle of one of the Î± helices (corresponding to the Î±6 of the bacterial N-domain) and well packed within the domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). It is a mutation from a polar residue to a proline, which is a well-known helix-breaker. <italic>FoldX</italic> (Schymkowitz et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) energy was used to estimate the free-energy changes upon Q96P mutation. In particular, the changes in protein stability upon the mutation were estimated as the difference (ÎÎG) between the free energies of unfolding (ÎG) of the mutant and the wild-type variant. ÎÎG values above 1.6 kcal/mol are expected to significantly affect stability because they correspond to twice the standard deviation of <italic>FoldX</italic> (Schymkowitz et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) Q96P mutation is predicted to impair protein stability of 5.4 Â± 0.3 kcal/mol, (Guerois et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) suggesting a loss of protein stability upon this mutation In the model structure, Gln96 is predicted to be involved in side-chain hydrogen bonds, as the one with Ser124, located in the loop than connect helices Î±8 and Î±9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The structural rearrangement caused by Q96P mutation might influence the network of polar interactions mediated by Gln95.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><italic>C19orf12</italic> was reported to code for a mitochondrial membrane protein probably involved in lipid metabolism (Hartig et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). We here demonstrated that C19orf12 protein is not only present in mitochondria but also in ER and MAM. These are zones of close contact between ER and mitochondria, which support communication between the two organelles as concerning lipid transfer and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions exchange. This activity regulates several processes including: ER chaperone-assisted folding of newly synthesized proteins, modulation of mitochondria-localized dehydrogenases involved in ATP-producing Krebs cycle reactions, activation of Calcium-dependent enzymes that execute cell death programs (Berridge, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). We observed that the G58S mutant protein was also present into the mitochondrial matrix and we reasoned whether this different sub-cellular localization could also affect its functionality. The C19orf12 protein belongs to the clan of glycine zipper containing membrane domains (Kim et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The majority of C19orf12 mutations are clustered in a functional region, which is crucial for this superfamily of proteins and is characterized, in the TM regions, by long and repeated glycine-zipper motifs, generally GxxxGxxxG. This is a common motif in several multimeric known membrane channel structures, where the glycine faces are in direct contacts (Kim et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Notably, this pattern is statistically over-represented in membrane proteins in general (Kim et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). It has been indeed proposed to be the driving force for right-handed packing against a neighboring helix. It has also been suggested to play a crucial role in gating mechanisms (Kim et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The glycine zipper motifs of C19orf12 suggest that they are involved in the interaction between the two TM helices of this protein, even if we cannot rule out also a putative involvement in homo-dimerization. Mutations of the glycines of the glycine-zipper motif to charged or polar residues, as observed in the mutant C19orf12 patients, were likely to impair the correct localization of the protein in the membrane. These bioinformatics predictions fully agreed with the experimental data obtained by western-blot investigation. Indeed, we observed a prevalent cytosolic localization of the mutant G58S protein, while the fraction present in mitochondria was also found in the matrix, indicating that the protein was not tightly bound to the membrane.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, glycine zipper motifs have been found in Ap and PrP, which are associated with Alzheimer's and prion diseases. A neuropathological hallmark of both Alzheimer's disease and spongiform encephalopathies includes the formation of deposits in the brain such as amyloid plaques, glial responses and neurofibrillary tangle (Jeffrey, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It is important to notice that histopathological examination of the brain from a single MPAN patient also revealed the presence of Lewy bodies, tangles, spheroids, and tau pathology (Hartig et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), suggesting a possible common pathological role for the motif in these neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
      <p>We predicted that C19orf12 soluble domain is homologous to the N-terminal regulatory domain of bacterial MgtE transporters. The comparison of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free and âbound structures of a MgtE transporter (Hattori et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and NMR experiments (Imai et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) showed a rearrangement of the N-domain upon Mg<sup>2+</sup>-interaction. Moreover, MgtE variants lacking the N-terminal subdomains showed a reduced Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inhibition and an increased open probability, implicating this subdomain in MgtE function and regulation (Hattori et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), acting as a sensor of Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. In eukaryotic organisms, MgtE-like genes belong to the SCL41 family and their precise role is unknown (Fleig et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Schweigel-RÃ¶ntgen and Kolisek, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Interestingly, the N-terminal regulatory domain of bacterial MgtE is missing in SLC41-A1, thus implying that the eukaryotic transporters evolved different mechanisms of regulation (Schweigel-RÃ¶ntgen and Kolisek, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The homology of the soluble portion of C19orf12 with this bacterial subdomain, and its localization in membrane, would support a function for C19orf12 as a regulatory domain of eukaryotic MgtE-like proteins, different from SLC41-A1.</p>
      <p><italic>In silico</italic> investigation of the Q96P predicted for this mutation to cause loss of side-chain mediated hydrogen bonds and to affect the correct architecture of a central Î±-helix in the 3D structure of the C19orf12 soluble domain homologous to the N-terminal regulatory domain of bacterial MgtE transporters. This suggests a possible role of the Î± domain in the interaction and regulation of C19orf12 protein with human MgtE-like transporters, acting as a regulatory protein.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, deficiency of systemic and intracellular magnesium (Mg) has long been suspected to contribute to the development and progression of Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases, although the molecular mechanism is still unknown (Kolisek et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>To gain insight into the pathogenic role of C19orf12 in MPAN we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations by challenging the cells with stressful conditions and by evaluating the response of the wild-type and mutant C19orf12 proteins.</p>
      <p>We proved that the wild-type C19orf12 protein was able to respond to oxidative stress by enriching its cytoplasmic localization and forming aggregates, which partially co-localized with mitochondria. On the contrary, both C19orf12 mutant proteins were insensitive to oxidative stress and did not form aggregates. In light of the recent observation, that the ERâmitochondria contact sites are important in autophagosome formation (Hamasaki et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) we proposed a putative role for C19orf12, in control of autophagy. In support of this hypothesis we observed that overexpression of wild-type C19orf12 resulted in conversion of autophagic marker LC3 and reduction of levels of p62. On the contrary, induction of delocalization by oxidative stress results in reduction of autophagy LC3 conversion. Interestingly, the overexpression of mutants, unable to properly gain its intracellular localization, fails to promote autophagy induction and levels of basal autophagy remain unchanged during exposure to oxidative stress.</p>
      <p>Live imaging suggested that delocalization of C19orf12 appears related to existence of LC3-vescicles. Indeed the progressive accumulation of C19orf12 in cytoplasm and its accumulations in aggregates were concomitant with the reduction in number of LC3-EGFP vesicles. Furthermore, the amount LC3-EGFP vescicles co-localizing with C19orf12 was extremely low. Since it was reported that the marker LC3-EGFP could produce non-autophagosome related aggregates (Kuma et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), also C19orf12 aggregates co-localizing with LC3 puncta have dimension larger then 1.5 Î¼m (average feret 1.98 Î¼m, SEM 0.17, <italic>n</italic> = 9) suggesting that these were not autophagosomes. These results would therefore suggest that the C19orf12 is contemporary able to exert an inhibitory effect on apoptosis induction and a stimulatory effect on autophagy. The loss of autophagy induction observed after mutants overexpression and the increased sensitivity to apoptosis in patients-derived fibroblasts carrying mis-localized mutants, suggests that C19orf12 can induce protective autophagy at the expense of apoptosis and that this effect could be dependent on its intracellular localization.</p>
      <p>These results suggest that C19orf12 could be involved in removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by selective autophagy (in a fashion independent on aggregates formation). Considering that MPAN disease mainly affects the brain, it is well possible that neurons carrying C19orf12 mutations, could accumulate altered mitochondria which can't be removed because of the presence of C19orf12 mutations, and could degenerate and/or eventually die. Nonetheless the present results about the role of C19orf12 in regulation of autophagy will require more detailed studies in future.</p>
      <p>Finally, we also observed high levels of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in fibroblasts derived from patients as compared to control, suggesting that the mutations altering the intracellular distribution of C19orf12 is detrimental for proper mitochondrial function and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. As a consequence, patient-derived fibroblasts were more sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent apoptotic stimuli like H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced death as compared to control fibroblasts.</p>
      <p>We here demonstrated that C19orf12 protein involved in NBIA is located in mitochondria and also present in the ER as previously reported (LandourÃ© et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and MAM. Moreover, we proposed a role for this protein as a sensor of mitochondrial damage. We also demonstrated that patients-derived fibroblasts accumulated high levels of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and were more prone to oxidative stress induced apoptosis. Altogether these data shed new light in the field of NBIA focusing the attention on the role of mitochondria-ER connection in the transfer of essential lipids, in calcium metabolism and in autophagosome formation (Hamasaki et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which are fundamental for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and for determination of cell fate under pathological condition. A role of MAM has been recently proposed in another neurodegenerative disorder that is Alzheimer's disease (Schon and Area-Gomez, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) with the demonstration that presenilin 1 and 2 are predominantly located into these specialized structures. It is well possible that proteins such as presenilin 1 and 2, and C19orf12, can shuttle between different sub-cellular compartments depending on the cells status. Moreover, molecular homology modeling suggested a putative role for C19orf12 in regulation of magnesium transport. Magnesium homeostasis is crucial for learning and memory and has a positive effect on synaptic plasticity and density (Barbagallo et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Slutsky et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Moreover, magnesium and calcium work together to modulate ion channels, which open in response to nerve impulses triggering neurotransmitter release (Slutsky et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Bardgett et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). These observations are particularly relevant in the context of a neurodegenerative disease such as NBIA, but dedicated experiments are required to further demonstrate this hypothesis.</p>
