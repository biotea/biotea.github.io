      <abstract>
        <p>The formation of the active spliceosome, its recruitment to active areas of transcription, and its role in pre-mRNA splicing depends on the association of a number of multifunctional serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. ZNF265 is an arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain containing zinc finger protein with conserved pre-mRNA splicing protein motifs. Here we show that ZNF265 immunoprecipitates from splicing extracts in association with mRNA, and that it is able to alter splicing patterns of Tra2-Î²1 transcripts in a dose-dependent manner in HEK 293 cells. Yeast two-hybrid analysis and immunoprecipitation indicated interaction of ZNF265 with the essential splicing factor proteins U1-70K and U2AF<sup>35</sup>. Confocal microscopy demonstrated colocalization of ZNF265 with the motor neuron gene product SMN, the snRNP protein U1-70K, the SR protein SC35, and with the transcriptosomal components p300 and YY1. Transfection of HT-1080 cells with ZNF265âEGFP fusion constructs showed that nuclear localization of ZNF265 required the RS domain. Alignment with other RS domainâcontaining proteins revealed a high degree of SR dipeptide conservation. These data show that ZNF265 functions as a novel component of the mRNA processing machinery.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gene transcription and pre-mRNA splicing are dynamic and highly coordinated processes that occur in a spatially organized manner in the nucleus (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Singer and Green, 1997</xref>). Splicing takes place in the spliceosome, a large RNAâprotein complex composed of various small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> and many other protein factors that include members of the highly conserved serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family. SR proteins, by RNAâprotein and proteinâprotein interactions, coordinate the passage of the spliceosomal complex though the splicing reaction (reviewed in <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fu, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Manley and Tacke, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">CÃ¡ceres et al., 1997</xref>). SR protein recruitment to active areas of transcription and RNA processing involves their signature arginine/serine-rich (RS) domains and an interaction with RNA polymerase II through its COOH-terminal domain (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Yuryev et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Du and Warren, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Misteli and Spector, 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>RS domains mediate proteinâprotein interactions with other general splicing factors during the formation of the spliceosome. By yeast two-hybrid for example, interactions of the SR proteins SC35 and SF2/ASF with both U1-70K and U2AF<sup>35</sup> have been documented, the latter two proteins functionally binding to the 5â² and 3â² splice sites, respectively, in early splicing complexes (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Maniatis, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cao and Garcia-Blanco, 1998</xref>). Binding of SR proteins to exonic splicing enhancers generally stimulates splicing (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dirksen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; reviewed in <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Blencowe, 2000</xref>), but antagonism of splice site recognition has also been observed (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Labourier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barnard and Patton, 2000</xref>). Many of the functions of SR proteins are facilitated by a meshwork of interacting factors that promote the passage of the splicing reaction and participate in postsplicing processes such as mRNA transport, which appears to be coupled to splicing (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">CÃ¡ceres et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Belshan et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>ZNF265 (formally termed âZisâ) is a zinc fingerâ and RS domainâcontaining protein (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Karginova et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2000</xref>) that was first identified, along with renin, because of its modulated expression in differentiating renal juxtaglomerular cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Karginova et al., 1997</xref>); it is now known to be expressed by most tissues, especially early in development (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2000</xref>). We have also found that the nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the zinc fingers accords with RNA binding (Plambeck, C.A., D.J. Adams., L. van der Weyden., J.P. Mackay, and B.J. Morris. <italic>22<sup>nd</sup> Ann. Conf. Org. Express. Genome.</italic> 2001. Abstr. 2â28). Therefore, we explored the function of ZNF265 by demonstrating its localization within cells, identifying the other proteins that it binds to in splicing complexes, and showing its potential to modulate alternative splicing in cells.</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p>Using a polyclonal ZNF265 antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
A) and antibodies directed against specific components of the spliceosome, we observed nuclear colocalization of ZNF265 with the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein, the authentic SR protein SC35 (at the periphery of the SC35-staining aggregates), and the snRNP protein U1-70K, but none with the common snRNP protein antigen Sm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). As expected, SMN showed some cytoplasmic localization (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pagliardini et al., 2000</xref>), but this did not overlap with the trace amount of cytoplasmic ZNF265 localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). ZNF265 also colocalized with the transcription factors YY1 and p300 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), both of which have been shown to colocalize within active transcriptional compartments and, in the case of p300, with RNA polymerase II (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bannister and Kouzarides, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ogryzko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">von Mikecz et al., 2000</xref>). These colocalizations are consistent with a role for ZNF265 in transcription and/or splicing. In this regard, ZNF265 may be cotranscriptionally recruited with RNA polymerase II to pre-mRNA transcripts, as has been reported for other RS domainâcontaining proteins (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Corden and Patturajan, 1997</xref>).</p>

      <p>To determine the region of ZNF265 necessary for its nuclear localization, cDNA expression plasmids were generated from which specific domains were deleted. Compared with the nuclear localization of the wild-type ZNF265 fusion protein (C2-ZNF265), fusions containing the zinc finger with (C2-Mut3) or without (C2-Mut2) the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) showed a predominantly cytoplasmic distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>)
. In contrast, nuclear localization was preserved when the RS domain was retained, either with (C2-Mut4) or without (C2-Mut5) the NLS. Consistent with this observation, nuclear localization was not affected by mutation of the NLS (C2-Mut6). Thus, nuclear localization is dictated by the RS domain of ZNF265, consistent with the behavior of other RS proteins such as SC35 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hedley et al., 1995</xref>), SF2/ASF, SRp20, and 9G8 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">CÃ¡ceres et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p>

      <p>To test whether ZNF265 could interact with other RS domainâcontaining proteins we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen against representative spliceosomal proteins that included many with RS domains, namely U1-70K, U2AF<sup>35</sup>, U2AF<sup>65</sup>, SC35, p80 Coilin, WT1, 9G8, SF2/ASF, SRp20, SRp30c, and SRp40. Interaction was seen with U1-70K and U2AF<sup>35</sup>, as determined by growth on SD-L-W-A-H plates, and the production of a blue precipitate on a Î²-gal filter assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>
A). Interaction of ZNF265 with U1-70K and U2AF<sup>35</sup> was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). Liquid Î²-gal assay, which provides a semiquantitative estimation of interaction strength, showed that ZNF265 interacted more strongly with U1-70K than with U2AF<sup>35</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). A U1-70K cDNA clone was also isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen against a human fetal brain cDNA library using ZNF265 as âbait.â Analysis of this clone revealed that residues 180â437 of U1-70K were responsible for mediating the interaction of U1-70K with the RS domain of ZNF265 (unpublished data). It is notable that this region contains the residues necessary for the binding of SF2/ASF to U1-70K (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cao and Garcia-Blanco, 1998</xref>). Several cDNA clones for the SR protein kinase Clk1 were also isolated from this screen. Because ZNF265 contains the Clk1 consensus phosphorylation site R/KXR/KXR/KXSXXR (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Colwill et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Moeslein et al., 1999</xref>), there may be a role for phosphorylation in the regulation of ZNF265.</p>

      <p>The fact that ZNF265 interacts with U1-70K and U2AF<sup>35</sup> points to its early commitment to the spliceosome, as the latter factors are necessary for the first detectable association between splice sites during formation of the E complex (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Michaud and Reed, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Maniatis, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Xiao and Manley, 1998</xref>). Based on the composition of affinity-purified E complex, this association has been proposed to occur though direct or indirect interaction of U1snRNP and U2AF<sup>35</sup> bound to the 5â² and 3â² splice sites, respectively (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Michaud and Reed, 1993</xref>). One model has suggested that SF2/ASF or SC35 was subsequently able to form a bridge between U1-70K and U2AF<sup>35</sup> (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Maniatis, 1993</xref>). In contrast to the interaction of SF2/ASF and SC35 with U1-70K and U2AF<sup>35</sup> (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Maniatis, 1993</xref>), our finding that ZNF265 interacts more strongly with U1-70K than with U2AF<sup>35</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C) suggests earlier binding of ZNF265 to U1-70K, as opposed to U2AF<sup>35</sup>, during recruitment to the spliceosome.</p>
      <p>Alignment of the RS domain of ZNF265 with that of other RS domainâcontaining spliceosomal proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>)
showed strong SR dipeptide conservation; this was particularly evident between ZNF265, SC35, and SRp40. The aligned region of SC35 contains the putative RS domain NLS, RRRRRSRSRSRSRSRSRSRSRYSRSKSRSR-TRSRSRSTSKSRS (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hedley et al., 1995</xref>).</p>

      <p>The specific recognition of splice sites within pre-mRNA precursors has been proposed as a control point for splicing. RS domain proteins could play a major role in such regulation, as they are required for the early recognition of splice sites during spliceosome assembly. Thus, the structural features of ZNF265, its nuclear localization, and its association with U1-70K and U2AF<sup>35</sup> prompted us to investigate a functional role for this protein in pre-mRNA splicing.</p>
      <p>In vitro splicing reactions showed that ZNF265 is immunoprecipitated in a complex that includes spliced mRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>
A). This result indicates that ZNF265 binds directly or indirectly to mRNA, but much less to pre-mRNA. This property is shared with other splicing factors, such as SF2/ASF and RNPS1 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hanamura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mayeda et al., 1999</xref>), both of which synergistically stimulate general splicing. Here we show in splicing assays in cultured cells that ZNF265 can regulate alternative splicing in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). Namely, overexpression of ZNF265 resulted in exclusion of exons 2 and 3 from the Tra2-Î²1 pre-mRNA, which led to an increase in the production of the Î²3 alternatively spliced isoform. Our in vivo splicing result suggests that ZNF265 may have the ability to antagonize the alternative splicing activity of SR proteins on Tra2-Î²1 pre-mRNA. Splicing factor SR protein-mediated antagonism of alternative 5â² splice site selection has been reported for human hnRNP A1 protein in that hnRNP A1 causes activation of distal alternative 5â² splice site and exon exclusion in vitro and in vivo (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Mayeda and Krainer, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mayeda et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">CÃ¡ceres et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1994</xref>). In contrast to hnRNP A1 that does not cause inhibition of general constitutive splicing, we have shown that addition of recombinant ZNF265 to SR protein-deficient HeLa cell S100 extracts supplemented with recombinant SF2/ASF may antagonize constitutive splicing of a Î²-globin pre-mRNA substrate and repress its splicing (our unpublished data). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, RSF1 protein antagonizes and represses splicing by binding to SF2/ASF and preventing it from interacting with U1-70K (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Labourier et al., 1999</xref>). It is possible that ZNF265 may also interfere with SF2/ASF-mediated constitutive splicing by binding directly to U1-70K.</p>

<bold>Function of ZNF265 in the spliceosome.</bold> (A) In vitro splicing reactions were performed using labeled Î²-globin pre-mRNA and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, pre-immune serum, anti-SF2/ASF/anti-hnRNP A1, and increasing amounts of anti-ZNF265 (shown by triangle), immobilized on protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed extensively and RNA was extracted and analyzed by denaturing PAGE followed by autoradiography. 1/20 of total RNA recovered from the supernatant of an immunoprecipitation with control preimmune serum reflects the initial relative abundance of predicted pre-mRNA, intermediates and products, which are schematically depicted on left hand side.

      <p>The suggestion that ZNF265 binds directly to mRNA is supported by the association of the zinc finger region of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> homologue C4SR with <italic>cyclin 1B</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ladomery et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, our nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the first zinc finger of ZNF265 indicate a structure capable of binding zinc ions, which in turn induce conformational changes in the finger to expose RNA binding side chains (Plambeck, C.A., D.J. Adams, L. van der Weyden, J.P. Mackay, and B.J. Morris. <italic>22<sup>nd</sup> Ann. Conf. Org. Express. Genome.</italic> 2001. Abstr. 2â28).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have shown that ZNF265 colocalizes with the spliceosome, associates with mRNA and essential splicing factors U1-70K and U2AF<sup>35</sup>, and can regulate alternative splicing of the Tra2-Î²1 pre-mRNA. Therefore, ZNF265 is a functional component of the RNA processing machinery.</p>

        <p>In preparation for visualization of fluorescence, cells were cultured on Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in situ. The cells were then permeablized with 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h before being blocked overnight with 5% (vol/vol) goat serum in PBS. After sequential 45 min incubations at 37Â°C with the primary and secondary antibodies, the cells were stained with 300 nM DAPI (Molecular Probes) before being mounted with DABCO in PBS (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 1982</xref>). For localization studies using the ZNF265âenhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion constructs, HT-1080 cells were transfected using SuperFect (QIAGEN) on Lab-Tek chamber slides and then fixed, DAPI stained, and mounted (as described above). Two-channel fluorescent images of the cells were acquired using a 12-bit cooled CCD camera (Sensicam) attached to an epifluorescent microscope (model E800; Nikon). For ZNF265 colocalization studies, three-channel fluorescent images were acquired on a Two Photon Imaging System (TCS MP; Leica) combined with a confocal microscope (TCS SP; Spectral). Both Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 were excited using the 488 line of an argon laser, whereas DAPI was excited in two-photon mode. Sequential scan Z-sections were obtained at 0.2 Î¼m intervals, and projections through the Z-stack were created using confocal software (Leica). Colocalization scatter diagrams were created to confirm and quantify visual interpretation of single Z-sections and digitally projected images. All immunofluorescent images shown are representative of three independent experiments in which &gt;95% of at least 500 cells assessed exhibited the same morphological pattern.</p>

        <title>Plasmid constructs and subcloning</title>
        <p>Full-length ZNF265 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and subcloned into pGEM T-Easy (Promega) to create the plasmid pZNFA (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2000</xref>). pZNFA was used as a template for PCR using primers ZNF-5â²A (ctcgagtatgtcgaccaagaatttccgactc), which incorporates a 5â² XhoI site, and ZNF-3â²A (cgcgttcgaagctctcccatatg). The resulting fragment was subcloned into pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) to generate C2-ZNF265, an in-frame fusion protein between ZNF265 and EGFP. PCR was used to obtain various domains of ZNF265 as EGFP fusion clones using C2-EGFPâpEGFP-C2. Plasmid constructs and PCR primers used were: C2-Mut2 (first 96 amino acids of ZNF265), primers ZNF-5â²A and ZNF-3â²B (ttatttagcatactttggagtatta); C2-Mut3 (zinc finger domains and NLS), primers ZNF-5â²A and ZNF-3â²C (gatcttcatccttcatccctc); C2-Mut4 (NLS and RS domains), primers ZNF-5â²B (ctcgagagaatctgatggtgaatatgatg) and ZNF-3â²A; C2-Mut5 (RS domain alone), primers ZNF-5â²C, and ZNF-3â²B (ctcgagagaatcagagggagaagaagagg). PCR (PCR Supermix High Fidelity; GIBCO BRL) consisted of 35 cycles of 95, 60, and 68Â°C for 1 min each, followed by 10 min at 68Â°C. C2-Mut6 (residues, RKKKKâAAAAA) was generated from C2-ZNF265 using primers NLS5â² (gatggtgaatatgatgagtttggagctgcagcggcagcatacagagggaaagcagttgg) and NLS3â² (ccaactgctttccctctgtatgctgccgctgcagctcca-aactcatcatattcaccatc), which destroyed the core sequence of this putative NLS. PCR was as above except that annealing was at 50Â°C, followed by digestion with 30 U of DpnI for 3 h. Clones were sequenced to confirm that the mutation had been introduced correctly. The ZNF265 yeast two-hybrid construct (pGBKT7-ZNF265) was generated by subcloning a BamHI-PstI fragment of the 1-kb PCR product amplified using the primers ZNF-3â²A and ZNF-5â²D (ggatccttatgtcgaccaagaatttccgagt), with clone ZNFA as template, into pGBKT7 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.).
