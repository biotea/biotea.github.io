      <abstract>
        <p>Seckel syndrome is a recessively inherited dwarfism disorder characterized by microcephaly and a unique head profile. Genetically, it constitutes a heterogeneous condition, with several loci mapped (SCKL1-5) but only three disease genes identified: the <italic>ATR</italic>, <italic>CENPJ</italic>, and <italic>CEP152</italic> genes that control cellular responses to DNA damage. We previously mapped a Seckel syndrome locus to chromosome 18p11.31-q11.2 (SCKL2). Here, we report two mutations in the <italic>CtIP</italic> (<italic>RBBP8</italic>) gene within this locus that result in expression of C-terminally truncated forms of CtIP. We propose that these mutations are the molecular cause of the disease observed in the previously described SCKL2 family and in an additional unrelated family diagnosed with a similar form of congenital microcephaly termed Jawad syndrome. While an exonic frameshift mutation was found in the Jawad family, the SCKL2 family carries a splicing mutation that yields a dominant-negative form of CtIP. Further characterization of cell lines derived from the SCKL2 family revealed defective DNA damage induced formation of single-stranded DNA, a critical co-factor for ATR activation. Accordingly, SCKL2 cells present a lowered apoptopic threshold and hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Notably, over-expression of a comparable truncated CtIP variant in non-Seckel cells recapitulates SCKL2 cellular phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner. This work thus identifies <italic>CtIP</italic> as a disease gene for Seckel and Jawad syndromes and defines a new type of genetic disease mechanism in which a dominant negative mutation yields a recessively inherited disorder.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cellular DNA is frequently damaged through the actions of exogenous and endogenously arising DNA damaging agents. To maintain genome integrity, cells have evolved complex mechanisms to detect DNA damage, signal its presence, and mediate its repair. The importance of such mechanisms is evident because inherited defects in them can cause embryonic lethality or severe genetically inherited diseases. The clinical manifestations of such diseases are complex and include growth delay, mental retardation, skeletal abnormalities, and predisposition to cancer. While most such syndromes are inherited recessively, in some cases they are inherited dominantly. Here, we show that mutations in <italic>CtIP/RBBP8</italic> cause related disorders: Seckel and Jawad syndromes. In addition to revealing how mutated CtIP impairs responses to DNA damage in Seckel cells, we establish that, despite the recessive mode of inheritance for this syndrome, the Seckel mutation has a dominant manifestation at the cellular level. To our knowledge, this represents a new form of molecular mechanism for recessive inheritance of a human disease. Furthermore, the aberrantly spliced mRNA is expressed at very low levels and yet significantly impairs cellular functions and causes severe clinical symptoms. This should provide new awareness that even very subtle splice mutations may have pronounced pathogenic potential.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Seckel syndrome (SS) belongs to the group of genome instability disorders collectively referred to as DNA-damage response (DDR) and repair defective syndromes <xref rid="pgen.1002310-ODriscoll1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. While cancer predisposition is often associated with such syndromes, only a few cancers have been reported for SS patients. Instead, SS pathogenesis is primarily based on marked growth and neurological impairments. Moreover, in contrast to some other repair defective syndromes, SS is a heterogeneous disease with five independent loci identified: SCKL1, which bears a mutation that creates an alternative splicing site in the <italic>ATR</italic> gene <xref rid="pgen.1002310-ODriscoll2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>; SCKL2, previously mapped by us in the chromosomal region 18p11.31-q11.2 <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Borglum1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; SCKL3, mapped in the region 14q23-q24 <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Goodship1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; SCKL4 that has a mutation in the <italic>CENPJ</italic> gene <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Griffith1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>; and the recently reported SCKL5 that harbors mutations in <italic>CEP152</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1002310-Kalay1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Cells derived from all Seckel patients are impaired in signaling mediated by the DNA-damage responsive protein kinase ATR. Thus, SS cells display reduced phosphorylation of downstream ATR substrates, which include the Chk1 effector checkpoint kinase, and impaired G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint arrest upon treatment with UV light or replication blocking agents <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Cimprich1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Alderton1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Except in SCKL1 patients where ATR itself is mutated, the connections between the other SCKL loci and ATR activation are not yet clear.</p>
      <p>ATR is recruited to and activated by replication protein A (RPA)-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Cimprich1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, which arises by uncoupling of DNA polymerases and helicases at stalled DNA replication forks <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Byun1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> or upon processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Cimprich1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. DSB processing occurs by DNA-end resection, a 5â²-3â² degradation of one of the DNA strands. This process is a tightly regulated and serves as a molecular switch between signaling mediated by the ATM and ATR kinases, and also regulates the way DSBs are repaired <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Specifically, resection only takes place effectively in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, and it is initiated by the combined actions of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex and CtIP <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The licensing of DNA-end resection requires cell-cycle dependent phosphorylation of CtIP <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Yun1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and in the absence of CtIP, DSB processing is impaired and ATR activation is hampered <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As the above factors suggested that <italic>CtIP</italic> defects might yield SS, we examined DNA samples from two unrelated microcephalic families that both map to the SCKL2 locus: the original SCKL2 family <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Borglum1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and a family diagnosed with a Seckel-like type of congenital microcephaly termed Jawad syndrome <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Hassan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002310.s001">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>). As described herein, this analysis revealed that the affected individuals in these families indeed harbor homozygous mutations in the <italic>CtIP</italic> gene. Strikingly, both mutations lead to premature stop codons in the <italic>CtIP</italic> transcript and, therefore, to the expression of predicted C-terminal truncation derivatives of CtIP. We show that, while the Jawad two basepair deletion mutation leads to a classical shift in reading frame, the SCKL2 mutation creates an alternative splicing site leading to both the normal and aberrant CtIP proteins coexisting in the cells of patients and carriers. By characterizing SCKL2 cells and CtIP proficient cells artificially expressing a C-terminally truncated CtIP protein, we conclude that, despite being a recessively inherited syndrome, the CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> mutation encodes a dominant negative protein that impairs ATR activation.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Like other SS cells, SCKL2 cells display defects in ATR signaling in response to DSBs. However, in contrast to all other SS cell lines tested, SCKL2 cells do not exhibit hypersensitivity to replication fork stalling caused by hydroxyurea treatment<xref rid="pgen.1002310-Alderton1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. As the ATR pathway is activated by ssDNA exposed during polymerase-helicase uncoupling under these circumstances, this implies that ATR and the ATR signaling pathway are functional in SCKL2 cells, and that the molecular defect of SCKL2 cells responding to DSBs is likely upstream of ATR. Moreover, these data suggest that SCKL2 cells might be specifically defective in processing DSBs to ssDNA. Based on these and other criteria, we sequenced the <italic>CtIP</italic> gene located within the SCKL2 locus (18p11.31-q11.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Borglum1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and found one mutation: a T to G transition 53 bp within the 15<sup>th</sup> intron (CtIP<sup>s</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The mutation co-segregated with the disease in the SCKL2 family and was not present in 100 unrelated control individuals. All seven members of the family were sequenced. No other mutations were found despite in-depth sequencing of the promoter- and untranslated regions (approximately 3500 bp), all coding exons and adjacent intronic sequences (on average 750 bp).</p>

      <p>Bioinformatics pointed to a 5â² splice-attracting capability for the altered sequence introduced by the CtIP<sup>s</sup> mutation, suggesting the presence of a competing alternative donor-site within the 15<sup>th</sup> intron (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002310.s002">Figure S2</xref>). An alternative spliced transcript, resulting in an extended exon 15 was thus expected. To assess this possibility, we carried out RT-PCR amplifications targeting both this hypothesized extended region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1C, 1D</xref>) and the wild-type transcript sequence on total RNA extracted from EBV-transformed lymphoblasts derived from SCKL2 patients, unaffected family members and unrelated control individuals. No measurable differences in expression were observed between the samples for the wild-type isoform (not shown), but one weakly expressed <italic>CtIP</italic> transcript, not previously identified, was specifically found in samples from SCKL2 patients (homozygous) and at approximately 50% of this level in non-affected family members (heterozygous; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1B</xref>
<bold>)</bold>. We therefore denoted this transcript <italic>CtIP<sup>Seckel</sup></italic>. We observe uniform expression level of wild-type transcript between cell lines, discarding a reduction in full length CtIP mRNA as a cause for the observed phenotypes in SCKL2 patients and cell lines. Due to the appearance of a premature stop codon, we expected <italic>CtIP<sup>Seckel</sup></italic> transcript to be subjected to NMD and only negligible levels to be expressed. Relative quantification of this mutant transcript against wild type transcript showed in fact a weak expression-ratio of approximately 1â¶600 in homozygous SCKL2 cells (not shown). Sequencing the exon-intron junction of <italic>CtIP<sup>Seckel</sup></italic> furthermore confirmed that the naturally occurring <italic>CtIP</italic> exon 15 donor-site is indeed skipped in this transcript and that RNA-splicing occurs between the introduced donor-site and the exon 16 acceptor-site as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To test our hypothesis that C-terminal truncation of CtIP can lead to congenital microcephaly, we sequenced DNA samples from several other patients suffering this type of condition. Some of them came from a family diagnosed as suffering from Jawad syndrome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002310.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Hassan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, previously mapped to chromosomal region (18p11.22-q11.2) overlapping with the SCKL2 locus <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Hassan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Jawad patients differ from Seckel patients as no growth-impairment has been described for this syndrome. They do, however, share a large number of other characteristics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002310-t001">Table 1</xref> for comparison of Seckel and Jawad symptoms). As it has been shown that SS and primary microcephaly can be caused by the same genes <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Bond1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Guernsey1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, we considered them good candidates for our study. Indeed, in family members with Jawad syndrome, we found a homozygous two base-pair deletion in exon 11 (CtIP<sup>j</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This 2 bp deletion causes a frame-shift in the <italic>CtIP</italic> reading frame and the appearance of a premature stop codon that would yield a truncated CtIP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002310.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We also analyzed DNA from two obligate carriers of the Jawad family and found that both were heterozygous for the mutation. The mutation was not present in any control individual.</p>

      <p>It is notable that both the CtIP<sup>s</sup> and CtIP<sup>j</sup> mutations are predicted to yield C-terminally truncated CtIP proteins (CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> and CtIP<sup>Jawad</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002310.s003">Figure S3</xref>) because C-terminal truncation of CtIP has been shown to cause cells to display defective processing of DNA DSBs and exhibit impaired ATR-dependent signaling <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Surprisingly, while CtIP<sup>j/j</sup> homozygotes presumably only express the truncated form of the protein, CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> homozygous cells express transcripts for both the truncated and full-length CtIP proteins. We decided to further characterize the mechanisms causing the syndromes at the molecular and cellular levels but, as no cellular or RNA samples were available from the Jawad family, we focused our investigations on the SCKL2 family. According to <italic>in silico</italic> analyses of the <italic>CtIP<sup>Seckel</sup></italic> transcript, its translation would end at a premature stop codon shortly after the mutation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002310.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These mRNA molecules are more likely subjected to NMD, explaining the low abundance observed in SCKL2 cell lines. However, the observed symptoms can not be explained by a reduction in full-length CtIP transcript, as no changes in the expression were observed in the different cell lines. Therefore, we speculated that some of the truncated form of CtIP protein has to be expressed in those cells and that the expression of this aberrant form of CtIP is causing the disease. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed CtIP in protein samples from lymphoblasts obtained from a SCKL2 patient (CtIP<sup>s/s</sup>), an asymptomatic family member (CtIP<sup>+/s</sup>) and an unrelated control individual (CtIP<sup>+/+</sup>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, no discernible changes in full-length CtIP protein levels were observed between the different cell lines when using an antibody raised against the CtIP C-terminus <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, in agreement with no changes at the mRNA level and indicating that accumulation of full-length CtIP is not compromised in SCKL2 patients. Notably, however, when using an antibody raised against the CtIP N-terminus (Anti CtIP-Nt) <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, an additional shorter protein species, undetectable in CtIP<sup>+/+</sup> lymphoblasts, was observed in both CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> and CtIP<sup>+/s</sup> cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Unfortunately, this antibody seemed less specific than the one raised against the C-terminus. Thus, to confirm that this band truly represented a form of CtIP, we immunoprecipitated all forms of the protein from etoposide treated cells by using an antibody raised against the central part of the protein (Sigma) and blotting with a different CtIP antibody (Novus Biological Ltd). Using this approach we confirmed that in protein samples from CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> and CtIP<sup>+/s</sup> lymphoblast a new, shorter species of CtIP of around 100 kDa appeared, whereas it was absent in the unrelated control protein samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We therefore denoted this protein, CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup>. Quantifying the abundance of this polypeptide revealed that, despite the low abundance of the <italic>CtIP<sup>Seckel</sup></italic> transcript in CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> cells, the CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> protein is present in amounts comparable to full-length CtIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). An additional band between full-length CtIP and CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> was also observed in all three extracts with all the tested antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>, double asterisk). We hypothesize that this represents an additional form of CtIP, which is not related to the phenotypes we are studying here. Alternative spliced CtIP mRNA has been found previously and at the protein level at least one CtIP variant has been isolated (Genbank Accession # NP_976037).</p>

      <p>Full-length CtIP is hyper-phosphorylated upon DNA-damage in a BRCA1-dependent manner by the apical checkpoint kinase ATM <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Foray1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, top panel; for phosphorylation sites, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Strikingly, although the truncated CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> protein retains the site required for its interaction with BRCA1 (Ser-327) <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Yu2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and contains all known sites for ATM-mediated phosphorylation in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Foray1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, it was devoid of detectable DNA-damage induced modification as assessed by changes in its electrophoretic mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that it represents a DNA-damage unresponsive form of the protein. Accordingly, immunoprecipitation of a full length and the truncated form of CtIP from etoposide treated lymphoblast using the CtIP antibody from Sigma and blotting with antibodies that recognize sites phosphorylated by ATM readily rendered a strong phosphorylation signal of full-length CtIP but no signal for the truncated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
      <p>Because CtIP promotes DSB processing into RPA-coated ssDNA required for ATR activation <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, we explored whether CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> cells were defective in this process. The RPA complex is phosphorylated once it is bound to ssDNA, with Ser-4/Ser-8 (S4/S8) phosphorylation of the RPA32 subunit being a readout of DSB processing <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-CruetHennequart1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In line with our other findings, after treating cells with the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, we observed that CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> cells exhibited reduced RPA32 S4/S8 phosphorylation as compared with CtIP<sup>+/+</sup> cells, with the difference being most evident at low etoposide doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In accordance with these data and with SS being associated with defective ATR activation <xref rid="pgen.1002310-ODriscoll2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Griffith1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, we also found that CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> and CtIP<sup>+/s</sup> cells exhibited a mild defect in ATR signaling as measured by Chk1 phosphorylation, with this again being more evident at low etoposide doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2E</xref> for quantification). Notably, cells from heterozygous CtIP<sup>+/s</sup> also displayed small impairments in RPA32 and Chk1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2A and 2E</xref>), suggesting that heterozygous carriers of the CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> are mildly defective in ATR signaling at the cellular level.</p>
      <p>To explore things further, we analyzed a second readout for DNA-end processing: RPA focus formation in cells treated with etoposide. To avoid potential differences in numbers of damaged cells, we quantified cells displaying <bold>Î³</bold>H2AX foci â which are well-established markers for DSBs â and the proportion of these <bold>Î³</bold>H2AX positive cells that also displayed RPA foci. Notably, whereas the proportions of cells positive for <bold>Î³</bold>H2AX and RPA foci were similar in CtIP<sup>+/+</sup> and CtIP<sup>+/s</sup> lymphoblasts, CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> cells exhibited a mild but significant reduction in etoposide-induced RPA-focus formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2E</xref>; see representative images on the left and quantifications on the right). This decrease did not reflect differences in cell cycle distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002310.s004">Figure S4</xref>) or rates of cell-cycle progression because the amount of <bold>Î³</bold>H2AX positive cells was similar for all three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, when we assessed cells for readouts of spontaneous DNA damage, which most likely arises through replication forks encountering DNA lesions, we found that the proportion of <bold>Î³</bold>H2AX positive cells that also displayed RPA foci was lower for CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> lymphoblasts than for CtIP<sup>+/+</sup> and CtIP<sup>+/s</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>
      <p>Microcephaly, being a core manifestation of SS, is thought to result from reduced proliferative potential in the developing nervous system, most likely due to increased cell death of neuronal stem cells or progenitor cells in the rapidly expanding fetal brain <xref rid="pgen.1002310-ODriscoll1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. As only lymphoblasts were available from SCKL2 patients, we could not analyze their DNA-damage sensitivity by traditional clonogenic assays. Instead, we cultured CtIP<sup>s/s</sup>, CtIP<sup>+/s</sup> and CtIP<sup>+/+</sup> lymphoblast cells to the same density, treated them with etoposide or DMSO as a control and then, at 24 hour intervals, counted the number of total cells present together with the number of viable cells in the cultures. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>, when cells were mock-treated, they grew without a lag phase, with similar growth rates being exhibited by all three genotypes. After etoposide treatment, both the total number of cells and the number of viable cells dropped in all cases. Notably, in accordance with our other data, CtIP<sup>+/+</sup> cells recovered faster than CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> cells, whereas CtIP<sup>+/s</sup> cells showed an intermediate response. These findings correlated with higher levels of apoptosis, measured by PARP cleavage, in CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> cells as compared to CtIP<sup>+/+</sup> lymphoblasts, with CtIP<sup>+/s</sup> cells once again displaying an intermediate phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These results thus provided indirect support for reduced proliferative potential being a factor in the pathogenesis of the SCKL2 neuro-developmental disorder.</p>

      <p>The mutated CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> protein is estimated to comprise 782 amino acid residues, whereas full-length CtIP comprises 897 residues. Interestingly, while CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> retains the CtIP dimerization domain and interaction sites for several of its protein partners, it lacks residues 790-897 that promote MRN binding and are required for DSB resection<xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The region lost in CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> also lacks Thr-847, a key cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) site that controls CtIP activity in response to DNA damage <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and lacks two small regions conserved between CtIP and its yeast counterparts Sae2 and Ctp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Limbo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

      <p>The clinical manifestation of SCKL2 is inherited recessively; that is, CtIP<sup>+/s</sup> family members, while showing mild cellular phenotypes that are intermediate between CtIP<sup>s/s</sup> and CtIP<sup>+/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g003">Figure 3</xref>), do not display overt clinical symptoms. We therefore hypothesized that the ratio between the dominant negative and full-length forms of CtIP might modulate the strength of the defect in RPA-focus formation and ATR signaling. To test this idea, we assessed RPA focus formation in human osteosarcoma cells that had been transfected with both GFP-CtIP and GFP-CtIPÎC in varying ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g004">Figure 4C</xref>; ratios of transfected DNA are shown below the plot and the percentage of CtIP that is full-length is stated below the western blot). Strikingly, when more wild-type CtIP than CtIPÎC was transfected, no effect on RPA focus formation was observed. However, once GFP-CtIPÎC reached over 70% of total CtIP, a moderate but significant reduction in RPA focus formation was observed after etoposide treatment, with more substantial defects in focus formation being observed at yet higher GFP-CtIPÎC levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Accordingly, Chk1 phosphorylation on Ser-345 was also impaired once the ratio between GFP-CtIPÎC and CtIP full-length was above 70â¶30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). These data therefore supported a model in which the C-terminally truncated CtIP protein serves as a dose-dependent dominant-negative mutant.</p>
      <p>During the course of the above experiments, we observed that, despite using increasing ratios of GFP-CtIPÎC DNA, the amount of CtIPÎC protein rapidly saturated and was always considerably higher than the full-length CtIP protein expressed from similar amounts of plasmid. This therefore mimicked the situation in cells from SCKL2 patients, in which low amounts of the <italic>CtIP<sup>Seckel</sup></italic> transcript produced substantial amounts of CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> protein. Notably, previous work has shown that CtIP is subject to a rapid turnover mediated by the E3 Ubiquitin ligase SIAH1 <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Germani1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, with the interaction with SIAH1 being mapped to the CtIP C-terminus <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Germani1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. To analyze the turnover of CtIPÎC and full-length CtIP, we transfected HEK293 cells with GFP-CtIPÎC and FLAG-CtIP. Although we were unable to co-immunoprecipitate SIAH1 either with full-length or truncated CtIP (data not shown), we observed that the full-length (FLAG) but not the truncated form (GFP) of CtIP was stabilized upon addition of the proteosome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Along the same lines, inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide had a much more pronounced effect on the levels of full-length CtIP than on CtIPÎC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Collectively, these data suggested that the pathological form of CtIP, CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup>, is not subject to normal proteosome dependent turnover, thereby explaining how small amounts of an alternative spliced transcript can produce enough protein to generate a dominant negative effect.</p>

      <p>CtIP activity relies on various protein-protein interactions, including its homodimerization and interaction with MRN, BRCA1, RB and PCNA. We explored the possibility that truncated CtIP can sequester some or all of these partners. First, we analyzed the ability of different forms of GFP-tagged CtIP to be recruited to sites of DNA damage in the absence of endogenous CtIP. To do so, we generated cell lines that stably expressed siRNA-resistant GFP-tagged versions of full-length and truncated CtIP, and then treated these cells with an siRNA oligonucleotide to specifically target the endogenous CtIP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, full-length CtIP and CtIPÎC were recruited with similar kinetics to sites of microirradiation (quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g005">Figure 5D</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002310.s006">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002310.s007">S2</xref>). Similar results were obtained when endogenous CtIP was present (that is, without siRNA treatment; data not shown). Moreover, the residence times at sites of DNA damage were almost identical for full-length CtIP and CtIPÎC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). These data supported a model in which CtIPÎC, previously shown to be non-functional, can localize to sites of DNA damage but is then unable to effectively promote ATR signaling and DNA repair. One possibility is that, as it still retains an intact homo-dimerization domain, the truncated form of CtIP can form an inactive hetero-dimer with full-length CtIP. Consistent with this idea, immunoprecipitation of GFP-CtIPÎC from cells also expressing full-length FLAG-CtIP revealed that the two proteins did indeed interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, lane 1). Strikingly, blocking the interaction of CtIPÎC with full-length CtIP by deleting the dimerization domain suppress its ability to act as a dominant negative, supporting an scenario in which CtIPÎC sequester full-length CtIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, GFP-CtIPÎC co-immunoprecipitated with the MRE11 subunit of the MRN complex, even in the absence of transfected full-length CtIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Collectively, these data supported the idea that the truncated form of CtIP acts in a dominant-negative manner to partially impair DSB processing and ATR activation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have defined point mutations in CtIP associated with the human congenital microcephaly syndromes, Seckel (SCKL2 family) and Jawad. Although the lack of biological samples from the Jawad family prevented us from analyzing the predicted appearance of the shorter species of CtIP mRNA and protein in this case, we hypothesize that in each disease, the causative mutation leads to a transcript with a premature stop codon, yielding a C-terminally truncated form of CtIP that partially hampers DSB resection and ATR activation. It is possible that in the CtIP<sup>j</sup> mutant, the shorter form of RNA will be subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and no truncated protein will be present. Although this may be the case, degradation of the mutated CtIP<sup>j</sup> transcript by NMD is unlikely to be complete, as it has been shown that CtIP null mutants are embryonic lethal in mice, at least in part due to their inability to overcome RB-mediated G1 arrest <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus, we speculate that, in CtIP<sup>j/j</sup> patients, in whom the only form of the CtIP transcript is the mutated one, some truncated protein will be present to allow the G1/S transition. In this regard, we note that, even if the transcript is largely degraded by NMD, the reduced turnover that we have observed for C-terminally truncated CtIP (both the CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> and GFP-CtIPÎC) will allow enough protein to accumulate to perform CtIP's essential functions, while impairing DNA resection.</p>
      <p>Our results highlight similarities between CtIP-SCKL2 and ATR-SCKL1. Notably, inactivation of either <italic>CtIP</italic> or <italic>ATR</italic> is embryonic lethal in mouse, and in both SCKL1 and SCKL2, a point mutation generates an alternative pre-mRNA splice site that leads to the cellular and physiological phenotypes associated with SS. However, in SCKL1, the aberrant mRNA form is not stable and the shorter protein has never been detected in cells <xref rid="pgen.1002310-ODriscoll2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In this case, the disease is caused by a reduction in the amount of full-length ATR mRNA transcript that leads to reduced ATR protein levels <xref rid="pgen.1002310-ODriscoll2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. By contrast, in SCKL2 cells, no changes in the overall levels of full-length mRNA or CtIP protein are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002310-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and data not shown). Instead, the low abundance, shorter version of the <italic>CtIP</italic> RNA is translated, producing a C-terminal CtIP truncation mutant that seems to be more stable than the wild-type protein, as much smaller amounts of mRNA are enough to produce similar protein levels. In agreement with this model, we have found that the levels of CtIPÎC protein are less affected by protein synthesis inhibition than full-length CtIP, and that levels of the full-length but not the truncated form of CtIP is induced by proteosome inhibition. Collectively, our data therefore indicate that, in the case of SCKL2, it is the presence of this truncated CtIP protein and not the reduction of full-length protein that causes the cellular phenotypes. We hypothesize that the resulting inability of SCKL2 cells to respond optimally to endogenously-arising DNA damage lowers the apoptotic threshold in SCKL2 patient cells, reduces their proliferative potential and thus causes the developmental phenotypes observed in these patients.</p>
      <p>Based on our analyses, we conclude that in SCKL2 patients, the mutated, C-terminally truncated form of CtIP impairs DSB processing and the formation of RPA-coated ssDNA. This impaired ssDNA production thus partially hampers ATR activation and results in hypersensitivity to DNA damage and induction of apoptosis. Although most of our observations were made when we used external sources of DNA-damaging drugs, we also observed that SCKL2 cells exhibited reduced RPA DNA-damage staining when grown in unperturbed conditions, possible due to endogenously-arising DNA damage. It is noteworthy that the predicted C-terminal truncated forms of CtIP in SCKL2 and Jawad cells lack the normal CtIP C-terminus, which is a key regulatory part of the protein. First, this region bears an MRN interaction domain <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> that is crucial for DNA-end resection. Although a second MRN interaction point has been found in the very N-terminal part of the protein <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, the C-terminal region is essential for CtIP-mediated activation of MRN-associated nuclease activity. This could explain how, although GFP-CtIPÎC still interacts with the MRN complex, it renders the complex unable to effectively perform DNA end resection <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Moreover, the homology regions between CtIP and its budding yeast and fission yeast counterparts Sae2 and Ctp1, respectively <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Limbo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> are also located at the C-terminal part of the CtIP protein that is affected by the SCKL2 and Jawad mutations. In fact, the Thr-847 CDK target site of CtIP, which is crucial for ssDNA formation, is also missing in CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> and CtIP<sup>Jawad</sup>
<xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Huertas3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Consistent with these issues, we have found that, unlike the wild-type protein, CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> is not detectably phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, despite it being able to hetero-dimerize with the full-length CtIP protein and despite it retaining sites for interaction with proteins such as BRCA1 and RB. Consequently, we propose a model in which this DDR unresponsive form of CtIP sequesters the full-length CtIP protein and/or some of its interaction partners in unproductive complexes, thereby blocking effective DSB processing. In accord with such an idea, we have found that C-terminally truncated CtIP is actively recruited to DNA damage sites with apparently the same kinetics and residence time as full-length CtIP. Moreover, CtIPÎC species that are not able to interact with full-length CtIP due to the deletion of the dimerization domain lose the ability to act as a dominant negative, favouring this model.</p>
      <p>While we do not know why these complexes are inactive, an attractive model is that CtIP acts as priming endonuclease, as has been proposed for its budding yeast counterpart Sae2 <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Lengsfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this scenario, an initial endonucleolytic attack of the DNA molecule by CtIP will create the substrate for the MRN complex. As many nucleases work as dimers, it is possible than a CtIP/CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> dimers will be non functional, an idea supported by the fact that Sae2 mutants lacking the C terminal part, conserved in CtIP, have a partial impairment of its endonucleolytic activity <xref rid="pgen.1002310-Lengsfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Unfortunately, it has not yet been proved that CtIP can act as an endonuclease. In fact, CtIP - as Sae2 - lacks of any putative nuclease domain. Further biochemical work characterizing the activity or activities of CtIP is needed to clarify this point.</p>
      <p>Our findings also support a model in which the strength of the phenotype caused by CtIP<sup>SCKL2</sup> depends on the ratio between the levels of full-length and truncated forms of CtIP, presumably because this ratio affects the levels of functional CtIP-containing complexes. Consequently, it seems that a threshold of this ratio must be surpassed in order to hamper ATR signaling sufficiently to yield a measurable phenotype. Interestingly, this threshold appears to be different for cellular and clinical symptoms because heterozygous SCKL2 carriers do not manifest clinical symptoms while they do present cellular phenotypes, albeit intermediate between homozygous and wild-type cells. Consequently, a dominant-negative form of CtIP causes SCKL2 Seckel syndrome recessively. To our knowledge this is the first example of such type of inheritance in man.</p>

Micro-irradiation was with a FluoView 1000 confocal microscope (Olympus) equipped with a 37Â°C heating stage (Ibidi) and a 405 nm laser diode (6 mW) focused through a 60X UPlanSApo/1.35 oil objective to yield a spot size of 0.5 to 1 mm. Time of cell exposure to the laser beam was â¼250 ms (fast-scanning mode).

FRAP analyses were performed on the microscope used for laser micro-irradiation when the accumulation of the GFP-tagged protein on the laser track reached its maximal steady-state level.

        <p>To determine cell-cycle distributions, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, incubated for 30 min with RNase A (250 Âµg/ml) and propidium iodide (10 Âµg/ml) at 37Â°C. For each experiment 10<sup>4</sup> cells were analyzed for fluorescence and recorded by a FACSAria flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA); cell debris was excluded on the basis of forward and side light-scattering properties. Cell cycle distribution was determined from DNA fluorescence histograms using the CellFit software (Becton Dickinson).</p>

        <title>Cell survival assays</title>
        <p>Cells were grown to â¼50,000 cells/ml, and then split in two. Half of the culture was treated with 10 ÂµM of etoposide, and the rest was mock treated with DMSO. A sample was taken every 24 h for 10 days to determine cell number/viability. Cell numbers were determined by direct counting with a Beckman Coulter Cell and particle counter. Viable cell were measured with a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Lab., Kumamoto, Japan) following the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
