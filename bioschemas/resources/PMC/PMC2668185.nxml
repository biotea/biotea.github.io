      <abstract>
        <p>Genes of the S100 fused-type protein (SFTP) family are clustered within the epidermal differentiation complex and encode essential components that maintain epithelial homeostasis and barrier functions. Recent genetic studies have shown that mutations within the gene encoding the SFTP filaggrin cause ichthyosis vulgaris and are major predisposing factors for atopic dermatitis. As a vital component of healthy skin, filaggrin is also a precursor of natural moisturizing factors. Here we present the discovery of a member of this family, designated as filaggrin-2 (FLG2) that is expressed in human skin. The <italic>FLG2</italic> gene encodes a histidine- and glutamine-rich protein of approximately 248 kDa, which shares common structural features with other SFTP members, in particular filaggrin. We found that <italic>FLG2</italic> transcripts are present in skin, thymus, tonsils, stomach, testis and placenta. In cultured primary keratinocytes, <italic>FLG2</italic> mRNA expression displayed almost the same kinetics as that of <italic>filaggrin</italic> following Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation, suggesting an important role in molecular regulation of epidermal terminal differentiation. We provide evidences that like filaggrin, FLG2 is initially expressed by upper granular cells, proteolytically processed and deposited in the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum (SC) layers of normal epidermis. Thus, FLG2 and filaggrin may have overlapping and perhaps synergistic roles in the formation of the epidermal barrier, protecting the skin from environmental insults and the escape of moisture by offering precursors of natural moisturizing factors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The skin functions as an effective barrier protecting the body from potentially damaging environmental influences <xref rid="pone.0005227-Pendegrass1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The surface-exposed epidermis, a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium composed of several layers of keratinocytes, is most important for the barrier defense against these challenges <xref rid="pone.0005227-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Keratinocytes in the outmost stratum corneum (SC) of the epidermis are sloughed off and replaced by newly differentiated cells originating from epidermal stem cells located in the basal layer <xref rid="pone.0005227-Wan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The cornified envelope (CE), a prominent feature of the SC, is a rigid and insoluble protein structure, which determines essential properties of the barrier function <xref rid="pone.0005227-Kalinin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Candi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Over the last two decades much effort has been made to uncover the molecular bases underlying the CE barrier function <xref rid="pone.0005227-Candi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In humans many genes, involved in formation of the CE or in regulation of keratinocyte terminal differentiation, are clustered tightly within the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), a 1.9-Mb locus on human chromosome 1q21 <xref rid="pone.0005227-Marenholz1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Mischke1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. With the exception of two single genes encoding involucrin and loricrin <xref rid="pone.0005227-BanksSchlegel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Hohl1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, they are organized into four gene clusters: small proline-rich region genes, encoding proteins that are cross-linked to the CE proteins <xref rid="pone.0005227-Cabral1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Steinert1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; late cornified envelope genes, encoding a group of proteins that have distinct functions <xref rid="pone.0005227-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; S100 genes, encoding a large family of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins involved in the regulation of various cellular processes including cell growth and cell cycle regulation, differentiation, transcription and motility <xref rid="pone.0005227-Marenholz2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; and S100 fused-type protein (SFTP) genes (see below).</p>
      <p>A total of five genes have been identified within the SFTP gene cluster in humans and mice, including <italic>filaggrin</italic> (<italic>FLG</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0005227-Presland1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-McKinleyGrant1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <italic>trichohyalin</italic> (<italic>TCHH</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0005227-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <italic>hornerin</italic> (<italic>HRNR</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0005227-Makino1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0005227-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <italic>repetin</italic> (<italic>RPTN</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0005227-Krieg1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and <italic>cornulin</italic> (<italic>CRNN</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0005227-Contzler1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. SFTP genes consist of three exons, a tiny untranslated exon 1, a small exon 2 containing the translation start site and encoding a 46-residue S100 domain, and a large exon 3 encoding an EF-hand domain and internal tandem repeats, which are characteristic of CE precursor proteins. The best characterized SFTP gene is the <italic>FLG</italic> gene encoding profilaggrin, a precursor protein generating mature filaggrin units. The liberated filaggrin is an essential component of the SC that participates in the aggregation of keratin filaments into bundles and promote the flattened shape of dead-cell remnants <xref rid="pone.0005227-Candi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Presland1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Steinert2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, while the amino-terminal domain of filaggrin enters the nucleus, where it may have a role in regulating terminal differentiation <xref rid="pone.0005227-Pearton1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the other hand, filaggrin is eventually degraded into free amino acids that carry out various functions in the upper cornified cells including water retention by forming part of the Natural Moisturising Factors (NMF) of the SC. Trichohyalin, another member of the SFTP family, functions in specialized epithelial tissues by contributing to greater mechanical strength <xref rid="pone.0005227-Steinert3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Steinert4" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In hair follicles, trichohyalin is cross-linked to either itself or other CE proteins by transglutaminases 3 (TGase3) as the main constituent of the inner root sheath (IRS) and the medulla of the hair shaft <xref rid="pone.0005227-Steinert4" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0005227-Tarcsa2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, whereas filaggrin is proposed to be cross-linked by TGase1 <xref rid="pone.0005227-Candi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Matsuki1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and is specially localized in the granular and cornified cells that surround hair follicles <xref rid="pone.0005227-Dale1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Kanno1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Recently we have identified hornerin as components of the SC and the outer root sheath (ORS) of normal human hair follicles <xref rid="pone.0005227-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These findings suggest different SFTP members play distinct roles in skin barrier function.</p>
      <p>It has been discovered that common loss-of-function mutations within the FLG gene cause ichthyosis vulgaris, one of the most common heritable disorders of cornification, and represent major risk factors for atopic dermatitis (AD) and secondary allergic diseases <xref rid="pone.0005227-Segre1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0005227-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. These studies underline the key role for impaired skin barrier function in the development of AD. However, the complexity of the AD genetics cannot be completely explained through studies on FLG pathology, suggesting additional modifying genes may also contribute to the phenotypic spectrum of AD <xref rid="pone.0005227-McGrath1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Although the SFTP gene cluster has long been known, the gene content of this cluster remains unclear.</p>
      <p>A recent study reported the presence of partial mRNA encoding filaggrin-2 (FLG2), a novel member of the SFTP gene family, in human keratinocytes and described its gene structure and tissue expression <xref rid="pone.0005227-Toulza1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Here, we report complete identification and detailed expression analysis of this new gene. We found FLG2 expression in several tissues including healthy human skin obtained from different body sites and an upregulation of <italic>FLG2</italic> mRNA upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation in cultured keratinocytes. We could demonstrate that the filaggrin-2 protein is proteolytically processed and deposited in the epidermis and is localized in the granular and cornified layers of human skin.</p>

        <title>Identification of the human filaggrin-2 gene within the SFTP genes cluster</title>
        <p>To search for additional S100 fused-type proteins within the SFTP genes cluster, a BLAST search with the N-terminal 82 amino-acid sequence of filaggrin was performed and identified several putative gene loci. One of these hits was located within the EDC region harbouring the SFTP gene cluster and between the two known genes <italic>FLG</italic> (GenBank NM_002016) and <italic>CRNN</italic> (GenBank NM_016190) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We then retrieved this theoretical 82 amino-acid sequence to screen for matching candidates in available databases for human peptide, cDNA, and EST sequences but failed to find any hit (data not shown), suggesting that this genomic locus represents a novel gene. In view of its gene location, we proposed that this gene may be a new member of the SFTP gene family. To investigate this possibility, a theoretical partial cDNA sequence was generated by predicting the exonic sequence around this genomic locus with the FSPLICE program. This method allowed us to find two potential exons encoding the related full-length amino-acid sequence of a protein.</p>

        <p>To verify the predicted sequence and determine its full-length cDNA sequence, a strategy combining 5â²/3â²RACE and short-range overlapping PCR was used. The 5â²RACE and the nested PCR with reverse-transcribed RNAs from human foreskin-derived primary keratinocytes resulted in only one product. Mapping of this 5â²-extended sequence determined the first exon (51 bp), the second exon (160 bp) and a part of the third exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The 3â²-extended sequence was determined by 3â²RACE, which includes a polyadenylation signal site (AAUAAA) situated eleven nucleotides from its 3â² extremity. After further verification of the full-length cDNA sequence (9147 bp) with short-range overlapping PCRs, it was registered as <italic>ifapsoriasin</italic> with the gene symbol <italic>IFPS</italic> under the GenBank accession number AY827490. Later on, an approved gene name <italic>filaggrin-2</italic> (gene symbol <italic>FLG2</italic>) was suggested by the HUGO/GDB Nomenclature Committee. Comparison between the cDNA and genomic sequences of human <italic>FLG2</italic> revealed the presence of 3 exons and 2 introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

        <title>FLG2 encodes a S100 fused-type protein</title>
        <p>The <italic>FLG2</italic> gene contains an open reading frame of 7176 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 2391 amino acids. By using SMART to explore domain architectures, this deduced protein sequence harboured an S100/ICaBP type calcium binding domain (residues 4â46) <xref rid="pone.0005227-Sastry1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and an EF-hand domain (residues 53â81) at its amino terminus. Analysis of the repeat contents using the computer program RADAR, followed by manual adjustment, revealed that this protein contains a large central repetitive region consisting of two types of multiple tandem repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Amino acid sequence comparison of all currently known human SFTPs, including profilaggrin, trichohyalin, repetin, cornulin, hornerin and filaggrin-2, indicated that they are highly conservative in inferring homology of the N-terminal 81-residue region containing the S100 and EF-hand domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

Repeat domains (A1 to 9 and B1 to14) were first detected by the RADAR program and then refined manually. (B) Multiple sequence alignment of N-terminal S100 domains from all known SFTP proteins. The alignment was generated by using M-COFFEE and displayed by using GeneDoc. Identical residues are boxed in black while gray boxes mark partially conserved residues. The darker the shading, the more the amino acids are conserved among SFTP members. The positions of the S100 and EF-hand regions are indicated above the alignment.

        <p>In particular, the filaggrin-2 protein is characterized by two arrays of ordered repetitive structures separated by a spacer sequence (residues 1154â1222) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The A-type repetitive domain region is located between residues 467 and 1153, the middle part of filaggrin-2. It is comprised of nine conserved repeats, each having a size of 75â¼77 amino acids (A1 to A9) characterized with four regularly spaced phenylalanine residues twelve amino acids apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The B-type repetitive domain region is located between residues 1246 and 2303 and just in front of the C-terminal 88-residue domain. It is comprised of fourteen conserved repeats of 75â¼77 amino acids (B1 to B14), but these repeats do not have any regularly spaced phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). By using these tandem repeats as queries in BLAST homolog searches against the human protein database, the most positive hit homologous to each A-type repeat was from repetitive domains of hornerin (50â77% identity) whereas that homologous to each B-type repeat was from filaggrin units (28â39% identity) (data not shown). Multiple alignments of these repeat domains together with one representative peptide of their corresponding homolog, respectively, further addressed their homology relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g002">Fig. 2C and D</xref>). In addition, a neighbour-joining tree was constructed based on alignment of all FLG2 repeats together with their representative homologous repeat units of filaggrin and hornerin, demonstrating different evolutionary histories for the A-type and B-type repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>Analysis of the overall amino acid composition of both the A-type and B-type domain revealed that they are particularly rich in two hydroxyl amino acids serine and threonine: from 32.61% in A-type repeats to 32.23% in B-type repeats. In addition, the A-type and B-type repeats have high glycine contents of 28.82% and 17.39%, respectively; the A-type repeats have high glutamine contents of 14.99%, whereas the B-type repeats have less glutamine (8.41%) but instead more basic amino acids histidine (14.93%) and arginine (8.32%). Most repeats except A1, A7, A9, B1 or B4 lack any lysine donor residue, yet rich with glutamine acceptor residues, raising the possibility that these repeat units may act as a glutamine acceptor site for the formation of transglutaminase-catalyzed N<sup>Îµ</sup>(Î³-glutamyl)-lysyl isopeptide bonds <xref rid="pone.0005227-Lorand1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p>

        <p>To evaluate the expression of the FLG2 protein, goat polyclonal antibodies against rFLG2-S were generated and used for analysis of FLG2 expression in healthy human tissues and cells. The FLG2-S peptide was used for immunization because it is located within the spacer region of FLG2 exhibiting the least sequence similarity to the other SFTP members. In immunohistochemical studies, the FLG2 immunoreactivity was detected weakly in the esophagus, tonsils and testis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005227.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), but strongly in the stratum granulosum (SG) and stratum corneum (SC) layers of human skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).

By using the LR-White resin-embedded samples of prefixed skin biopsy specimen from the knee, FLG2 labelling was observed in both, the granular and cornified cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>-a and -b). FLG2 labels were dispersed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm in the SC, while in the SG, FLG2 was localized to irregularly-shaped keratohyalin granules of various sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>-c and -d). These data suggested that the localization of FLG2 is similar to that of filaggrin, as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0005227-IshidaYamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Therefore, the spatial localisation of FLG2 in comparison with that of filaggrin was further analysed by immunofluorescent staining and laser scanning confocal microscopy.

Using detergent-free conditions, we observed very faint staining in both the epidermal extract (â¼65 kDa) and the SC extract (â¼65 kDa and â¼15 kDa) (lane 1 and 5). When extraction was performed in the presence of SDS, the epidermal extract exhibited two strong bands, one corresponding to the expected molecular mass of full-length FLG2 (â¼248 kDa) and another corresponding to a fragment at â¼65 kDa (lane 2). Subsequent treatment of the extract with DTT-containing buffer resulted in extraction of additional FLG2 bands corresponding to 40, 30, 25, and 20 kDa size, respectively (lane 3). In contrast, SC extracts exhibited different band patterns with stronger small-size FLG2 bands, especially a 15-kDa size band, but without a clear band at the size of full length FLG2 (lane 6 and 7). Interestingly, extracts obtained from further treatment of the SC sediment with trypsin did not abolish any FLG2-immunostaining but resulted in broad intense bands between 45 and 72 kDa (lane 8).</p>

Proteins were extracted sequentially from abdominal epidermis with PBS buffer (lane 1), SDS buffer (62.5 mM Tris, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS) (lane 2), and SDS/DTT buffer (SDS buffer plus 10 mM DTT) (lane 3), and from trypsin-digested skin sample (lane 4); alternatively, proteins were sequentially extracted from SC with PBS buffer (lane 5), SDS buffer (lane 6) and SDS/DTT buffer (lane 7), and from trypsin-digested SC sample (lane 8). In all other lanes, 5 Âµl of protein extracts were loaded. The approximate size of the protein was determined using high-molecular-weight standards.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the current study we have identified and characterized the <italic>FLG2</italic> gene (GenBank accession number AY827490) as a member of the SFTP gene family. A recent paper described this gene based on the registered AY827490 gene and publicly available DNA data <xref rid="pone.0005227-Toulza1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. While supporting keratinocyte expression of <italic>FLG2</italic> as the major cellular source <xref rid="pone.0005227-Toulza1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, our data are inconsistent with their conclusion that <italic>FLG2</italic> expression is restricted to the epidermis. Our data show that in addition to skin, <italic>FLG2</italic> mRNA is also present in thymus, stomach, tonsils, testis and placenta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). This discrepancy may be the result of the inherent technique difficulties of RT-PCR analysis, which we have previously addressed <xref rid="pone.0005227-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Indeed, in consideration of high sequence similarities between each other among the 5â²-end regions of all the SFTP gene members, it seems that the design of specific primers emerges as a key barrier to successfully distinguish various SFTP members. In our study, we have developed two specific primer pairs that can uniquely amplify the <italic>FLG2</italic> gene with the Primer Unique program.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the proposed classification of the FLG2 repeats <xref rid="pone.0005227-Matsuki1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, we suggest that FLG2 can generate two kinds of repeat units with homology to filaggrin and hornerin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). There are nine A-type internal repeats, which display high identity to hornerin, and fourteen B-type internal repeats, which resemble those of filaggrin. The phylogenetic tree constructed based on their amino acid sequences supports the above idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, both repeat domains of FLG2 contain a high proportion of histidine and glutamine residues, the source of the natural moisturizing factors urocanic acid and pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, suggesting FLG2 may contribute to maintaining SC hydration as proposed for filaggrin <xref rid="pone.0005227-Rawlings1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Similar to that of the <italic>FLG</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0005227-Presland1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Gan1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, the final huge exon of the <italic>FLG2</italic> gene contains highly GC-rich repeats with similar nucleotide sequences. Such properties may cause technical problems for PCR-based amplification and subsequent sequencing, as was also reported for analyzing the <italic>plectin</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0005227-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and the <italic>FLG</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0005227-Sandilands1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The reason is that GC-rich templates frequently generate local secondary structures leading to an inefficient PCR amplification <xref rid="pone.0005227-Varadaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Therefore, it is a technical challenge to efficiently clone and sequence the full-length cDNA of this kind of genes. In this study, a comprehensive strategy has been developed by combining bioinformatic analysis, RACE and short-range overlapping PCR to overcome PCR problems and subsequent sequencing steps to yield the full-length cDNA sequence of the <italic>FLG2</italic> gene. This strategy seems to be the best way to analyze a gene like <italic>FLG2</italic> with highly similar sequences and GC-rich repeats at DNA level. More importantly, the primer pairs used for successful determination of <italic>FLG2</italic> cDNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005227-t001">Table 1</xref>) should be crucial for detailed functional analyses of the <italic>FLG2</italic> gene in the future. Indeed, we have failed to clone the length cDNA sequence of FLG2 by long-distance RT-PCR (data not shown).</p>

      <p>In the epidermis and hair follicles, the localization of FLG2 is similar to that of filaggrin but is different from that of hornerin or trichohyalin <xref rid="pone.0005227-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-IshidaYamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. FLG2 immunoreactivity is present as FLG2 granules in granular cells but is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of cornified cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). However, FLG2 and filaggrin did not show complete colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). These data suggest that FLG2 and filaggrin might have not any direct intermolecular cross-linking between each other but may play a similar role in skin biology. Profilaggrin is an insoluble, highly phosphorylated protein, which consists of multiple FLG units joined by linker peptides <xref rid="pone.0005227-Dale2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005227-Presland2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. During terminal differentiation this protein is dephosphorylated and processed by several endoproteases to generate two major products: FLG and the N-terminal peptide <xref rid="pone.0005227-Pearton1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. FLG mainly functions to aggregate keratin filaments leading to keratinocyte compaction and formation of the SC <xref rid="pone.0005227-Candi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> by conjugation of glutamine-rich linkage proteins with lysine-rich proteins like P-cystatin, a known cross-linking partner of filaggrin in the SC <xref rid="pone.0005227-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. A similar mechanism can be suggested for FLG2 repeats to aggregate lysine-rich proteins because these repeats almost lack cysteine or lysine residues but contain high glutamine contents, implicating that they may act as amino acceptors in transglutaminase-catalyzed reactions to generate glutaminyl-lysine cross-links with neighbouring proteins <xref rid="pone.0005227-Kahlem1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. The cross-linking possibility of FLG2 is supported by the detection of natural FLG2 proteins under reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005227-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). The absence of a clear full-length FLG2 band in the SC extract suggests that FLG2 is processed within the stratum granulosum. However, because of the existence of different FLG2 intermediates in the SC, further protein processing can be expected to happen in order to completely generate mature FLG2 repeat domains. This observation is consistent with data from profilaggrin, where an N-terminal peptide of 32 kDa is released after proteolytic processing <xref rid="pone.0005227-Presland3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, suggesting the processing of the N-terminal domain of FLG2 could be similar to that of filaggrin.</p>
      <p>Common loss-of-function mutations within the <italic>FLG</italic> gene causing ichthyosis vulgaris, filaggrin units represent major risk factors for atopic dermatitis (AD) and secondary allergic diseases <xref rid="pone.0005227-Segre1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0005227-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In the investigation of FLG2 immunoreactivity in skin biopsies from patients with AD and psoriasis vulgaris, two of the most common inflammatory skin diseases, we have observed decreased expression of FLG2 only in the lesional but not in uninvolved skin of psoriasis patients. Because FLG2 expression strongly depends on terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, the decreased expression of FLG2 might be caused by the altered differentiation in the psoriatic plaques. Indeed, reduced expression of FLG has also been reported for psoriasis lesions <xref rid="pone.0005227-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, though <italic>FLG</italic> null alleles are not associated with psoriasis <xref rid="pone.0005227-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. In contrast, it has been reported that hornerin, another member of the SFTP family, is strongly expressed in psoriatic lesions <xref rid="pone.0005227-Takaishi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In AD patients, no obvious differences have been observed for FLG2 expression in lesional and nonlesional skin. Since the number of patients investigated was limited (nâ=â3), it might be still of interest to investigate the association of the FLG2 expression and AD in larger cohorts.</p>
      <p>Taken together, these findings identify FLG2 as a novel member of the SFTP family present in the granular and horny layers of human epidermis, which might play a role in skin barrier networks. Future work will be necessary to determine the processing of FLG2 repeat domain units and their biological function.</p>

        <p>Total RNA was isolated from human skin samples or cultured foreskin-derived keratinocytes using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All other RNAs were obtained from BD Bioscience Clontech (Heidelberg, Germany). A total of 2 Âµg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with an oligo(dT)<sub>18</sub> primer and Superscript II RNaseH<sup>â</sup> reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Hamburg, Germany). The reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with H<sub>2</sub>O for further PCR experiments. To design primer pairs to uniquely amplify the FLG2 gene, all the 5â²-end 500-bp nucleotide sequences of the SFTP gene family were retrieved from GenBank and then used for primer designing by the Primo Unique program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.changbioscience.com/primo/primou.html">http://www.changbioscience.com/primo/primou.html</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>Qualitative RT-PCR assay was performed with Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix (BD Bioscience Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). One pair of gene-specific primers FLG2-rtF and FLG2-rtR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005227-t001">Table 1</xref>) were designed to overlap intron 2 of the <italic>FLG2</italic> gene and amplify the 198-bp cDNA target.

The PCR products were separated on a 2.0% agarose gel and then visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. As an internal control of cDNA templates, the housekeeping gene <italic>glyceraldehyde phosphodehydrogenase</italic> (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) was assessed with each cDNA in a separate PCR reaction by one pair of intron-spanning primers (forward primer: <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-CCA GCC GAG CCA CAT CGC TC-3â²</named-content>, reverse primer: <named-content content-type="gene">5â²- ATG AGC CCC AGC CTT CTC CAT-3â²</named-content>).</p>
        <p>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay was carried out with the same primer pair as above using the SYBRÂ® Premix Ex Taqâ¢ Kit (Takara Bio, Heidelberg, Germany) in a fluorescence thermocycler following the instructions of the manufacturer (LightCycler, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Hamburg, Germany). Cycling conditions were: 45 cycles at 95Â°C for 10 s, then 69Â°C for 20 s (âtouchdownâ of â1Â°C/cycle to 63Â°C). Fluorescence measurements were taken at 72Â°C at the end of each cycle. Amplicons were analysed by 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and, where necessary, purified and sequenced to confirm their identity. As an internal control to account for keratinocyte differentiation in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulation, the <italic>FLG</italic> gene was measured with each cDNA in a separate PCR reaction using intron-spanning primers (forward primer: <named-content content-type="gene">5â²- GGC TCC TTC AGG CTA CAT TCT A -3â²</named-content>, reverse primer: <named-content content-type="gene">5â²- ATC TGG ATT CTT CAG GAT TTG C -3â²</named-content>).

For calculation of the relative transcripts amplification, the housekeeping gene <italic>GAPDH</italic> was performed with each cDNA in a separate PCR reaction by the same pair of primers as above. For standard curve acquisition, eight serial 10-fold dilutions of linearized plasmid DNA containing the insert were prepared for each primer set, representing 30 to 3.0Ã10<sup>8</sup> double-stranded DNA molecules quantified by use of a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). For relative real-time PCR, the data from one triplicate-sample result of three independent experiments were analyzed with software (GraphPad Prism 4) and expressed as meanÂ±SD of mRNA in question relative to that of <italic>GAPDH</italic>. For absolute DNA quantification, reactions were carried out with different concentrations of linearized plasmid DNA containing the insert in parallel to the samples that should be quantified.

        <title>Determination of the full-length sequence of FLG2 cDNA</title>
        <p>Total RNA was obtained from cultured human foreskin-derived keratinocytes using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Hamburg, Germany). After treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) to exclude contamination with genomic DNA, 3 Âµg of DNA-free total RNA was then used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis for RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) with SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (BD Bioscience Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For 5â²-RACE, two specific primers FLG2-R1 and FLG2-R2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005227-t001">Table 1</xref>) were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the putative exon 3 of the <italic>FLG2</italic> gene and used as antisense primers. For 3â²-RACE, seven specific primers FLG2-F1â¼7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005227-t001">Table 1</xref>) were designed against the nucleotide sequence of the putative exons 2 and 3 of the <italic>FLG2</italic> gene and used as sense primers, among which each FLG2-F2â¼7 was used for the second round PCR whereas FLG2-F1 was used for the first round PCR. RACE reactions were set up as follows: 5 Âµl of adapted cDNA, 0.2 ÂµM 10ÃUPM primer, 0.2 ÂµM gene-specific primer, 5 Âµl of 10Ãreaction buffer, 0.2 mM dNTP, 1 Âµl of BD Advantage 2 Polymerase mix, in a final volume of 50 Âµl. RACE PCR was performed on MJ Research Peltier Thermal cycler PTC-200 and reaction cycles were as follows: 95Â°C for 1 min; 5 cycles of 95Â°C for 20 sec, 72Â°C for 5 min; 5 cycles of 95Â°C for 20 sec, 70Â°C for 5 min; 25 cycles of 95Â°C for 20 sec, 68Â°C for 5 min; and a final extension of 10 min at 68Â°C. Then, 0.5 Âµl of PCR products was used as template for nested PCRs under the following conditions: 1 min at 95Â°C, 30 cycles of 20 sec at 95Â°C and 3 min at 70Â°C, and a final extension of 10 min at 70Â°C.</p>
        <p>To characterize the full-length cDNA sequence of <italic>FLG2</italic>, an alternative approach was used, namely the short-range overlapping PCR strategy. Firstly, based on the newly defined 5â²- and 3â²-terminal sequence, the putative middle part of mRNA sequence was initially predicted by in silico analysis and then used for primer design; secondly, all subsequent PCRs used primer pairs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005227-t001">Table 1</xref>) designed to amplify about 0.5â¼1.4 kb length of overlapping cDNA. Thirdly, to design a pair of primers, one primer maps the previously confirmed cDNA sequence while another primer maps the predicted DNA sequence to be tested. The first round 3â²RACE-PCR product was used as the template for PCR using BD Advantage 2 Polymerase mix under the following conditions: 1 min at 95Â°C, 30 cycles of 20 sec at 95Â°C and 90 sec at 70Â°C, and a final extension of 10 min at 70Â°C. The amplified products were subcloned and sequenced.</p>

        <title>Construction of prokaryotic expression vectors for FLG2 expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>
</title>
        <p>Recombinant protein expression of FLG2 cDNA in <italic>Escherichia. coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) was performed by molecular subcloning of a partial FLG2 cDNA into prokaryotic expression vectors. This partial coding region, termed FLG2-S (residues 96 to 235), was generated as a PCR fragment using <italic>Pfu Turbo</italic>Â® DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). Two expression vectors, pET-SUMO (Invitrogen) and pET-32a (Novagen, North Ryde, Australia), were used in this study. One primer pair pET-IFPS-2-F and pET-IFPS-2-R (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005227-t001">Table 1</xref>) was used to introduce the cloning sites <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Not</italic>I sites. The PCR product was first subcloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and then double-digested prior to being cloned into the similarly digested pET-32a vector. To be subcloned into the pET-SUMO vector, the insert was generated with the primer pair SUMO-IFPS-2-F and SUMO-IFPS-2-R. Both constructs were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> TOP10 (Invitrogen) and selected on LB agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics. Clones were sequenced to check for any mutation that might have been misincorporated during the amplification.</p>

        <p>Proteins were extracted from abdominal skin and pooled heel stratum corneum (SC). The subcutaneous fat tissue was separated from abdominal skin and it was minced with a scalpel blade into smaller pieces. The skin or pooled SC was ground in liquid nitrogen in the presence of washed hydrochloric acid-treated sea sand. The fine-grained powder was added with 500 Âµl of PBS containing Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (CPIC; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) (buffer 1) per 100 mg of skin (or SC), vortexed thoroughly and centrifuged. Unless otherwise indicated, all centrifugation steps were carried out at 11,900Ãg for 10 min. After separation of the supernatant (extract 1), the sample sediment was resuspended in 500 Âµl of buffer 2 (5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl containing CPIC) and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected (extract 2) and the pellet was resuspended in 500 Âµl of buffer 3 (buffer 2 plus 10 mM DTT and CPIC) and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature before centrifugation.
