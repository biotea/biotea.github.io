        <p>Neurotrophins, such as NGF and BDNF, induce sustained activation of Rap1 small G protein and ERK, which are essential for neurite outgrowth. We show involvement of a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Rap1, PDZ-GEF1, in these processes. PDZ-GEF1 is activated by GTP-Rap1 via a positive feedback mechanism. Upon NGF binding, the TrkA neurotrophin receptor is internalized from the cell surface, passes through early endosomes, and arrives in late endosomes. A tetrameric complex forms between PDZ-GEF1, synaptic scaffolding molecule and ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning protein which interacts directly with the TrkA receptor. At late endosomes, the complex induces sustained activation of Rap1 and ERK, resulting in neurite outgrowth. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, PDZ-GEF1 is recruited to late endosomes in a BDNF-dependent manner involved in BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth. Thus, the interaction of PDZ-GEF1 with an internalized neurotrophin receptor transported to late endosomes induces sustained activation of both Rap1 and ERK and neurite outgrowth.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Formation and extension of axons and dendrites, so-called neurite outgrowth, is a crucial event in neuronal differentiation and maturation during development of the nervous system (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Da Silva and Dotti, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Horton and Ehlers, 2003</xref>). These morphological changes require reorganization of the cytoskeletal networks and its accompanying membrane expansion and contraction (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Craig et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1998</xref>). Rap1 small G protein has been shown to be involved in neurite outgrowth and neuronal polarization through regulating the MAPK cascade and the cytoskeletal network (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">York et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Schwamborn and PÃ¼schel, 2004</xref>). Rho small G protein has been shown to be involved in the morphological development of neurons through regulating actin dynamics (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Jalink et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kozma et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bito et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Da Silva et al., 2003</xref>). We previously showed that inactivation of Rho is required for the Rap1-induced neurite outgrowth (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>). Rap1-activated Rho GTPase-activating protein, RA-RhoGAP, transduces a signal from Rap1 to Rho and inactivates Rho. The precise temporary and spatially activation of Rap1 is important for regulating the activity of RA-RhoGAP to produce the neurite. However, the mechanism underlying how and where Rap1 is activated remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Neurite outgrowth begins with the activation of membrane receptors of neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Reichardt, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sofroniew et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Zweifel et al., 2005</xref>). NGF is the prototypic neurotrophin, a group of structurally related signaling proteins that are crucial for the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of specific neuronal population (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Snider, 1994</xref>). First, NGF binds to TrkA receptor and induces its dimerization, which then activates its own tyrosine kinase and gathers a signaling complex consisting of SOS, a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) specific for Ras small G protein, Grb2, an adaptor protein for SOS, and Shc, a linker protein between Grb2 and TrkA receptor, on the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). Ras is transiently activated on the plasma membrane and induces activation of the c-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. On the other hand, activated TrkA receptor gathers another signaling complex consisting of C3G, a GEF specific for Rap1, CrkL, an adaptor protein for C3G, and FRS2, a linker protein between CrkL and TrkA receptor, on the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). TrkA receptor and the FRS2-Crk-C3G complex associating with the receptor are internalized into clathrin-coated vesicles and transported to early endosomes (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). Rap1 is activated at the early endosomes and induces activation of the B-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. It has been believed that Rap1 is also activated on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, but the direct evidence has not been obtained. Then, TrkA receptor proceeds further along the degradative pathway in a microtubule- and motor-dependent fashion, reaching late endosomes, followed by the physical destruction of TrkA receptor by proteolysis in lysosomes (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Jullien et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Saxena et al., 2005a</xref>,<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Thus, transport of TrkA receptor to late endosomes has long been recognized as a means to terminate the signaling via degradation of the activated TrkA receptor complex after their internalization from the cell surface.</p>
      <p>Recent studies suggest that TrkA receptor, after binding NGF at the cell surface, passes through early endosomes and reaches to late endosomes within 30 min (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Saxena et al., 2005a</xref>). However, there is still sustained activation of Rap1 after 30 min (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). Like the activated TrkA receptor complex at early endosomes, TrkA receptor at late endosomes might be competent in the sustained activation of Rap1, but it remains unknown whether, or if so how, Rap1 is activated at late endosomes. Here, we addressed these issues and showed that activated TrkA receptor, which was transported to late endosomes, recruited PDZ-GEF1, a GEF specific for Rap1, by forming a complex through Trk receptors associating ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning (ARMS) and synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM). This tetramer complex then induced the sustained activation of Rap1 and ERK, eventually causing neurite outgrowth. ARMS is a tetraspan transmembrane protein and directly interacts with Trk receptors through each transmembrane domain (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arevalo et al. 2004</xref>). S-SCAM is a synaptic scaffolding molecule with six PDZ domains (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hirao et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

        <title>Activation of PDZ-GEF1 by GTP-Rap1</title>
        <p>As PDZ-GEF1 has a Rap1-binding RA domain, we first examined whether the binding of GTP-Rap1 to the RA domain affects the GEF activity of PDZ-GEF1. We generated recombinant proteins of FLAG-tagged full-length PDZ-GEF1 (FLAG-PDZ-GEF1) and its RA domainâdeficient mutant FLAG-PDZ-GEF1-ÎRA and examined their GEF activity. FLAG-PDZ-GEF1 indeed showed GEF activity toward Rap1 as reported (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">de Rooij et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ohtsuka et al., 1999</xref>), while FLAG-PDZ-GEF1-ÎRA showed much less effect on Rap1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The constitutively active form of GST-Rap1A enhanced the PDZ-GEF1 activity twofold more than control GST did (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), whereas it did not affect the GEF activity of FLAG-PDZ-GEF1-ÎRA (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200610073/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200610073/DC1</ext-link>). In addition, GST-Rap-binding domain (RBD) of RalGDS, a specific inhibitor of GTP-Rap1, inhibited the PDZ-GEF1 activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These results indicate that PDZ-GEF1 is activated by GTP-Rap1 and suggests that once PDZ-GEF1 is activated, its activation is amplified by GTP-Rap1 in a positive feedback mechanism.</p>

        <title>Involvement of PDZ-GEF1 in the NGF-induced sustained activation of Rap1 at late endosomes</title>
        <p>As PDZ-GEF1 has an auto-amplification GEF activity toward Rap1, we examined whether PDZ-GEF1 is involved in the NGF-induced sustained activation of Rap1 and ERK. We first performed loss-of-function experiments by use of the RNA interference (RNAi) method for PDZ-GEF1. Immunoblotting showed that the amount of PDZ-GEF1 was markedly reduced by the knockdown of PDZ-GEF1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The amounts of other proteins, including TrkA receptor, another Rap1 GEF C3G, Rap1, Ras, and ERK remained unchanged (unpublished data). The knockdown of PDZ-GEF1 significantly decreased the activation of Rap1, but not Ras, after NGF stimulation as estimated by the pull-down assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and unpublished data). The knockdown of PDZ-GEF1 did not inhibit the activation of ERK at 5 min after NGF stimulation, but it significantly decreased it at 30 and 60 min. The reason why we measured the activation of Rap1 and ERK at 30 and 60 min was that (1) it was reported that activation of Rap1 at 5 min does not contribute to transient activation of ERK at 5 min (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">York et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sasagawa et al., 2005</xref>); (2) that a substantial portion of the transient activation of ERK at 5 min mainly depends on Ras, but not on Rap1, whereas the activation of Rap1 at later time points, such as 30 and 60 min, but not at 5 min, contributes to the sustained activation of ERK at 30 and 60 min; and (3) that this sustained activation of ERK is essential for neurite outgrowth.</p>

        <p>Consistent with the results of the pull-down assay, the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging assay showed that the knockdown of PDZ-GEF1 reduced the activation of Rap1 at the perinuclear region of the cells after NGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 Ba</xref>). To rescue the knockdown of PDZ-GEF1, we generated siRNA-resistant PDZ-GEF1 expression vector (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 Bb</xref>). Expression of siRNA-resistant PDZ-GEF1 potently rescued the activation of Rap1 at the perinuclear region of the cells at 30 min after NGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 Bc</xref>). Rap1 has been shown to localize at various intracellular organelles, such as the Golgi complex, early endosomes, and late endosomes, in cultured fibroblasts and epithelial cells (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Beranger et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Pizon et al., 1994</xref>). To examine the localization of endogenous Rap1 in PC12 cells, we performed subcellular fractionation from the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) of PC12 cells. A significant amount of Rap1 was recovered in the EEA1-positive early endosomal fraction and the Rab7-positive late endosomal fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 Ca</xref>). To examine the localization of GTP-Rap1 in PC12 cells, we performed the subcellular fractionation in the presence of GST-RalGDS-3xRBD, which preferentially binds to GTP-Rap1 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann et al., 1996</xref>). GST-RalGDS-3xRBD was recovered in the late endosomal fraction at 30 min after NGF stimulation, indicating that Rap1 was activated at late endosomes at 30 min after NGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 Cb</xref>). The huge amount of GST- RalGDS-3xRBD, which did not bind to Rap1, remained in the bottom PNS and heavy membrane fractions.</p>
        <p>The NGF-induced neurite outgrowth was reduced in the PDZ-GEF1-knockdown PC12 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). This knockdown effect was rescued by expression of siRNA-resistant PDZ-GEF1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Moreover, PC12 cells overexpressing PDZ-GEF1 or PDZ-GEF1-ÎRA displayed marked neurite outgrowth at 12 h after NGF stimulation as compared with control cells (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200610073/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200610073/DC1</ext-link>). Consistent with the difference in the GEF activities between PDZ-GEF1 and PDZ-GEF1-ÎRA shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 Ab</xref>, the effect of PDZ-GEF1-ÎRA on neurite outgrowth was less effective than that of PDZ-GEF1. Collectively, these results indicate that PDZ-GEF1 is involved in the NGF-induced sustained activation of Rap1 and ERK, which eventually causes neurite outgrowth.</p>
        <p>Before NGF stimulation, FLAG-PDZ-GEF1 diffusely localized at the cytoplasm, but it was recruited to LBPA-positive late endosomes at 30 min after NGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). FLAG-PDZ-GEF1 was not recruited to EEA1-positive early endosomes at either 5 or 30 min. In contrast to PDZ-GEF1, C3G was recruited to EEA1-positive early endosomes at 5 min after NGF stimulation (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200610073/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200610073/DC1</ext-link>). C3G was not recruited to LBPA-positive late endosomes at either 5 or 30 min. These results indicate that PDZ-GEF1 is recruited to late endosomes in response to NGF and suggest that this Rap1 GEF is involved in the NGF-induced sustained activation of Rap1 at late endosomes.</p>

        <title>Involvement of transport of TrkA receptor to late endosomes in the NGF-induced recruitment of PDZ-GEF1</title>
        <p>We next examined whether transport of TrkA receptor to late endosomes recruits PDZ-GEF1 there. Bafilomycin is known to be an inhibitor of V-ATPase-regulating protein trafficking from early to late endosomes (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hurtado-Lorenzo et al., 2006</xref>). The immunofluorescence signal for TrkA receptor became concentrated at EEA1-positive early endosomes at 5 min and at LBPA-positive late endosomes at 30 min after NGF stimulation (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200610073/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200610073/DC1</ext-link>). Bafilomycin did not inhibit the NGF-induced transport of TrkA receptor to EEA1-positive early endosomes at 5 min, but it significantly decreased the transport of TrkA receptor to LBPA-positive late endosomes at 30 min (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref> and Fig. S4). Bafilomycin inhibited the recruitment of PDZ-GEF1 to LBPA-positive late endosomes at 30 min after NGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

        <title>NGF-induced formation of a tetramer complex of PDZ-GEF1, S-SCAM, ARMS, and TrkA receptor</title>
        <p>We next attempted to understand the molecular mechanism how PDZ-GEF1 induces the activation of Rap1 at late endosomes in response to NGF. We previously showed that PDZ-GEF1 directly binds S-SCAM (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ohtsuka et al., 1999</xref>), whereas it was shown that TrkA receptor directly binds an endosomal protein ARMS (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Yano and Chao, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arevalo et al. 2006</xref>). Consistent with our earlier observation, S-SCAM was coimmunoprecipitated with PDZ-GEF1 before or after NGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). ARMS and TrkA receptor were also coimmunoprecipitated with PDZ-GEF1, but this coimmunoprecipitation was strengthened after NGF stimulation. However, presumably due to the reconstitution of the complex during the procedure of cell lysis, we did not get the strong difference in the amount of the complex between 5 min and 60 min after NGF stimulation. These results suggest that PDZ-GEF1 forms a tetramer complex with S-SCAM, ARMS, and TrkA receptor after NGF stimulation.</p>

        <p>As ARMS has a PDZ-binding motif, RESIL, at the cytoplasmic tail, we examined by the pull-down assay whether ARMS directly binds to S-SCAM or PDZ-GEF1. The GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal region of ARMS (GST-ARMS- C-terminal) bound to S-SCAM, but not to PDZ-GEF1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and unpublished data). GST-ARMS-C-terminal lacking the last three amino acids in the RESIL motif (GST-ARMS-C-terminal-ÎSIL) did not bind to S-SCAM. The PDZ4 domain of S-SCAM bound to GST-ARMS-C-terminal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C, a and b</xref>). Under the conditions where Myc-S-SCAM was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-ARMS, Myc-S-SCAM lacking the PDZ4 domain (S-SCAM-ÎPDZ4) was not coimmunoprecipitated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 Cc</xref>). These results indicate that S-SCAM directly binds ARMS and that this binding is mediated by the PDZ4 domain of S-SCAM and the PDZ-binding motif of ARMS. Collectively with the earlier observations that PDZ-GEF1 binds to the PDZ1 domain of S-SCAM and that ARMS directly binds to TrkA receptor in a NGF-dependent manner, these results indicate that PDZ-GEF1 binds to S-SCAM to form a binary complex in a NGF-independent manner, which binds to TrkA receptor through ARMS to form a tetramer complex in a NGF-dependent manner.</p>

        <title>Formation of the tetramer complex at late endosomes</title>
        <p>We then examined whether this tetramer complex of PDZ-GEF1, S-SCAM, ARMS, and TrkA receptor is formed at late endosomes in intact PC12 cells. The immunofluorescence signal for ARMS was mainly concentrated at LBPA-positive late endosomes, not at early endosomes, before and after NGF stimulation, indicating that ARMS is an intrinsic late endosomal protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The signals for PDZ-GEF1 and S-SCAM localized diffusely at the cytoplasm before NGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B, a and c</xref>). The signal for TrkA receptor localized at the cell surface plasma membrane and a vesicular-like structure, presumably, early endosomes, before NGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 Bb</xref>). The signals for PDZ-GEF1, S-SCAM, and TrkA receptor became concentrated at ARMS-positive late endosomes after NGF stimulation. As the signals for PDZ-GEF1 and S-SCAM colocalized well before and after NGF stimulation, these two molecules seem to form a binary complex, consistent with the above coimmunoprecipitation results (Fig. S5A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200610073/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200610073/DC1</ext-link>). Collectively, these results suggest that upon binding of NGF, TrkA receptor is internalized and transported to ARMS-positive late endosomes, interacts with ARMS, and then recruits the PDZ-GEF1-S-SCAM complex mainly to ARMS-positive late endosomes, resulting in the tetramer complex formation.</p>

The bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with indicated Abs. Arrowhead indicates a light chain of rabbit IgG. Arrow indicates Rab7. The PDZ-GEF1-pAb immunoreactive nonspecific bands were observed in the control IgG coated-magnetic beads presumably due to the nonspecific reaction of the secondary Ab against the contaminating proteins interacted with the magnetic beads.

        <title>Involvement of PDZ-GEF1 in the BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons</title>
        <p>To validate the role of PDZ-GEF1 in PC12 cells, we finally examined whether PDZ-GEF1 is involved in the BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth in rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons. It has been reported that BDNF, but not NGF, enhances axon elongation in hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ip et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Morfini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Labelle and Leclerc, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>).

PDZ-GEF1 was recruited to LBPA-positive late endosomes at 30 min after BDNF stimulation (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 A</xref>). PDZ-GEF1 was not recruited to EEA1-positive early endosomes. Hippocampal neurons were cotransfected with an expression vector for GFP as a morphological marker along with the PDZ-GEF1 siRNA expression vector.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We first showed here that NGF induced the sustained activation of Rap1 at late endosomes and neurite outgrowth in cultured PC12 cells. The activation of Rap1 at late endosomes was catalyzed by PDZ-GEF1. Earlier FRET studied showed that Rap1 was activated at peri-nuclear regions and it was practically difficult to distinguish the sites of the activation of Rap1 at the plasma membrane, early endosomes, and late endosomes by this method (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Mochizuki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ohba et al., 2003</xref>). We could not directly show the activation of Rap1 at late endosomes but indirectly showed it by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoisolation analysis: PDZ-GEF1 was recruited to late endosomes in response to NGF. PDZ-GEF1 was not recruited to early endosomes, whereas C3G was recruited to early endosomes, but not to late endosomes. Thus, these two GEFs for Rap1 play roles in different compartments.</p>
      <p>As Rap1 is first activated by C3G at the plasma membrane and early endosomes after NGF stimulation (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2001</xref>), activated Rap1 may affect the GEF activity of PDZ-GEF1. We found that the inhibitory effect of the knockdown of C3G on the NGF-induced sustained activation of Rap1 and neurite outgrowth was less effective than that of the knockdown of PDZ-GEF1. The knockdown of PDZ-GEF1 alone did not completely abolish the NGF-induced sustained activation of Rap1 or neurite outgrowth. The double knockdown of C3G and PDZ-GEF1 completely abolished the NGF-induced sustained activation of Rap1 and neurite outgrowth similar to the knockdown of Rap1. Thus, C3G and PDZ-GEF1 seem to work cooperatively in the NGF-induced sustained activation of Rap1 and neurite outgrowth. We found that C3G was recruited to early endosomes, but not to late endosomes. The activation of Rap1 was observed on late endosomes, not on early endosomes, at 30 min after NGF stimulation. Moreover, inhibition of the transport of TrkA receptor form early to late endosomes reduced the activation of Rap1 at 30 min after NGF stimulation. Collectively, we propose the following model for the activation of Rap1 by C3G and PDZ- GEF: (1) Upon NGF stimulation, C3G first activates Rap1 on early endosomes; (2) GTP-Rap1 on early endosomes is transported to late endosomes with TrkA receptor; and (3) Transported GTP-Rap1 activates PDZ-GEF1 and induces the sustained activation of Rap1 on late endosomes, eventually inducing neurite outgrowth.</p>
      <p>The long-distance retrograde NGF signaling from axon terminals to cell bodies is crucial for neuronal survival and plasticity (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Howe and Mobley 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Zweifel et al., 2005</xref>). It was shown that the internalization and endosomal trafficking of TrkA receptor are important for the long-distance retrograde NGF signaling (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">York et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ginty and Segal, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Howe and Mobley, 2004</xref>). TrkA receptor continues to transduce a signal after its internalization into endosomes (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">York et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ginty and Segal, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Howe and Mobley, 2004</xref>). Certain specialized endosomal organelles might represent signaling platforms from which specific pathways emerge (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sorkin and Von Zastrow, 2002</xref>). Earlier studies demonstrated that late endosomes are the major endosomal population labeled by endocytosed iodinated NGF in cell bodies of sympathetic neurons (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Claude et al., 1982</xref>). As the interaction of TrkA receptor and NGF is resistant to decreasing pH values within the endosomal pathway (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Zapf-Colby and Olefsky, 1998</xref>), it appears likely that NGF is still bound to the extracellular domain of TrkA receptor within late endosomes. Accordingly, immunoelectron microscopic study found phospho-TrkA receptor (pTrkA) immunoreactivity in late endosomes of sciatic-nerves (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharyya et al., 2002</xref>) and biochemical study found pTrkA in late endosomes in PC12 cells (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Saxena et al., 2005a</xref>). Rab7, a member of the Rab family small G proteins, which regulates TrkA receptor transport from late endosomes to lysosomes, was shown to regulate the persistence of TrkA receptor at late endosomes and TrkA receptor signaling (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Saxena et al., 2005b</xref>). Consistent with these earlier observations, we showed here by use of bafilomycin, an agent which inhibits the vesicular traffic from early endosomes to late endosomes, that the NGF-induced internalization and transport of TrkA receptor to late endosomes was essential for the sustained activation of Rap1 at late endosomes, the activation of ERK, and neurite outgrowth. Collectively with our findings, like TrkA receptor in clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al., 2001</xref>) and early endosomes (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Delcroix et al., 2003</xref>), TrkA receptor in late endosomes is competent of signaling. In addition, there are several reports that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) induce signaling from late endosomes. For instance, it is known that late endosomes contain phospho-EGF receptor (pEGFR and its activated downstream signaling components (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Oksvold et al., 2001</xref>). The MAPK scaffold p14 localizes to the outer limiting membrane of late endosomes, and this localization is essential for EGFR signaling (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wunderlich et al., 2001</xref>). There is also in vivo evidence pointing toward the importance of late endosomes in the regulation of neuronal TGF-Î² signaling (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sweeney and Davis, 2002</xref>). Thus, late endosomes appear to be ideally suited for regulating spatial and temporal compartmentalization of signal transduction, beyond its conventional role in cargo degradation. Our report is the first to demonstrate that late endosomes represent functional TrkA receptor signaling platforms. This system might play a role in continuing activation state of NGF signaling during transport of TrkA receptor from axon terminals to cell bodies.</p>
      <p>We furthermore showed here that PDZ-GEF1 was recruited to late endosomes to form a complex with TrkA receptor, which was internalized and transported there, and that recruited PDZ-GEF1 induced sustained activation of Rap1 and ERK. NGF-bound TrkA receptor activates its own tyrosine kinase and gathers the signaling complex consisting of C3G, CrkL, and FRS2 on the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). TrkA receptor and the FRS2-Crk-C3G complex associating with the receptor are internalized into clathrin-coated vesicles and move into early endosomes within 5 min (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2001</xref>). Rap1 is activated at early endosomes and activated Rap1 induces the activation of the MAPK cascade through activating B-Raf (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). TrkA receptor then passes through early endosomes without entering into the recycling pathway to the plasma membrane and reaches to late endosomes within 30 min. Like the activated TrkA receptor complex at early endosomes, the TrkA receptor complex containing ARMS, S-SCAM, and PDZ-GEF1 at late endosomes was competent in activation of Rap1. While the GEF activity of C3G is activated by its interacting partner Crk (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">York et al., 1998</xref>), it remains unknown how the activity of PDZ-GEF1 is regulated at late endosomes. PDZ-GEF1 binds to the PDZ1 domain of S-SCAM through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif and forms a stable complex (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ohtsuka et al., 1999</xref>). However, the binding of S-SCAM to PDZ-GEF1 does not affect GEF activity in vitro (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ohtsuka et al., 1999</xref>). The complex was recruited to ARMS-positive late endosomes through directly binding to ARMS, in a manner dependent on transport of TrkA receptor. The C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of PDZ-GEF1 contributed to direct the subcellular localization of PDZ-GEF1, leading to the augmented activation of Rap1 at late endosomes. Collectively, PDZ-GEF1 is recruited to late endosomes through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. PDZ-GEF1 then activates Rap1 at late endosomes and the GEF activity of PDZ-GEF1 is augmented by a positive feedback mechanism, resulting in the sustained activation of Rap1 at late endosomes. It may be noted that when TrkA receptor is transported from early endosomes to late endosomes, the FRS2-Crk-C3G complex associating with TrkA receptor remains at early endosomes, suggesting that this complex is dissociated from the receptor. The mechanism of this dissociation remains unknown and is an issue to be addressed in the future.</p>
      <p>We finally showed here that the PDZ-GEF1-induced sustained activation of Rap1 at late endosomes was involved in the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and the BDNF-induced axon outgrowth in rat hippocampal neurons. What is the target protein(s) of Rap1 in the neurite outgrowth? Many downstream targets of Rap1 have been identified: they include c-Raf, B-Raf, RalGDS, afadin/AF-6, PI3-kinase, and RAPL (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kinashi and Katagiri, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Nakanishi and Takai, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Price and Bos, 2004</xref>). c-Raf and B-Raf are protein kinases connecting Ras to ERK; RalGDS is a regulator of another small G protein Ral; afadin/AF-6 is an actin filament- and nectin-binding protein at adherens junctions; PI3-kinase is a phosphatidylinositol kinase, and RAPL is a small protein which transduces a signal from Rap1 to integrin. Among them, for activating MAP kinase cascade, B-Raf was shown to be the target protein of Rap1 for the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ohtsuka et al., 1996</xref>). Several transcription factors, which are downstream of the MAP kinase cascade, contribute to neurite outgrowth by gene expression. On the other hand, RAPL and its binding protein Mst1 were recently shown to be involved in transport of integrin LFA-1 and its activation in lymphocytes (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Katagiri et al., 2006</xref>). Transport of transmembrane proteins from late endosomes to the plasma membrane is an emerging paradigm and generally accepted (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Mellman and Steinman, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Trajkovic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">van Niel et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, activation of Rap1 at late endosomes might be involved in the transport of integrin from late endosomes to the plasma membrane and thereby regulate the activation of MAP kinase cascade indirectly. Moreover, we previously identified RA-RhoGAP as another direct downstream target of Rap1 (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>). RA-RhoGAP has the RA and GAP domains in addition to the PH and annexin-like repeat domains. It indeed shows a GAP activity specific for Rho and this GAP activity is enhanced by GTP-Rap1. The Rap1-RA-RhoGAP-Rho pathway plays an important role in the neurite outgrowth. Collectively, during the initiation of the neurite outgrowth, a neurite formation signal(s), such as NGF and BDNF, induces the C3G-mediated activation of Rap1 at endocytic vesicles or early endosomes in a growth cone of the nascent neurite. Subsequently, RA-RhoGAP is recruited and activated by Rap1 to cause the inactivation of Rho at the growth cone of the nascent neurite. Repression of the Rho-mediated signaling pathway induces rapid actin depolymerization of the growth cone and thereby extends the incipient neurite further. In addition, to replenish the requirement for neurite outgrowth, such as signaling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins, endocytic vesicles or early endosomes are transported to late endosomes to sustain the activation of Rap1 by PDZ-GEF1. The sustained activation of Rap1 prolongs the activation time of the MAPK cascade and results in the up-regulation of gene expression. Thus, the Rap1-RA-RhoGAP-Rho system and the PDZ-GEF-Rap1-B-Raf-MAPK system could cooperatively regulate neurite outgrowth. In future studies, it will be important to elucidate how these two systems are spatially and temporally activated during the neurite outgrowth.</p>

        <title>FRET imaging</title>
        <p>PC12 cells were transfected with an empty pSUPER-retro vector or pSUPER-retro-PDZ-GEF1. After selection with puromycin, cells were further transfected with pRaichu-Rap1. PC12 cells expressing Raichu-Rap1 were starved for 6â12 h with phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then treated with 50 ng/ml of NGF. The medium was covered with mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) to preclude evaporation. Cells were imaged with an IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped with a Cool SNAP-HQ cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific) controlled with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging), as described previously (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Mochizuki et al., 2001</xref>). The filters used for the dual-emission imaging studies were obtained from Omega Optical: an XF1071 (440AF21) excitation filter, an XF2034 (455DRLP) dichroic mirror, and two emission filters (XF3075 (480AF30) for CFP and XF3079 (535AF26) for YFP). Cells were illuminated with a 75-W Xenon lamp through a 12% ND filter and viewed through a 60x immersion objective lens. The exposure times for 4 Ã 4 binning were 400 msec for CFP and YFP images, and 100 msec for differential interference contrast (DIC) images. After background subtraction, YFP/CFP ratio images were created with the MetaMorph software and the images were used to represent FRET efficiency.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy</title>
        <p>Staining was performed as follows: PC12 cells were seeded onto poly-<sc>l</sc>- lysine coated coverslips in 24-well plates a day before the experiment. PC12 cells were cultured in DME with serum for 24 h, serum-starved for 16 h, treated with bafilomycin for 2 h, and stimulated by NGF for 30 min. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.05% Saponin for 30 min at room temperature. Images were captured using a Carl Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope using a 63Ã oil immersion objective lens (model LSM 510-V3.2; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) or a confocal laser scanning microscope (model TE2000; Nikon) using a 60Ã oil immersion objective lens.

        <title>Quantification of neurites</title>
        <p>PC12 cells were obtained from Dr. Shinya Kuroda (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan) and maintained in DMEM with 5% horse serum and 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone) in a 10% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM with serum for 48 h and stimulated by NGF for 24 h. Images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope using a 60Ã oil immersion objective lens (model TE2000; Nikon). Collected data were exported as 8-bit TIFF files and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. The assay for neurite outgrowth was performed on 40â60 cells randomly chosen in each group. The number of primary neurites per cell was defined as the number of thin cell processes with a length longer than one cell diameter. The statistical significance of differences between each group was analyzed by the two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test.</p>
        <p>Rat hippocampal neurons were prepared form embryonic day (E) 18 Sprague-Dawley rats with slight modifications as described (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Goslin and Banker, 1989</xref>). For cDNA transfection, before plating, the cells were resuspended in an optimized transfection solution for primary rat hippocampal neurons (Amaxa). Each sample (2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 100 Î¼l) was transfected with 2 Î¼g cDNA as indicated by using Nucleofector electroporation device (Amaxa), according to the optimized protocol for primary rat hippocampal neurons (Amaxa). Immediately after transfection, the cells were cultured in 24-multiwells at a density of 3 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. After 1.5 d culture, neurons were processed for immunohistochemistry. Images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope using 40 and 60Ã oil immersion objective lens (model TE2000; Nikon). Collected data were exported as 8-bit TIFF files and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. The morphometrical analysis for axons and minor neurites was performed on between 40 and 60 GFP-positive neurons (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahnert-Hilger et al., 2004</xref>). The number of axons or minor neurites per cell was defined as the number of Tau-1-positive processes at least twice as long as the other processes or MAP2-positive processes longer than one cell diameter, respectively. The length of individual axons for each neuron was measured by use of the NIH Image software. Axon length encompasses all visible parts of an axon without the length of its branches. The statistical significance of differences between each group was analyzed by the two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test.</p>

        <title>Subcellular fractionation</title>
        <p>PC12 cells (cultured on 3 Ã 10 cm plates) were cracked with a ball-bearing homogenizer in Buffer B (250 mM sucrose, 3 mM imidazole at pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Subsequently, a post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min (Kubota 5800). The PNS was adjusted to 40.6% sucrose, loaded at the bottom of a p55ST centrifuge tube (Hitachi), and overlaid sequentially with 35% and 30.5% sucrose solutions in 3 mM imidazole at pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide. Subsequently, the tube was filled up with the homogenization buffer. The gradient was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 66 min using a p55ST rotor (Hitachi). After the centrifugation, the different interfaces and sucrose cushions were collected from top to bottom of the tube. Heavy membrane fraction was recovered in the 40.6/35% fraction. Early endosomal fraction was recovered in the 35/30.5% fraction. Late endosomal fraction was recovered in the 30.5/8% fraction. BCA assays (Pierce Chemical Co.) were performed to determine the protein concentration of each fraction. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were loaded on SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the mouse anti-GM130 mAb, the mouse anti-EEA1 mAb, the rabbit anti-Rab7 pAb, and the rabbit anti-Rap1 pAb.</p>

        <p>Immunoisolation of vesicles was performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Saucan and Palade, 1994</xref>). In brief, PC12 cells (cultured on 4 Ã 10 cm plates) were starved for 16 h in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium containing 0.1% BSA, and either left unstimulated or stimulated by NGF for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were cracked with a ball-bearing homogenizer in Buffer B. Subsequently, a PNS was prepared by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min (Kubota 5800). Dynabeads Protein A (DYNAL Inc.) magnetic beads were coated with the anti-PDZ-GEF1 pAb or the control IgG at a density of 10 Î¼g Ab per 50 Î¼l beads according to manufacturer's instructions. The anti-PDZ-GEF1 pAb-coated beads were added to the PNS and incubated with continuous rotation at 4Â°C for 2 h. The immunoisolated beads were washed five times with Buffer B using a magnet and transferred to fresh tubes. The beads were finally resuspended in 80 Î¼l of the SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the mouse anti-EEA1 mAb, the rabbit anti-Rab7 pAb, the anti-ARMS mAb, and the rabbit anti-PDZ-GEF1.</p>
