        <title>Summary</title>
        <p id="P2">Algorithms designed to identify canonical yeast prions predict that ~250 human proteins, including several RNA-binding proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease, harbor a distinctive prion-like domain (PrLD) enriched in uncharged polar amino acids and glycine. PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. However, the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is not understood. Here, we define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1 in families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone, and a case of familial ALS. Wild-type hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 display an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a âsteric zipperâ motif in the PrLD, which accelerates formation of self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Importantly, the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization caused by a potent mutant âsteric zipperâ motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with PrLDs must be considered candidates for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone.</p>

    <p id="P3">Elucidating the genetic basis of rare, inherited diseases can provide valuable insights to the molecular pathogenesis of common diseases. Inclusion body myopathy with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Pagetâs disease of bone and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (sometimes called âIBMPFD/ALSâ) is a rare disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of muscle, brain, motor neurons and bone accompanied by prominent TDP-43 pathology<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Patients with this rare, inherited syndrome experience features of IBM, FTD, ALS or PDB indistinguishable from familial and sporadic cases of these disorders, and the disease may manifest in multiple tissues in the same patient<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Recently the name âmultisystem proteinopathyâ (MSP) has been adopted to reflect the expanding phenotype and prominent proteinaceous pathology that characterizes this syndrome. Some, but not all, cases of MSP are caused by mutations in the <italic>VCP</italic> gene<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, which encodes the AAA+-ATPase VCP, a ubiquitin-dependent segregase. The discovery that <italic>VCP</italic> mutations cause MSP led to the subsequent discovery of pathogenic <italic>VCP</italic> mutations in more common diseases such as sporadic or familial forms of ALS<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, FTD<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, IBM<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, and PDB<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These rare MSP families represent a unique opportunity to identify fundamental molecular defects shared among age-related diseases; thus it is highly desirable to identify additional genetic mutations responsible for this syndrome.</p>

      <title>Identification of a pathogenic mutation in hnRNPA2B1 in <italic>VCP</italic>-negative MSP</title>
      <p id="P4">We identified a family (family 1) with dominantly inherited degeneration affecting muscle, bone, brain, and motor neurons that was clinically indistinguishable from prior families we have seen with <italic>VCP</italic>-related MSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1 and Table 1</xref>).

Genetic analysis of this family by exome sequencing and linkage analysis in parallel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) identified a single novel variant (c.869/905A&gt;T, p.D290V/302V) that co-segregated with disease and impacted the gene encoding hnRNPA2B1, a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). hnRNPA2B1 is expressed as two alternatively spliced isoforms: A2 and B1. The shorter hnRNPA2, which lacks 12 amino acids in the N-terminal region, is the major isoform accounting for ~90% of the protein in most tissues. This mutation substitutes valine for an aspartate residue that is evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) and also centered in a motif that is conserved in multiple human paralogs in the hnRNP A/B family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

The clinical features of this family with <italic>VCP</italic>-negative MSP have been previously described<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. To identify the culprit mutation we took the same strategy as for family 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2 and Table 2</xref>). This analysis identified 5 novel SNVs and 1 indel that co-segregated with disease. Of these, a mutation in hnRNPA1 (c.785/941A&gt;T, p.D262V/314V) stood out because it was the only variant that impacted a conserved residue, it was predicted to be deleterious, and hnRNPA1 is highly expressed in affected tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Moreover, this mutation in hnRNPA1 was identical to that found in hnRNPA2B1 in family 1, creating a substitution of valine for a highly conserved aspartate residue that is centered in a motif conserved in multiple human paralogs the hnRNP A/B family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1eâf</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Subsequent to the identification of these MSP-causing mutations we screened the exomes of 212 familial ALS cases for sequence variants affecting hnRNPA2B1 or hnRNPA1. In one dominantly inherited case in which known ALS genes were formally excluded we identified a mutation (c.784/940G&gt;A; p.D262/314N) impacting the identical, conserved aspartate residue in hnRNPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, eâf</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P6">Identification of disease mutations in hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 was intriguing for 3 reasons.

      <title>Disease mutations impact a prion-like domain in hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1</title>
      <p id="P9">hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1 each have C-terminal, glycine-rich domains that are essential for activity and mediate interaction with TDP-43<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. FoldIndex predicts these domains to be intrinsically unfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3aâb</xref>). Interestingly, these low complexity domains have amino acid composition similar to that of yeast prion domains. Indeed, an algorithm devised by Alberti <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> predicted that the C-terminal regions of hnRNPA2 (residues 185â341) and hnRNPA1 (residues 186â320) are prion-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3aâd</xref>), whereas these domains narrowly missed the cutoff for prion propensity according to the Toombs <italic>et al</italic>. algorithm<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Interestingly, similar âprion-like domainsâ (PrLDs) are present in many hnRNPs, including TDP-43 and FUS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5 and Table 3</xref>). The disease-causing mutations fall at the center of the predicted PrLD, and, according to both algorithms, are expected to enhance prion-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3aâb</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P10">We also examined hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1 with ZipperDB, a structure-based threading algorithm, which scores 6-amino acid segments for their propensity to form 2 self-complementary beta strands termed âsteric zippersâ that form the spine of amyloid fibrils<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Hexapeptides with Rosetta energy lower than â23kcal/mol are predicted to form steric zippers, with lower energy predicting higher amyloidogenicity. ZipperDB predicted that disease mutations increase the potency of steric zipper motifs present in the PrLDs of hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3câf</xref>). This analysis is discussed in greater detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>. Taken together, multiple algorithms predict that the PrLDs of hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1 are intrinsically disordered, but poised to access higher order self-templating structures. Notably, the disease mutations are centered within these PrLDs and predicted to promote transition to an ordered structure.</p>

      <title>hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 are intrinsically fibrillization-prone and disease mutations accelerate fibrillization</title>
      <p id="P11">We directly tested the predictions that (i) hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 are prone to fibrillization and (ii) this property is enhanced by disease-causing mutations. First, we experimentally assessed the ZipperDB prediction for the impact of disease mutations on steric zipper motifs found in hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1. Remarkably, the synthetic mutant hexapeptides of hnRNPA2/B1-D290V (NYNVFG) and hnRNPA1-D262V (SYNVFG) rapidly assembled into amyloid fibrils, as shown by thioflavin-T fluorescence and electron microscopy (EM), whereas the corresponding wild-type peptides did not even after several weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4aâd</xref>). Thus, the disease mutations in hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1 generate highly amyloidogenic hexapeptides precisely as predicted. The more potent steric zippers that result from disease mutations are likely to be significant for two reasons. First, introduction of similarly potent steric zippers is sufficient to force fibril formation even in model proteins that do not ordinarily fibrillize<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Second, in hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 these potent steric zippers are centered in the intrinsically disordered PrLD and are thus available to make intermolecular contacts and drive fibril formation.</p>
      <p id="P12">We next assessed the fibrillization propensity of full-length proteins. We purified bacterially expressed, GST-tagged wild-type and mutant hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 as soluble proteins under native conditions and assessed fibrillization by sedimentation analysis and EM. Wild-type hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 were both intrinsically aggregation prone with a lag phase of ~4h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e, g</xref>). EM revealed that wild-type hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 form fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f, h</xref>). The pronounced lag suggests that a critical rate-limiting step in hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 fibrillization is nucleation. Indeed, a small quantity (5% wt/wt) of preformed hnRNPA2 or hnRNPA1 fibrils greatly accelerated the assembly of hnRNPA2 or hnRNPA1, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a, e</xref>). By contrast, preformed hnRNPA2 fibrils did not seed assembly of hnRNPA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7e</xref>). Likewise, preformed hnRNPA1 fibrils did not seed assembly of hnRNPA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Thus, wild-type hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 spontaneously form self-seeding fibrils.</p>
      <p id="P13">Importantly, the disease mutations greatly accelerated hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 fibrillization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4eâh</xref>). In all cases, the lag phase was curtailed and fibrillization was well advanced while the wild-type protein remained in lag phase. Thus, the disease mutations directly promote nucleation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into fibrils. Moreover, fibrils formed by hnRNPA2-D290V, hnRNPA1-D262V, and hnRNPA1-D262N not only seeded their own assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b, f, g</xref>), but also promoted fibrillization of their respective wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7d, i</xref>). Neither hnRNPA2-D290V fibrils nor hnRNPA1-D262V fibrils seeded the assembly of TDP-43, another RNA-binding protein with a PrLD.</p>
      <p id="P14">Finally, we assessed the importance of the steric zipper motifs in fibrillization. We deleted the steric zipper residues 287â292 from hnRNPA2 and 259â264 from hnRNAPA1 and assessed fibrillization in vitro. Importantly, neither hnRNPA2<sup>Î287â292</sup> nor hnRNPA1<sup>Î259â264</sup> formed fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e, g</xref>), even after 24h with agitation. Moreover, hnRNPA2<sup>Î287â292</sup> did not fibrillize when seeded by fibrils of wild-type or mutant hnRNPA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>), nor did hnRNPA1<sup>Î259â264</sup> fibrillize when seeded by fibrils of wild-type or mutant hnRNPA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7h</xref>). Thus, residues 287â292 of hnRNPA2 and 259â264 of hnRNPA1 are critical for spontaneous and seeded fibrillization of the full-length protein. Collectively, these findings indicate that steric zipper motifs centered in the PrLDs of wild-type hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 are critical to their intrinsic tendency to fibrillize and that disease mutations introduce more potent steric zippers, which accelerate nucleation and polymerization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>)</p>

      <title>The PrLD of mutant hnRNPA2/B1 supports prion activity in yeast</title>
      <p id="P15">Yeast prion proteins are generally modular, meaning that prion domains from one protein can be transferred to another, while retaining prion activity<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. To determine whether the PrLD of hnRNPA2/B1 could support prion activity in yeast, we replaced the Sup35 nucleation domain (residues 3â40) with the core PrLD (residues 261â303) from either wild-type or mutant hnRNPA2/B1 and expressed these fusion proteins as the sole copies of Sup35 in the cell. Prion formation was detected by monitoring nonsense suppression of the <italic>ade2-1</italic> allele and verified by monitoring a series of prion-defining criteria, including curability with guanidine, transferability with cytoduction and sensitivity to expression levels (detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). This analysis showed that the hnRNPA2/B1 core PrLD can substitute for the Sup35 nucleation domain in supporting prion formation, and that the D290V mutation specifically promotes the nucleation activity.

      <title>Disease mutations enhance recruitment of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 to stress granules</title>
      <p id="P16">Remarkably, the PrLDs in hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 correspond to the âlow complexity sequencesâ found in various hnRNPs (including TDP-43 and FUS) that are essential determinants of RNA granule assembly<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules composed of repressed translation complexes<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. TDP-43 and FUS are recruited to SGs and this is enhanced by disease mutations<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Thus, we hypothesized that hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 would be recruited to SGs and that this would be enhanced by disease mutations. To test this, we first examined the subcellular localization of endogenous hnRNPA2/B1 in HeLa cells before and after SG induction with arsenite. At baseline, endogenous hnRNPA2/B1 was localized exclusively to nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Following arsenite treatment hnRNPA2/B1 relocalized to eIF4Gâpositive cytoplasmic puncta, showing the recruitment of endogenous hnRNPA2/B1 to SGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P17">To examine the impact of disease mutations, we expressed Flag-tagged versions of wild-type and mutant hnRNPA2.

Moreover, following arsenite treatment mutant hnRNPA2 was incorporated into SGs more rapidly than wild-type hnRNPA2, although by 30 min their degree of incorporation was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Both wild-type and mutant hnRNPA2 formed high molecular weight species that accumulated in the detergent-insoluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).

Expression of wild-type hnRNPA2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscle led to mild degeneration affecting the rostral portion of several muscles, whereas expression of hnRNPA2-D290V caused severe degeneration that affected all muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Importantly, flies over-expressing hnRNPA2<sup>Î287â292</sup>, in which the hexapeptide (NYN<bold><underline>D</underline></bold>FG) in the PrLD was deleted, had virtually normal muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). This result indicates that the severe toxicity found in flies over-expressing mutant hnRNPA2 requires the presence of this potent steric zipper motif.</p>
      <p id="P19">Immunohistochemical analysis showed that wild-type hnRNPA2 localized appropriately to nuclei, as did hnRNPA2<sup>Î287â292</sup>, whereas hnRNPA2-D290V largely accumulated in cytoplasmic inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). We observed a correlation between cytoplasmic inclusion formation and solubility of hnRNPA2.

      <p id="P21">Polymerization of PrLDs underlies the orderly, regulated phase transition that drives assembly of nonmembrane-bound organelles including RNA granules, which serve as "reaction crucibles" in which many aspects of RNA metabolism occur<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Disease mutations introduce more potent steric zippers into the PrLDs of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1, dysregulating and accelerating nucleation and polymerization, altering the dynamics of RNA granule assembly, which likely has adverse consequences for RNA metabolism. In addition to hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1, at least four other RNA-binding proteins that harbor PrLDs (TDP-43, FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15) accumulate in disease pathology<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. By analogy to hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1, we speculate that these and perhaps other PrLD-containing proteins contribute to the initiation or propagation of disease by a similar mechanism. Indeed, ~250 human proteins are predicted to harbor PrLDs, many of which are RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5 and Table 3</xref>), and must be considered candidates for contributing to degenerative disease.</p>
      <p id="P22">Thus, disease could ensue from unregulated polymerization initiated spontaneously by PrLDs upon environmental stress, by a mutation impacting the PrLD, or by a mutation impacting another factor (e.g. VCP) that regulates the ribonucleoprotein granule assembly with altered metabolism of RNA as a consequence.</p>
      <p id="P23">Notably, diseases associated with pathological inclusions of PrLD-containing proteins frequently show âspreadingâ pathology, in which cellular degeneration with intracellular inclusions starts in one epicenter and subsequently spreads to neighboring tissue<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. While not directly addressed here, this study suggests that cell-to-cell transmission of a self-templating conformer could contribute to the spreading pathology that is characteristic of these diseases.</p>

Therefore, subsequent to the discovery of mutations in hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 underlying MSP, we screened 212 familial ALS cases and identified a pathogenic hnRNPA1 mutation in one family, as described above. As this manuscript was being assembled for publication we completed screening of 305 sporadic ALS cases and identified a nonsynonymous variant in hnRNPA1 (c.800/956A&gt;G, p.N267/319S) in one classic, late-onset case in which mutations in known ALS genes had been excluded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 17</xref>). Although not definitive, this variant is likely pathogenic since it is centered in the core PrLD and introduces a potent steric zipper similar to that introduced by D262V/N mutations. The frequency of hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 mutations in ALS, and the possibility that mutations in these genes underlie some sporadic and familial forms of FTD, IBM, and PDB, is will be important to address in the future.</p>

        <title>Exome capture and next-generation sequencing</title>
        <p id="P28">Exome enrichment of 3 Âµg of genomic DNA was performed by using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kit capture library (G3362 for 5 DNA samples from family 1 and G3370 for 5 DNA samples from family 2) according to the manufacturerâs protocol (SureSelect Human All Exon Illumina Paired-End protocol version 1.0.1). The capture library, containing regions totaling approximately 38 Mb (G3362) or 50 Mb (G3370), is designed to target all human exons in the NCBI consensus coding sequence (CCDS) database. Captured DNAs were sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with 76 bp (family 1) or 100 bp (family 2) paired-end reads. At least 2 lanes of sequencing data were collected for each sample to generate sufficient coverage. Image analyses and base calling were performed by using the Illumina Genome Analyzer Pipeline software (GAPipeline version 1.5 or higher) with default parameters. Reads were aligned to a human reference sequence (UCSC assembly hg19, NCBI build 37) and genotypes were called at all positions at which there were high-quality sequence bases (Phred-like score Q25 or greater) at minimum coverage of 8, using CLC Genomics Workbench v4.5.1 (CLC Bio, Cambridge, MA). For each sample, more than 50% of at least 100 million reads were uniquely mapped to the targeted human exon regions to give mean depth of coverage of 123. Under such coverage, approximately 94% of targeted regions were covered by 5 reads or more, and more than 85% were covered by more than 20 reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). To identify the pathogenic mutations, we performed a series of filtering steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We first discarded the variants that did not change the amino acid sequence. We then generated a list of variants that are present in affected individuals but absent in nonaffected individuals. Variants previously reported in dbSNP132 were excluded, as the causative variants were uncommon and unlikely to be registered in the SNP database. The variants were further filtered by using the in-house database (a collection of variants from whole-exome sequencing of more than 625 individuals) by a similar methodology. Finally Sanger sequencing was performed on DNAs of 3 additional members (both affected and nonaffected) from each family to exclude the nonpathogenic mutations. Presence of mutations was confirmed in all candidate disease-causing variants by Sanger sequencing.</p>

Domain architecture of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 shows the RNA-recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2), the C-terminal glycine-rich domain, and an M9 nuclear localization signal. The PrLDs are centered in the C-terminal glycine-rich domain. Highly similar predictions were made for the minor isoforms of hnRNPA2B1 (hnRNPB1) and hnRNPA1 (hnRNPA1 isoform b).</p>
