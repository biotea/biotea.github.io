        <p id="P1">Orai1 and STIM1 are critical components of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channels that mediate store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) in immune cells. While Orai1 and STIM1 co-cluster and physically interact to mediate SOCE, the cytoplasmic machinery modulating these functions remains poorly understood. We sought to find modulators of Orai1 and STIM1 using affinity protein purification and identified a novel EF-hand protein, CRACR2A (CRAC regulator 2A, EFCAB4B, FLJ33805). We show that CRACR2A directly interacts with Orai1 and STIM1, forming a ternary complex that dissociates at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Studies using siRNA-mediated knockdown and mutagenesis show that CRACR2A is important for clustering of Orai1 and STIM1 upon store depletion. Expression of an EF-hand mutant of CRACR2A enhanced STIM1 clustering, elevated cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and induced cell death, suggesting its active interaction with CRAC channels. These observations implicate CRACR2A, a novel Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, highly expressed in T cells and conserved in vertebrates, as a key regulator of CRAC channel-mediated SOCE.</p>

STIM1 is a single transmembrane (TM) segment-containing protein that detects ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> via its N terminus and has a long C-terminal cytoplasmic region.

Subsequent studies have identified Orai1 as a pore subunit of the CRAC channels<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Upon store depletion, Orai1 also clusters on the PM in the proximity of STIM1 clusters<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Amplified CRAC currents have been observed upon co-expression of Orai1 and STIM1, suggesting that these are the limiting and essential components of CRAC channels<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.

However, the cellular machinery modulating Orai1-STIM1 interactions remains unexplored.</p>
    <p id="P3">Recent studies showed that Orai1 exists in a macromolecular complex with 11â14 nm protrusion into the cytoplasm using chemically inducible bridge formation with linkers of variable lengths between the PM and ER membranes<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. These results indicate the presence of additional components within the Orai1-STIM1 complex<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Using immunoaffinity purification of Orai1 after store depletion, we identified a macromolecular complex containing Orai1, STIM1 and putative interactors. An EF-hand containing protein, CRACR2A was validated as an important regulator of Orai1-STIM1 interaction. Our results show that CRACR2A directly interacts with the cytoplasmic regions of Orai1 and STIM1, forming a ternary complex. Interestingly, CRACR2A dissociates from Orai1 and STIM1 at higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]). An EF-hand mutant of CRACR2A enhanced STIM1 clustering and elevated cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] thereby causing cell death in T cells. These observations suggest a role of CRACR2A as a cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that modulates multiple steps of CRAC channel activation including translocation and clustering of Orai1 and STIM1 by direct protein interaction.</p>

        <title>Orai1 and STIM1 exist in a macromolecular protein complex</title>
        <p id="P4">To identify novel regulators of the CRAC channel using Orai1 for affinity purification, we generated HeLa cells stably expressing Orai1 and STIM1 (HeLa O+S cells). Presence of an active CRAC channel complex was verified by detection of amplified CRAC currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1a</xref>)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. To capture Orai1 in its native complex, cells were treated with different concentrations of a membrane-permeable cross-linker, dithiobis succinimidyl propionate (DSP) and immunoblotted for Orai1. Upon treatment with 0.5 mM DSP, Orai1 and STIM1 were detected in high molecular weight complexes in non-reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1b</xref>). These complexes were applied onto a 20â50% glycerol gradient to determine their size. The size of the Orai1 protein complex was estimated to be ~700 kDa under resting conditions and ~670 kDa after store depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Under resting conditions, STIM1 was primarily detected in a ~200 kDa protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, right), possibly as a dimer, whereas it co-migrated with Orai1 upon store depletion. These results are consistent with the observation that STIM1 self-associates at rest and forms a high molecular weight (MW) protein complex upon stimulation<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>.</p>

        <title>Identification of CRACR2A as a binding partner of Orai1 and STIM1</title>
        <p id="P5">To identify the binding partners of Orai1, fractions containing Orai1 were pooled, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody coated resin and eluted with the FLAG peptide. Samples from HeLa cells showed very few non-specific bands, while those from HeLa O+S cells exhibited a number of specific bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Enrichment of different size bands in resting or store-depleted conditions suggest presence of discrete binding partners of Orai1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, denoted by *). Specific bands after store depletion were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Detection of STIM1 peptides served as a positive control (&gt;17 peptides). In addition to STIM1, p45 renamed as CRACR2A (CRAC regulator 2A, EFCAB4B, FLJ33805, FLJ33046; amino acid sequence of the transcript NM_032680) was identified as a binding partner of Orai1. The N terminus of CRACR2A contains two predicted EF-hands while its C terminus has a predicted coiled-coil domain as well as a leucine-rich motif that is highly conserved among vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2</xref>). Fluorescence protease protection assays<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> showed a predominantly cytoplasmic localization of CRACR2A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P6">To examine whether CRACR2A binds Orai1, we carried out immunoprecipitation and pulldown analysis. For immunoprecipitation experiments, HeLa cells stably expressing either STIM1 alone or STIM1 and Orai1 proteins were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding CRACR2A. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, both STIM1 and CRACR2A co-immunoprecipitated with Orai1 and showed enhanced binding upon store depletion. These results were further validated by reverse immunoprecipitation using FLAG-tagged CRACR2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, right). To test for a direct interaction between CRACR2A and Orai1, recombinant proteins purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S4</xref>) were used for <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays. GST pulldown analysis showed a strong interaction between CRACR2A and Orai1 in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> while the binding was minimal in the presence of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, first panel). To confirm an inhibitory role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we used an EF-hand mutant of CRACR2A that abolishes Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (CRACR2A<sup>EF2MUT</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and see below). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> had no effect on Orai1-CRACR2A<sup>EF2MUT</sup> interaction, supporting its inhibitory role.</p>
        <p id="P7">For domain interaction studies, we purified GST-fused fragments of the N, C termini and the intracellular loop of Orai1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, right and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S4d</xref>). The N terminal fragment of Orai1 consisted of the amino acids 64â93, since truncation of first 63 residues did not alter CRACR2A binding (data not shown). These interaction studies showed that CRACR2A binds to the N terminus of Orai1 in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive manner, with elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> favoring its dissociation from Orai1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, right panel). Since amino acids 64â93 of Orai1 are highly conserved among Orai family, we examined interaction of CRACR2A with Orai2 and Orai3. CRACR2A co-immunoprecipitated with Orai2 and Orai3 suggesting a conserved binding mechanism with all the Orai proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Since CRACR2A co-immunoprecipitated with Orai1 and STIM1, we hypothesized that Orai1, STIM1 and CRACR2A may form a ternary complex though direct interaction. To examine a direct interaction of STIM1 with CRACR2A, three different GST fusion proteins of the cytoplasmic domain of STIM1, corresponding to coiled-coil domain (CC), serine/threonine (S/T) rich sequence, and proline/lysine rich sequence (PEST) were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Full-length CRACR2A bound to the CC and PEST domains of STIM1 and the interaction was reduced in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. On the other hand, the S/T rich sequence, which did not bind to CRACR2A, was identified as a STIM1 multimerization and Orai1 interaction domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This sequence partially overlaps with the recently identified CAD/SOAR domains (amino acids 342â448) of STIM1, which directly interact with Orai1<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Together these data suggest that CRACR2A binds to both Orai1 and STIM1 in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive manner.</p>

        <p id="P8">BLAST and Homologene analysis revealed a homologue of CRACR2A, renamed as CRACR2B (EFCAB4A, FLJ46033). NCBI depicts one transcript encoded by the human <italic>CRACR2B</italic> gene (NM_173584) while Ensembl shows four transcripts (ENST00000321883, 327417, 450448, 450828) with different intron-exon architecture. To characterize the mRNA sequence of human CRACR2B, we cloned its full-length cDNA from Jurkat T cells (registered as GenBank accession number, GU952799). Our sequencing analysis revealed similar intron-exon architecture between human and mouse CRACR2B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S5</xref>). Sequence alignment of human CRACR2A and CRACR2B proteins showed an overall identity of 36% (pair-wise BLAST analysis) with a conserved primary structure of predicted EF-hand motifs and a coiled-coil domain.</p>

        <title>CRACR2 proteins play an important role in SOCE</title>
        <p id="P9">To examine the physiological role of CRACR2 proteins, we measured SOCE in Jurkat T cells upon siRNA-mediated depletion of CRACR2A or CRACR2B. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, depletion of CRACR2A decreased SOCE by 50% while that of CRACR2B had a mild effect. Consistent with a decrease in SOCE, depletion of CRACR2A resulted in a stronger impairment in IL-2 production by Jurkat T cells than CRACR2B knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Surprisingly, in HEK293 cells, depletion of CRACR2B had a stronger effect on SOCE than that of CRACR2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, bottom). Specificity and efficiency of CRACR2 knockdown was examined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S6aâd</xref>). To determine the reason for the differences between Jurkat and HEK293 cells, we measured the expression levels of CRACR2 transcripts in various human tissues and cell lines. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed abundant expression of CRACR2A transcripts in spleen and thymus distinct from CRACR2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Among cell lines, CRACR2A transcripts were higher in Jurkat T cells when compared with HEK293 or HeLa cells, while those of CRACR2B were higher in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Since CRACR2A transcripts were abundant in Jurkat T cells, we examined their expression in primary T cells. Murine thymocytes, naÃ¯ve and effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells showed high expression of CRACR2A transcripts when compared with murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), while CRACR2B transcripts were very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). These data suggest that the relative contribution of CRACR2A and CRACR2B in SOCE in T cells versus HEK293 cells is partially due to differences in their expression levels.</p>
        <p id="P10">To check for a possible functional redundancy between CRACR2 proteins, we used HEK293 cells stably depleted of CRACR2B by shRNA and ectopically expressed CRACR2A or CRACR2B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S6e</xref>). Expression of CRACR2B completely restored SOCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, cyan trace) validating the specificity of knockdown. Under these conditions, expression of CRACR2A significantly restored SOCE, indicating a functional redundancy between CRACR2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, blue trace). To examine whether both CRACR2 proteins can modulate Orai1 activity, we expressed CRACR2A or CRACR2B in Orai1-null MEFs in the absence or presence of Orai1. Orai1-null MEFs show very low residual SOCE, which is restored to wild-type levels by exogenous expression of Orai1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, black and red traces)<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Expression of CRACR2A or CRACR2B alone did not restore SOCE in Orai1-null MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S6f</xref>). However, co-expression of CRACR2A with Orai1 increased the peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by more than twofold compared with expression of Orai1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, bar graph). In contrast, co-expression of CRACR2B with Orai1 had a very mild effect on SOCE. These data suggest a specific role of CRACR2A in enhancement of Orai1-mediated SOCE that is distinct from CRACR2B.</p>

        <title>CRACR2A mediates clustering of Orai1 and STIM1 at PM-ER junctions</title>
        <p id="P11">STIM1 is involved in clustering and gating of Orai1 and evokes large CRAC currents when co-expressed with Orai1<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. In contrast, CRACR2A did not induce large CRAC currents when co-expressed with Orai1 (data not shown), indicating that CRACR2A cannot substitute for STIM1. We hypothesized that binding of CRACR2A to Orai1 and STIM1 may stabilize their interaction in PM-proximal area, and consequently its depletion may impair clustering of Orai1 and STIM1. To examine the role of CRACR2A in STIM1 clustering, we transfected control or CRACR2A-depleted Jurkat T cells with STIM1-YFP and measured its accumulation into PM-proximal regions using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Upon stimulation, STIM1-YFP clustered within ten minutes in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, top), but in CRACR2A-depleted cells clustering was severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, bottom). To investigate the effects of CRACR2A on clustering of Orai1, we transfected control and CRACR2A-depleted Jurkat T cells with plasmids encoding Orai1-GFP and STIM1-mCherry in an equimolar ratio. Orai1 formed clusters upon thapsigargin treatment in control cells while CRACR2A depletion impaired this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).

        <p id="P12">To identify the residues in Orai1 N terminus necessary for CRACR2A binding, we generated mutants of amino-acids conserved in Orai family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S7a</xref>). Particularly, we focused on positively charged residues since CRACR2A contains many negatively charged residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2</xref>). GST pulldown assays revealed an important role of positively charged residues in binding to CRACR2A while mutations of conserved serine residues in Orai1 did not alter binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S7b</xref>). The substitutions of lysines at positions 85 and 87 to alanine (K85A and K87A) significantly decreased interaction with CRACR2A. Pulldown and immunoprecipitation with a K85A/K87A double mutant of Orai1 showed very low residual binding to CRACR2A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S7b, c</xref>). To examine whether Orai1<sup>K85A/K87A</sup> showed impairment in clustering, we expressed Orai1<sup>K85A/87A</sup>-GFP with STIM1 in Jurkat T cells. While WT Orai1 readily clustered upon store depletion, Orai1<sup>K85A/K87A</sup> showed impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). To assess the functional consequence of impaired clustering, we measured SOCE in Orai1-null T cells expressing Orai1<sup>K85A/K87A</sup>. Orai1<sup>K85A/K87A</sup> could not restore SOCE in Orai1-null CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Moreover, it had a dominant negative effect over the residual SOCE, suggesting that the residual SOCE may be contributed by other members of the Orai family and hetero-multimerization with Orai1<sup>K85A/K87A</sup> may influence their function. Membrane insertion and expression levels of the Orai1<sup>K85A/K87A</sup> mutant were similar to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S7c and S8</xref>). To examine whether CRACR2A co-expression can overcome the inability of Orai1<sup>K85A/K87A</sup> to rescue SOCE, we generated Orai1-null MEFs stably co-expressing Orai1<sup>K85A/K87A</sup> with either CRACR2A or CRACR2B. Indeed, co-expression of CRACR2A with Orai1<sup>K85A/K87A</sup> showed significant recovery of SOCE, while that of CRACR2B had a marginal effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). These experiments suggest that CRACR2A physically interacts with the positively charged residues in the N terminus of Orai1 and this interaction is important for clustering and activity of Orai1.</p>

Cells expressing STIM1-YFP showed minimal clustering under resting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, top, arrow). However, in cells co-expressing CRACR2A<sup>EF2MUT</sup>-mCherry, STIM1 was clustered to varying degrees even without store depletion (see two separate examples in the top and middle panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Upon store depletion, clusters of STIM1 expanded to become larger aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b and c</xref>).

Visual examination of cells expressing STIM1 and CRACR2A<sup>EF2MUT</sup> revealed more than 80% cells with STIM1 in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). These results were confirmed independently by using live cell confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S9</xref>). In addition, biochemical analysis also showed STIM1 oligomerization mediated by CRACR2A overexpression. Upon co-expression of CRACR2A, both STIM1 and CRACR2A could readily be detected in high MW complexes without store depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S10a, b</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P18">We have identified CRACR2A as an important component of the Orai1-STIM1 complex. CRACR2A directly interacts with the N terminus of Orai1; however, its co-expression with Orai1 is not sufficient to amplify CRAC currents (data not shown). Instead, CRACR2A seems to act as a stabilizer for the interaction between Orai1 and STIM1. Several experimental data support this hypothesis. First, the biochemical analyses showed that CRACR2A directly interacts with both Orai1 and STIM1 and their interaction increases upon store depletion. Second, depletion of CRACR2A decreases CRAC channel-mediated SOCE due to reduced clustering of Orai1 and STIM1. Third, CRACR2A facilitates clustering of STIM1 and Orai1 at PM-ER junctions and potentiates SOCE. Based on these observations, we propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Under resting conditions, Orai1 and STIM1 are dispersed in the PM and ER membranes respectively, while CRACR2A is localized in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>, state 1). Upon store depletion, STIM1 and Orai1 translocate and cluster at PM-ER junctions. Whether CRACR2A plays an active role in translocation of Orai1 and/or STIM1 (State 2, <italic>i-iii</italic>) or is recruited into junctions after clustering (<italic>iv</italic>) awaits further studies. Since Orai1 translocation is dependent on STIM1, CRACR2A is likely to be involved in translocation of STIM1 or both of Orai1 and STIM1 (<italic>ii</italic> and <italic>iii</italic>) rather than Orai1 alone (<italic>i</italic>). In all the scenarios, our results suggest the presence of a ternary complex of Orai1, STIM1, and CRACR2A (State 3) that dissociates upon elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (State 4). CRACR2A may play an important role in a physiological context where the amount of Orai1 and STIM1 is limiting, unlike transient overexpression of Orai1 and STIM1. Recently, CaM binding to the N terminus of Orai1 has been shown to evoke inactivation of CRAC channels<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. CaM binding sites on Orai1 and STIM1 partially overlap with those of CRACR2A<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. In addition, CRACR2A and CaM have comparable affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Interestingly, CaM co-immunoprecipitates with Orai1 only in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, contrary to CRACR2A, which dissociates from Orai1 and STIM1 at elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. These results suggest a scenario where CRACR2A binding favors an active CRAC channel complex upon store depletion (at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) while CaM facilitates inactivation of CRAC channels at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Whether CRACR2A plays any role in modulating electrophysiological properties of CRAC channels awaits future investigations. In summary, we have identified a novel family of SOC channel regulators that modulate protein interactions in a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-dependent manner.</p>

Arrowheads in the top panel show clustering of STIM1-YFP in cells co-expressing CRACR2A<sup>EF2MUT</sup>. An arrow in the same panel depicts minimal clustering in a cell expressing only STIM1-YFP. Arrowheads in the bottom TIRF panels show co-accumulation of CRACR2A<sup>EF2MUT</sup>-mCherry with STIM1-YFP at sites of newly formed clusters after store depletion (+TG). Bar, 10 Âµm. (<bold>c</bold>) TIRF microscopy analysis of HEK293 cells expressing STIM1-YFP in the absence (top) or presence (bottom) of CRACR2A<sup>EF2MUT</sup>. Cells co-expressing mCherry (top) or CRACR2A<sup>EF2MUT</sup>-mCherry (bottom) were selected. CRACR2A<sup>EF2MUT</sup> induced clustering of STIM1-YFP without ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion (compare images at T = 0 s in the top and bottom panels). Thapsigargin was added at T = 0 s and images of STIM1 clustering are shown at 200 and 500 s. Arrowheads represent preformed clusters of STIM1 that expand upon store depletion. Bar graph depicts averaged number of HEK293 cells (Â± s.d.) showing STIM1 clustering in the presence (n = 112 cells) or absence (n = 106) of CRACR2A<sup>EF2MUT</sup>. Cells moderately expressing STIM1-YFP were examined. Bar, 10 Âµm.</p>

(<bold>d</bold>) A proposed model showing possible role(s) of CRACR2A in CRAC channel function. Under resting conditions, Orai1 and STIM1 are distributed at the PM and ER membranes, respectively (1. Resting state) while CRACR2A (green) localizes in the cytoplasm. Upon store depletion, Orai1 and STIM1 translocate to form clusters at the junctional regions between PM and ER (State 2). CRACR2A may either be actively involved in translocation of Orai1 (<italic>i</italic>), STIM1 (<italic>ii</italic>) or both (<italic>iii</italic>). It is also possible that CRACR2A passively interacts with Orai1 and STIM1 at sites of clustering (<italic>iv</italic>). Based on our data, we propose that CRACR2A is important for stabilization of Orai1- STIM1 complex via direct protein interaction under physiological conditions where amounts of Orai1 and STIM1 proteins are limiting (State 3). Upon increase of cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] via opening of CRAC channels, the EF hands of CRACR2A bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, resulting in its dissociation from Orai1 and STIM1 (State 4), thereby destabilizing the Orai1-STIM1 complex. The EF-hands of STIM1 and CRACR2A are indicated and their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound status is colored in red. The schematic does not represent molecular stoichiometry of Orai1, STIM, and CRACR2A proteins.</p>
