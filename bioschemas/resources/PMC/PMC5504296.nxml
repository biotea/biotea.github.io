      <abstract>
        <p>Multinucleate cellular syncytial formation is a hallmark of skeletal muscle differentiation. Myomaker, encoded by <italic>Mymk (Tmem8c)</italic>, is a well-conserved plasma membrane protein required for myoblast fusion to form multinucleated myotubes in mouse, chick, and zebrafish. Here, we report that autosomal recessive mutations in <italic>MYMK</italic> (OMIM 615345) cause Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome in humans (CFZS; OMIM 254940) by reducing but not eliminating MYMK function. We characterize <italic>MYMK</italic>-CFZS as a congenital myopathy with marked facial weakness and additional clinical and pathologic features that distinguish it from other congenital neuromuscular syndromes. We show that a heterologous cell fusion assay <italic>in vitro</italic> and allelic complementation experiments in <italic>mymk</italic> knockdown and <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> zebrafish <italic>in vivo</italic> can differentiate between <italic>MYMK</italic> wild type, hypomorphic and null alleles. Collectively, these data establish that MYMK activity is necessary for normal muscle development and maintenance in humans, and expand the spectrum of congenital myopathies to include cell-cell fusion deficits.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Carey-Fineman-Ziter (CFZS; OMIM 254940) is an eponymous syndrome described in two siblings who had marked bilateral facial weakness, Robin sequence (mandibular hypoplasia, hypoglossia, cleft palate), inability to fully abduct both eyes, characteristic facial dysmorphisms, generalized muscle hypoplasia with hypotonia and relatively mild proximal weakness, failure to thrive, delayed motor milestones, scoliosis, and normal intelligence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Reports of children subsequently diagnosed with CFZS have differed from the original siblings by also having intellectual disabilities, seizures, and/or brain malformations or calcifications, raising concerns that they may not represent the same disease entity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Many of these subsequent cases had facial weakness and complete absence of ocular abduction, thus meeting diagnostic criteria for Moebius syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In an effort to identify the genetic etiology of CFZS, we enrolled the original CFZS pedigree and additional sibling pairs and simplex cases with similar phenotypes together with their family members into ongoing genetic studies at six medical institutions. By exome and Sanger sequencing, we now identify compound heterozygous or homozygous <italic>MYMK (TMEM8C)</italic> missense mutations in affected members of four CFZS sibling pairs and one simplex case.</p>
    <p>During embryogenesis, myoblast precursors migrate from pre-somitic mesoderm to the site of muscle formation, where they then fuse to form multinucleate myotubes and ultimately myofibers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Multinucleated myofibers then confer distinct biomechanical advantages to mature muscles by transducing force between remote skeletal attachments. Myomaker, encoded by <italic>Mymk</italic>, mediates the fusion of mononuclear myoblasts to form multinucleate myocyte syncytia during muscle development in mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, chick<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and zebrafish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. <italic>Mymk</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice have a paucity of skeletal muscle and die perinatally, while heterozygotes (<italic>Mymk</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic>â</sup>) are indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) littermates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Moreover, <italic>Mymk</italic><sup>â<italic>/LoxP</italic></sup> conditional knockout mice under the control of a muscle satellite cell specific promoter have defective muscle regeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p>
    <p>Phenotypic evaluation of the affected participants in this study defines <italic>MYMK</italic>-CFZS as a congenital myopathy with marked facial weakness and additional clinical and pathologic features that distinguish it from other congenital neuromuscular syndromes and from Moebius syndrome. Heterologous cell fusion assays and zebrafish modelling demonstrate that <italic>MYMK</italic> mutations cause CFZS by reducing but not eliminating MYMK function. Collectively, these data establish that MYMK activity is necessary for normal muscle development and maintenance in humans, and expand the spectrum of congenital myopathies to include cellâcell fusion deficits.</p>

        <title>Mutations in <italic>MYMK</italic> cause CFZS</title>
        <p>To identify the genetic etiology of CFZS, three laboratories each independently generated and analysed exome sequence data from one of three unrelated non-consanguineous families, each with two affected siblings with similar phenotypes (Families 1â3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Exome analysis was performed to identify recessive variants with minor allele frequencies (MAF) of &lt;0.01. Among the genes harbouring recessive variants identified in each family, only <italic>MYMK</italic> was common to all three (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1aâc</xref>). The affected siblings in USA Family 1 (individuals 1 and 2), the original CFZS pedigree<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, inherited <italic>MYMK</italic> c.271C&gt;A (p.Pro91Thr, rs776566597, M1) and c.553T&gt;C (p.Cys185Arg, M2) from their father and mother, respectively. The affected siblings in New Zealand Family 2 (individuals 3 and 4) and the affected siblings in USA Family 3 (individuals 5 and 6) each inherited M1 and c.298G&gt;A (p.Gly100Ser, M3) from their father and mother, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Variants and their co-segregation were validated by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
        <p>To define the phenotypic heterogeneity among individuals harbouring <italic>MYMK</italic> variants, <italic>MYMK</italic> exons and flanking intron-exon boundaries were sequenced in &gt;300 additional probands with congenital facial weakness who were referred with the following diagnoses: CFZS (1 proband); congenital myopathy with predominant facial weakness with micro/retrognathia (â¼10 probands); isolated or syndromic congenital facial weakness and normal eye movements (â¼50 probands); and Moebius syndrome (â¼250 probands). Among these, <italic>MYMK</italic> variants were identified in two individuals: an affected child from the USA who had been misdiagnosed with Moebius syndrome inherited M1 from her father and c.2T&gt;A (p.0?, M4) from her mother (Family 4, individual 7); and an affected child from a consanguineous Brazilian pedigree diagnosed with CFZS was homozygous for a c.461T&gt;C (p.Ile154Thr, M5) variant (Family 5, individual 8; the affected sibling was not enrolled in the study; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Sequencing also revealed nine known polymorphisms, none of which were found in combination with other compound heterozygous changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1d</xref>).</p>
        <p>Among the 5 <italic>MYMK</italic> missense variants, only M1 is present in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>; it has a cumulative MAF of 0.0013 (0.002 for Europeans) and is reported in the homozygous state in one individual with no declared phenotype who is not recontactable. We constructed and compared familiesâ haplotypes surrounding the <italic>MYMK</italic> locus. The four families segregating M1 are haploidentical within a 41âkb region, suggesting a common origin for this allele. By contrast, the two pedigrees segregating M3 share maximum haploidentity of 1.4âkb, suggesting that this variant, present in a CpG dinucleotide and therefore prone to mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, arose independently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). MYMK is predicted to have seven transmembrane (TM) domains with amino- and carboxyl-termini located extracellularly and intracellularly, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The five corresponding amino acid substitutions alter phylogenetically highly conserved residues and are predicted to be deleterious by SIFT and Polyphen2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1e</xref>).</p>

        <title>The CFZS phenotype differs from other congenital syndromes</title>
        <p>To define the <italic>MYMK</italic> human phenotype, we examined affected individuals and determined the penetrance of their clinical features and laboratory test results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). All eight affected individuals had congenital bilateral facial weakness, upturned/broad nasal tip, micro/retrognathia, generalized muscle hypoplasia with mild axial and appendicular weakness, delayed motor milestones, and normal cognition. None had abducens nerve palsy, although mild to minimal eye movement limitations were noted in extreme positions of gaze. Both males also had cryptorchidism, while the penetrance of eleven additional clinical features was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2aâe</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Notably, all eight individuals achieved independent mobility in childhood, and none reported significant progression of appendicular muscle weakness, required assistance with ambulation, or have shown susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. Individuals 1 and 2, the eldest participants and siblings, both had nocturnal hypoventilation and developed restrictive pulmonary disease and pulmonary hypertension after age 35 years, from which individual 1 died at the age of 37 years. They also had a family history of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, and individual 2 has had very slowly progressive axial weakness. Therefore, it remains to be determined if pulmonary hypertension and/or adult-onset progressive weakness are features of <italic>MYMK</italic> CFZS. When obtained, brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) were normal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). Affected individuals had no fasciculations or other clinical signs of peripheral nerve involvement, electromyogram/nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCS) revealed myopathic (and not neurogenic) changes, and <italic>Mymk</italic> expression was not detected in adult mouse sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 2g,h and 3u</xref>), supporting the absence of a neurogenic component to CFZS. Muscle MRI revealed fatty infiltration predominantly affecting the adductor magnus and sartorius muscles, and to a lesser degree the paraspinal and glutei maximi muscles. More pronounced changes were observed in the oldest living participant (Individual 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2h</xref>). Scoring the presence or absence of a maximum of 19 clinical and 4 laboratory features revealed variability over the cohort with scores ranging between 68 and 96% for a given affected individual (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Individual 2 underwent biopsy of the right vastus lateralis muscle at 15 years of age. Histologic analysis revealed a disproportionately high number (60%) of variably sized type I (slow) fibers, many of which were atrophic/hypotrophic, polygonal, and often present in small groups. In contrast, type II (fast) fibers were consistently hypertrophic with cross-sectional areas measuring 330% of control type II fibers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2dâi</xref>). This type I fiber type predominance and hypotrophy with type II fiber hypertrophy meets the diagnostic criteria for congenital fiber type disproportion myopathy (CFTD). Additional staining and analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3aât</xref>) showed no rods, cores, reciprocal type II fiber grouping, or increased central or number of nuclei. The biopsy also lacked features of dystrophies, myositis, storage diseases, or mitochondrial myopathies. Notably, Individual 2 had a prior quadriceps biopsy as a toddler that was reported to show a slight reduction in fiber size and a moderate increase in perimysial connective tissue. Thus, while a few regenerating fibers with myogenin-positive nuclei were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3j,o</xref>), the appearance of the more distinctive muscle biopsy features shown here that developed later in childhood, and the greater degree of fatty infiltration of affected muscles in the older compared to the younger participants support reduced regenerative capacity.</p>

        <title>CFZS results from <italic>MYMK</italic> null or hypomorphic alleles</title>
        <p>Unlike <italic>Mymk</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, CFZS patients survive and thus may retain residual <italic>MYMK</italic> function. Therefore, based on the combinations of genotypes harboured by the affected individuals, we hypothesized that M1 and M5 were hypomorphic and M2, M3, and M4 were null alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). To evaluate this hypothesis, we first tested the effect of the variants on protein stability by overexpressing FLAG-tagged WT and mutant <italic>MYMK</italic> alleles in HeLa cells. By western blot, WT but no mutant protein of the expected band size was visible in the soluble fraction after 24âh, despite comparable transfection levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>), suggesting that the mutant alleles are unstable and degrade and/or aggregate, similar to other mutant membrane proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. We found, however, that immunostaining with a FLAG antibody revealed a low percentage of M1 and M5 transfected protein at the membrane compared to WT. Notably, there was no M2, M3 or M4 protein at the membrane, and transfected M2, M3, M4, and M5 proteins formed cytoplasmic aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c,d</xref>).</p>
        <p>Based on these data, we next asked whether M1 and M5 fusogenic activity remained intact by exploiting the observation that ectopic overexpression of WT mouse or human <italic>Mymk/MYMK</italic> in fibroblasts leads to fibroblast fusion with C2C12 myoblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Indeed, fibroblast overexpression of FLAG-tagged human <italic>MYMK</italic> M1 or M5 constructs induced fusion with C2C12 cells, supporting the hypothesis that, despite lower expression level, they retain residual function. Moreover the M1 allele that is reported as homozygous in one individual in the ExAC database had similar fusion as WT, while M5 had reduced fusion. By contrast, overexpression of M2, M3 or M4 constructs resulted in no fusogenic activity, supporting these as null alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3aâc</xref>).</p>
        <p>Primary myoblasts were available from individual 2, who is heterozygous for the M1 and M2 alleles. We observed no difference in the capability of his CFZS mutant cells to differentiate compared to control myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Following differentiation, however, there was a significant difference in the fusion index, with a higher percentage of singly-nucleated relative to multinucleated cells in CFZS compared to control myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The differentiated CFZS-derived myoblasts also appeared hypotrophic, with reduced cell diameter and elongated cytoplasm compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>). While normal variability exists among human-derived myoblasts from even a single affected individual, the reduced fusion and hypotrophy of CFZS-mutant myoblasts, while not as severe, parallels the findings in murine <italic>Mymk</italic><sup>â<italic>/</italic>â</sup> myoblasts where no fusion occurs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>

</sup> zebrafish lack fast-twitch myoblast fusion</title>
        <p>To confirm pathogenicity and determine if the consequences of null and hypomorphic <italic>MYMK</italic> alleles could be distinguished <italic>in vivo</italic>, we modelled CFZS variants in zebrafish. Unlike human and mouse, in which both type I slow-twitch and type II fast-twitch progenitors fuse to form multinucleated syncytia, zebrafish slow-twitch muscle progenitors do not fuse. Moreover, the relative proportions and organization of zebrafish slow- and fast-twitch fibers change over development and are spatially separated, aiding in their analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Consistent with its role in muscle fusion, zebrafish <italic>mymk</italic> is exclusively expressed in multinucleated fast-twitch fibers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, whose differentiation and fusion begins after adaxial cell migration and is completed around 24âh post fertilization (hpf)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Knockdown of <italic>mymk</italic> in zebrafish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and chick<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> myoblasts were reported to produce a fusion defect similar to that in <italic>Mymk</italic><sup>â<italic>/</italic>â</sup> mice. We recapitulated a similar muscle fusion phenotype by the injection into zebrafish of a splice-blocking and three translation-blocking morpholinos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). The muscle fusion defects following morpholino knockdown were incomplete and variable, however, and thus we employed CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate a germline loss-of-function <italic>mymk</italic> fish line.</p>
        <p>We generated a mutant <italic>mymk</italic> zebrafish line harbouring a single thymidine insertion in exon 3 (c.434insT; p.Val106CytfsTer33; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). F2 <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> embryos lacked fast-twitch myoblast fusion at 24 h.p.f. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). By 48 h.p.f., the nuclei of the unfused myofibers aligned fully at the center of each myotome, in contrast to the random-appearing distribution of WT myonuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video</xref>). This is the same phenotype reported recently in two other truncating loss-of-function <italic>mymk</italic> zebrafish alleles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, and is a similar but far more striking and penetrant phenotype than that observed in morpholino-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). As predicted, loss of mymk function did not alter the organization of slow-twitch myofibers, as they do not fuse in WT teleosts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>).</p>
        <p>In contrast to <italic>Mymk</italic><sup>â<italic>/</italic>â</sup> mice that do not survive, and consistent with the two previously reported truncating alleles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> zebrafish were viable, likely because of the residual function of the slow-twitch mononucleated myofibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>). Larval and early juvenile <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> fish were macroscopically indistinguishable from their heterozygous and WT siblings. By contrast, adult fish were small and had developed craniofacial deformities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4câe</xref>). Microscopic examination of their fast-twitch musculature revealed variably-sized hypotrophic fibers with variable degrees of fatty infiltration compared to their WT siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Heterozygous <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/wt</italic></sup> embryos and adults appeared normal.

        <p>We used the <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> loss-of-function zebrafish line to confirm the pathogenicity of the CFZS alleles <italic>in vivo</italic> and their function as null or hypomorphic alleles. We injected WT or mutant human <italic>MYMK</italic> mRNA and membrane bound mCherry fluorescent protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> into <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> embryos, and visualized myonuclear alignment at 48 hpf to evaluate the ability of the injected mRNA to rescue the myoblast fusion defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). By blinded qualitative analysis, injection of WT <italic>MYMK</italic> mRNA resulted in myonuclei distributed in a random- or near-random-appearing pattern in 80% of embryos, thus rescuing the <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> phenotype. By contrast, injection of M2 or M3 <italic>MYMK</italic> mRNA resulted in no rescue of the <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> phenotype, and was indistinguishable from injection of mCherry alone, while injection of M1 or M5 <italic>MYMK</italic> mRNA resulted in an intermediate level of rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5aâc</xref>). We obtained similar but less penetrant results when we co-injected WT or mutant mRNA together with a transcription-blocking morpholino into WT embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6d,f,g</xref>).</p>
        <p>To quantify the rescue phenotypes, we measured the distances between myonuclei in <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>wt/wt</italic></sup> embryos, <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> embryos, and <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> embryos injected with WT-, M1-, M2-, M3-, or M5- <italic>MYMK</italic> human mRNA. For each injected allele, we then calculated for each nucleus the frequency distribution of all nuclei within a 5âÎ¼m to 80âÎ¼m distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>wt/wt</italic></sup> embryos, and <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> embryos injected with WT mRNA, had a random distribution of myonuclei, while <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). The distribution of nuclei in <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> embryos injected with M2- or M3- mutant mRNA were not significantly different than <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> alone, confirming these as null alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5dâh</xref>). By contrast, <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> embryos injected with M1 or M5 resulted in distributions intermediate between <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>wt/wt</italic></sup> and <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup>, consistent with hypomorphic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g,h</xref>).

These data support the pathogenicity of the <italic>MYMK</italic> alleles and their null or hypomorphic status.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We demonstrate that recessive mutations in <italic>MYMK</italic> cause CFZS through a combination of one hypomorphic and one null allele, or two hypomorphic alleles, which reduce MYMK function and myoblast fusion below a threshold but not to zero (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Despite the presence of the hypomorphic M1 allele at a very low frequency in the ExAC database in the heterozygous state and in one individual of unknown clinical status in the homozygous state, both our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data support its pathogenicity. It does, however, have the highest level of residual MYMK activity among the mutant alleles. Thus, it will be of interest to identify and phenotype individuals who are homozygous for the M1 or compound heterozygous for the M1 and M5 alleles to define the threshold of MYMK activity below which one manifests the CFZS phenotype. We also anticipate that, similar to <italic>Mymk</italic><sup>â<italic>/</italic>â</sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, two null alleles will result in absence of muscle and be incompatible with human life (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>The combined clinical, imaging, and muscle biopsy findings in CFZS define a distinct disorder. Significant facial weakness and Robin sequence, minimal limitation of horizontal end-gaze, only mild axial and appendicular weakness, and CFTD on muscle biopsy distinguishes CFZS from most other congenital myopathies. CFZS may have greatest clinical overlap with Native American myopathy resulting from <italic>STAC3</italic> mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, although the absence of malignant hyperthermia in CFZS and possibly different muscle pathologies distinguish them. The characteristic distribution of fatty infiltration/atrophy on muscle imaging in CFZS is similar to that reported in <italic>SEPN1</italic> CFTD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, in which respiratory muscle weakness, scoliosis, and impaired muscle regeneration are present, but facial weakness is not prominent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. CFZS pathophysiology may most closely resemble EMARDD (early onset myopathy, areflexia, respiratory distress, and dysphagia), which results from <italic>MEGF10</italic> mutations that appear to reduce myocyte proliferation, differentiation, and fusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. By contrast, the ability to almost fully abduct the eyes in CFZS permits its distinction from Moebius syndrome, in which abduction limitation is complete or nearly complete<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Finally, as anticipated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, normal cognition, absence of seizures and abducens nerve palsy, and normal brain and brainstem imaging shared by the MYMK-CFZS individuals in this report suggest that many cases previously reported to be CFZS likely represent different disease entities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
      <p>While the current CFZ muscle pathology fits best within the category of CFTD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, the type II hypertrophy is greater than typically reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Our data also support the appearance of more distinctive muscle pathology and an increase in fatty infiltration of specific muscle groups over time, potentially correlating with slow progression of weakness and adult-onset restrictive pulmonary disease. Thus, additional longitudinal clinical data coupled with analyses of serial biopsies that target more significantly and specifically affected muscle groups may lead to the recategorization of this disorder.</p>
      <p>The congenital facial weakness and Robin sequence of CFZS highlight the selective vulnerability of specific muscle groups to reduced levels of <italic>MYMK</italic>, and the interplay between muscle and bone development. Compared to other skeletal muscles, craniofacial muscles use unique developmental pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and have distinct molecular compositions and combinations of fiber types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> that may, in part, account for their vulnerability. Muscle is known to influence bone development and, like CFZS, other congenital myopathies with significant facial weakness are often accompanied by secondary retrognathia, palatal defects, and facial dysmorphisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Similarly, <italic>Myf5</italic><sup><italic>â/â</italic></sup><italic>:MyoD</italic><sup><italic>â/â</italic></sup> mice are born without muscles, including jaw and tongue muscles, and have secondary retrognathia and cleft palate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p>
      <p>While complete loss of <italic>Mymk</italic> in mice is perinatal lethal, zebrafish live and phenotypes only become evident at a late juvenile age. Notably, the relative number and distribution of fast- and slow-twitch muscle fibers in zebrafish change during maturation, and these fiber type changes are believed to be necessary for optimization of swimming ability and feeding behaviours as the fish grow and mature from larvae into adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Specifically in cranial musculature, including in the adductor mandibulae muscle, there is a gradual increase in the proportion of fast-twitch fibers during larval and juvenile stages, followed by the preferential growth and expansion of fast-twitch muscle beds during the juvenile to adult transition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Fast-twitch but not slow-twitch myoblasts fuse in zebrafish, and <italic>mymk</italic> is expressed only in fast-twitch myoblasts. Thus, failure of fusion of the fast-twitch fibers during this normal fiber type adaptation, coupled with reduced regenerative capacity suggested by progressive fatty infiltration of muscle, may explain the onset of the <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> phenotype in the late juvenile stage, and the appearance of micrognathia in adult zebrafish.</p>
      <p>While both type I and type II human striated muscle fibers fuse during muscle development, it remains to be determined if different muscles and/or different fiber types require different levels of fusion and/or express different levels of <italic>MYMK,</italic> resulting in selective vulnerability to a reduction in functional MYMK protein. Future studies should both clarify this selective vulnerability and more clearly define the CFZS clinical course. Finally, the ability to genetically rescue the mutant phenotype in zebrafish lends hope for future therapies that restore <italic>MYMK</italic> function in muscle and lessen any potentially progressive features of this disorder.</p>

        <title>Muscle biopsies</title>
        <p>Frozen muscle tissue from a right quadriceps (vastus lateralis) muscle biopsy from individual 2 (15 years old at the time of biopsy; obtained for clinical indications) was sent to the Engle Laboratory at Boston Childrenâs Hospital and re-evaluated with new sections and stains. For comparison, a total of 184 de-identified muscle biopsy cases at Boston Childrenâs Hospital were reviewed for diagnoses of minimal abnormalities, and similar age and sex to individual 2. From these, nine cases were cut, stained, imaged and compared. Section thickness in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> is 10âÎ¼m (all H&amp;E and control MHC) and 12âÎ¼m (Ind. 2 MHC). Quantification was performed on a representative case that appeared to most closely match published findings for the vastus lateralis muscle at this age (âcontrolâ quadriceps biopsy from an active 14.5-year-old male, diagnosed as âskeletal muscle with rare atrophic fibers,â without other diagnostic abnormalities). For nuclei counts, a second quadriceps biopsy from a 13-year-old male diagnosed as âskeletal muscle with mild variation in fiber sizeâ was quantified as âControl 2â). To compare CFZS findings with a broader cross-section of individuals, we evaluated published data of vastus lateralis measurements (relative fiber type composition, fiber type cross-sectional area, and percentage fiber type areas) from four cohorts of young men (age 16â28, <italic>n</italic>=383 individuals) from the literature: cohort-1 (<italic>n</italic>=95, 21.1Â±2.4 years)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, cohort-2 (<italic>n</italic>=215, 24Â±4 years)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, cohort-3 (<italic>n</italic>=55, 16Â±0 years)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> , and cohort-4 (<italic>n</italic>=18, 17Â±1 years)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p>
        <p>The myofiber (fiber) cross-sectional area was calculated from the entire biopsy from each individual, including 3569 fibers from individual 2, and 609 fibers from the control individual. No blinding was possible due to the characteristic phenotype of the patient muscle biopsy. Fiber number and nuclei number were measured from three distinct regions from each biopsy, normalized to number per mm<sup>â2</sup>, based on the areas measured, and the means and standard deviations were calculated in Microsoft Excel. Relative fiber type composition (type I fiber number/total fiber number) and percentage fiber type area (type I relative fiber type composition Ã mean type I area/(type I relative fiber type composition Ã mean type I area+type II relative fiber type composition Ã mean type II area)) were calculated for each area of the biopsy. Image alignments were performed in Adobe Photoshop. Fiber cross-sectional area and minimum Feret diameter were measured using Image J (1 pixel in raw images=0.3467âÎ¼m). Fibers were binned in 500âÎ¼m<sup>2</sup> increments for histogram generation. For comparative cohort 4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), approximate fiber area was calculated as the square of the reported diameters (which were the mean of the maximum and minimum Feret diameters). Type II A and type II B fiber sizes were combined into a single average Type II fiber size for each cohort.

Two exon 3 (sgRNA1 and sgRNA2) targets and one exon 5 (sgRNA3) target were selected. sgRNAs were generated by annealing long oligos to a Sp6 promoter sequence, followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. To generate loss-of-function lines, 250âpg of sgRNA and 500âpg of recombinant Cas9 protein (PNA Bio Inc.) were incubated on ice for 10âmin and injected into the cytoplasm of one-cell stage AB embryos as described for morpholino injections. Efficiency of the guide was evaluated by sequencing 10 of the approximately 100 injected embryos per clutch for each guide. Successful editing was indicted by multiple nucleotide peaks 4â5 bases 5â² to the PAM sequence. Chimeric sequences were identified for 60% of sgRNA1, 10% of sgRNA2 and 100% for sgRNA3 injected embryos. The low efficiency of editing for sgRNA2 may be explained by the presence of a SNP in our AB line located 5â² of the guide binding region. SgRNA1 guide was selected to establish the F0 population because sgRNA3 generated 100% edited embryos in the homozygous state, and the muscle hypoplasia of the resulting fish would place them at risk for decreased fertility secondary to impaired swimming and spawning.</p>
        <p>F0 embryos generated with the sgRNA1 guide were outcrossed with WT AB and their offspring (F1) screened for germline transmission of the editing. We identified three different changes at the level of the cutting site, of which the most common was an insertion of a T at position c.434, predicted to cause a frame-shift resulting in 33 ectopic amino acids before a stop codon. Three founders were used to generate the F2 population, called <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT</italic></sup>, used in this study.

An optimal final volume of 3ânl was injected into the embryo yolk at the one or two nuclei stage for each morpholino. Morpholino against p53 at a ratio of 3:2 was coinjected with each morpholino to reduce non-specific effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. A control morpholino targeting the human beta-globin gene was used to test injection conditions. A minimum of 100 embryos were injected during each session; only a small increase (less than 10%) of embryo deaths was observed in morpholino injected versus uninjected embryos after 24âh. For rescue experiments, an optimal dose of 100âpg of mRNA generated from WT and mutant constructs (described above) were each independently co-injected with MO4 in or proximal to the nuclei of at least 100 embryos at the 1 cell stage. No evident toxicity was associated with mRNA injection.</p>

        <p>For rescue of <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> zebrafish, 200âng of WT or mutant mRNA was injected into the yolk of one-cell stage embryos obtained from F2 <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/WT</italic></sup> crosses. To visualize the plasma membrane, 40âng of membrane-bound mCherry was injected in the yolk of 8- to 16-cell stage of the same embryos to chimerically staining cell membranes. At least 100 embryos were injected with each allele for 3 or more replicate experiments, each on a separate day. We observed an average survival of 60% of the embryos after injection independent of the injected mRNA. Embryos were collectively fixed in PFA 4% in PBS and stained with DAPI. Each embryo was individually separated, the head was dissected for DNA extraction (using 50âmM NaOH stabilized with 10âmM Tris HCl pH 8) and genotyping, and the tail distal to the yolk sac was isolated in a single well of 96 well plate. After genotyping, tails of <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> embryos were mounted laterally in 80% glycerol and images acquired using a confocal microscope LS710 with ZEN software (Carl Zeiss AG). Analysis was blinded to the injected mRNA and scored according to the nuclear organization.

        <title>Internuclear distance analysis</title>
        <p>To quantify the distance between nuclei, randomly selected images of 6 fish per allele (2 embryos from 3 different injections each on a different day) were opened in ImageJ and the <italic>xy</italic> position of each nucleus was annotated. The quantitative analysis of internuclear distances was performed using a custom written program on MATLAB. The program takes the coordinates of myonuclei as input, and gives the frequency distributions of the nucleus-nucleus distance <italic>d</italic>, for each phenotype. It then compares these distributions with each other and with the distribution produced by a random generated data set of <italic>xy</italic> positions. The 2D random distribution was obtained starting from 6 computer generated images, each with a number of objects equal to the average number and size of nuclei found in the zebrafish images (mean 110 nuclei, St.Dev. 20). To not overlap, any object with a distance &lt;5âÎ¼m from any other was excluded, as zebrafish myonuclei are â¼5âÎ¼m. The histograms were normalized to 80âÎ¼m, as this is the peak, after which there is a decay due, in part, to the finite boundaries of the 200âÎ¼m image. Histograms of the same genotype were then averaged together and presented with SE bands. Deviations from the 2D random model were measured at distance <italic>a</italic> (5â10âÎ¼m from the nucleus center that describes the nearest neighbor organization) and distance <italic>b</italic> (18â28âÎ¼m from the nucleus center that describes the row organization), and statistical significance was tested between all distributions (6 distributions per genotype) using Two-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in MATLAB (kstest2). The code used for the analysis is available on request. Data were obtained from a minimum of two mutant embryos per clutch and three clutches from separate injections on different days.</p>

The red-filled residues denote the predicted locations of the CFZS amino acid substitutions. M4 is predicted to preclude initiation of wildtype translation; if translation were initiated instead by the next methionine codon (Met32), the first TM would be excluded from the protein. M2 and M3 alter residues buried deeply in TM7 and TM4, respectively. M3 alters Gly100, which is highly conserved in MYMK, TMEM8A and TMEM8B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. M2 alters a less conserved Cys185, but introduces a charged arginine into a hydrophobic domain. This model locates M1 and M5 at the beginning of TM4 and five residues inside TM5, respectively, and both substitute a hydrophobic amino acid with threonine. The red âVâ in residue 106 in TM4 corresponds to the amino acid disrupted by the one-base-pair frameshift-causing insertion generated in the zebrafish model (<italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT</italic></sup>).

Fibroblasts were co-infected with GFP plasmid and FLAG-tagged WT or CFZS-mutant <italic>MYMK</italic> construct, co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts for 4 DIV, and immunostained with myosin antibody, a myocyte marker. If fibroblast-myoblast fusion occurs, chimeric myotubes appear yellow/orange from colocalization of GFP (green, fibroblast origin) and myosin (red, myoblast origin). (<bold>b</bold>) Fibroblasts co-infected with mouse or human WT <italic>MYMK-FLAG</italic> constructs and GFP fuse with C2C12 cells. Hypomorphic CFZ mutations M1 (p. P91T) and M5 (p.

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) 24 h.p.f. embryos stained with 488-conjugated phalloidin (white) and DAPI (red) to label the forming myofibers and nuclei, respectively. WT <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>wt/wt</italic></sup> embryo myofibers are multinucleated, while <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> embryo myofibers elongate and differentiate, but fail to fuse.

Compared to the random appearance of WT myonuclei, the single nuclei in unfused <italic>mymk</italic><sup><italic>insT/insT</italic></sup> myofibers pathologically align at the center, equidistant between two myosepta. Lower panel: Merged images showing phalloidin (red), DAPI (white) and F59 (green, anti-myosin heavy chain) confirm that affected myofibers are fast-twitch fibers because they do not express F59, a slow-twitch cellular marker in zebrafish.

Zebrafish <italic>mymk-</italic>expressing fast-twitch myofibers are located centrally, while <italic>mymk-</italic>negative slow-twitch myofibers are located near the body wall and stain slightly darker with H&amp;E. The mutant fish have reduced body width (compare the red line extending from the dorsal artery to the body wall in WT versus mutant fish in left photos), and fat infiltration (thick black arrows, middle photo) that is absent in the WT fish.
