        <p>Although several ADAMs (A disintegrin-like and metalloproteases) have been shown to contribute to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, the full spectrum of metalloproteases involved in this metabolism remains to be established. Transcriptomic analyses centred on metalloprotease genes unraveled a 50% decrease in <italic>ADAM30</italic> expression that inversely correlates with amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease brains. Accordingly, in vitro down- or up-regulation of <italic>ADAM30</italic> expression triggered an increase/decrease in AÎ² peptides levels whereas expression of a biologically inactive ADAM30 (ADAM30<sup>mut</sup>) did not affect AÎ² secretion. Proteomics/cell-based experiments showed that ADAM30-dependent regulation of APP metabolism required both cathepsin D (CTSD) activation and APP sorting to lysosomes. Accordingly, in Alzheimer-like transgenic mice, neuronal ADAM30 over-expression lowered AÎ²42 secretion in neuron primary cultures, soluble AÎ²42 and amyloid plaque load levels in the brain and concomitantly enhanced CTSD activity and finally rescued long term potentiation alterations. Our data thus indicate that lowering ADAM30 expression may favor AÎ² production, thereby contributing to Alzheimer's disease development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Alzheimer's disease is a complex, multifactorial, neurodegenerative disease. It is the leading cause of dementia in elderly people. The main pathologic features of Alzheimer's disease are neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaque formation in the brain. The latter is caused by the progressive deposition of mainly 39- to 43-amino acid amyloid Î² (AÎ²) peptides generated by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The systematic observation of changes in APP metabolism in monogenic forms of Alzheimer's disease suggested that the AÎ²/APP pathway is at the heart of the disease (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Hardy and Selkoe, 2002</xref>). Even though the key role of APP processing in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease has been challenged in recent years, recent genetic and GWAS studies of sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease seem to support the importance of dysfunctional APP metabolism and AÎ² peptide production/degradation in the physiopathology of Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Lambert and Amouyel, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Jonsson et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p>The two major AÎ² peptide species (AÎ²x-40 and AÎ²x-42) are produced by the sequential endoproteolysis of APP by Î²-secretase and Î³-secretase complexes. APP can also undergo non-amyloidogenic cleavage by Î±-secretase within the AÎ² sequence, which thereby precludes AÎ² generation. The various enzymes and protein complexes involved in these secretase activities are increasingly well characterized: Î²-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) accounts for almost all the Î²-secretase activity, whereas a complex that includes presenilin 1 or 2 is responsible for the Î³-secretase activity (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">De Strooper, 2003</xref>). More recently, an additional matrixine (MMP-MT5) has been shown to contribute to APP processing by acting upstream of the Î²-site (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Willem et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Baranger et al., 2016</xref>). Finally other <italic>N</italic>-terminal truncated AÎ² peptide species can be generated by other proteases besides BACE1 (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">SchÃ¶nherr et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p>In contrast, Î±-secretase activity is less well characterized even if several research groups have suggested that ADAM10 and ADAM17 are the major enzymes responsible for constitutive and regulated Î±-secretases-mediated pathways in the brain (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Lammich et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to these direct cleavages taking place on APP, several additional proteins are likely to modulate APP levels by interfering with secretase activity, APP trafficking and/or APP degradation (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Vincent and Checler, 2012</xref>). This complex network of protein-protein interactions is however poorly characterized and the identification of its components should improve our understanding of APP biology and fate, and might enable the delineation of therapeutic approaches.</p>
      <p>Given this context, we decided to focus on ADAMs and related proteins. Our study was inspired by several observations besides our knowledge of the involvement of ADAMs as Î±-secretases (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg, 2009</xref>): (i) ADAMs and APP are involved in many different biological processes including brain development, plasticity and repair (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2006</xref>), and (ii) several matrix metalloproteases (MMP-2, -3 and -9) can degrade AÎ² peptides (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Reitz et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Carson and Turner, 2002</xref>). We therefore performed a multi-angle screen for new components of APP metabolism, with a focus on MMPs, ADAMs and related proteins. We postulated that differentially expressed MMPs, ADAMs and related proteins (when comparing expression in Alzheimer's disease brains and control brains) might be clues for their involvement in APP physiology.</p>

        <title>Study Design</title>
        <p>We postulated that uncharacterized MMPS, ADAMs or related proteins may be involved in the APP metabolism. The purpose of this study was thus to explore this possibility. Potential candidates were selected from transcriptomic analyses targeting MMPs/ADAMs expression using total RNAs extracted from the brain of AD cases and controls. The strongest variations in expression were validated in an independent sample of brains using a different technology. Potential correlation between amyloid deposition in the brain of AD cases and expression of our genes of interest were examined. This work allowed us to select ADAM30 for further exploration.</p>
        <p>We developed ADAM30 over- or under-expression experiments in different cellular models to assess ADAM30 impact on the APP metabolism. Potential Î±-, Î²- or Î³-secretase activities of ADAM30 were examined. A without a priori research for ADAM30 substrates was performed using COFRADIC experiments. Impact of ADAM30 on APP metabolism through CTSD activation was tested using pharmacological or siRNA tools. All the experiments have been made at least in triplicates and by two independent manipulators for most of them. This work allowed us to demonstrate that ADAM30 modulates the APP metabolism through CTSD activity.</p>
        <p>The in vitro observations were finally extended to an âAlzheimer-likeâ transgenic mouse model specifically over-expressing ADAM30 in neurons. Primary cultures of adult neurons were used to validate the results obtained from cell lines. Measurement of soluble AÎ²42 and amyloid deposition were performed to corroborate the in vitro results in the mouse brains. Electrophysiological analyses were finally performed to extend the results to neuronal activity. All the analyses were performed in a blinded fashion. Our data demonstrated that ADAM30 over-expression led to a decrease in AÎ²42 secretion in primary cultures, in soluble AÎ²42 and amyloid deposition in the cerebral tissue and to a rescue of LTP in the Alzheimer-like mouse brain.</p>

        <title>Microarray Analyses</title>
        <p>The preparation of human brain samples is described in the Supplementary experimental procedures. Total RNA was extracted with a phenol/chloroform protocol (TRIzolÂ® reagent, InvitrogenÂ®, USA) from frozen frontal cortex brain tissue from one hundred fourteen Alzheimer's disease samples and one hundred sixty seven control samples. The quality of the total RNA extract was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and the ribosomal 28S/18S RNA ratio was estimated with the system's onboard biosizing software. Twelve Alzheimer's disease cases and twelve controls were selected among the initial samples by applying the following two criteria: (i) a ribosomal 28S/18S RNA ratio of 1.0 or more; (ii) a Braak stage below 2 (for control samples) (Table S1) (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bensemain et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>Specific oligonucleotides for one hundred thirty two open reading frames (corresponding to MMPs, ADAMs, ADAMTSs and related proteins) were designed using OLIGOMER software (Mediagen) (Supplementary experimental procedures and <xref rid="ec0010" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>; <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bensemain et al., 2009</xref>). After synthesis, the oligonucleotides were purified to obtain a population that was homogeneous in terms of length (Sigma-AldrichÂ®, Germany). All oligonucleotides were 5â²-functionalized with a C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> arm.</p>
        <p>In order to decrease the potential influence of inter-individual variability in the control population, we compared the genetic expression of each Alzheimer's disease case with the pool of control samples (see the Supplementary experimental procedures). Complementary RNA corresponding to 10Â Î¼g of the initial mRNA extract was produced by amplification and labeled with a Cy5 or Cy3 fluorophore using a Fluorescent Linear Amplification KitÂ® (Agilent), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After hybridization, microarrays were analyzed as described previously (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bensemain et al., 2009</xref>, see the Supplementary experimental procedures). It is important to note that the analyses of the one hundred thirty two ADAMs, MMPs and related proteins were performed with a one thousand seven hundred seventy one gene microarray used in a previous project in our laboratory (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bensemain et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Chapuis et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, the threshold for statistical significance was set to pÂ &lt;Â 10<sup>âÂ 5</sup> (after Bonferroni correction), in order to select genes differentially expressed in the Alzheimer's disease brain.</p>

        <title>Quantification of ADAM17, ADAM30, ADAM33 and ADAMTS16 mRNAs</title>
        <p>Total RNA samples (from forty two controls and fifty one Alzheimer's disease cases) were randomly selected (see Supplementary material section) from among the samples not used in the transcriptomic experiments. Levels of ADAM17, ADAM30, ADAM33 and ADAMTS16 mRNAs were quantified as described by the supplier (QuantigeneÂ®, Panomics) (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Canales et al., 2006</xref>), normalized against two different housekeeping genes (Î²-actin and Î²-glucuronidase: see the Supplementary material procedures) and were expressed in arbitrary units (AU). Comparisons were performed with a Mann-Whitney non-parametric test.</p>

        <title>Immunohistochemistry Experiments</title>
        <p>The brains used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments were obtained at autopsy (at Lille University Medical Center) from Caucasian patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and from Caucasian controls in whom the absence of Alzheimer's disease had been confirmed neuropathologically. These samples were not used in the transcriptomic experiments. In all patient samples, the neuropathologic features of Alzheimer's disease were confirmed by IHC and Western blot analysis of Tau, AÎ² and Î±-synuclein (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Delacourte et al., 2002</xref>). Brain samples were fixed in formalin for brightfield microscopy. Paraffin sections from the anterior frontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) were processed in an automatic Benchmark-XT system (Ventana, USA). Polyclonal antibodies against a sixteen-amino acid polypeptide within the human ADAM30 protein (Table S3) were raised according to a standard protocol (with three months of immunization, InterchimÂ®, France). <italic>Anti</italic>-ADAM30 antibody and pre-immune rabbit serum (both diluted at 1:500) were applied after sample heating and were revealed using a standard immunoperoxidase technique.</p>

        <title>Analyses of APP Metabolism as a Function of ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> or ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> Expression</title>
        <p>Plasmid constructions are fully described in the Supplementary experimental procedures.</p>
        <p>SKNSH-SY5Y-APP<sup>695WT</sup> and HEK293/HEK293-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cell lines were respectively cultured in DMEM and DEM/F12 supplemented with 10% serum FCS, 2Â mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 50Â U/ml penicillin, 50Â Î¼g/ml streptomycin and (for SKNSH-SY5Y-APP<sup>695WT</sup> only) 1% MEM NEAA (InvitrogenÂ®, USA) at 37Â Â°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        <p>For the analysis of APP metabolism, SKNSH-SY5Y-APP<sup>695WT</sup> and HEK-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cell lines (300,000 cells per well at seeding) were transfected with pcDNA-Mock, pcDNA-ADAM30<sup>WT</sup>, pcDNA-ADAM30<sup>mut</sup>, shRNA pU6/ADAM30 vectors (500Â Î¼g) or siADAM30 (ON-TARGETplus ADAM30 siRNA, GE Dharmacon). Transient transfection was performed using an Exgen500 protocol (FermentasÂ®, France) in SKNSH-SY5Y-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cells and a Fugene-HD protocol (Roche DiagnosticsÂ®, Switzerland) in HEK/HEK-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cells, according to the respective manufacturers' instructions. SiADAM30 were specifically transfected using Lipofectamine RNAi Max. Of note, because of the low endogenous level of ADAM30 expression, shRNA and siRNA targeting ADAM30 were first validated in SKNSH-SY5Y stably over-expressing ADAM30 (Fig. S12).</p>
        <p>Forty-eight hours after transfection, supernatants were collected for the quantification of APP by-products and cells were lysed to assay for expression of ADAM30<sup>WT/mut</sup> or endogenous ADAM30 by Western blotting. AÎ²1â40, AÎ²1â42, sAPPÎ± and sAPPÎ² were measured in sandwich ELISAs (INNOTESTÂ® Î²-amyloid (1â42) and Î²-amyloid (1â40), Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium), and the sAPPÎ± and sAPPÎ² Assay kits (IBL-InternationalÂ®, Germany), according to the respective manufacturers' recommendations. Three independent, duplicate experiments were carried out for each mutant and measurements were performed twice for each sample.</p>
        <p>For the BACE1 fluorometric assay, HEK293 cells were transfected with ADAM30<sup>WT/mut</sup> cDNAs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were pipette-lysed with 50Â Î¼l of Tris-HCl (10Â mM, pHÂ 7.5) and monitored for BACE1 activity, as described previously (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Andrau et al., 2003</xref>).

        <title>Identification of ADAM30 Substrates</title>
        <p>Two HEK293-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cell lines stably overexpressing ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> or ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> (HEK293-ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> and HEK293-ADAM30<sup>mut</sup>) were generated (as mentioned above, one advantage of the HEK293 cell line is the absence of endogenous ADAM30 expression; see the Supplementary experimental procedures). These HEK293 cell lines were used to perform a targeted COFRADIC analysis of N-terminal peptides in a highly complex mixture, whereas all internal peptides were disregarded. The combination of COFRADIC, SILAC and N-terminal tagging chemistries generates quantitative data on the modification status of the N termini of the proteins present in the mixture. This approach provides an overall profile of enzyme activities and substrates (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Staes et al., 2011</xref>; see the Supplementary experimental procedures).</p>
        <p>For the CTSD assay, recombinant ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> and ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> were generated by Genscript (Piscataway, USA) (see the Supplementary experimental procedures). The activity of recombinant human CTSD (R&amp;D Systems, Lille, France) was measured via cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide substrate (Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH<sub>2</sub> from R&amp;D Systems). CTSD (16Â Î¼g/ml) was pre-incubated at 37Â Â°C for 30Â min before being diluted eight-fold into 50Â mM Tris-HCl, pHÂ 7.5 buffer with 300Â mM NaCl. Twenty-five microliter aliquots of enzyme sample were transferred into the wells of black 96-well microplates (Corning, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and incubated with substrate at 37Â Â°C for 40Â min. The final volume of the incubation solution was 100Â Î¼l and the final reagent concentrations were 0.5Â Î¼g/ml of CTSD and 10Â Î¼M of substrate in assay buffer (0.1Â M sodium acetate and 0.2Â M NaCl, pHÂ 3.5). Fluorescence was measured using a Victor3 V1420 plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France) fitted with a 340Â nm excitation filter and a 410Â nm emission filter. The fluorescence of substrate blanks was subtracted. To evaluate the effect of ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> or ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> on CTSD activity, CTSD was pre-incubated with 84Â Î¼g/ml of each protein prior to dilution and substrate addition. The observed CTSD activities were compared with that measured when CTSD was pre-incubated with 84Â Î¼g/ml of bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Lyon, France).</p>
        <p>For measuring intracellular CTSD activity, the SKNSH-SY5Y-APP<sup>695WT</sup> and HEK-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cell lines (300,000 cells per well at seeding) were transfected with pcDNA-Mock, pcDNA-ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> or pcDNA-ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> vectors. After 48Â h, cells were lysed and the time course of CTSD activity (0, 5, 10 and 15Â min) was monitored using a fluorometric SensoLyteÂ® Cathepsin D assay (AnaSpecÂ®, USA).</p>
        <p>For the cathepsin inhibition experiments, HEK-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cell lines were transfected for 24Â h with pcDNA-Mock, pcDNA-ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> or pcDNA-ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> vectors and then exposed for 24Â h to pepstatin A (10Â Î¼M; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), leupeptin (10Â Î¼M; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) or E64-D (1Â Î¼M; Sigma-Aldrich).</p>
        <p>Transient Co-transfection of CTSD siRNA (37.5Â pmol ~Â 0.75Â Î¼g, ON-TARGETplus CTSD siRNA, GE Dharmacon) and pCDNA3.1-ADAM30 vector (1.25Â Î¼g of DNA per well) was performed using LipofectamineÂ® 2000 Transfection Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 36Â h of transfection and 24Â h of secretion (wash after 12Â h of transfection), cells were finally lysed and supernatants were recovered. Cell extracts were analyzed by western blot to validate both ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> over-expression and CSTD under-expression.</p>
        <p>By-products of APP metabolism were then quantified as previously described. Three independent duplicate/triplicate experiments were carried out and measurements were performed twice for each sample.</p>

Brain tissue was automatically segmented on block-face photography volumes and masked to remove background. As block-face images were taken prior to sectioning at the same position section after section, reconstructed photographic volumes necessarily reflected the original shape of the frozen brains and were used as a 3D reference. Affine registrations between two-dimensional histological images and corresponding block-face photographs were estimated and used to (i) correct for deformations due to histological procedures and (ii) provide coherent histological volumes (xyz resolution: 5Â ÃÂ 5Â ÃÂ 90Â Î¼m<sup>3</sup> for histological volumes stained with the 6E10 monoclonal antibody).

Acute slices (400Â Î¼m thick) were prepared with a vibratome (VT 1000S; Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) in ice-cold gassed aCSF enriched with sucrose.

        <title>Transcriptomic Analyses Show That ADAM30 is Under-expressed in AD Brains</title>
        <p>Using total RNA from the frontal cortex of twelve Alzheimer's disease cases and twelve healthy controls, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of one hundred thirty two genes coding for MMPs, ADAMs and related proteins (the complete results are provided in <xref rid="ec0010" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Four ADAMs were found to be differentially expressed in the brain of Alzheimer's disease cases compared with controls (ADAM17, ADAM33, ADAMTS16 over-expressed and ADAM30 underexpressed; pÂ &lt;Â 1Â ÃÂ 10<sup>âÂ 5</sup> for all comparisons after Bonferroni correction; see the <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> section and in <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bensemain et al. (2009)</xref>). Of note, since the analyses of the 132 ADAMs, MMPs and related proteins were performed using a 2741-gene homemade microarray (see again the <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> section and in <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bensemain et al. (2009)</xref>, this design allowed us to determine whether the decrease in ADAM30 expression may be imputed to neuronal death. In order to evaluate this potential bias, we compared the expression of a subset of genes reported as only expressed in neuron (nÂ =Â 113) to genes not exclusively (or not) expressed in neurons (nÂ =Â 1789). Importantly, we did not observe any significant differences in terms of fold-change (Fig. S1). To bypass inherent risks of false positives in such systematic transcriptomic approaches despite of multiple testing corrections, the expression level of these four ADAMs was then analyzed in an independent, larger sample of AD cases (fifty one) and healthy controls (forty two). ADAM30 underexpression (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a) and ADAM33 overexpression were confirmed whereas changes in the expression of ADAM17 and ADAMTS16 genes could not be validated in this larger sample (Fig. S2).</p>
        <p>We finally assessed whether the levels of ADAM30/ADAM33 expression may be correlated with AD hallmarks in the brain. The decrease in ADAM30 expression was significantly correlated with higher AÎ²42 loads but not with Tau loads in Alzheimer's disease brain samples (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b and Fig. S3) while ADAM33 expression did not correlate with these Alzheimer's disease markers (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry experiments in human brain tissue revealed a neuronal expression of ADAM30 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c and Fig. S4) as observed in a laser dissection transcriptomic analysis (GSE15222 dataset described in <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al. (2008)</xref>). We thus hypothesized that ADAM30 under-expression might be harmful by modulating AÎ² peptide production and thus, we assessed the putative involvement of ADAM30 in APP processing.</p>

        <title>ADAM30 Under-expression is Associated With Increased APP Catabolites In Vitro</title>
        <p>We first investigated whether modulation of ADAM30 expression could be associated with an alteration of the APP metabolism in the SKNSH-SY5Y cell line stably expressing the wild-type (WT) APP<sup>695</sup> isoform (SKNSH-SY5Y-APP<sup>695WT</sup>). This model allows measuring the production/secretion of all APP byproducts and quantifying separately AÎ²<sub>1â40</sub> and AÎ²<sub>1â42</sub> peptides. ADAM30 under-expression (transient transfection of SKNSH-SY5Y-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cells with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting ADAM30; <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d)) increased the levels of all APP products yielded by Î±-, Î²- and Î³-secretases-mediated proteolysis and particularly AÎ²<sub>1â40</sub> and AÎ²<sub>1â42</sub> (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>e). Both endogenous sAPPÎ± and sAPPÎ² secretion were also increased in the SKNSH-SY5Y cells after transient transfection of ADAM30-shRNA (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>f) or of an ADAM30-siRNAs (data not shown).</p>

        <title>ADAM30 Catalytic Activity is Required for the Modulation of APP Metabolism</title>
        <p>ADAM30 holds a unique zinc-binding motif HEXXHXXGXXHD, which is normally required for enzymatic activity (all metalloproteases harbour a HEXXH motif and half of the ADAM proteins present such a functional catalytic motif). We thus aimed at determining whether the catalytic function of ADAM30 accounts for the observed modulation of APP catabolites. To assess this possibility we generated mammalian expression vectors expressing either a wild-type ADAM30 (ADAM30<sup>WT</sup>) or an ADAM30 with a mutated catalytic site (ADAM30<sup>mut</sup>, see Supplementary information). These constructs were transfected either in the SKNSH-SY5Y-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cell line or a HEK293 cell line also stably expressing the wild-type APP<sup>695</sup> isoform (HEK293-APP<sup>695WT</sup>).</p>
        <p>Over-expression of ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> in both cell lines triggers the exact opposite effects observed when down-regulated ADAM30, i.e. decreased levels of all amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic APP catabolites (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A and <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). This effect was not observed after overexpression of catalytically silent ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a and b).</p>
        <p>We next started evaluating pathways that could link ADAM30 and APP catabolites. Strikingly, the fact that all APP catabolites were decreased by ADAM30 could have indicated that ADAM30 acted upstream of secretases cleavages. One possibility could be that ADAM30 directly modulates APP levels but we showed that APP mRNA levels were not affected by ADAM30 modulation (Fig. S5). An alternative explanation would be that ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> (but not ADAM30<sup>mut</sup>) modifies Î±-, Î²- and Î³-secretase activities. Since several ADAMs has been proposed as genuine Î±-secretases, we first examined this possibility. However, ADAM30 did not exhibit Î±-secretase-like activity (Fig. S6a). Of note, ADAM30 is not present at the membrane (Fig. S6b, c). We also ruled out ADAM30 as a modulator of Î²- and Î³-secretases, since overexpression of WT or mutated ADAM30 did not modify these activities (Fig. S7).</p>

        <title>Identification of ADAM30 Substrates and Subsequent Targets</title>
        <p>The above data suggest that ADAM30 might modulate an intracellular pathway or an intermediate effector contributing to APP physiology. Thus, we systematically searched for direct ADAM30 substrates or further downstream targets by applying <italic>N</italic>-terminal combined fractional diagonal chromatography (COFRADIC) (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Staes et al., 2011</xref>) and comparing the âstable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell cultureâ (SILAC)-labeled <italic>N</italic>-terminones of HEK293 cells stably over-expressing either WT or catalytically inactive ADAM30 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). We identified two thousand two hundred thirty eight proteins, eighteen of which (characterized by twenty five distinct peptide sequences) had neo-<italic>N</italic>-terminal peptides with higher intensities in cells over-expressing ADAM30<sup>WT</sup>, suggesting a putative susceptibility to ADAM30-mediated proteolysis (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d). Most of these eighteen proteins were involved in transcription and translation (e.g. histones and ribosomal proteins). Even though the latter might well be substrates for ADAM30, we suspected that this observation might reflect potential differential extraction of proteins, e.g. potential differences in cell growth between HEK293-ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> and HEK293-ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> cell lines. After discarding all proteins linked to transcription and translation, only three peptides (and thus proteins) showed different ratios: insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4), cathepsin D (CTSD) and G kinase-anchoring protein 1 (GKAP1). We decided to focus on CTSD (see representative mass spectrum of the neo <italic>N</italic>-terminal peptide of CTSD, <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>e). Indeed, the potential ADAM30 cleavage site identified in the COFRADIC experiment matched the CTSD endoproteolysis domain (residues 161â169) leading to a mature, active, lysosomal protease (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A) (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Benes et al., 2008</xref>). This latter observation suggests that ADAM30 acts as a CTSD maturation enzyme leading to enhanced cellular activity.</p>

        <title>CTSD Co-localizes With, and is Activated by ADAM30</title>
        <p>To further investigate the hypothesis whereby ADAM30 targets CTSD, we set up a fluorescence-based assay of CTSD activity. A human, recombinant pro-CTSD was incubated with its substrate in the presence or absence of human recombinant ADAM30<sup>WT</sup>, ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> or bovine serum albumin (BSA). Incubation with ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> increased CTSD activity, whereas this effect was not detected after incubation with either ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> or BSA (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). In native SKNSH-SY5Y and transiently transfected HEK293-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cells, proximity ligand assay (PLA) revealed that respectively endogenous and overexpressed ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> co-localized with endogenous CTSD (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c). Overexpression of ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> (but not ADAM30<sup>mut</sup>) was consistently associated with elevated CTSD activity in transiently transfected HEK293-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cells (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>d) or SKNSH-SY5Y-APP<sup>695WT</sup> cells (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>e). Inversely, transfection of ADAM30-siRNA led to a decrease in CTSD activity in native SKNSH-SY5Y cells (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>f). Of note, mutagenesis of ADAM30<sup>mut</sup> did not appear to alter the protein compartmentalization when compared with the main localization of ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> in late-endosome (Fig. S8).</p>

        <title>CTSD Activity is Required for the Modulation of APP Metabolism by ADAM30</title>
        <p>Both ADAM30's cellular localization and its ability to increase CTSD activity led us to postulate that ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> could contribute to the lysosomal CTSD maturation/activation and thereby, could favor APP degradation. This hypothesis may explain our observation of a general decrease in amyloidogenic and non amyloidogenic APP catabolites and agrees with our empirical observation that exposure to generic lysosome inhibitors (e.g. bafilomycin A1 and chloroquinone) abolished ADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-mediated impact on cellular APP metabolism (Fig. S9).</p>
        <p>We further investigated this hypothesis by testing the impact of different pharmacological inhibitors: pepstatin (an aspartyl protease inhibitor with activity mainly directed towards CTSD), leupeptin (a serine and cysteine proteinase inhibitor with selective activity against cathepsin B) and E64D (a cysteine proteinase inhibitor that targets CTSB, cathepsin L and calpain). In the presence of pepstatin, the effect of ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> expression in HEK293 cells was no longer detected (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a). In contrast, leupeptin (a serine and cysteine proteinase inhibitor with selective activity against CTSB) did not alter the impact of ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> expression on APP metabolism in HEK293-APP695<sup>WT</sup> cells (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a). Similar results were obtained with E64D (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a). Pepstatin could have elicited non-specific effect on the APP metabolism. In order to confirm the molecular cascade linking ADAM30, CTSD and APP, we finally down-regulated CTSD expression with a siRNA targeting CTSD in HEK293 cells over-expressing or not ADAM30<sup>WT</sup>. When CTSD was down-regulated, the effect of ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> expression in HEK293 cells was again no longer detected (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b).</p>
        <p>Altogether, these results strongly suggested that ADAM30 might be involved in APP degradation via selective activation of lysosomal CTSD. In line with our previous results, it is noteworthy that in a HEK293 cell line stably overexpressing APP<sup>695WT</sup> and ADAM30<sup>WT</sup>, exposure to pepstatin was also associated with a 51% increase in intracellular APP accumulation (relative to cells not overexpressing ADAM30<sup>WT</sup>; pÂ &lt;Â 0.01; <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>c).</p>

        <title>Lysosome Sorting of ADAM30 is Required for its Modulation of APP</title>
        <p>We finally assessed whether the consensus sequences for lysosomal sorting in the APP C-terminal tail (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Kouchi et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Kouchi et al., 1999</xref>) was required for ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> impact on APP metabolism. In a first step, we mutated lysine 688 of APP<sup>695WT</sup> into a stop codon (APPÎC8) (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>d); this leads to deletion of the last eight C-terminal amino acids (the lysosome-addressing sequence YKFF, corresponding to YXXÃ, where Ã is a highly hydrophobic residue) but does not modify the sequence controlling APP endocytosis. <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>e shows that the transient co-expression of APPÎC8 and ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> in HEK293 cells abolished the decrease in APP catabolites associated with ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> expression. Further, we mutated phenylalanine at position 690 (APP<sup>F690S</sup>) into a serine residue within the lysosome-addressing sequence. <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>e also shows that transient co-expression of APP<sup>F690S</sup> and ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> in HEK293 cells abolished the decrease in APP products associated with ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> expression. However, mutation of glutamic acid 691 (outside the lysosome-addressing sequence) into a valine (APP<sup>E691V</sup>), did not modify ADAM30 wild-type phenotype. These results thus indicate that only a mutation within the lysosome addressing sequence (APP<sup>F690S</sup>) abolished ADAM30-mediated impact on APP metabolism. Of note, we did not detect any modification on APP<sup>WT</sup> endocytosis in line with ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> over-expression (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Overexpression of ADAM30 Modulates AÎ² Production and Deposition In Vivo</title>
        <p>To corroborate our observations in vivo and further evaluate the impact of ADAM30 on AÎ² peptide secretion and amyloidosis, we sought to generate a transgenic mouse model. It was not possible to develop ADAM30 knock-out mice (ADAM30 is not expressed in the mouse brain (Allen Brain Atlas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brain-map.org" id="ir0015">http://www.brain-map.org</ext-link> and our data, <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a and Supplementary Fig. 13) contrary to what we observed in humans. We thus generated APP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup> mice that conditionally overexpressed hADAM30<sup>WT</sup> in the neurons of the forebrain (as previously mentioned, immunohistochemistry experiments were consistent with the expression of human ADAM30 in neurons in human brain tissue (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c)). Primary cultures of adult neurons indicated that expression of ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> was only observed in neurons generated from hADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup>-Cre mice (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a). As observed in cell lines, a decrease in APP catabolites was also observed in primary cultures of adult neurons expressing ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b).</p>
        <p>We then extended our results by analyzing the level of soluble AÎ²42 in the mouse hippocampus. We observed significantly lower hippocampal levels of soluble AÎ²42 upon induction in mice overexpressing hADAM30<sup>WT</sup> (âÂ 39%, relative to hADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup> mice; pÂ =Â 0.03). We also generated mice that conditionally overexpressed hADAM30<sup>mut</sup> in order to confirm that ADAM30-mediated potential effects are genuinely linked to its catalytic activity. Remarkably, we did not detect any lower levels of soluble AÎ²42 in these mice overexpressing hADAM30<sup>mut</sup> (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>c). CTSD activity was also significantly higher in the cortex of mice overexpressing hADAM30<sup>WT</sup> (but not in those overexpressing hADAM30<sup>mut</sup>) than in hADAM30-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup> mice (+Â 34%, pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001, and +Â 7%, pÂ =Â 0.82, respectively; <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D). Interestingly, we also observed a negative correlation between CTSD activity and soluble AÎ²42 concentrations in hADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup>-Cre mice (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05 in Spearman's correlation test, Fig. S10).</p>
        <p>All these observations are in full accordance with our in vitro data and support the claim that our observed effects are indeed specifically due to ADAM30 enzymatic activity. Furthermore, our results support a direct link between ADAM30, CTSD activation and amyloid load.</p>
        <p>To assess this possibility, we used a reliable, automated, high-throughput, three-dimensional (3D) histology method to determine the AÎ² load in mouse forebrain in general and the hippocampus in particular (see the Experimental procedures, <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a). Current standards for the analysis of brain histopathological markers heavily rely on manual intervention to delineate regions of interest and quantify the staining. Data collection is thus usually restricted to a few tissue sections. As a consequence, this approach allows avoiding eventual biases due to low section sampling rate as demonstrated elsewhere (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Vandenberghe et al., 2016</xref>). By using this powerful approach, we observed that overexpression of hADAM30<sup>WT</sup> was associated with a 20% reduction in the AÎ² load (pÂ =Â 0.03; <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b) in the mice forebrain. As expected, this reduction was also observed in analysis restricted to the hippocampus (âÂ 28%, pÂ =Â 0.01; <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>c).</p>

        <title>Overexpression of ADAM30 Partially Rescues LTP Deficits</title>
        <p>Since APP catabolites have been shown to block hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) and impair learning function in mice (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Nalbantoglu et al., 1997</xref>), we aimed at establishing the functional impact of hADAM30 overexpression on LTP in hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup> hippocampus. Several paradigms of basal synaptic transmission were analyzed: maximum fEPSP slope, Maximum fEPSP amplitude, maximum fiber volley amplitude and the function relating the stimulation intensity to fEPSP, which is an index of basal synaptic strength. None of these parameters were altered whatever the transgenic mice analyzed (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a).</p>
        <p>As expected, a LTP deficit was observed in hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup> and hADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup> mice and this deficit was partially restored over time in hADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup>-Cre mice (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a and b). Mean fEPSP for the different groups was calculated over the last 20Â min of recording post-high frequency stimulation. A significant difference in LTP was observed between the hADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup>-Cre mice and the other transgenic mice in which no potentiation was observed. Even if ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> over-expression did not fully rescue potentiation, an about 60% recovery was observed (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>c).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>One of the main difficulties in differential expression analyses of postmortem tissues relates to whether the variations detected are causes or consequences of the disease process. By means of a multidisciplinary approach involving various state-of-the-art techniques and novel original transgenic mouse models, we identified ADAM30 as a player in APP metabolism and show that its underexpression likely directly contributes to Alzheimer's disease physiopathology.</p>
      <p>Very little is known about the physiological role of ADAM30 (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cerretti et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Almawi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 2014</xref>), its putative involvement in Alzheimer's disease and its protein partners. However, our results highlight a new axis in APP metabolism, with APP sorting to lysosomes, ADAM30-dependent CTSD activation and APP degradation. Overall, this set of data supports previous mechanistically unsolved observations of an important lysosomal contribution to the metabolism of APP (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Funk and Kuret, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>The potential APP degradation through ADAM30-dependent CTSD activation could be either linked to the CTSD activity by itself (CTSD was described to endoproteolyse the C100 APP fragment at multiple sites and to display Î²-secretase-like activity, in vitro) (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Mackay et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Chevallier et al., 1997</xref>) or to a CTSD-mediated subsequent activation of other hydrolases (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Benes et al., 2008</xref>). In line with the recent description that PS1 mutations can be linked to defective lysosomal proteolysis (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), our data support the importance of the lysosome compartment in APP metabolism and as a consequence in the Alzheimer's disease pathophysiological processes.</p>
      <p>We suspect that further investigation of other potential ADAM30 substrates might provide a better understanding of the ADAM30-dependent physiopathologic processes. Interestingly, all these targets can be directly or indirectly linked to insulino-resistance and/or APP metabolism. In one hand, GKAP1 was recently described to interact with IRS1 and to participate in insulino-resistance in adypocites (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Ando et al., 2015</xref>) whereas the ADAM30 locus was reported as a genetic risk factor for Type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cerretti et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Almawi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, IRs, insulino-resistance and TD2 were described as modulators of the Alzheimer's disease pathology though a potential modulation of the APP metabolism whereas CTSD was previously involved in APP processing in vitro (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Dreyer et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Mackay et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Haque et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Funk and Kuret, 2012</xref>). It is also noteworthy that IRS4 (also identified in our COFRADIC study) is able to directly interact with the Grb2 adaptor protein, a well-known actor of APP processing/sorting (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Hinsby et al., 2004</xref>). Of note, since lysosomal proteolysis can represent a general mechanism for protein degradation/processing, we measured secreted catabolites of Met, a protein exhibiting a metabolism similar of APP (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>). We did not observe any modifications of the secreted Met products following co-transfection of Met and ADAM30 in HEK293 cells (Fig. S11). This observation suggests that the ADAM30-dependent CTSD-lysosome activation may be rather selective and that its metabolic consequences could be limited to a restricted number of proteins.</p>
      <p>When considering the APP metabolism as a whole, our present findings (including the ADAM30-linked decreased secretions of APPs-Î± and -Î² and AÎ² peptides) strongly suggest that either (i) ADAM30 is involved in a process that modifies the equilibrium between APP recycling (from early/late lysosomes to the membrane) and APP degradation in the lysosome or (ii) ADAM30 affects the cellular events that drives the dispatching of full-length membrane APP to either the endocytosis pathway or the lysosomal compartment, as was previously suggested (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzen et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is noteworthy that we did not detect any changes in the internalization or endocytosis of full-length membrane APP in cells overexpressing ADAM30.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we hypothesize that ADAM30 is a key player in APP metabolism; it appears to be involved in APP degradation via sorting to lysosomes, targeted CTSD activation and then full-length APP recycling. The mechanisms that involve ADAM30 may restrict full-length APP recycling and therefore influence the pool of APP available for Î±-, Î²- and Î³-secretase processing.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we characterized a new facet of the APP physiology which may provide new therapeutic targets to control amyloid peptide production in the brain.</p>

        <p>Impact of ADAM30<sup>WT</sup> over-expression on LTP in Alzheimer-like mouse model. (a) LTP at the CA3-CA1 synapses of hippocampal slices induced by 4Â ÃÂ 100-Hz stimulation is impaired in hADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup> (nine mice) and hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup> ( eight mice) compared with WT mice (eight mice). Cre dependent gene expression of hADAM30<sup>WT</sup> in hADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup>-Cre mice partially rescues LTP (nine mice). Inset graph shows inputâoutput curves, which are comparable in hADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup> (nine mice), hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup> (nÂ =Â 8 mice), hADAM30<sup>WT</sup>-hAPP<sup>Sw,Ind</sup>-Cre (nÂ =Â 9 mice), and WT mice (eight mice). (b) Traces show the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) from a representative animal from each group, black traces represent the average of baseline recording before 4Â ÃÂ 100-Hz stimulation, red traces show the average over the last 20Â min of post-stimulation recording. (c) Quantification indicating the percentage change in average fEPSP amplitude 40â60Â min after 4Â ÃÂ 100-Hz stimulation. Data are meanÂ Â±Â SEM. **pÂ =Â 0.0005, **pÂ =Â 0.0015 (Mann-Whitney non-parametric test).</p>
