          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Many inducible transcription factors are regulated through batteries of posttranslational modifications that couple their activity to inducing stimuli. We have studied such regulation of <underline>H</underline>eat <underline>S</underline>hock <underline>F</underline>actor <underline>1</underline> (HSF1), a key protein in control of the heat shock response, and a participant in carcinogenisis, neurological health and aging. As the mechanisms involved in the intracellular regulation of HSF1 in good health and its dysregulation in disease are still incomplete we are investigating the role of posttranslational modifications in such regulation.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>In a proteomic study of HSF1 binding partners, we have discovered its association with the pleiotropic protein kinase A (PKA). HSF1 binds avidly to the catalytic subunit of PKA, (PKAcÎ±) and becomes phosphorylated on a novel serine phosphorylation site within its central regulatory domain (serine 320 or S320), both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Intracellular PKAcÎ± levels and phosphorylation of HSF1 at S320 were both required for HSF1 to be localized to the nucleus, bind to response elements in the promoter of an HSF1 target gene (<italic>hsp70.1</italic>) and activate <italic>hsp70.1</italic> after stress. Reduction in PKAcÎ± levels by small hairpin RNA led to HSF1 exclusion from the nucleus, its exodus from the <italic>hsp70.1</italic> promoter and decreased <italic>hsp70.1</italic> transcription. Likewise, null mutation of HSF1 at S320 by alanine substitution for serine led to an HSF1 species excluded from the nucleus and deficient in <italic>hsp70.1</italic> activation.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>These findings of PKA regulation of HSF1 through S320 phosphorylation add to our knowledge of the signaling networks converging on this factor and may contribute to elucidating its complex roles in the stress response and understanding HSF1 dysregulation in disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>HSF1 is a primary regulator of the heat shock response and a factor in a number of human pathologies including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases <xref rid="pone.0013830-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Min1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Calderwood1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Calderwood2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Mosser1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Curiously, although both diseases are associated with advancing age, HSF1 loses activity in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases while being activated in cancer <xref rid="pone.0013830-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Min1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Tonkiss1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It would seem apparent therefore that understanding the molecular basis of HSF1 up- and down-regulation in disease would provide valuable insights.</p>
      <p>HSF1 belongs to the multi-gene HSF family present in all eukaryotes <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Initial studies were carried out on the single HSF gene of the yeast <italic>S. cereviseae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0013830-Wiederrecht1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These studies indicated that, unique among transcription factors HSF undergoes trimer formation on activation and that such oligomerization governs binding to the heat shock elements (HSE) on the promoters of heat shock protein (HSP) genes <xref rid="pone.0013830-Sorger1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Sorger2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The findings in yeast were confirmed in mammalian cells in which trimerization was shown to be a requirement for binding to HSP promoters <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Another unusual feature associated with HSF is that trimerization and binding to HSE can be dissociated from <italic>tran</italic>s-activation in studies carried out both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>; DNA binding alone is evidently insufficient to drive transcription and other, binding independent processes are involved <xref rid="pone.0013830-Bruce1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Hensold1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Early studies suggested that these may include posttranslational modification of HSF1 <xref rid="pone.0013830-Sorger2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Hensold1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Sarge1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Indeed yeast HSF and mammalian HSF1 appear to undergo heavy phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues when activated <xref rid="pone.0013830-Sorger2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Sarge1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In addition intracellular HSF1 undergoes other modifications such as sumoylation and acetylation after stress <xref rid="pone.0013830-Westerheide1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Alterations in HSF1 phosphorylation appear to be important in the âsecond stepâ of HSF1 activation and stress and <italic>tran</italic>s-activation of HSP genes can be inhibited by kinase inhibitors, while inactive HSF1 trimers can be rendered active <italic>in vivo</italic> by exposure to phosphatase inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0013830-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The sites of HSF1 phosphorylation have been studied by phosphopeptide mapping and a partial list of such sites exists. HSF1 is known to be phosphorylated on serines residues at 121, 230, 303, 307, 326, 363 <xref rid="pone.0013830-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Holmberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Chu2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Guettouche1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Kline1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Knauf1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The role of these sites in HSP transcription have been attributed mainly by point mutation studies and these experiments suggest that phosphorylation of serine 121, 303, 307, or 363 can inhibit HSP transcription <xref rid="pone.0013830-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Xavier1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. S230 and S326 are the only currently known phosphorylation sites associated with stimulation of transcription by HSF1. In addition, the regulatory mechanisms through which these posttranslational modifications are converted into intracellular functions are not clear <xref rid="pone.0013830-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The inhibitory modifications at serines 303, 307 and 363 have each been attributed to accelerated nuclear export <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-He1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This effect has, in the case of serines 303 and 307 been attributed to recruitment of 14-3-3 to Phospho-S303, S307-HSF1 and stimulation of nuclear export through a pathway involving nuclear export protein CRM1/exportin1 <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In addition, S303 phosphorylation has been shown to lead to a secondary posttranslational modification, HSF1 sumoylation at lysine 298 <xref rid="pone.0013830-Hietakangas1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Another curious aspect of HSF1 regulation during stress is that, while HSF1 phosphorylation at S303 and S307 and sumolylation at K298 are inhibitory to HSF1 function when assayed at 37Â°C, during heat shock these inhibitory signals are evidently inoperative and HSP transcription proceeds <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It seems likely that an override mechanism exists to promote rapid activation of the stress response. Persistence of inhibitory signaling may permit rapid turn off of transcription in recovery from stress after the override mechanisms of stress subside.</p>
      <p>Much therefore remains to be learned regarding the activating roles of posttranslational modifications in HSF1 regulation, their role in stress mediated transcription and the mechanisms by which such modifications are recognized by regulatory pathways in cells and converted into altered function. We therefore began a screen of intracellular proteins that can interact with HSF1 and modify function and observed binding to a number of proteins including the catalytic subunit of 3â²-5â²-<italic>cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase</italic> (PKAc). Protein kinase A is a versatile regulator of cell metabolism and gene transcription and consists of two main subunits, PKAc and PKA<sub>R</sub> (PKA<sub>R</sub> is the regulatory subunit of PKA) <xref rid="pone.0013830-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Before cellular activation, PKAc and PKA<sub>R</sub> bind in an inactive complex that can be induced by the low molecular weight signaling molecule cAMP <xref rid="pone.0013830-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Cyclic AMP is a second messenger molecule generated both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm by numerous isoforms of the enzyme adenylate cyclase <xref rid="pone.0013830-Dessauer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Binding of cAMP to the PKA complex liberates PKAc to interact with a wide range of protein substrates, phosphorylating them on serine or threonine residues, usually within the conserved motif (RXXS/T), (where X can be any amino acid, R is arginine, S/T serine or threonine) <xref rid="pone.0013830-Pearson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, a significant exception to this mechanism is found in the regulation of NFÎºB. PKAc binds directly to the substrate (NFÎºB/p65 transcription factor), phosphorylates p65 when NFÎºB is induced by cytokines and activates ÎºB gene transcription independently of cAMP <xref rid="pone.0013830-Chu2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, cAMPâdependent phosphorylation of p65 has also been observed <xref rid="pone.0013830-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have investigated binding of the Î± form of PKA<sub>C</sub> (PKAcÎ±) to HSF1 and its role in <italic>hsp70.1</italic> transcription. PKAcÎ± bound to HSF1 and led to phosphorylation on a novel site (serine 320). Reduction of intracellular PKAcÎ± levels by RNA interference inhibited HSF1-S320 phosphorylation, prevented accumulation of HSF1 in the nucleus and binding to the <italic>hsp70.1</italic> promoter and decreased heat shock transcription. Thus PKAcÎ± may play a novel role in activation of HSF1 and stress-induced transcription.</p>

        <title>(1) HSF1 binds PKAcÎ±</title>
        <p>Association between HSF1 and PKAcÎ± was first indicated in the pulldown analysis mentioned above, using GST-HSF1, HeLa cell lysates, mass spectrometry and database analysis <xref rid="pone.0013830-Khaleque1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013830.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We confirmed that these proteins interact <italic>in vivo</italic> using immunoprecipitation of PKAcÎ± from HeLa cell lysates by anti- PKAcÎ± antibodies followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-HSF1 antibodies in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Intracellular HSF1 was co-immunoprecipitated by these antibodies in association with PKAcÎ± and this interaction was also observed after heat shock. We next examined whether HSF1 can bind to regulatory subunits from the PKA holoenzyme (PKA R1 or PKA RII) using co-immunoprecipiation analysis with anti-PKA-R1 and anti-PKA-RII antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Trace levels of HSF1 binding to PKAR1 were observed after heat shock although we did not detect association with PKARII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, the intracellular levels of PKA-R1 and PKA-RII were considerably lower than the concentration of PKAcÎ± by the criterion of intensity of the immunoblot bands and preferential association may reflect this higher concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Nonetheless, these data are consistent with the original proteomic screen in which we found strong evidence for HSF1 binding to PKAcÎ± but did not detect interaction of GST-HSF1 with the PKA regulatory domains.</p>

<italic>A)</italic> Immunoprecipitation assays. HeLa cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°C or 43Â°C before they were harvested on ice and equalized for protein concentration. Cell extracts were then probed by immunoprecipitation with either anti-PKAcÎ± (lane 1,2) anti-PKARI (lane 3), anti-PKARII antibodies (lane 4) or rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with anti-HSF1 antibodies. We have shown the IgG heavy chain to indicate the equal loading of immunoprecipitates in this experiment. The membrane was then stripped and re-probed sequentially with anti- PKAcÎ±, PKARI and PKARII antibodies. We also analyzed the levels of HSF1, PKAcÎ±, PKARI and PKARII in the cell lysate (prior to immunoprecipitation) and these data are shown beneath the immunoprecipitation data. Experiments were carried out in duplicate with similar findings. <italic>B)</italic> Immunoprecipitation assay with anti-HSF1 antibodies in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°C or 43Â°C. Other cultures were simultaneously treated with growth factors (30 mM HRG or 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 24 hr) or inhibitors (2 mM 17AAG for 24 hr, 5 ÂµM MG-132 for 6 hr) as indicated on the figure (panels 3â6). Cell lysates were then prepared as in (A). Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-HSF1 antibodies and immunoprecipitates later analyzed by immunoblot with anti- PKAcÎ± antibodies. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins were loaded and immunoblotted with anti-HSF1 and anti- PKAcÎ± antibodies. Again, we have shown the IgG heavy chain to indicate the equal loading of immunoprecipitates. In the lower panel equal amounts of protein lysates were loaded for measurement of HSF1, PKAcÎ±, Î²-actin and Hsp70 in cells prior to immunoprecipitation (B, lower panel). The whole-cell lysates were analyzed by 4â15% gradient gels to demonstrate the presence of hyperphosphorylated HSF1 in the preparations more effectively. In addition we analyzed the expression of Hsp70 in cells 6 and 24 hr after the treatments to determine their effectiveness in inducing Hsp70 expression. Experiments were carried out in duplicate reproducibly. <italic>C</italic>) MCF-7 cells were incubated with or without heat shock for 1 hour at 43Â°C. Additional cell cultures were also treated with growth factors (30 ÂµM HRG for 24 hrs, 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 24 hrs) and inhibitors (2 ÂµM 17AAG for 24 hrs, 5 ÂµM MG132 for 6 hrs) at 37Â°C, as indicated in panels 2â5. Cells were then lysed and extracts collected and equalized for protein concentration. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti- PKAcÎ± antibodies prior to anti-HSF1 immunoblot. Equal amounts of protein were loaded to measure quantitatively the level of HSF1, and PKAcÎ±. Levels of HSF1, PKAcÎ± and Î²-actin in cell lysates prior to immunoprecipitation are shown in the lower panels. The experiments were carried out three times with similar findings. <italic>D</italic>) HSF1, adenylate cyclase and PKAcÎ± binding. Control cells or cells given 1 hr at 43Â°C were treated with or without t-busate (lane 2) and then lysed on ice and immunoprecipitated with anti- PKAcÎ± antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-HSF1 antibodies. In addition, we assayed the cAMP levels in these cell lysates by EIA and these are plotted as means +/â standard deviation (right panel). Amount of cAMP was normalized to 100% of the cAMP concentration in control HeLa cells (no heat). We also measured intracellular cAMP levels (mean +/â SD) after heat shock, HRG, IGF1, MG-132 and 17-AAG treatment, using the conditions described in Fig. 1B. The cAMP levels after each of the treatments were not significantly increased compared to control. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate with similar results.</p>

        <p>We next carried out the inverse analysis using immunoprecipitation with anti-HSF1 antibodies followed by immunoblot with anti-PKAcÎ± antibodies. Because HSF1 can also be activated by a number of other agents including the Hsp90 inhibitor 17AAG, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and growth factors such as heregulin (HRG) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), we also examined the effect of these molecules on HSF1-PKAcÎ± association. For these experiments we used MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells as these cells respond vigorously to the growth factors. We observed a significant basal level of HSF1-PKAcÎ± binding in these cells and association was strongly increased by HRG and MG-132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Heat shock did not cause a major increase in HSF1-PKAcÎ± complex formation in the MCF-7 cells. However, heregulin and MG-132 led to major increases in PKA co-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). When we examined HSF1 in the lysates, we found that heat shock led to electrophoretic retardation of HSF1, consistent with stress-induced hyperphosphorylation shown previously. PKAcÎ± levels were largely unaltered. We also measured the levels of an HSF1 product (Hsp70). Hsp70 concentrations were increased by each treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). We then carried out the reverse procedure in MCF-7 cells, immunoprecipitating with anti-PKAcÎ± antibodies and observed the co-precipitation of HSF1 with immunoprecipitated PKAcÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). HSF1 levels were consistently increased in cells treated with HRG and HSF1-PKAcÎ± association appeared to increase in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1 B, C</xref>). This was not observed for the other treatments in which HSF1-PKAcÎ± association was maintained after the treatments but not consistently increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1AâC</xref>). PKAcÎ± levels were not consistently altered by any of the treatments and changes in levels of the kinase do not appear to influence responses to HSF1 activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1, AâC</xref>).</p>
        <p>As PKA can be induced through the activation of adenylate cyclase, we examined a <italic>scenario</italic> in which HSF1-binding to PKAcÎ± is regulated through the product of adenylate cyclase activity, cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Indeed, using the adenylate cyclase inhibitor t-busate, we observed a reduction in HSF1-PKAcÎ± binding, a decrease that correlates with lower cAMP levels under these conditions, suggesting a role for cAMP in the interaction. However, we did not detect an increase in intracellular cAMP levels after 1 hour of heat shock at 43Â°C in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, right panel). This could be interpreted as meaning that basal levels of cAMP are required to maintain a pool of free intracellular PKAcÎ± capable of HSF1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). We next measured cAMP levels in cells treated with the other activators HRG, IGF1, 17AAG and MG-132. Once again we did not detect an increase in intracellular cAMP levels after heat shock at 43Â°C or with the other treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, lower panel). However some studies have shown transient activation of adenylate cyclase, within seconds or minutes after the stress, that decay over time <xref rid="pone.0013830-Calderwood3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Calderwood4" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Elevating cAMP levels with the drug forskolin in the absence of stress failed to activate HSF1-PKAcÎ± binding (A. Murshid &amp; SK Calderwood, unpublished data). Thus although basal cAMP may be required for HSF1-PKAcÎ± binding, alterations in cAMP after HSF1 activation do not seem to be involved.</p>

        <title>(2) HSF1 is phosphorylated on serine 320 by PKAcÎ±</title>
        <p>We next investigated whether PKAcÎ± could phosphorylate HSF1 when the two proteins were incubated together <italic>in vitro</italic>. Purified GST-HSF1 was mixed with purified PKAcÎ± and ATP for a range of incubation times to maximize the extent of HSF1 phosphorylation. The reaction mixtures were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot for HSF1 and for HSF1 phosphorylation on PKA consensus phosphorylation motif RXXpS, using anti-RXXpS antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Abundantly phosphorylated samples of HSF1, detected by this antibody were then digested in-gel with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Database analysis of the trypsin fragments indicated the generation of two principal phosphopeptide species, V310-R336 containing a potential site for PKAcÎ± at S320 within a consensus PKA motif and K118-K126 containing S121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We have shown that the latter site (S121) is, when phosphorylated, inhibitory for HSF1 under resting conditions. However, the influence of phospho-S121-HSF1 is overridden during heat shock under which conditions it does not influence transcription and becomes dephosphorylated <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We therefore concentrated on the novel S320 phosphorylation site. We examined the role of heat shock and PKAcÎ± expression on HSF1-S320 phosphorylation using commercial antibodies specific for this phosphorylated form of HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). Cells apparently contain significant background levels of phospho-S320-HSF1 and phosphorylation increased immediately after heat shock, before decaying back to basal levels by 2 hr recovery at 37Â°C, correlating well with the period of increased <italic>trans</italic>-activation by heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). We then carried out experiments in which intracellular PKAcÎ± levels were reduced by stable knockdown with small hairpin RNA packaged in lentivirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). We employed two such shRNA species, PKAkd#1 and PKAkd#2, one of which (PKAkd#1) efficiently reduced PKAcÎ± levels in infected cells while the other (PKAkd#2) was relatively less effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Phospho-S320-HSF1 levels were significantly reduced in cells expressing PKAkd#1 compared to cells expressing PKAkd#2 or control cells infected with lentivirus enclosing a scrambled RNA species (PKA scr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). As a further control, we investigated HSF1 phosphorylation at the adjacent serine 326 using antibodies specific to this phosphorylated motif. HSF1 phosphorylation at this site was also increased by heat shock, although knockdown of PKAcÎ± had minimal effects on S326 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Phosphorylation of HSF1 at these two adjacent serine residues, although induced with similar kinetics by heat shock, is evidently regulated independently. It is notable that HSF1 hyperphosphorylation was not markedly ablated by PKAcÎ± knockdown conditions that led to reduced phospho-S320-HSF1 suggesting that other posttranslational modifications may contribute to the electrophoretic mobility shift seen in HSF1 after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p>

        <title>(3) Intracellular localization of HSF1 and PKAcÎ± without and with stress</title>
        <p>We next examined the intracellular localization of HSF and PKAcÎ± before and after stress using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In the absence of stress, PKAcÎ± was found in punctuate <italic>foci</italic> in the perinuclear and nuclear regions of cells and HSF1 largely in the nucleus as described previously <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). After heat shock, HSF1 was also localized to nuclei and was concentrated in a number of punctuate foci (stress granules) also as observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Co-localization or partial co-localization of the two proteins was observed in the nuclei in many cells after heat shock, although a large proportion of PKAcÎ± remained in the perinuclear as well as in the cytosol in some cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Quantitation by cell counting indicated that in approximately 30% of cells a proportion of the HSF1 was associated with PKAcÎ± before heat shock, and this proportion increased to approximately 70% after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Fig. 3A, 3B, 3E</xref>). Heat shock did not however cause quantitative translocation of the PKAcÎ± to the nucleus, suggesting that stable interaction after heat shock involves only a fraction of the cytosolic PKAcÎ± or that perinuclear PKAcÎ± may be capable of phosphorylating HSF1 in that region and help in translocation of HSF1 to the nucleus. Some cells showed nuclear localization of PKAcÎ± and partial co-localization with HSF1 suggesting direct association between them as indicated in the earlier immunoprecipitation experiments. Not all PKAcÎ±-containing punctate structures were associated with HSF1 in the nucleus, a finding which is not unexpected as nuclear PKAcÎ± can associate with and phosphorylate other key components such as CREB (cyclic AMP responsive factor) after heat shock (A. Murshid &amp; SK Calderwood, in preparation). Although HRG and IGF-1 activate transcription through HSF1, we did not observe the accumulation of the factor in stress granules after these treatments in most cells. However HSF1 association with PKAcÎ± in nuclei was increased from 30% to approximately 60% after treatment with both HRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Fig. 3C, 3E</xref>) and IGF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Fig. 3D, 3E</xref>).

        <p>As previous studies suggest that HSF1 is regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and that nuclear export is an important component in this process, we next examined the potential role of the principal exportin, CRM1/exportin-1 in PKAcÎ±-regulated localization of HSF1 under control and stress conditions. A role for CRM1 was examined using the inhibitor leptomycin-B (LMB). As described above, HSF1 was localized by immunofluorescence mainly in the nuclear compartments of cells with or without heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013830.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013830.s003">S3</xref>). We next examined whether LMB could reverse the inhibitory effects on HSF1 nuclear localization of PKAcÎ± knockdown. Our hypothesis was that HSF1 phosphorylation by PKAcÎ± might be required for nuclear accumulation of HSF1 by decreasing CRM1-mediated nuclear export. However, addition of LMB failed to reverse the effects of PKAcÎ± knockdown on redistributing HSF1 to the cytoplasm in heat shocked cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013830.s002">Fig. S2</xref> D, E). Curiously, LMB was effective in permitting nuclear localization of HSF1 in unstressed cells even under conditions of PKAcÎ± knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013830.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). However, nuclear localization of HSF1 in stress conditions appears to be regulated in a PKAcÎ±-dependent manner by an unconventional pathway that does not involve a major role for CRM1/exportin1. Indeed we were able to detect by co-immunoprecipitation analysis significant binding of CRM1 to HSF1 that was not modulated by heat shock (A Murshid &amp; SK Calderwood, unpublished data).</p>
        <p>We then investigated the potential role of HSF1 phosphorylation at serine residue 320 in intracellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Mutant versions of GFP-tagged HSF1 were prepared in which S320 was changed either to aspartate (S320D) or alanine (S320A) and these constructs were then expressed in cells from a CMV-based promoter. S320A, being refractory to phosphorylation, would function as a null mutation while in S320D the negative charge of the carboxyl side chain of aspartate might mimic that of the phosphoserine. As the presence of wild-type HSF1 in such cells could complicate the interpretation, we carried these experiments in cells in which HSF1 was depleted by specific shRNA. We were unsuccessful in preparing stable HSF1 knockdown cell lines in either HeLa or MCF-7 as significant reductions in HSF1 were lethal to these cells (data not shown). We therefore used a prostate cancer cell line, DU-145 in which we were able to induce profound reduction in HSF1 levels by knockdown with shRNA and yet maintain viability. Inactivation of serine 320 by alanine substitution led to an HSF1 species refractory to heat-induced nuclear localization and which was detected in cytoplasmic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). In cells expressing HSF1-GFP (S320D), this mutant form of HSF1 was localized to the nucleus after stress, indicating a role for negative charge at serine 320 in heat-induced nuclear localization of HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The predominantly nuclear localization of HSF1-GFP (S320D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g004">Fig. 4 B</xref>) resembled that of wt HSF1 after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Fig. 3 B, F</xref>), while the largely cytoplasmic localization of S320A-HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g004">Fig. 4A, C</xref>) resembled localization of wt HSF1 after PKAcÎ± knockdown by PKAkd#1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that PKAcÎ±-mediated HSF1 phosphorylation at S320 plays a significant role in nuclear localization. To further determine the role of HSF1 phosphorylation at S320 in co-localization with PKAcÎ±, we expressed FLAG-PKAcÎ± in HeLa cells and then stained for phospho-S320 HSF1 in control, heat shocked (43Â°C, 1 hr) and HRG treated cells. We found similar patterns of partial co-localization of phospho-S320-HSF1 and PKAcÎ± in perinuclear to nuclear regions as seen previously for total HSF1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013830.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). HSF1 may thus dissociate from PKAcÎ± but remain phosphorylated on S320.</p>

These experiments were carried out in cells expressing wtHSF1 as we aimed to investigate a potential dominant negative role for the null mutant (HSF1-S320A). Exposure to heat shock led to activation of the <italic>hsp70.1</italic>-luciferase promoter-reporter construct (<italic>hsp70</italic>.1-Luc) in untransfected cells and such activity was increased in cells transfected with wild-type HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, after HSF1-S320A transfection, heat shock induced <italic>hsp70.1</italic>-Luc activity was significantly (p&lt;0.01) decreased below the levels seen in untransfected cells suggesting potential âdominant negativeâ effects of S320A in quenching activation of the endogenous HSF1 by heat shock.

Interestingly, cells expressing HSF1-S320D had significantly elevated mean luciferase levels (p&lt;0.05) even in non-heat conditions suggesting that gain of negative charge at S320 may mediate the activating effects of heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> shows ChIP analysis indicating HSF1 binding to <italic>hsp70.1</italic> chromatin. In each panel we show PCR analysis of DNA associated with HSF1 in the first lane, a control ChIP analysis with pre-immune IgG in the second lane, as well as an indication of the input in the third lane. Experiments are carried out without and with heat shock in cells treated with the shRNA PKAkd#1 described above (PKAshRNA) or in controls expressing a scrambled RNA sequence (PKA<italic>scr</italic>). Using this approach we detected HSF1 binding to the HSE region of <italic>hsp70.1</italic> after heat shock in PKA<italic>scr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> top left panel). HSF1 was not detected in association with the EXN region of <italic>hsp70.1</italic> in any of the conditions and did not appear to bind Hsp70HSE in the absence of heat shock or after PKAcÎ± knockdown with or without heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). These experiments were repeated using quantitative real time RT-PCR and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>. Heat shock led to an approximate 35-fold enrichment of HSF1 on the HSE region and such binding was inhibited in cells after PKAcÎ± knockdown (PKAkd#1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Minimal binding of HSF1 to the HSE was seen in PKAshRNA cells and in the absence of heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Minimal association of HSF1 with HSP70 EXN was seen in under each of the conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next examined the requirement for PKAcÎ± in transcriptional activation of HSF1 by heat shock. Modulation of PKAcÎ± activity by overexpression or knockdown influenced markedly the activity of the <italic>hsp70.1</italic>-Luc reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Increasing intracellular PKAcÎ± levels by forced expression from a viral promoter (pCMV.FLAG-PKAcÎ±) led to a significant (p&lt;0.005) plasmid dose-dependent increase in heat-induced <italic>hsp70.1</italic>-Luc activity <xref rid="pone.0013830-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> (left panel).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our experiments therefore suggest a novel mechanism in the activation of hsp70 after stress, involving HSF1 association with PKAcÎ± and phosphorylation by this kinase at a novel site (serine 320) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). These conclusions are confluent with earlier studies suggesting a role for PKA in activation of an <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter <xref rid="pone.0013830-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The mechanisms dictating PKAcÎ± binding to HSF1 in stress are not entirely clear but do not appear to involve major roles for adenylate cyclase or cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). We observed only a minor amount of binding of the regulatory R1 domain of PKA to HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). It seems likely that activation of phosphorylation by the bound PKAcÎ± involves the transition in HSF1 structure that occurs after heat shock, from a compacted form, constrained by intramolecular coiled-coil and molecular chaperone interactions to a more expansive conformation <xref rid="pone.0013830-Rabindran1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Sarge2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Westwood1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Zuo1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Zuo2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Such a transition may expose domains previously cryptic within the inactive protein. We also observed a basal level of HSF1- PKAcÎ± binding and S320 phosphorylation in HeLa and MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">2</xref>). This may reflect the fact that HSF1 possesses basal transcriptional activity in many human malignant cells lines and is required for survival in these cells <xref rid="pone.0013830-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Min1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Previous studies also showed that, when HSF1 is partially activated to a more relaxed, DNA binding form by exposure of cells to salicylate or menadione, it can then be rendered transcriptionally competent by exposure of cells to protein phosphatase inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0013830-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed a similar two part activation and although ATP is not required for the formation of HSF1 trimers and for DNA binding it is essential for full transcriptional activation. Serine 320 is within the central region of HSF1 that is regulated by heat shock independently of trimerization or DNA binding <xref rid="pone.0013830-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The regulatory domain of HSF1 is repressive to transcription under normal temperatures while stress not only overturns repression but leads to <italic>trans</italic>-activation considerably greater in magnitude than might be accounted for by reversal of repression <xref rid="pone.0013830-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The original studies suggested that regulatory function is bounded by amino acids 221â310 although the discovery of activating phosphorylation at serines 320 and 326 suggests extending the domain to at least serine 326 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0013830-Guettouche1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The regulatory domain of HSF1 could function as a signaling platform in response to protein kinases as it contains multiple serine and threonine residues <xref rid="pone.0013830-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Rabindran2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This region contains serines 303 and 307 that are repressive when phosphorylated and could exert some of the inhibitory functions of the regulatory domain seen at normal temperatures. Inhibition of <italic>trans</italic> activation exerted through this region appears to involve a pathway in which dual phosphorylation of HSF1 at serines 307 and 303 by ERK1 and GSK3, respectively leads to nuclear export of HSF1 through a mechanism involving recruitment of 14-3-3 family members, thus removing HSF1 from <italic>HSP</italic> promoters <xref rid="pone.0013830-Chu2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-He1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Mivechi1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In addition an adjacent residue at lysine 298 can be sumoylated in a mechanism also dependent on serine 303 phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0013830-Hietakangas1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Anckar1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. These inhibitory posttranslational modifications can be overridden in heat shocked cells even though serine 303 remains abundantly phosphorylated, 14-3-3 remains bound and K298 is sumoylated <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The central regulatory region also contains positively acting phosphorylation sites at serines 230, 326 and, as shown here at S320 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0013830-Holmberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Guettouche1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It is not clear how posttranslational modifications in this domain during stress might override the inhibitory influence of S303 phosphorylation and stimulate HSF1 <italic>trans</italic> activation. However, the current studies suggest a role for PKAcÎ± and S320 in permitting HSF1 to accumulate in the nucleus and in nuclear stress granules, bind to the <italic>hsp70.1</italic> promoter and activate <italic>hsp70.1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g003">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">5</xref>). PKAcÎ± phosphorylation of S320 may be involved in the accumulation in nuclei by reversing of nuclear export <xref rid="pone.0013830-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The exact mechanism involved is, however not clear. Nuclear localization depends on relative rates of nuclear import and nuclear export. Human HSF1 contains bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS) adjacent to leucine zipper domains, N-terminal to the regulatory domain <xref rid="pone.0013830-Sheldon1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Earlier studies showed that nuclear import involving one or more of these NLS sequences occurs continuously with or without stress and that nuclear accumulation is most likely due to blockade of nuclear export <xref rid="pone.0013830-Vujanac1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. A role for reversible binding of HSF1 to the major nuclear export protein CRM1/exportin1 in stress seems unlikely as this protein binds avidly to HSF1 with or without heat shock (A. Murshid &amp; S.K. Calderwood, unpublished data). It is also notable that depletion of PKAcÎ± did not completely inhibit HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g005">Fig. 5 D</xref>). This may reflect the incomplete reduction in PKAcÎ± levels after expression of shRNA in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">Fig. 2 C</xref>). It seems however likely that other posttranslational modifications in the regulatory domain also contribute to HSF1 activation, notably phosphorylation at serines 230 and 326 <xref rid="pone.0013830-Guettouche1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013830-Hietakangas1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. One suggested mechanism for differential regulation of HSF1 in stressed and unstressed conditions is that an altered phosphorylation landscape in the central regulatory domain may permit a switch between activator and inhibitor activity. This region of HSF1, rich in proline and serine residues, would be predicted to lack secondary structure motifs and phosphorylation could impose alternative structures due to changes in charge distribution. In addition, such phosphorylation patterns might also form binding sites for (as yet undetected) regulatory proteins.</p>
      <p>We did not examine here the potential effects of HSF1 binding on the kinase activity of PKA. However, one recent study indicates that HSF1 may be involved in upstream activation of PKA during cell transformation <xref rid="pone.0013830-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although we did not study HSF1 mediation of intracellular PKA activity, our studies do indicate sturdy interaction of HSF1 and PKAcÎ± after treatment with transforming growth factor HRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g001">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013830-g002">2</xref>). Previously we showed that, HRG directly activates HSF1 and that HSF1 mediates some of its tumorigenic effects <xref rid="pone.0013830-Khaleque2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion therefore, we have demonstrated physical and functional interaction between protein kinase A and HSF1. The PKA catalytic subunit PKAcÎ± binds and phosphorylates HSF1 on serine 320, a modification essential for nuclear localization, association with the <italic>hsp70.1</italic> promoter and transcription. A role for PKAcÎ± in the network of signaling events leading to the activation of HSF1 during the stress response is suggested.</p>

          <p>HSF1 interacts with PKAcÎ±. HeLa proteins adsorbed to GST (control) or GST-HSF1 were eluted from GSH-4B beads by reduced glutathione, and proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Silver-stained bands were digested in-gel with trypsin and eluted peptides analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectroscopy using a Voyager DE-PRO (Applied Bio-systems) and proteins identified by mass fingerprinting using database (SwissProt.8.17.2002). Peptides (AKEDFLK, VMLVKHK, QIEHTLNRK) with an exact match to murine (8.66), rat (8.64), human (8.65) PKAcÎ± and bovine PKAcÎ² (8.65) were found. (MOWSE scores are shown in parenthesis.) Mass spectrometry data were confirmed by immunoblot assay shown here carried out here on eluates from either unmodified GST or GST-HSF1, using anti-PKAc antibodies. Experiments were performed in duplicate with similar findings.</p>

          <p>Effects of LMB on localization of HSF1 with or without PKAcÎ± knockdown. AâD) HeLa cells were treated without or with LMB for 16 hours. Cells were later probed for PKAcÎ± and HSF1 with anti-PKAcÎ± antibodies and anti-HSF1 antibodies respectively. Cells were later stained with second antibodies goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (for PKAcÎ±, green) and goat anti-rat Cy3 (for HSF1, red). Nuclei were visualized using DAPI (blue) staining. C, D, E) HeLa (PKAscr) and HeLa (PKAkd#1) cells were treated with LMB for 16 hours before heat shock (43oC, 1 hour) and fixed cells were later stained for PKAcÎ± and HSF1 with anti- PKAcÎ± and anti-HSF1 antibodies as described in A. E) HeLa (PKAkd#1) cells heat shocked (43oC, 1 hour) or not. Cells were then stained for PKAcÎ± and HSF1 using the antibody cascades employed in AâD. All experiments were repeated at least once with consistent findings.</p>
