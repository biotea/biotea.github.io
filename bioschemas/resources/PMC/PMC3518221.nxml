        <p>Postsynaptic Farp1 helps to assemble a synaptic protein complex that promotes F-actin assembly and spine formation, and modulates active zones.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Synaptic adhesion organizes synapses, yet the signaling pathways that drive and integrate synapse development remain incompletely understood. We screened for regulators of these processes by proteomically analyzing synaptic membranes lacking the synaptogenic adhesion molecule SynCAM 1. This identified FERM, Rho/ArhGEF, and Pleckstrin domain protein 1 (Farp1) as strongly reduced in SynCAM 1 knockout mice. Farp1 regulates dendritic filopodial dynamics in immature neurons, indicating roles in synapse formation. Later in development, Farp1 is postsynaptic and its 4.1 protein/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain binds SynCAM 1, assembling a synaptic complex. Farp1 increases synapse number and modulates spine morphology, and SynCAM 1 requires Farp1 for promoting spines. In turn, SynCAM 1 loss reduces the ability of Farp1 to elevate spine density. Mechanistically, Farp1 activates the GTPase Rac1 in spines downstream of SynCAM 1 clustering, and promotes F-actin assembly. Farp1 furthermore triggers a retrograde signal regulating active zone composition via SynCAM 1. These results reveal a postsynaptic signaling pathway that engages transsynaptic interactions to coordinate synapse development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Synapse formation in the brain involves concerted steps. Axons and dendrites of developing neurons interact through exploratory filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ziv and Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiala et al., 1998</xref>), and contact triggers cytoskeletal rearrangements, resulting in shorter and wider filopodia as stable synapses form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hotulainen and Hoogenraad, 2010</xref>). Adhesion molecules guide these stages, assembling into transsynaptic complexes to regulate synapse number and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Missler et al., 2012</xref>). These parameters are critical for neuronal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kasai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chklovskii et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yuste, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>The actin cytoskeleton is prominent in dendritic spines, the postsynaptic specializations of mature excitatory synapses, and shapes these protrusions, anchors receptors, and participates in signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frost et al., 2010</xref>). Spine actin is highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 1998</xref>), and its reorganization contributes to the formation and structural plasticity of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonhoeffer and Yuste, 2002</xref>). Regulators of postsynaptic actin include members of the Rho GTPase familyâRhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42âthat have distinct functions in modulating spine turnover and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tashiro et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tada and Sheng, 2006</xref>). Cell surface interactions can activate theses GTPases, notably via Ephrin-B receptors that bind guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and, additionally, promote kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penzes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moeller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tolias et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The understanding of synapse organization will benefit from additional insight into the signaling pathways underlying dendritic contact exploration and spine development. To identify novel regulators of synapse formation, we focused on synaptic cell adhesion molecule 1 (SynCAM 1)-mediated synaptogenesis. SynCAM 1 (also known as Cadm1 and nectin-like 2 protein) is well-suited to study synaptic signaling because it first promotes excitatory synapse numbers and then acts in the mature brain to maintain this increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biederer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robbins et al., 2010</xref>). Further, it has an intracellular motif predicted to interact with 4.1 protein/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domains present in cytoskeletal regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biederer, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>In an unbiased proteomic analysis of synaptic membranes from SynCAM 1 knockout (KO) mice, we have now identified FERM, Rho/ArhGEF, and Pleckstrin domain protein 1 (Farp1) as a novel synapse-organizing molecule that binds via its FERM domain to the cytosolic tail of SynCAM 1. Functional studies revealed that Farp1 promotes the structural dynamics of dendritic filopodia and their stability early in development. In mature neurons, Farp1 is enriched at postsynaptic sites and regulates the number of spines in dissociated neurons and organotypic slice culture. Notably, SynCAM 1 requires Farp1 to promote synapse formation, and the synaptogenic activity of Farp1 is reduced in absence of SynCAM 1. Biochemical assays and live imaging of an optical probe demonstrate that Farp1 specifically binds the GTPase Rac1 and activates it in postsynaptic protrusions. In turn, Farp1 increases F-actin polymerization in spine heads. Moreover, SynCAM 1 and postsynaptic Farp1 signal retrogradely across the synaptic cleft to modulate the composition of presynaptic active zones. These results identify a novel signaling pathway that coordinates synaptic adhesion and pre- and postsynaptic organization.</p>

        <title>Proteomic identification of Farp1</title>
        <p>We performed a proteomic screen to compare the composition of synaptic membranes from forebrains of KO mice lacking SynCAM 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robbins et al., 2010</xref>) versus wild-type (WT) littermates. This approach followed the rationale that intracellular synaptogenic signaling partners of SynCAM 1 may be recruited to or stabilized at synaptic membranes by this adhesion molecule, resulting in lower levels of such partners at synapses lacking SynCAM 1. Isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) mass spectrometry identified 24 proteins that increased above a 1.3-fold cutoff in SynCAM 1 KO synaptic plasma membranes compared with WT. These hits included neurexin 1, neuroligin 2, and EphA4, synapse-organizing proteins that may be increased to compensate for the loss of SynCAM 1. Conversely, nine proteins were reduced below a 0.7-fold cutoff in SynCAM 1 KO synapses. Among them, Farp1 was selected for further analysis because of the high degree of reduction by 54% approximated by mass spectrometry, and its domain organization. Farp1 contains a FERM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koyano et al., 1997</xref>) that is present in cytoskeletal regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoover and Bryant, 2000</xref>), together with Dbl oncogene homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains characteristic of GEFs that activate Rho family GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hart et al., 1994</xref>). We generated an antibody that recognizes Farp1 in immunoblotting (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201205041/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Quantitative analysis of hippocampal homogenates showed that Farp1 is reduced in SynCAM 1 KO mice by 79 Â± 22% (P = 0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), validating its proteomic identification.</p>

        <p>Farp1 promotes dendrite outgrowth in motor neurons of the chick spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhuang et al., 2009</xref>). However, the expression, interactions, and functions of Farp1 protein in the mammalian central nervous system were unknown. Immunoblotting showed that Farp1 is most prominent in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) and is expressed across brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). At postnatal day 13 (P13), when synapse formation in rat hippocampus is rapid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiala et al., 1998</xref>), Farp1 was found in synaptosomes and enriched in synaptic plasma membranes, cofractionating with SynCAM 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, lanes 4 and 6). Farp1 was present in Triton X-100âresistant fractions from synaptosomes, which is indicative of a cytoskeletal association, and a small fraction of Farp1 cofractionated with postsynaptic densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our antibody detected Farp1 when it was overexpressed in neurons (Fig. S1), but was not suitable for staining endogenous protein. To localize Farp1, we generated a full-length construct tagged at its amino terminus with GFP. In dissociated cultures of rat hippocampal neurons at 15 d in vitro (div), GFP-Farp1 was present in dendrites but not axons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201205041/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2</ext-link>). GFP-Farp1 was enriched at 12 div in most dendritic protrusions positive for the excitatory postsynaptic protein Shank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). GFP-Farp1âcontaining protrusions were additionally marked by the F-actin probe UtrCH-Cherry (utrophin calponin homology domain fused to Cherry; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkel et al., 2007</xref>), which we used as marker for spine heads, as they contain dense actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matus et al., 1982</xref>). These results show that Farp1 is a novel postsynaptic protein that is strongly reduced at synaptic membranes lacking SynCAM 1.</p>

        <title>SynCAM 1âFarp1 form a synaptic complex through a FERM domain interaction</title>
        <p>In hippocampal neurons, GFP-Farp1 was enriched in spine heads relative to the volume marker Cherry, and colocalized with endogenous SynCAM 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). In support of an interaction between SynCAM 1 and Farp1 at synapses and consistent with the rationale of our proteomic screen, Farp1 coimmunoprecipitated with SynCAM 1 from synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The high degree of sequence similarity of the cytosolic FERM domainâbinding motifs of SynCAMs 1â4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biederer, 2006</xref>) raised the possibility that Farp1 may bind more than one family member. However, affinity chromatography of forebrain extracts on GST fusions of different SynCAM cytosolic tails showed that Farp1 only binds to SynCAM 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). This agreed with the selective reduction of Farp1 measured by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting in mice lacking SynCAM 1 alone. Farp1 is the only known specific intracellular partner for SynCAM 1, in contrast to FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stagi et al., 2010</xref>), that binds both SynCAMs 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>).</p>

        <p>We mapped the interaction of SynCAM 1 and Farp1 using affinity chromatography of synaptosomal fractions. SynCAM 1/Farp1 binding was FERM domainâdependent, as a GST fusion of the cytosolic SynCAM 1 tail lacking five amino acids in the FERM motif did not bind Farp1 from brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>, lane 4). Reciprocally, a GST fusion of the Farp1 FERM domain was sufficient to retain synaptosomal SynCAM 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>).</p>
        <p>To assess whether SynCAM 1 can alter the subcellular localization of Farp1, we transfected HEK293 cells with GFP-Farp1 alone or with SynCAM 1. GFP-Farp1 expressed alone was present both in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane, to which it may be recruited through its PH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Line scan analysis showed that the fraction of GFP-Farp1 at the membrane perimeter relative to cytosol doubled in the presence of SynCAM 1 (200 Â± 25%, P &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>). Heterologous coexpression of SynCAM 1 did not alter the amount of overexpressed Farp1 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>). Together, these data support the fact that SynCAM 1 interacts with Farp1 at plasma membranes, presumably directly.</p>

        <title>Farp1 promotes filopodial dynamics and stability</title>
        <p>Farp1 is highly expressed in rat forebrain already at P1, i.e., before the peak of synaptogenesis, and remains elevated until P15, when SynCAM 1 increases synapse numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robbins et al., 2010</xref>). Farp1 continues to be expressed to a lower extent in adulthood. In developing neurons at 9 div, GFP-Farp1 was present in filopodia-like dendritic protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) that can be precursors to dendritic spines. We imaged live filopodia at 9 div over 30-min periods and quantified their properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201205041/DC1" id="supp3">Video 1</ext-link>). This was performed blind to the condition, as were all other measurements in this study. We compared Farp1 overexpression and knockdown, for which we used a short-hairpin construct (shFarp1) that reduced the amounts of Farp1 overexpressed in heterologous cells by 75 Â± 13% and in neurons by 68 Â± 2% (Fig. S1). Farp1 knockdown reduced the motility of dendritic filopodia compared with neurons expressing an shScramble control construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>; shScramble, 6.3 Â± 0.3 Âµm/30 min; shFarp1, 5.3 Â± 0.2; P = 0.007). This effect was rescued by coexpression of knockdown-resistant Farp1<sup>sh res</sup>, and the increase in motility under this condition was presumably caused by Farp1 expression above endogenous levels (shFarp1 + Farp1<sup>sh res</sup>, 7.5 Â± 0.4 Âµm/30 min; P = 0.03). Overexpressing Farp1 in the presence of endogenous protein further elevated filopodial motility (Farp1<sup>sh res</sup>, 8.9 Â± 0.5 Âµm/30 min; P &lt; 0.0001).</p>

        <title>Farp1 regulates excitatory synapse number and acts downstream of SynCAM 1</title>
        <p>The regulation of filopodia in early development may affect the later formation of synapses. Consistent with synaptic functions, GFP-Farp1 is present in dendritic spine heads at 14 and 21 div (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Spines in these cultures are apposed to presynaptic sites with recycling vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogel et al., 2007</xref>), allowing for the approximation of spines as sites of excitatory synapses. Knockdown of Farp1 in neurons significantly lowered mushroom spine density at 21 div compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>; shScramble control, 5.4 Â± 0.3 mushroom spines per 10 Âµm; shFarp1, 2.9 Â± 0.2; P &lt; 0.0001). This decrease was rescued by coexpression of Farp1<sup>sh resist</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201205041/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Knockdown of Farp1 did not alter spine length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>), and we observed no effect of reduced Farp1 on stubby or thin spine densities in dissociated neurons.</p>

        <p>We hypothesized that SynCAM 1 promotes synapse formation through its partner Farp1, and tested this by coexpressing SynCAM 1 with shScramble or shFarp1. As expected, SynCAM 1 overexpression significantly increased mushroom spine density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>; SynCAM 1 + shScramble, 6.7 Â± 0.5 per 10 Âµm; P = 0.017). Importantly, neurons that overexpressed SynCAM 1 while Farp1 was knocked down showed the same low spine density as neurons expressing shFarp1 alone (SynCAM 1 + shFarp1, 3.0 Â± 0.2 per 10 Âµm). Thus, endogenous Farp1 regulates spine number, and SynCAM 1 requires Farp1 to increase spine density.</p>
        <p>Does Farp1 also regulate synapse numbers in an intact environment corresponding to the packing of neuropil in vivo? We investigated this in organotypic slice cultures, which maintain hippocampal connectivity while allowing the manipulation of protein expression in individual neurons. Slices were prepared from rat pups at P4/5 and biolistically transfected with shScramble or shFarp1 at 10 div. 4 d after transfection, we analyzed dendritic spines of pyramidal CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, E and F</xref>). Knockdown of Farp1 prominently decreased the density of mushroom spines by 52 Â± 3.8% (P &lt; 0.001), stubby spines by 56 Â± 2.5% (P &lt; 0.01), and thin spines by 47 Â± 3.8% (P &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>), resulting in 52 Â± 5.0% fewer total spines (P = 0.0001). The density of the less abundant stubby and thin spines was lowered by Farp1 knockdown in slice cultures, but not in dissociated neurons. This may indicate that physical constraints in tissue affect synapse development, and that the loss of synaptogenic proteins such as Farp1 could render thin and stubby spines in slice cultures less resilient and hence more unstable than in dissociated neurons. Together, these results support the fact that Farp1 is required for normal synapse numbers in CA1 neurons.</p>

        <title>Farp1 rescues synapse loss in SynCAM 1 KO neurons</title>
        <p>Is Farp1 sufficient to promote mature synapse numbers? Immunostaining for the excitatory presynaptic markers VGlut1/2 at 14 div showed that dendrites of dissociated rat neurons overexpressing GFP-Farp1 had 35 Â± 11% more presynaptic sites compared with controls expressing myristoylated GFP (GFP<sup>myr</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>; GFP<sup>myr</sup>, 5.8 Â± 0.30 VGlut puncta per 10 Âµm; GFP-Farp1, 7.8 Â± 0.53; P = 0.0016). The VGlut puncta area was unaffected by Farp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). GFP-Farp1 also increased mushroom spine numbers later in development, as determined in Cherry-filled WT mouse neurons at 21 div (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, left two panels; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>; Cherry, 5.3 Â± 0.4 mushroom spines per 10 Âµm; Cherry + GFP-Farp1, 7.0 Â± 0.6; P = 0.02). This was associated with increases in the density of stubby (Cherry, 1.1 Â± 0.1 per 10 Âµm; Cherry + GFP-Farp1, 1.6 Â± 0.2; P = 0.02) and thin spines (Cherry, 0.27 Â± 0.07; Cherry + GFP-Farp1, 0.95 Â± 0.22; P = 0.005). Farp1 selectively promoted mushroom spine density in dissociated rat neurons, leaving stubby and thin spine numbers unaltered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201205041/DC1" id="supp5">Fig. S4</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>We next asked whether Farp1 rescues spine density in SynCAM 1 mouse KO neurons, consistent with a role downstream of SynCAM 1. Neurons were transfected with Cherry to count spines, and KO cultures were prepared from littermates in parallel to the WT cultures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>. As expected, KO neurons had fewer mushroom spines than WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, right two panels; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>; KO + Cherry, 3.4 Â± 0.19 spines per 10 Âµm, P &lt; 0.0001).

KO neurons overexpressing GFP-Farp1 formed fewer spines than WT neurons expressing GFP-Farp1 (P = 0.02), which indicates that SynCAM 1 contributes to the ability of Farp1 to promote spine numbers.</p>
        <p>Morphological analysis showed that GFP-Farp1 increased spine length independently of SynCAM 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>; WT, 1.22 Â± 0.04 Âµm; WT + GFP-Farp1, 1.71 Â± 0.05, P &lt; 0.0001; KO + GFP-Farp1, 1.66 Â± 0.04, P = 0.009). SynCAM 1 loss also moderately increased spine length (KO, 1.40 Â± 0.10, P = 0.03). These results support the finding that SynCAM 1 and Farp1 share synaptogenic functions, yet have distinct roles in shaping spines.</p>

        <title>Presynaptic active zones are organized by transsynaptic Farp1 signaling via SynCAM 1</title>
        <p>As postsynaptic Farp1 expression promotes presynaptic terminal number, we tested to what extent Farp1/SynCAM 1 signaling may act across the synaptic cleft to regulate presynaptic composition. We measured the effects of altering postsynaptic Farp1 expression on presynaptic terminals by staining hippocampal neurons for the active zone marker bassoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

        <p>Knockdown of Farp1 in dendrites additionally decreased the immunostaining intensity of the remaining apposed bassoon puncta by 29 Â± 2% compared with GFP controls (P &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). In turn, overexpression of GFP-Farp1 increased the intensity of bassoon puncta by 18 Â± 2% (P &lt; 0.0001). To assess contributions of SynCAM 1, we used a construct of its Ig2+Ig3 domains linked to the membrane surface via a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that interferes with lateral SynCAM 1 assembly in cis and reduces transsynaptic adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fogel et al., 2011</xref>). It lacks the tail of SynCAM 1 and its effects are therefore independent of cytosolic partners. Notably, coexpression of Ig2+Ig3-GPI impaired the ability of elevated Farp1 to promote presynaptic bassoon staining intensity above controls (P &lt; 0.0001). Farp1 still increased bassoon intensity in neurons expressing Ig2+Ig3-GPI, albeit moderately, which may have been caused by incomplete disruption of SynCAM assembly. We addressed this next in SynCAM 1 KO neurons.</p>
        <p>We analyzed transsynaptic roles of Farp1 in hippocampal neurons cultured from SynCAM 1 WT and KO littermate mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Studying bassoon puncta density first, we observed that the postsynaptic overexpression of Farp1 in WT neurons increased the number of bassoon puncta by 55 Â± 16%, as expected (WT + GFP, 3.70 Â± 0.24 puncta per 10 Âµm; WT + GFP-Farp1, 5.72 Â± 0.55; P = 0.0013). KO neurons had fewer bassoon puncta (KO + GFP, 3.03 Â± 0.21 puncta per 10 Âµm, P &lt; 0.05), and elevating Farp1 in SynCAM 1 KO neurons increased bassoon puncta density above control KO neurons by 71 Â± 15% (KO + GFP-Farp1, 5.20 Â± 0.39, P &lt; 0.001). This effect indicates that overexpressed Farp1 can engage SynCAM 1âindependent pathways to promote synapse numbers. Measuring the intensity of bassoon puncta next (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>), we determined that Farp1 overexpression in postsynaptic WT neurons promoted this parameter by 27 Â± 6% (P &lt; 0.0001), as expected. Importantly, Farp1 required SynCAM 1 to promote bassoon puncta intensity, as Farp1 overexpression in SynCAM 1 KO neurons failed to alter bassoon signals.</p>
        <p>Together, these results support the finding that postsynaptic Farp1 can modulate the composition of presynaptic active zones. The lateral assembly of SynCAM 1 in dendritic membranes contributes to this transsynaptic signaling by Farp1. Notably, SynCAM 1 is required for the ability of postsynaptic Farp1 to increase presynaptic bassoon intensity across the cleft.</p>

        <title>Farp1 activates the GTPase Rac1 at synapses</title>
        <p>Aiming to define the mechanism of postsynaptic Farp1, we were guided by the presence of DH-PH domains that indicated a role as a GEF for a Rho family GTPase. To test whether Farp1 interacts with RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42, the best-characterized GTPases in spines, we performed affinity chromatography on empty nucleotide mutants of these enzymes that retain activating GEFs more strongly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">GarcÃ­a-Mata et al., 2006</xref>). Heterologously expressed Farp1 was retained on Rac1-containing beads but not on RhoA or Cdc42, which indicates that Farp1 may selectively activate Rac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). This interaction is indeed functionally relevant, as HEK293 cells expressing Farp1 contained twice the amount of active GTP-Rac1 compared with control cells (200 Â± 47%, P = 0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Expression of Farp1 in these cells had no effect on total Rac1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>). Because Rac1 promotes spine numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>), the ability of Farp1 to activate Rac1 agrees with a shared role of both proteins in promoting spines.</p>

        <p>To determine whether Farp1 directly regulates local Rac1 activity at synapses, we imaged live neurons expressing the optical probe Raichu-Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Itoh et al., 2002</xref>). This FRET-based probe contains a Rac1 GTPase sequence proximal to a binding domain for Rac1-GTP flanked by YFP and CFP, allowing the measurement of Rac1 activity as the YFP/CFP ratio. We imaged Rac1 activity live at 9 div in dendritic protrusions. Signals were normalized for each protrusion to Rac1 activity along the adjacent dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Farp1 knockdown decreased postsynaptic Rac1 activity by 20 Â± 3% (P &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). Other activators of Rac1 in spines therefore fail to fully compensate for a reduction in Farp1. In turn, Farp1 overexpression increased synaptic Rac1 activity significantly by 31 Â± 3% (P &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>). Co-expression of SynCAM 1 Ig2+Ig3-GPI with Farp1 abrogated the ability of Farp1 to activate Rac1, which indicates that Farp1 requires interactions with SynCAM 1 clusters that are laterally assembled in dendritic membranes to activate Rac1.</p>
        <p>As Farp1 can activate Rac1, the reduction of Farp1 in SynCAM 1 KO brains may result in lower levels of active Rac1. We biochemically measured this in hippocampal homogenates of SynCAM 1 KO and WT littermates. Because of loss of Rac1 activity over time, activity levels could only be analyzed in freshly prepared hippocampal homogenates, but not in subcellular fractions. Measurements were performed at P13, when Farp1 is abundant in WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and synaptogenesis is high. SynCAM 1 KO mice showed a modest but significant 12 Â± 4% reduction in the specific activity of Rac1 compared with WT littermates (P = 0.010), whereas total Rac1 levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, E and F</xref>). Rac1 signaling is therefore impaired in the brains of SynCAM 1 KO mice, concurrent with a reduction of Farp1.</p>

We quantified amounts of F-actin in spines by measuring UtrCH-Cherry fluorescence intensity within the center of spine heads and normalized each measurement to the probe signal along the adjacent dendritic shaft. Spines of neurons expressing GFP-Farp1 showed 36 Â± 5% higher UtrCH-Cherry intensity (P &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>), which is consistent with an increase in F-actin by postsynaptic Farp1.</p>

        <p>To determine whether this may result from increased actin polymerization, we treated GFP<sup>myr</sup>- or GFP-Farp1âexpressing neurons for 24 h with 2.5 ÂµM Latrunculin A (Lat-A), a drug that leads to actin depolymerization. Lat-A treatment decreased spine F-actin in both GFP<sup>myr</sup>- and GFP-Farp1âexpressing neurons, reducing UtrCH-Cherry intensity by 47 Â± 6% and 63 Â± 10%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>). Lat-A reduced F-actin to the same low level in both conditions, which indicates that Farp1 does not alter actin depolymerization. 2 h after washout of Lat-A, GFP-Farp1âexpressing neurons exhibited a strong 199 Â± 8% increase of UtrCH-Cherry fluorescence in spines, completely recovering their high baseline level. Control neurons expressing GFP<sup>myr</sup> showed only a 66 Â± 6% increase in F-actin in the same period.

      <p>Our proteomic analysis of SynCAM 1 KO synapses led us to identify and characterize Farp1 as a novel postsynaptic protein that signals during concerted steps of excitatory synapse development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). In immature neurons, Farp1 regulates filopodial dynamics. At later stages, Farp1 localizes to dendritic spines, where it activates the GTPase Rac1 and promotes actin assembly. Moreover, postsynaptic Farp1 contributes to the control of excitatory synapse density and signals across the synaptic cleft to modulate active zone composition. Two effects of Farp1 may enable it to promote synapse number. On the one hand, the Farp1-mediated increase in filopodial dynamics and lifetime may make axo-dendritic contacts more frequent. This could culminate in a conversion of filopodia to spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kayser et al., 2008</xref>), although this model is a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2004</xref>). On the other hand, Farp1 elevates Rac1 activity and F-actin assembly in mature spines, molecular changes that can increase synapse numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang and Benson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zito et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

      <p>Interplay of Farp1 with SynCAM 1 in vivo is indicated by our findings that Farp1 is strongly reduced at SynCAM 1 KO synapses and that both proteins form a synaptic complex. In agreement, SynCAM 1 requires Farp1 to drive synaptogenesis, which elucidates the first synaptic signaling mechanism of SynCAMs. Farp1 additionally rescues the lower synapse density in SynCAM 1 KO neurons, which is consistent with acting downstream of SynCAM 1. Moreover, the functions of Farp1 as GEF for spine Rac1 and in transsynaptic signaling involve the assembly of SynCAM complexes in dendritic membranes. The reduction in Farp1-driven spine formation in the absence of SynCAM 1 may point to roles of SynCAM 1 in activating Farp1, although molecular evidence for this is not yet available.</p>
      <p>Although endogenous Farp1 is less abundant at SynCAM 1 KO synapses, and the extent to which Farp1 increases spine number is lower in the absence of SynCAM 1, additional proteins likely cooperate with Farp1 to promote synapse density, at least in the absence of SynCAM 1. One candidate binding partner is Plexin A4, with which Farp1 interacts in the chick spinal cord to promote dendritic outgrowth of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhuang et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, the brains of mice lacking Plexins A3 or A4 have increased spine numbers and larger spines, supporting roles of Plexin signaling in restricting synapse number and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2009</xref>). As Farp1 has opposite functions, it appears unlikely to operate in a synapse-organizing Plexin A4 pathway. Additional evidence for SynCAM-independent functions of Farp1 is provided by our finding that elevating Farp1 and losing SynCAM 1 both result in increased spine length. Future studies can now identify additional upstream partners of Farp1 in mammalian neurons.</p>
      <p>Farp1-regulated GTPase signaling may converge with other postsynaptic pathways. Notably, Ephrin B receptors signal through Tiam1 and Kalirin-7, GEFs for Rac1, to promote synapse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penzes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tolias et al., 2007</xref>), and may act in concert with N-cadherins to regulate Rho family GTPases in spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xie et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, the activity-dependent remodeling of spines is regulated by the GEF Epac2, which binds neuroligin and activates the Ras-like GTPase Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woolfrey et al., 2009</xref>). Spine number and Rac1 activity are also modulated by the GEF Î±-PIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). These findings support the idea that GTPases and Rac1 in particular play central roles in synaptic differentiation and can act downstream of synapse-organizing adhesion proteins. This agrees with aberrations of synaptic adhesion molecules and GTPase signaling in developmental and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Govek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">SÃ¼dhof, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Penzes et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, a chromosomal microdeletion that includes the <italic>FARP1</italic> gene is also linked to mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amor et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our data indicate that Farp1 plays a significant role in activating spine Rac1, as other GEFs do not fully compensate once Farp1 is knocked down. Our study also reveals an unexpected regulatory mechanism of a GEF: Farp1 depends on the lateral assembly of SynCAM 1 in postsynaptic membranes to activate Rac1. This agrees with the notion that the clustering of signaling molecules into modular domains can underlie their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Groves and Kuriyan, 2010</xref>). Subspine domains where SynCAM 1 forms adhesion complexes may therefore be sites of preferential Farp1/Rac1 activation.</p>
      <p>Because SynCAM 1 can induce synapses through its interactions across the synaptic cleft, we analyzed effects of Farp1 on presynaptic organization. Our results show that postsynaptic Farp1 promotes bassoon puncta intensity only when SynCAM 1 is present. Additionally, Farp1 depends on lateral SynCAM clustering in dendritic membranes to act across the cleft. This provides evidence that SynCAM 1 and Farp1 cooperate to signal retrogradely. SynCAM 1/Farp1 signaling across the synaptic cleft may contribute to the shortening of the presynaptic active zone that occurs in SynCAM 1 KO brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robbins et al., 2010</xref>). The transsynaptic role of postsynaptic Farp1 is reminiscent of the effects of PSD-95 and SAP-97 on presynaptic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Husseini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Regalado et al., 2006</xref>), with PSD-95 acting via neuroligin 1 to also regulate presynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Futai et al., 2007</xref>). Postsynaptic neuroligin 1 further promotes the maturation of presynaptic vesicle release and active zone stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wittenmayer et al., 2009</xref>). These retrograde effects may complement the bidirectional signaling of ephrins and their Eph receptors across synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein, 2009</xref>) and the roles of glutamate receptors in presynaptic maturation and homeostasis (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindskog et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tracy et al., 2011</xref>). The interaction of postsynaptic SynCAM 1 and Farp1 in organizing presynaptic terminals described here presents a novel function for a GTPase regulator.</p>
      <p>Last, the molecular complexity of SynCAMs, with all four family members expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>), raises the question of how this diversity may impact synaptic signaling. Only SynCAM 1 binds Farp1, and postsynaptic sites can contain both SynCAM 1 (this paper) and SynCAM 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shu et al., 2011</xref>). Synaptic signaling could hence be regulated by differential SynCAM expression across postsynaptic sites, enabling those spines that contain SynCAM 1 to engage Farp1 for regulating their cytoskeleton and signaling across the cleft. With respect to nonsynaptic roles of Farp1, it can now also be tested to what extent SynCAM 1 contributes to Farp1 function in dendritic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhuang et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Together, this study reveals Farp1 as a postsynaptic signaling protein that binds SynCAM 1 to instruct and integrate excitatory synapse development.</p>

        <title>Microscopy and analysis</title>
        <p>Imaging of fixed and live samples was performed on a spinning disk microscope (UltraView VoX; Perkin-Elmer) equipped with a camera (C9100-50; Hamamatsu Photonics) and an autofocus system (Perfect Focus; Nikon) unless noted otherwise. Fluorochromes imaged include GFP (488 nm), mCherry (568 nm), and Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen). Unless otherwise stated, images were acquired with a 60Ã oil Plan-Apochromat VC lens (Nikon) with 1.4 NA. Live imaging of neurons plated on glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation) was performed in modified Tyrode buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biederer and Scheiffele, 2007</xref>) on a stage heated to 37Â°C.</p>
        <p>Imaging of live neurons expressing the Raichu-Rac1 probe were performed on a confocal microscope (LSM710; Carl Zeiss) equipped with an argon laser (Lasos; Lasertechnik GmbH) and acquired with Zen 2010 software (Carl Zeiss). Images were acquired using a 63Ã oil Plan-Apochromat lens with 1.4 NA (Carl Zeiss). Raichu-Rac1 imaging was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Itoh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>). In brief, CFP was excited at 458 nm, and z stacks were obtained alternately in both CFP (465â515 nm) and YFP (520â650 nm) channels, and collapsed into 2D images. Local Rac1 activity was measured as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of YFP to the intensity of CFP, and regions of interest were selected in dendritic protrusions versus the adjacent shaft. Care was taken to minimize variation in exposure time, laser power, and gain between conditions and experiments. For imaging of fixed neuronal cultures, z stacks of neurons and dendrites were taken and collapsed into 2D frames for analysis.</p>
        <p>Spine fluorescence intensities of UtrCH-Cherry were normalized to the average UtrCH-Cherry fluorescence intensity measured in three areas along the dendritic shaft adjacent to each analyzed spine. UtrCH-Cherry was imaged live throughout this study as the signal tended to fade after fixation.</p>
        <p>Analyses of spine density and morphology, VGlut1 and -2 puncta density, and bassoon puncta density were performed using ImageJ. Analyses of bassoon puncta intensity, line scans of protein distribution in HEK293 cells, tracking of live dendritic filopodia over time, fluorescence intensity measurements of the UtrCH-Cherry probe, and the ratiometric analysis of the Raichu-Rac1 probe were performed using Volocity (PerkinElmer).</p>

        <title>Data and statistical analysis</title>
        <p>All imaging data acquisitions for quantitated analyses and their quantitation were performed with the researcher blind to the conditions. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (Graph Pad Software) and MATLAB (MathWorks). Statistical analyses were performed as indicated using either a Studentâs <italic>t</italic> test with errors corresponding to the standard error of the mean or the DâAgostino and Pearson normality test. *, <italic>t</italic> test P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01; ***, P &lt; 0.001.</p>

        <p>Fig. S1 demonstrates the efficiency of Farp1 knockdown by the shFarp1 versus the shScramble construct, and rescue of Farp1 knockdown by Farp1<sup>sh resist</sup> (in HEK293 cells, Fig. S1 A; in cultured neurons, Fig. S1, B and C). Fig. S2 shows the subcellular localization of Farp1 in dendrites stained with MAP2 and the absence of Farp1 in tau-stained axons. Fig. S3 complements <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> and confirms that overexpression of Farp1<sup>sh resist</sup> rescues spine loss after Farp1 knockdown in cultured neurons. Fig. S4 complements <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> by demonstrating that overexpression of GFP-Farp1 in rat hippocampal neurons increases dendritic mushroom spine number. Video 1 shows time lapse videos of live neurons expressing shScramble control vector, shFarp1, or shFarp1 + Farp1<sup>sh resist</sup> as analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>.
