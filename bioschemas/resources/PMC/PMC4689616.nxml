      <title>Introductory Paragraph</title>
      <p id="P1">Genetic defects in myelin formation and maintenance cause leukodystrophies, a group of white matter diseases whose mechanistic underpinnings are poorly understood<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Hypomyelination and Congenital Cataract (HCC), one of these disorders, is caused by mutations in <italic>FAM126A</italic>, a gene of unknown function<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. We show that FAM126A/Hyccin regulates the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a determinant of plasma membrane identity<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. HCC patient fibroblasts exhibit reduced PI4P levels. FAM126A is an intrinsic component of the plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase complex that comprises PI4KIIIÎ± and its adaptors TTC7 and EFR3<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. A FAM126AâTTC7 co-crystal structure reveals an all-Î±-helical heterodimer with a large protein-protein interface and a conserved surface that may mediate binding to PI4KIIIÎ±. Absence of FAM126A, the predominant FAM126 isoform in oligodendrocytes, destabilizes the PI4KIIIÎ± complex in mouse brain and patient fibroblasts. We propose that HCC pathogenesis involves defects in PI4P production in oligodendrocytes, whose specialized function requires massive plasma membrane expansion and thus generation of PI4P and downstream phosphoinositides<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Our results point to a role of FAM126A in supporting myelination, an important process in development and also following acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p>

      <title>Main Text</title>
      <p id="P2">Phosphoinositides (PIPs) are low abundance anionic membrane phospholipids that play critical roles in many physiological processes<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. At the plasma membrane, a major PIP is PI4P, which has direct signaling roles and in addition serves as the precursor of two other plasma membrane-enriched PIPs with major signaling functions in this membrane, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub><sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, these lipids regulate several steps in the biogenesis and maintenance of myelin, including the recruitment of myelin basic protein (MBP) to the plasma membrane by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and the promotion of myelin growth by PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub><sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P3">Phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) to generate PI4P at the plasma membrane is mediated by PI 4-kinase Type IIIÎ± (PI4KIIIÎ±, Stt4 in yeast)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The properties, targeting mechanisms and regulation of this enzyme have only recently come into focus. Two factors required for its localization at the plasma membrane have been described<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and structurally characterized<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>: EFR3 and TTC7 (Efr3 and Ypp1 in yeast).</p>
      <p id="P4">To identify additional regulators of PI4KIIIÎ±, we used quantitative interaction proteomics. We immunoprecipitated either stably expressed TTC7B-GFP or GFP, followed by protease digestion and mass spectrometry analysis, to identify candidate TTC7B-binding proteins (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These experiments identified the known TTC7B interaction partners PI4KIIIÎ±, EFR3A, and EFR3B. Among the other hits, two of the most significantly enriched candidates were the paralogous FAM126A/hyccin and FAM126B, both of which were also identified in similar experiments using EFR3A-GFP or EFR3B-GFP as the bait (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P5">Mutations in <italic>FAM126A</italic> that lead to loss of the FAM126A/hyccin protein cause a recessive leukoencephalopathy termed Hypomyelination and Congenital Cataract (HCC)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Manifestations of this condition, which include progressive neurological impairment, mild to moderate cognitive defects, and peripheral neuropathy, stem from hypomyelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. No molecular functions or activities have been ascribed to FAM126A, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms of HCC pathogenesis are unknown. Thus, the identification of FAM126A as a potential interaction partner of TTC7 and EFR3 led us to investigate its role in PI4KIIIÎ± complex formation and function as a first step toward understanding whether defects in phosphoinositide metabolism may cause HCC pathology.</p>
      <p id="P6">We first explored and confirmed the interaction of FAM126A with TTC7, and more generally its association with the PI4KIIIÎ± complex, in co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot experiments (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Two FAM126A immunoreactive species (58 and 47 kD) were enriched in TTC7B-GFP immunoprecipitates, corresponding to two predicted splice forms of FAM126A (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Accordingly, these two bands are absent in tissues from FAM126A knockout mice (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Given that the longer, 58 kD band represents the major form in mammalian brain (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), we chose to focus on it in our subsequent studies. We then performed a reciprocal proteomics experiment using FAM126A-GFP-expressing cells to assess whether PI4KIIIÎ±, TTC7, and EFR3 are the major interaction partners of FAM126A. Indeed, all of these proteins were the strongest hits in analogous quantitative proteomics experiments (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and were highly enriched in immunoblot analysis of FAM126A-GFP immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P7">Examination of the primary amino acid sequence of FAM126A revealed a highly conserved, structured N-terminal portion (FAM126A-N, residues 1â289) common to both splice forms and a poorly conserved C-terminal tail predicted to be disordered (FAM126A-C, residues 290â521) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments of GFP-tagged full-length FAM126A, FAM126A-N, or FAM126A-C with differentially tagged PI4KIIIÎ±, TTC7B, and EFR3B revealed an interaction of all of these components with full-length FAM126A and FAM126A-N (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Note that the apparent more robust interaction of these proteins with FAM126A-N than with full-length FAM126A (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, lanes 6 and 7) reflects higher levels of FAM126A-N in the total lysate. Interestingly, overexpression of FAM126A-N led to a marked increase in levels of transfected TTC7B in total lysate (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, lane 3), suggesting a stabilizing interaction between these two proteins, as further confirmed by experiments described below.</p>
      <p id="P8">We next examined whether, as would be expected for a direct TTC7 interactor<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, FAM126A-N localizes to the plasma membrane when co-expressed with other PI4KIIIÎ± complex subunits. Using confocal microscopy, we found that GFP-tagged FAM126A-N and full-length FAM126A were localized to the cytosol in HeLa and COS-7 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). While co-expression of FAM126A-N with EFR3B, the membrane anchor for the PI4KIIIÎ± complex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, bottom), did not change the FAM126A-N localization (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), co-expression of FAM126A-N or full-length FAM126A with both EFR3B and TTC7B resulted in a relocalization of FAM126A to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Further, co-expression of FAM126A-N, TTC7B, EFR3B, and PI4KIIIÎ± resulted in colocalization of all four proteins at the plasma membrane in a manner that was dependent on the presence of TTC7B (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>). Omission of EFR3B revealed a cytosolic colocalization (but nuclear exclusion) of TTC7B, FAM126A-N, and PI4KIIIÎ± (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Collectively, these data argue for a central role of TTC7B not only in bridging PI4KIIIÎ± to EFR3B, the plasma membrane anchor, as reported previously<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, but also in mediating the association of FAM126A to the plasma membrane, consistent with a direct interaction.</p>
      <p id="P9">The localization experiments did not, however, allow us to conclusively determine whether, at the plasma membrane, FAM126A and PI4KIIIÎ± can bind to TTC7B simultaneously, or, alternatively, whether FAM126A competes with PI4KIIIÎ± for binding to TTC7B. To address this issue, we first confirmed the direct interaction between FAM126A-N and TTC7B by co-expression of the proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> and analysis of the resulting complex by size-exclusion chromatography (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The two proteins co-eluted as a heterodimer. Importantly, protein-protein interaction experiments with purified proteins showed that the TTC7B/FAM126A-N subcomplex interacts directly with PI4KIIIÎ± (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), ruling out a competition between FAM126A and PI4KIIIÎ± for TTC7 binding.</p>
      <p id="P10">Given that the TTC7B/FAM126A-N heterodimer bound tightly to PI4KIIIÎ±, we next examined the effects of each of these proteins on the catalytic activity of PI4KIIIÎ±. We purified wild-type or kinase-dead PI4KIIIÎ± alone or in complex with either TTC7B only or both TTC7B and FAM126A-N (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>) and assessed the relative kinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> by monitoring the formation of PI4P from phosphatidylinositol in the presence of Î³<sup>32</sup>P-labeled ATP. The PI4KIIIÎ±/TTC7B complex was about twice as enzymatically active as PI4KIIIÎ± only, and the PI4KIIIÎ±/TTC7B/FAM126A-N ternary complex was roughly five-fold more active (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Thus both TTC7B and FAM126A appear to play a role in stabilizing the PI4KIIIÎ± fold and/or stimulating the intrinsic enzymatic activity of the kinase.</p>
      <p id="P11">To obtain further insights into the role of FAM126A in the kinase complex, we determined the crystal structure of the TTC7B/FAM126A-N dimer at 2.9 Ã resolution (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Both proteins are almost entirely alpha-helical. In TTC7B, as in its yeast homolog Ypp1<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> (PDBID 4N5C), the alpha helices are arranged into a superhelix, with the very C-terminal peptide inserted into the center of the superhelix (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). FAM126A-N is globular, except for a long hairpin (residues 121â165) that extends out and wraps around TTC7B (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The proteins interact via an unusually large interface (~6000 Ã<sup>2</sup> total occluded surface area, where &gt;2000 Ã<sup>2</sup> is considered large), indicative of a high-affinity, stable interaction as would be expected if FAM126A is an intrinsic part of the kinase complex (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P12">Interestingly, while the interacting surfaces in both proteins are well conserved in metazoans (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), the FAM126A-interacting surface of TTC7B is not conserved in fungi (including in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ypp1)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, we have not been able to identify a fungal FAM126A homolog, and it is possible that FAM126 is not conserved across eukaryotic evolution but is a modification to the PI4KIIIÎ± system present in higher eukaryotes only. Nevertheless, the overall organization of EFR3, TTC7 and PI4KIIIÎ± within the complex is most likely conserved (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, as the yeast homolog of TTC7 interacts with the kinase via conserved surfaces in the C-terminal lobe<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, we hypothesize that mammalian TTC7 interacts with PI4KIIIÎ± in a similar way. We note that in the TTC7B/FAM126A-N subcomplex there is a conserved surface comprising the C-terminal portion of TTC7B and adjoining FAM126A residues, and we propose that these surfaces together form the binding site for PI4KIIIÎ± in mammals (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P13">The structural data suggest a stabilizing function for FAM126A in the PI4KIIIÎ± complex. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the levels of PI4KIIIÎ± complex components in primary human skin fibroblasts from five HCC patients that are homozygous for either nonsense or missense mutations in <italic>FAM126A</italic><sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Cells from patients with nonsense mutations were completely devoid of the FAM126A/hyccin protein (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, lanes 3, 5, and 7), and cells from patients with missense mutations (L53P and C57R, see <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>) exhibited greatly reduced levels of FAM126A (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, lanes 4 and 6), consistent with the misfolding and near-complete degradation of FAM126A in these cells. Indeed, immunoblot analysis revealed decreases in the levels of PI4KIIIÎ± and its adaptors TTC7A, TTC7B, and EFR3A (EFR3B was not detectable in the fibroblasts) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), suggesting a general destabilization and degradation of the PI4KIIIÎ± complex components in the absence of FAM126A. Accordingly, reintroduction of GFP-tagged FAM126A into the patient fibroblasts using a lentiviral vector partially rescued this phenotype (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). While a compensatory increase in FAM126B, a paralog of FAM126A, was also observed in patient fibroblasts (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), the approximately 10-fold lower expression of FAM126B mRNA in fibroblasts (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>) may explain why this increase is not sufficient to compensate for lack of FAM126A.</p>
      <p id="P14">HPLC analysis of total phosphoinositide content revealed a decrease in total cellular PI4P in HCC fibroblasts relative to control fibroblasts (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), and a specific decrease of the plasma membrane fraction of PI4P in HCC fibroblasts relative to control fibroblasts was confirmed by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, FAM126A loss specifically affects PI4KIIIÎ± complex assembly and PI4KIIIÎ±-mediated PI4P synthesis at the plasma membrane.</p>
      <p id="P15">Global knockout (KO) of PI4KIIIÎ± in several model organisms leads to lethality<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, while loss of FAM126A is permissive of life, although it causes defects in myelination in humans, leading to HCC<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. To investigate the potential role of FAM126A in promoting PI4KIIIÎ± function in myelination, we compared the expression levels of PI4KIIIÎ± complex subunits in mouse primary cortical neurons and oligodendrocytes. We found that FAM126A was expressed in both oligodendrocytes and neurons, while its paralog FAM126B was expressed at much lower levels in oligodendrocytes relative to neurons (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Thus, in principle, a global loss of FAM126A could, in the brain, be more effectively compensated by FAM126B in neurons than in oligodendrocytes and thus more severely affect PI4KIIIÎ± function in the latter cell type.</p>
      <p id="P16">To support this possibility, we evaluated the levels of PI4KIIIÎ± complex components in brain tissue from FAM126A KO mice<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Although these mice do not exhibit an obvious abnormal phenotype or specific defects in myelination as evaluated by light and electron microscopy analysis (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), immunoblot analysis of lysates from total brain and optic nerve (a pure white matter tract) revealed a selective decrease of TTC7A and EFR3A relative to wild-type (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>,and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). These are the isoforms of TTC7 and EFR3 whose levels are more highly expressed in oligodendrocytes relative to neurons, compared to their respective paralogs TTC7B and EFR3B (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P17">These results are further supported by immunoblot analysis of cellular fractions of different lineages that were generated from dissociated brain tissue by affinity purification from WT and FAM126A KO mice. Notably, there was a more pronounced decrease in PI4KIIIÎ±, EFR3A/B, and TTC7A/B in cells of the oligodendroglial lineage compared to those of the neuronal lineage (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>). Taken together, these data connect FAM126A to PI4KIIIÎ± function in the nervous system and implicate the white matter as a region potentially susceptible to PI4KIIIÎ± dysfunction upon global loss of FAM126A, pointing to a mechanistic hypothesis for HCC disease pathogenesis. While it appears surprising that the lack of FAM126A in mice does not produce the neurological phenotype observed in humans, we note that the greater diameter of axons and thickness of the myelin sheath around such axons in humans implies a larger surface area of oligodendrocytes<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Thus, a greater demand on the machinery responsible for myelin biogenesis and maintenance in humans may explain their enhanced sensitivity to loss of FAM126A and impaired PI4P synthesis.</p>
      <p id="P18">Interestingly, FAM126A expression was reported to be repressed by activated Î²-catenin<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, and canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin/TCF signaling was recently shown to be a powerful negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, a step that precedes the massive plasma membrane biogenesis that occurs in myelination. Our data suggest that activation of PI4KIIIÎ± may be an important downstream consequence of the relief of Wnt/Î²-catenin/TCF signaling that occurs in oligodendrocyte development.</p>
      <p id="P19">In sum, our results demonstrate that FAM126A is an intrinsic component of the PI4KIIIÎ± complex and an important regulator of PI4P production at the plasma membrane, the first step in the synthesis of the bulk of the downstream PIPs PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. We further provide evidence for an important role of FAM126A/hyccin in oligodendrocytes, a cell type whose specialized function is to dramatically expand its plasma membrane. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is implicated in myelin compaction<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> helps drive myelin growth<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Collectively, our studies point to impaired production of these PIPs as a mechanism through which absence of FAM126A/hyccin results in a hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy in humans, and they demonstrate the critical importance of plasma membrane PIP homeostasis in myelin development and potentially<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> also in remyelination after myelin loss.</p>

The complex was first isolated using Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN). After elution, the His<sub>12</sub>-SUMO tag was cleaved off with SUMO protease. Protein was then bound to Glutathione-S-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare). Bound complex was eluted from the resin by cleavage with PreScission protease to remove the GST tags. Protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) in buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 8.0 at 22 Â°C), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP) and concentrated to 6 mg/mL. For protein-protein interaction experiments, GST-tagged FAM126A alone or complexed with TTC7B were isolated by Glutathione-S-Sepharose 4B resin and then eluted from the resin using glutathione. Protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) in buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP).
