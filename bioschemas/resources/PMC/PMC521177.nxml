        <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology is characterized by the degeneration of midbrain dopamine neurons (DNs) ultimately leading to a progressive movement disorder in patients. The etiology of DN loss in sporadic PD is unknown, although it is hypothesized that aberrant protein aggregation and cellular oxidative stress may promote DN degeneration.

In a companion article (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1" ref-type="bibr">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>), we show that mutations in DJ-1 alter the cellular response to oxidative stress and proteasomal inhibition. Here we show that DJ-1 functions as a redox-sensitive molecular chaperone that is activated in an oxidative cytoplasmic environment.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive movement disorder that is characterized pathologically by the relatively selective degeneration of midbrain DNs and the presence of prominent intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions, termed Lewy bodies (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Dauer1" ref-type="bibr">Dauer and Przedborski 2003</xref>). The identification of several genes that underlie familial forms of primary parkinsonism has allowed for the molecular dissection of mechanisms of dopamine neuron (DN) survival. Autosomal dominant mutations in Î±-synuclein (Î±Syn) lead to a rare familial form of primary Parkinsonism (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Polymeropoulos1" ref-type="bibr">Polymeropoulos et al. 1997</xref>), and there is evidence that these mutations generate toxic, abnormal protein aggregates (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Goldberg1" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg and Lansbury 2000</xref>) and proteasomal dysfunction (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Rideout1" ref-type="bibr">Rideout et al. 2001</xref>). Of note, Lewy body inclusions are particularly enriched for Î±Syn (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Spillantini2" ref-type="bibr">Spillantini et al. 1998</xref>) and neurofilament protein subunits (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Trojanowski1" ref-type="bibr">Trojanowski and Lee 1998</xref>). Mutations in a second gene, <italic>Parkin,</italic> lead to autosomal recessive primary Parkinsonism (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Hattori1" ref-type="bibr">Hattori et al. 2000</xref>). Parkin is a ubiquitin ligase that appears to participate in the proteasome-mediated degradation of several substrates (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Staropoli1" ref-type="bibr">Staropoli et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Homozygous mutations in a third gene, <italic>DJ-1,</italic> were recently associated with autosomal recessive primary Parkinsonism (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Bonifati1" ref-type="bibr">Bonifati et al. 2003</xref>). <italic>DJ-1</italic> encodes a ThiJ domain protein of 189 amino acids that is broadly expressed in mammalian tissues (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Nagakubo1" ref-type="bibr">Nagakubo et al. 1997</xref>). Interestingly, DJ-1 was independently identified in a screen for human endothelial cell proteins that are modified with respect to isoelectric point in response to sublethal doses of paraquat (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Mitsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">Mitsumoto and Nakagawa 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Mitsumoto2" ref-type="bibr">Mitsumoto et al. 2001</xref>), a toxin which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells and has been associated with DN toxicity (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-McCormack1" ref-type="bibr">McCormack et al. 2002</xref>). Gene expression of a yeast homolog of DJ-1, YDR533C, is upregulated in response to sorbic acid (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-de1" ref-type="bibr">de Nobel et al. 2001</xref>), an inducer of cellular oxidative stress. These data suggest a causal role for DJ-1 in the cellular oxidative stress response.</p>
      <p>ThiJ domain proteins are highly conserved and have been associated with several functions including protease and chaperone activities (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Halio1" ref-type="bibr">Halio et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Du1" ref-type="bibr">Du et al. 2000</xref>). The crystal structure of DJ-1 demonstrates the presence of a highly conserved nucleophile elbow-like domain at cysteine 106, but the relative position of this residue differs from that of a structurally related ThiJ protease, PH1704, and does not appear to be permissible for proton transfer and protease catalysis (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. 2003</xref>). Furthermore, DJ-1 forms an asymmetric homodimer with a prominent carboxy-terminal helical region present at the dimerization interface, which appears to limit access to the nucleophile elbow-like domain (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Huai1" ref-type="bibr">Huai et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Lee3" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>DJ-1 displays significant homology to the carboxy-terminal domain of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> HPII catalase, as both proteins are divergent members of the type I glutamine amidotransferase family. Interestingly, the carboxy-terminal DJ-1 homology domain of HPII catalase lacks catalase activity, but rather appears to function as a chaperone in the correct folding of the catalytic core of the protein, and in thermal enzyme stability (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Chelikani1" ref-type="bibr">Chelikani et al. 2003</xref>). <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Taira1" ref-type="bibr">Taira et al. (2004)</xref> recently reported that purified DJ-1 harbors catalase activity, and that overexpression of DJ-1 by transfection of neuroblastoma tumor cells inhibits the accumulation of ROS. In contrast, analysis of DJ-1-deficient cells (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1" ref-type="bibr">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>) revealed that such cells display an apparently normal initial accumulation of ROS, indicating that DJ-1 likely functions in a protective role downstream of ROS insult. Consistent with this, DJ-1-deficient cells are predisposed to apoptotic death in the context of oxidative stress (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1" ref-type="bibr">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here we demonstrate that DJ-1 functions as a redox-regulated molecular chaperone that is activated in an oxidizing environment. DJ-1 chaperone activity extends in vivo to Î±Syn, a protein that has been implicated in PD pathogenesis. DJ-1 activity is abrogated by the L166P mutation, associated with primary Parkinsonism, as a consequence of defective dimerization and reduced stability.</p>

        <p>DJ-1 homologs have been reported to harbor protease (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Halio1" ref-type="bibr">Halio et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Du1" ref-type="bibr">Du et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Lee3" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2003</xref>) and amidotransferase activities (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Horvath1" ref-type="bibr">Horvath and Grishin 2001</xref>). However, crystal structure analyses of DJ-1 suggest that this protein may not retain such catalytic activities (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Honbou1" ref-type="bibr">Honbou et al. 2003a</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Huai1" ref-type="bibr">Huai et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Lee3" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Tao1" ref-type="bibr">Tao and Tong 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. 2003</xref>). Consistent with this, purified DJ-1 preparations failed to display in vitro protease activity toward a variety of synthetic or natural substrates, and, similarly, DJ-1 lacked antioxidant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>) or catalase activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) in vitro. Furthermore, cells deficient in DJ-1 appear unaltered in the initial accumulation of ROS in the context of acute oxidative stress (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1" ref-type="bibr">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>).</p>

        <title>DJ-1 Is a Redox-Dependent Molecular Chaperone</title>
        <p>Every organism responds to ROS and other toxic environmental stresses by overexpressing a highly conserved set of heat shock proteins (Hsps), many of which function as molecular chaperones to assist other proteins in folding. Hsp31, an <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ThiJ domain protein<italic>,</italic> has been shown to function as a molecular chaperone in vitro (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Sastry1" ref-type="bibr">Sastry et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Malki1" ref-type="bibr">Malki et al. 2003</xref>). We hypothesized that DJ-1 may similarly function as a protein chaperone to protect cells from ROS. DJ-1 chaperone activity was quantified in the suppression of heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase (CS) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), two well-characterized protein chaperone assays. These proteins lose their native conformation and undergo aggregation during incubation at 43 Â°C and 60 Â°C, respectively. Addition of 0.5â4.0 Î¼M polyhistidine (His)-tagged DJ-1 was found to effectively suppress the heat-induced aggregation of 0.8 Î¼M CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The chaperone activity was independent of the His tag used for purification, as cleavage and removal of the His tag did not alter DJ-1 chaperone function (unpublished data). DJ-1 chaperone activity is comparable to that of a well-described small cytoplasmic chaperone, human Hsp27. In contrast, RNase A failed to demonstrate chaperone activity and served as a negative control. Interestingly, the Parkinsonism-associated L166P DJ-1 mutation abrogated chaperone activity relative to the wild-type (WT) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p>

        <p>DJ-1 similarly functioned as a molecular chaperone in the context of the heat-induced aggregation of GST (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, DJ-1 failed to display activity in a third chaperone assay, aggregation suppression of reduced insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Reduction of the disulfide bonds between the A and B chains of insulin with dithiothreitol (DTT) leads to aggregation of the B chains. Hsp27 effectively inhibited the aggregation of insulin in the presence of 20 mM DTT, whereas neither DJ-1 nor the negative control protein RNase A displayed chaperone activity in this assay. As the insulin aggregation assay is performed in a reduced environment, we hypothesized that DJ-1 chaperone activity may be redox regulated. Interestingly, such a redox switch in a molecular chaperone has been described in Hsp33 (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Jakob1" ref-type="bibr">Jakob et al. 1999</xref>), a dimeric bacterial Hsp unrelated to DJ-1.</p>
        <p>To test the redox regulation of DJ-1, we assayed chaperone activity in the CS aggregation assay in the presence or absence of the reducing agent DTT. DJ-1 chaperone activity in the CS aggregation assay was completely abrogated by preincubation of DJ-1 with 0.5 mM DTT in aggregation buffer for 10 min at 4 Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). DTT did not significantly alter CS aggregation in the absence of DJ-1 and did not modify suppression of CS aggregation by Hsp27 (unpublished data). To further test whether redox regulation might govern DJ-1 chaperone activity, reactivation studies using reduced DJ-1 were performed. DTT-reduced DJ-1 was incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (10 mM in aggregation buffer for 10 min at 4 Â°C followed by dialysis against aggregation buffer for 2 h), and subsequently chaperone activity was measured in the CS thermal aggregation assay. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effectively reactivated the chaperone activity of DTT-treated DJ-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). This was not an indirect effect of residual H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on CS aggregation, as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment of CS increased aggregation (unpublished data). These results suggest that redox regulation of DJ-1 is reversible and is regulated by the redox environment.</p>
        <p>Molecular chaperones typically display marked stability to thermal stress (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Sastry1" ref-type="bibr">Sastry et al. 2002</xref>). Consistent with this, the ultraviolet-circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of WT DJ-1 is consistent with a well-folded protein, and thermal denaturation of WT DJ-1 revealed a cooperative thermal unfolding transition at approximately 75 Â°C (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, the CD spectrum of the DJ-1 L166P mutant protein is typical of a partially unfolded polypeptide, suggesting that the L166P mutation causes a significant loss of helical structure. The mutant protein does not exhibit a thermal unfolding transition in the range studied (0â90 Â°C).</p>

        <title>DJ-1 Inhibits the Generation of Î±Syn Aggregates</title>
        <p>We extended the analysis of DJ-1 chaperone function to a candidate DJ-1 substrate, Î±Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The aggregation of Î±Syn has been implicated in familial and sporadic forms of PD, as mutations associated with autosomal dominant familial primary Parkinsonism alter the propensity of Î±Syn to aggregate (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Conway1" ref-type="bibr">Conway et al. 2000a</xref>), and as Î±Syn fibrils are a major constituent of the Lewy body intracytoplasmic inclusions that typify PD pathology (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Spillantini1" ref-type="bibr">Spillantini et al. 1997</xref>). In vitro, monomeric Î±Syn is disordered or ânatively unfoldedâ in dilute solution (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Weinreb1" ref-type="bibr">Weinreb et al. 1996</xref>). Incubation of purified WT human Î±Syn for 2 h at 55 Â°C results in the generation of high molecular weight multimers that likely represent protofibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g002">2</xref>B) (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Volles1" ref-type="bibr">Volles et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Gosavi1" ref-type="bibr">Gosavi et al. 2002</xref>). This treatment does not result in formation of mature amyloid fibrils, as determined by Congo red staining (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). WT DJ-1 effectively inhibits the formation of soluble Î±Syn protofibrils at a molar ratio of 1:2 (DJ-1: Î±Syn).

        <p>Î±Syn protofibrils have been shown to be an intermediate in the formation of mature amyloid fibrils. Because DJ-1 chaperone activity is effective at inhibiting the accumulation of Î±Syn protofibrils, we sought to investigate the role of this activity in the generation of Congo redâpositive mature fibrils. Congruently, WT DJ-1 inhibited formation of Congo red-positive Î±Syn fibrils, while L166P DJ-1 and GST did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Thus, DJ-1 seems to inhibit formation of Î±Syn fibrils by preventing formation of Î±Syn high molecular weight oligomers, or protofibrils. Interestingly, PD-associated clinical mutations in Î±Syn appear to accelerate oligomerization and protofibril formation (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Volles1" ref-type="bibr">Volles et al. 2001</xref>).</p>

        <title>DJ-1 Chaperone Activity In Vivo</title>
        <p>We sought to investigate the chaperone activity of DJ-1 toward Î±Syn in vivo. Î±Syn has been shown to form aggregates that consist of both protofibrils and mature amyloid fibrils in the context of oxidative stress (such as FeCl<sub>2</sub> treatment [<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Lee 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2002</xref>]) in neuroblastoma cells. We evaluated the activity of DJ-1 overexpression on Î±Syn aggregation in this tissue culture model system. Briefly, CAD murine neuroblastoma cells (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Staropoli1" ref-type="bibr">Staropoli et al. 2003</xref>) were transfected with Flag epitope-tagged Î±Syn (Flag-Î±Syn), differentiated via serum withdrawal, and exposed to FeCl<sub>2</sub> (2 mM) for 18 h. Treatment with FeCl<sub>2</sub> induced accumulation of Î±Syn in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, which has been shown to correlate with Î±Syn protofibrils (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Lee 2002</xref>). Overexpression of WT DJ-1, but not L166P clinical mutant DJ-1, significantly inhibited the accumulation of Triton X-100-insoluble Î±Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g003">3</xref>B).

Triton X-100-soluble (Tx-100 sol) and Triton X-100-insoluble (Tx-100 insol) fractions were analyzed by Western blotting.

Cells were transfected with Flag-Î±Syn (F-Î±Syn), and, after 48 h, treated with 2 mM FeCl<sub>2</sub> or with media alone for 18 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for Î±Syn or Î²-actin. In the Triton X-100-soluble fraction (Tx-100 sol), DJ-1 accumulated to a similar extent in the knockout and control cells. In contrast, Î±Syn accumulation in the insoluble pool (Tx-100 insol) was detectable only in the knockout cells, and this was further promoted by FeCl<sub>2</sub> treatment.</p>
            <p>(D) CAD cells transfected with Flag-Î±Syn (F-Î±Syn) along with WT DJ-1 (or vector alone) were treated with 2 mM FeCl<sub>2</sub> or media alone for 18 h. Triton X-100-soluble cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a mouse monoclonal antibody for the Flag epitope and Western blotted for DJ-1. FeCl<sub>2</sub> treatment induces association of Flag-Î±Syn with WT DJ-1. Lysates represent 20% input of the immunoprecipitation (IP Î±-Flag).

        <p>To investigate whether DJ-1 is necessary to inhibit Î±Syn aggregation in vivo, we utilized <italic>DJ-1</italic> âknockoutâ embryonic stem (ES) cells, which display increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. <italic>DJ-1</italic> homozygous knockout or control heterozygous ES cells (heterozygous cells were used as controls because they were the source of the knockout subclones) were differentiated in vitro using the embryoid body protocol (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1" ref-type="bibr">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>) and transfected with Flag-Î±Syn or control vector. Upon differentiation, both endogenous Î±Syn and transfected Flag-Î±Syn are accumulated to a similar extent in the soluble fraction of knockout and control cell lysates, as determined by Western blotting with an antibody for Î±Syn. In contrast, DJ-1-deficient cells (but not control cells) additionally accumulate Triton X-100-insoluble Î±Syn (both endogenous Î±Syn and transfected Flag-Î±Syn), which likely corresponds to protofibril aggregates (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Lee 2002</xref>). As predicted, FeCl<sub>2</sub> treatment further promoted the accumulation of insoluble Î±Syn in DJ-1-deficient cells but not in control heterozygous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Interestingly, transfection of Flag-Î±Syn into undifferentiated knockout or control ES cells in the presence or absence of FeCl<sub>2</sub> treatment did not lead to the accumulation of insoluble Flag-Î±Syn (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>), consistent with a prior study suggesting a role for neuronal differentiation in the generation of insoluble Î±Syn aggregates (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate the mechanism of DJ-1 activity toward Î±Syn, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments on untreated and FeCl<sub>2</sub>-treated CAD cells transfected with DJ-1 and Flag-Î±Syn (or control vector) as above. Triton X-100-soluble cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a mouse monoclonal antibody for the Flag epitope, and Western blots were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody for DJ-1. DJ-1 failed to interact with Flag-Î±Syn in the absence of pretreatment with FeCl<sub>2</sub>, but an association was evident in FeCl<sub>2</sub>-treated cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Furthermore, overexpression of Î±Syn (but not vector control) leads to a reduction in the soluble pool of DJ-1, particularly in the context of FeCl<sub>2</sub> treatment, indicating that DJ-1 additionally associates with an insoluble fraction of Î±Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, bottom panel). Consistent with this, we found that a significant fraction of DJ-1 protein localizes to the insoluble fraction upon FeCl<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g003">Figure 3</xref>E) in cells that have been cotransfected with Flag-Î±Syn.</p>
        <p>To further evaluate Î±Syn aggregation, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of CAD cells transfected with Î±Syn along with DJ-1 or control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Surprisingly, mutation of cysteine 106, at the predicted nucleophile elbow of DJ-1, does not alter the basal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) or the DTT sensitivity (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) of DJ-1 chaperone function. In contrast, mutation of cysteine 53, which is present at the dimeric interface of DJ-1, completely abrogates chaperone activity. Similarly, mutation of all three cysteines in DJ-1 (cysteine 106, cysteine 53, and cysteine 47) leads to the loss of chaperone function. The cysteine mutations do not alter DJ-1 dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g006">Figure 6</xref>D) or the apparent stability of DJ-1 in vivo (unpublished data), unlike the L166P Parkinsonism-associated mutation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We provide evidence that DJ-1 functions as a cytoplasmic redox-sensitive molecular chaperone in vitro and in vivo. This activity extends to Î±Syn and the neurofilament subunit NFL, proteins implicated in PD pathology. In a companion article (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1" ref-type="bibr">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>), we show that DJ-1 deficiency sensitizes cells to oxidative stress, leading to increased apoptosis in the context of an ROS burst. Taken together, our data strongly support the notion that DJ-1 functions as a redox-dependent protein chaperone to mitigate molecular insults downstream of an ROS burst. Oxidation-modified proteins have been shown to accumulate in the context of normal aging and PD, and may participate in the generation of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Jenner1" ref-type="bibr">Jenner 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is of interest to identify relevant in vivo substrates for DJ-1 activity in the context of DNs in PD. Our data suggest that DJ-1 activity extends to multiple targets, reminiscent of other small protein chaperones (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Gusev1" ref-type="bibr">Gusev et al. 2002</xref>), and consistent with this, DJ-1 activity is not ATP-dependent (unpublished data). Candidate substrates for DJ-1 chaperone activity in the context of PD include Î±Syn and neurofilament proteins, based on their presence in PD protein inclusions. Our data suggest that DJ-1 functions to suppress protein aggregates in the cytoplasm. It is possible that DJ-1 plays additional roles in the mitochondria or nucleus, as has been suggested (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Bonifati1" ref-type="bibr">Bonifati 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020362-CanetAviles1" ref-type="bibr">Canet-Aviles 2004</xref>), although DJ-1 appears to remain localized diffusely in the cytoplasm with or without toxin treatment in our studies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our data indicate that DJ-1 can suppress an early step in the formation of Î±Syn aggregates, the generation of high molecular weight oligomers (protofibrils). Interestingly, it has been suggested that such protofibrils, rather than the large fibrillar aggregates, may underlie Î±Syn toxicity in vivo (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Volles1" ref-type="bibr">Volles et al. 2001</xref>). DJ-1 inhibits the aggregation of Î±Syn in differentiated cells in vivo, and loss of DJ-1 leads to increased accumulation of insoluble Î±Syn. DJ-1 appears to associate with Î±Syn in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of FeCl<sub>2</sub>-treated lysates, and DJ-1 colocalizes with Î±Syn in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in the context of FeCl<sub>2</sub> treatment. However, DJ-1 does not colocalize with the punctate protein aggregates visible by immunostaining in the case of either Î±Syn or NFL. This supports the notion that DJ-1 functions at an early step in the aggregation process, when the substrate protein may be misfolded, but has not yet formed a mature aggregate. We hypothesize that DJ-1 may promote the degradation of such misfolded proteins, either through the proteasome or through other cellular pathways such as chaperone-mediated autophagy.</p>
      <p>A recent study investigated the chaperone activity of WT DJ-1 in vitro toward CS and concluded that redox regulation was not a significant factor (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Lee3" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2003</xref>). This is most likely a consequence of the use of only oxidizing conditions (0.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) but not reducing conditions in the described chaperone assays (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Lee3" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2003</xref>). A second report failed to detect DJ-1 chaperone activity in vitro (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Olzmann1" ref-type="bibr">Olzmann et al. 2003</xref>), but importantly, this study employed only reducing conditions in which DJ-1 chaperone activity is abrogated. In the present study we demonstrate that DJ-1 chaperone activity is inhibited by reducing conditions, and can be stimulated by oxidation. Thus, in the normal reducing environment of the cell, DJ-1 may be inactive. Production of ROS and alteration of the redox state of the cytoplasm may activate DJ-1 chaperone activity as a mechanism of coping with protein aggregation and misfolding.</p>
      <p>We find that that the PD-associated L166P mutant DJ-1 fails to function as a molecular chaperone in vivo or in vitro. Consistent with this, in a companion article (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1" ref-type="bibr">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>), we show that this mutant fails to complement <italic>DJ-1</italic> knockout cells in vivo, even when overexpressed at artificially high levels (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1" ref-type="bibr">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the L166P mutant form fails to dimerize even when expressed at WT levels. Thus, although prior studies (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al. 2003</xref>) and our analyses (unpublished data) have found that the L166P PD-associated DJ-1 mutation leads to decreased protein stability, it is apparent that even overexpression of the L166P mutant protein does not restore function. The L166P clinical phenotype is not due simply to reduced levels of DJ-1 protein, and, furthermore, we do not observe evidence of altered subcellular localization of the L166P mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g004">Figure 4</xref>M-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g004">4</xref>R). Rather, our studies favor a model by which the pathological mechanism of this mutation is a consequence of altered structure and resultant loss of function.</p>
      <p>Mutation of cysteine 53 in DJ-1 abrogates both chaperone and protective functions of this protein. Interestingly, cysteine 53 has previously been implicated as a reactive cysteine required for the in vivo modification of DJ-1 to a lower isoelectric point in response to oxidative stress (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Honbou1" ref-type="bibr">Honbou et al. 2003a</xref>), consistent with a role for such redox regulation in vivo. In contrast, cysteine 106, which has been reported to be sensitive to oxidative modification in vitro (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. 2003</xref>), does not appear to be required for the in vitro and in vivo DJ-1 activities.</p>

The mutant protein displays significantly reduced secondary structure. CD spectra of DJ-1 (40 Î¼M in 10 mM PBS [pH 7.4]) were recorded on an Aviv 62A sCD spectrometer at 4 Â°C in a 0.02-cm path length cuvette, and Î±-helix and Î²-sheet content were estimated as described (<xref rid="pbio-0020362-Sreerama1" ref-type="bibr">Sreerama and Woody 2003</xref>). Based on an initial evaluation of the spectra, the WT spectrum was analyzed using a basis set appropriate for folded proteins, whereas the mutant spectrum was analyzed using a basis set suited for unstructured proteins. Thermal stability was determined by monitoring the change in mean residue ellipticity ([Î], equal to Â°C Â· cm<sup>2</sup> Â· dmol<sup>â1</sup>) at 222 nm as a function of temperature. Thermal melts were performed in 4 Â°C increments with an equilibration time of 1 min and an integration time of 30 sec, using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette.</p>
