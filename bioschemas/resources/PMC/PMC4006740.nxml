      <abstract>
        <p>Impairment of the tightly regulated ossification process leads to a wide range of skeletal dysplasias and deciphering their molecular bases has contributed to the understanding of this complex process. Here, we report a homozygous mutation in the mitochondria-associated granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor-signaling gene (<italic>MAGMAS</italic>) in a novel and severe spondylodysplastic dysplasia. MAGMAS, also referred to as PAM16 (presequence translocase-associated motor 16), is a mitochondria-associated protein involved in preprotein translocation into the matrix. We show that <italic>MAGMAS</italic> is specifically expressed in trabecular bone and cartilage at early developmental stages and that the mutation leads to an instability of the protein. We further demonstrate that the mutation described here confers to yeast strains a temperature-sensitive phenotype, impairs the import of mitochondrial matrix pre-proteins and induces cell death. The finding of deleterious <italic>MAGMAS</italic> mutations in an early lethal skeletal dysplasia supports a key role for this mitochondrial protein in the ossification process.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Skeletal dysplasias (SD) refer to a complex group of rare genetic disorders affecting the growth and development of the skeleton. The identification of the molecular basis of a considerable number of SD has greatly expanded our knowledge of the ossification process. Among SD, spondylodysplastic dysplasia is a generic term describing different conditions characterized by severe vertebral abnormalities and distinct by additional specific features. Several entities within this group are well defined. However, a few cases remain unclassified, of which a novel autosomal recessive spondylometaphyseal dysplasia recently reported by MÃ©garbanÃ© et al. in two Lebanese families. Here, we identified <italic>MAGMAS</italic> as a candidate gene responsible for this severe SD. MAGMAS, also referred to as PAM16, is a mitochondria-associated protein, involved in pre-proteins import into mitochondria and essential for cell growth and development. We demonstrated that <italic>MAGMAS</italic> is expressed in bone and cartilage in early developmental stages underlining its specific role in skeletogenesis. We also give strong evidence of the deleterious effect of the identified mutation on the <italic>in-vivo</italic> activity of Magmas and the viability of yeast strains. Reporting deleterious <italic>MAGMAS</italic> mutation in a SD supports a key and specific role for this mitochondrial protein in ossification.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During embryonic development and postnatal growth period, most longitudinal bone growth occurs via endochondral ossification, a process in which chondrocytes produce a cartilage template that will ultimately be replaced by bone <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Karsenty1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Disturbance of this tightly regulated process results in skeletal dysplasias (SD), which are an extremely diverse and complex group of rare genetic diseases <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Baitner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Causative mutations have now been identified in over 230 different genes in more than 400 unique skeletal phenotypes <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Warman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Ikegawa1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, the genetic basis of over 100 different entities remains to be determined. Among SD, spondylodysplastic dysplasia is a generic descriptive term for a heterogeneous group of SD characterized by severe vertebral abnormalities and distinctive skeletal or extra-skeletal features <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Warman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Ikegawa1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The outcome is variable from early lethality to long-term survival. The last international classification recognizes at least five distinct entities within this group of rare disorders, i) achondrogenesis type 1A [MIM 200600] due to mutations in <italic>TRIP11</italic> [MIM 604505], which encodes the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 11, ii) Schneckenbecken dysplasia [MIM 296250] due to mutations in <italic>SLC35D1</italic> [MIM 610804], encoding the solute carrier family 35 member D1, also known as UDP-Galactose transporter-related 7 iii) spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (SMD) Sedaghatian type [MIM 250220], a heterogeneous condition that is due in some cases, to mutations in <italic>SBDS</italic> [MIM 607444] involved in the processing of ribosomal RNA, iv) fibrochondrogenesis [MIM 228520], due in some cases to <italic>COL11A1</italic> mutations and v) opsismodysplasia [MIM 258480], due to mutations in <italic>INPPL1</italic> [MIM 600829] that encodes the inositol polyphosphate phosphatase like-1 <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The wide range of proteins involved in this group of SD points out the complexity of the ossification process.</p>
      <p>Although different entities within the group of spondylodysplastic dysplasia are well defined, a few cases remain unclassified. Recently, MÃ©garbanÃ© et al. have reported on two unrelated consanguineous Lebanese families with four affected cases presenting a novel type of early lethal spondylometaphyseal dysplasia <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Mgarban1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Mgarban2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. To elucidate the molecular basis of this entity, we performed exome sequencing in these two distinct families and identified a homozygous mutation in <italic>MAGMAS</italic> (Mitochondria-associated granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor-signaling molecule) in patients from both families.</p>

The main clinical features were pre- and postnatal growth retardation, developmental delay, dysmorphic features, prominent abdomen, narrow thorax with short ribs and short limbs. Skeletal features included severe platyspondyly at birth that improved somewhat over time, square iliac bones, horizontal acetabulae, short long bones with abnormal modeling, widening of the distal femoral metaphyses and delayed epiphyseal ossification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004311-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In the first reported family (Family F1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004311-g002">Figure 2</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Mgarban1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, both affected sibs died at an early age from respiratory insufficiency (F1-IV.1 at age 9 months and F1-IV.3 at age 2 years) while heart failure was the cause of the early death, at age 2 years, in patients (F2-IV.2 and F2-IV.3) of the second family (Family F2: individuals IV.2 and IV.3) <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Mgarban2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004311-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>Exome sequencing has been performed in Family 2, in three individuals: the proband (F2-IV.3) and her two unaffected parents (F2-III.1 and F2-III.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004311-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Considering the recessive inheritance of the disease in the pedigree and consanguinity (Fâ=â1/16), we assumed identity by Descent <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Lander1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Using an in-house bioinformatics tool, we realized identity by descent filtering of exome data and identified 1037 homozygous variants in the proband, which were also heterozygous in both parents. Of these 1037 variants, 916 were exonic and/or splice site mutations, of which 434 were either non-synonymous and nonsense single nucleotide variants, or small insertions/deletions leading to a shift in the reading frame.</p>
        <p>In order to further refine the list of candidate nucleotide variations, additional filtering was performed on what we called the âdbSNP13700â database (i.e. dbSNP137, from which we have removed mutations that are reported as pathogenic alleles, as well as all referenced variants with frequencies lower than 1%, or without any frequency information). Additional filtering was also performed using our in-house exome database that includes all homozygous variants detected by exome sequencing of 14 Lebanese unaffected individuals. We ended up with a list of 16 candidate homozygous by descent variants in the proband F2-IV.3.</p>
        <p>In family 1, exome sequencing has been performed only in the proband (F1-IV.3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004311-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Using the same analysis pipeline and after all filtering steps, we were able to identify 59 homozygous variants in the genes coding regions of this patient.</p>
        <p>In total, patients F1-IV.3 and F2-IV.3 shared 13872 homozygous variants, of which only 3 exonic variations were both homozygous by descent in the proband from family 2 (F2-IV.3), and homozygous in the proband from family 1 (F1-IV.3), after applying the different filters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004311.s004">Table S1</xref>). Of those three variants, only one missense mutation (NM_016069: c.226A&gt;G; p.Asn76Asp) in the <italic>PAM16</italic> gene (presequence translocase-associated motor 16), that is more commonly referred to as <italic>MAGMAS</italic> (Mitochondria-associated granulocyte macrophage CSF-signaling molecule), was predicted to have pathogenic effects using different bioinformatics prediction softwares, such as: Mutation Taster (disease causing variation with a probability value of 0.99999957), SIFT (damaging effect, score 0.006) <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, PROVEAN (deleterious effect, score â4.021) <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and PolyPhen-2 (possibly damaging effect, score 0.728 HumDiv). By Sanger sequencing, we confirmed the segregation of the c.226A&gt;G transition in <italic>MAGMAS</italic> with the disease in both families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004311-g003">Figure 3A</xref>): the mutation was homozygous in the patients, heterozygous in the parents and in the unaffected sibs in both families. We also demonstrated that the variation was absent in a set of 550 Lebanese control chromosomes. Protein sequence alignments showed that the Asparagine at codon 76 in MAGMAS is well conserved among mammals and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004311-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

        <p>The two patients described here are not related. However, they display the same homozygous missense mutation, thus suggesting the existence of a founder mutation. In order to verify this hypothesis, we used both exome data and genotyping of STR markers. By analyzing exome data, we were able to identify 11 regions of shared homozygosity on chromosome 16. However, only three regions displayed a size over 100 kb, of whom two were containing or contiguous to the <italic>MAGMAS</italic> locus (Chr16: 4015729â7102036 (â¼3 Mb) and Chr16: 8728764â8840025 (â¼1.1 Mb)). Also, by using PLINK <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Purcell1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, we were able to reconstruct haplotypes from exome data of both patients, and here again, we identified a 3.6 Mb shared homozygous region located between SNP markers rs3730119 and rs4616299 on chromosome 16p13.3 (Chr16:4,057,603â7,657,432). Genotyping of microsatellite markers allowed to refine this region and define a minimal ancestral common homozygous haplotype spanning 1.9 Mb between markers D16S758 and D16S243 containing <italic>MAGMAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004311.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Altogether, our results demonstrate that the c.226A&gt;G transition in <italic>MAGMAS</italic> (p.Asn76Asp) is likely to be pathogenic in both families. <italic>MAGMAS</italic> is located on chromosome 16p13.3 and is composed of five exons.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we report the identification of a homozygous missense <italic>MAGMAS</italic> mutation, (p.Asn76Asp), in patients from two unrelated Lebanese families, affected with a rare lethal spondylometaphyseal dysplasia recently described by MÃ©garbanÃ© et al. <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Mgarban1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Mgarban2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. By reconstructing haplotypes from exome and STR genotyping data from patients F1-IV.3 and F2-IV.3, we were able to identify a minimal common ancestral homozygous haplotype around <italic>MAGMAS</italic>, spanning 1.9 Mb on chromosome 16p13.3, suggesting the existence of a founder mutation in gene. <italic>MAGMAS</italic>, also referred to as <italic>PAM16</italic>, was first identified in 2001 by Jubinsky et al. <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Jubinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, as a gene encoding a novel mitochondria-associated protein involved in granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signal transduction and expressed by nearly all mammalian cells. The observation of a <italic>MAGMAS</italic> mutation in a severe chondrodysplasia supports a specific role of MAGMAS protein in the endochondral ossification process. Its expression in the notochord and the somites has been reported at day 12.5 embryo and in the cartilage of the developing ribs at day 14.5 embryo <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Jubinsky2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, its involvement in skeletogenesis has never been described to date. Our findings demonstrate that <italic>MAGMAS</italic> is expressed in trabecular bone and cartilage and more specifically by differentiated chondrocytes localized in the hypertophic zone and by osteoblasts at early developmental stages underlining its key role in skeletogenesis. On the other hand, the implication of the fusion protein CORO7-MAGMAS in the pathogenesis of the skeletal dysplasia has been ruled out, as the related transcript was not well expressed in human fetal chondrocytes and human osteoblasts.</p>
      <p>Besides the skeletal features, respiratory insufficiency (F1-IV.1 and F1-IV.3) or heart failure (F2-IV.2 and F2-IV.3) were observed, leading to early deaths of the patients <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Mgarban1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Mgarban2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Of note, an elevated <italic>MAGMAS</italic> level was detected in murine heart and lung in previous studies <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Jubinsky2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These features may also support a key role of MAGMAS in heart and lung.</p>
      <p>MAGMAS consists of two main functional domains: a N-terminal hydrophobic region including a membrane association domain (M) and a predicted mitochondria targeting region (T), and a C-terminal J-like domain (J) characterized by three Î±-helical segments <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Frazier1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004311-DSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Importantly, the p.Asn76Asp mutation lies in the helix II of MAGMAS J-like domain. The latter domain forms, with the J-domain of DNAJC19 (ortholog of yeast Pam18 which is another essential component of PAM), a stable heterodimeric subcomplex <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Elsner1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Chacinska1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004311.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Mutations in <italic>DNAJC19</italic> preventing MAGMAS/DNAJC19 dimerization have been shown to lead to dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome (DCMA) <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Sparkes1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Davey1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Considering the localization of the p.Asn76Asp mutation in the J-like domain of MAGMAS, a similar phenotype was likely to be observed in our reported patients. Cardiomyopathy was observed exclusively in patients of the second family and ataxia was not present but all 4 cases died early before 2 years of age. On the other hand, the absence of DCMA in affected cases may also suggest a redundancy in the function of the subcomplex MAGMAS/DNAJC19 in some tissues.</p>
      <p>We further demonstrated that the p.Asn76Asp mutation confers to yeast strains a temperature-sensitive phenotype characterized by a very slow-growth at 34Â°C (307.15Â°K) and inviability at 36Â°C (309.15Â°K), on both fermentable and non-fermentable growth media. Remarkably, the deleterious effect of the mutation was only observed at a homozygous state which is in correlation with the recessive mode of inheritance of the spondylodysplastic dysplasia reported in this study.</p>
      <p>Our findings of impaired import of mitochondrial-matrix proteins in the mutant strains shifted at non-permissive temperature confirmed the deleterious nature of the identified mutation. Likewise, it has been demonstrated that aa alterations in MAGMAS J-like domain resulted in temperature sensitivity and <italic>in vivo</italic> protein import defects in yeast cells <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Sinha1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004311-DSilva2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The low expression level of MAGMAS detected in the mutant strain at the non permissive temperature indicates that the p.Asn76Asp mutation confers protein instability. Additionally, we observed unusual punctuated and highly fragmented mitochondria together with enhanced pexophagy in the mutant <italic>MAGMAS</italic> strain at the non permissive temperature, supporting a cell death induction in the yeast mutant strain. These data are consistent with the finding of Roy et al., in <italic>Drosophila</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004311-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and confirm the crucial role of MAGMAS for cell integrity and viability.</p>
      <p>The association between a mitochondrial protein and a skeletal dysplasia is striking as skeletal manifestations are rarely seen in mitochondrial disorders. To date, the only severe skeletal dysplasia identified as having a possible mitochondrial basis is the anauxetic dysplasia [MIM 607095], which is allelic to two milder forms of SD, namely metaphyseal dysplasia Mc Kusick type [MIM 250250] and metaphyseal dysplasia without hypotrichosis [MIM 250460]). The gene responsible for these SD is <italic>RMRP</italic> [MIM 157660], which encodes the RNA component of the mitochondrial RNA processing endoribonuclease (MRP) complex <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Thiel1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004311-Bonaf1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Of note, RNase MRP is not exclusively found in the mitochondria but also in the nucleus. Previous studies have shown that mitochondrial and nucleolar RNase MRP have identical RNA components but distinct enzymatic activities and protein components <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The recent identification of mutations in <italic>POP1</italic> (Processing of precursor 1) [MIM 602486], which encodes a protein component of the nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex in two siblings with anauxetic dysplasia <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Glazov1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> may support the involvement of the nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex rather than the mitochondrial complex in the etiology of these severe skeletal dysplasias. Similarly, besides its role in preprotein import into mitochondria, Magmas may also be involved in additional important mechanisms as suggested by Short et al. <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Short1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The detection of different human transcripts of <italic>MAGMAS</italic>, with some lacking the mitochondrial transit peptide (mTP) leader sequence <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> may support a novel extra mitochondrial activity of this protein.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, this is the first report linking a mutation in <italic>MAGMAS</italic> with a human developmental disorder and supporting a key role for this mitochondrial protein in the ossification process.</p>

        <p>For the import activity analysis, YPH499<italic>pam16Î</italic>-<italic>PAM16</italic>, YPH-<italic>pam16Î</italic>-MAG<sub>WT</sub> and YPH-<italic>pam16Î</italic>-MAG<sub>Asn76Asp</sub> cells were first grown to OD<sub>600 nm</sub> of 1.0 at 28Â°C (301.15Â°K) in rich medium then shifted to 37Â°C (310.15Â°K), for 8 h (28800 s) to induce non-permissive conditions. Cell pellets were suspended in ice-cold TCA buffer (TrisHCl pH 8 20 mM, Ammonium Acetate 50 mM, EDTA 2 mM, protease inhibitor solution, and TCA10%) then lysed by adding glass beads and shaking vigorously for 300 s (5 fold 60 s in ice between). After centrifugation of 600 s (13,000 rpm) at 4Â°C (277.15Â°K), the proteins were solubilized in TCA-Laemmli loading buffer (SDS/glycerol stock solution 48%, Tris EDTA 40%, Î²-mercaptoethanol 0.5%, PMSF 0.2%, protease inhibitor solution 0.2%) and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was first blocked, then incubated 1 h at room temperature with a blocking solution containing the monoclonal HSP60 Ab (provided by Dujardin G.) at 1/15000 dilution. After several washes with TBS1X (Tris Buffered Saline 1X), the membrane was immersed for 1 h at room temperature with HRP â conjugated secondary anti-mouse Ab (at 2/15000 dilution in a blocking solution) then washed again with TBS1X. Secondary antibodies bound to the membrane were detected by chemiluminescence using the Thermo Scientific PierceECL 2 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The same protocol was used for the immunodetection of MAGMAS protein in YPH499, YPH-<italic>pam16Î</italic>-MAG<sub>WT</sub> and YPH<italic>-pam16Î-</italic>MAG<sub>Asn76Asp</sub>strains. For this purpose, we incubated the membrane with a blocking solution containing the polyclonal anti-MAGMAS Ab (Abcam plc., UK) at a 1/1000 final concentration. Therefore, the secondary Ab used in this case was HRP â conjugated secondary anti-rabbit Ab (at 2/15000 dilution in a blocking solution). Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and Porin were detected using anti-PGK (Invitrogen) and anti-Porin (Invitrogen), accordingly.</p>

        <p>In order to label mitochondria, YPH-<italic>pam16Î</italic>-MAG<sub>WT</sub> and YPH-<italic>pam16Î</italic>-MAG<sub>Asn76Asp</sub> strains were transformed with the <italic>pYX232-mtGFP</italic> plasmid that encodes the mitochondrial matrix-targeted GFP <xref rid="pgen.1004311-Westermann1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and grown for 2 days at 28Â°C (301.15Â°K). Cells were secondly incubated overnight at the non-permissive temperature to induce the phenotype. For the visualization of peroxisomes, BY-<italic>pam16Î-</italic>MAG<sub>WT</sub> and BY-<italic>pam16Î-</italic>MAG<sub>Asn76Asp</sub> were transformed with <italic>pUG34DsRed.SKL</italic> encoding the red fluorescent protein DsRed containing the C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1, DsRed-SKL). Transformants were grown for 2 days at 28Â°C (301.15Â°K) in minimal medium. Harvested cells were washed in Phosphate-buffered saline 1X (PBS1X) then transferred to microscopic slides for imaging. For observations at high temperature, cells grown 2 days at 28Â°C (301.15Â°K) in minimal medium, were shifted to 37Â°C (310.15Â°K), for 6 hours then harvested, washed and transferred to slides for visualization. The slides were examined with a DMIRE2 microscope (Leica, Deerfield, IL). For GFP fluorescence, filters used were 450/490 nm for excitation and 500/550 nm for emission whereas for Ds.Red fluorescence, filters were 542/582 nm for excitation and 604/644 nm for emission. Images were captured using a CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, WestChester, PA) was used to deconvolute <italic>Z</italic>-series and treat the images.</p>

          <p>Protein import pathways into mitochondria. (<bold>A</bold>) Several sophisticated transport machineries mediate recognition, import, sorting and assembly of preproteins into a specific subcompartment of the mitochondria. Preproteins targeted to the matrix cross the outer mitochondrial membrane through the TOM complex then pass through the inner membrane via the TIM23<sup>MOTOR</sup>. Once processed into the matrix, preproteins are folded to their active forms after the cleavage of their presequences by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). HSP60 assists in the correct folding and assembly of the imported proteins. (<bold>B</bold>) TIM23<sup>MOTOR</sup>: the translocase involved in preproteins import into the mitochondrial matrix. It is composed of TIM23 translocase associated with the PAM complex (In red). The ATP-dependant core of PAM, mtHSP70, drives the translocation and the unfolding of preproteins. The regulation of the position and activity of mtHSP70 is mediated by five other subunits of the PAM complex, consisting of a soluble nucleotide exchange factor MGE1 and four membrane bound co-chaperones TIM44, DNAJC19, PAM16 and PAM17. Via its C-terminal J-like domain, PAM16 (red arrow) interacts with DNAJC19 thus enabling its tethering to the translocon. IM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; OM: outer membrane.</p>
