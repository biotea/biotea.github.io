          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Transcription factor 4 (TCF4 alias ITF2, E2-2, ME2 or SEF2) is a ubiquitous class A basic helix-loop-helix protein that binds to E-box DNA sequences (CANNTG). While involved in the development and functioning of many different cell types, recent studies point to important roles for TCF4 in the nervous system. Specifically, human <italic>TCF4</italic> gene is implicated in susceptibility to schizophrenia and <italic>TCF4</italic> haploinsufficiency is the cause of the Pitt-Hopkins mental retardation syndrome. However, the structure, expression and coding potential of the human <italic>TCF4</italic> gene have not been described in detail.</p>

          <title>Principal Findings</title>
          <p>In the present study we used human tissue samples to characterize human <italic>TCF4</italic> gene structure and <italic>TCF4</italic> expression at mRNA and protein level. We report that although widely expressed, human <italic>TCF4</italic> mRNA expression is particularly high in the brain. We demonstrate that usage of numerous 5â² exons of the human <italic>TCF4</italic> gene potentially yields in TCF4 protein isoforms with 18 different N-termini. In addition, the diversity of isoforms is increased by alternative splicing of several internal exons. For functional characterization of TCF4 isoforms, we overexpressed individual isoforms in cultured human cells. Our analysis revealed that subcellular distribution of TCF4 isoforms is differentially regulated: Some isoforms contain a bipartite nuclear localization signal and are exclusively nuclear, whereas distribution of other isoforms relies on heterodimerization partners. Furthermore, the ability of different TCF4 isoforms to regulate E-box controlled reporter gene transcription is varied depending on whether one or both of the two TCF4 transcription activation domains are present in the protein. Both TCF4 activation domains are able to activate transcription independently, but act synergistically in combination.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>TCF4 (Gene 6925), alias ITF2 (immunoglobulin transcription factor 2), SEF2 (leukemia virus SL3-3 enhancer factor 2), E2-2 and ME2 (mouse E2), is one of the widely expressed class A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) that are homologous to <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> protein daughterless (Gene 34413) <xref rid="pone.0022138-Henthorn1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Corneliussen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The bHLH factor TCF4 discussed here should not be confused with the high mobility group box transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2; Gene 6934) that is a downstream effector of the Î²-catenin signaling pathway and is also known as TCF4 (T-cell specific factor 4).</p>
      <p>Class A bHLH factors in mammals include TCF4, HEB (TCF12; Gene 6938) and E2A (TCF3, ITF1; Gene 6929) alternative isoforms E12 and E47 <xref rid="pone.0022138-Massari1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These proteins are referred to as E-proteins since they bind to Ephrussi box (E-box) sequence (CANNTG) as homodimers or as heterodimers with tissue-specific bHLH factors <xref rid="pone.0022138-Massari1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Ephrussi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Dimerization is mediated by the C-terminal HLH motif that together with the preceding stretch of basic amino acids is required also for DNA binding. Structurally related Id proteins (inhibitors of differentiation) hinder DNA binding of E-proteins by heterodimerization, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin specifically inhibits DNA binding of E-protein homodimers <xref rid="pone.0022138-Benezra1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0022138-Hauser1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Three amino-terminally distinct TCF4 isoforms have been described â TCF4-A, TCF4-B and TCF4-D <xref rid="pone.0022138-Corneliussen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. All these isoforms contain the bHLH domain and a transcription activation domain (AD2) <xref rid="pone.0022138-Quong1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. TCF4-B has an additional transcription activation domain in its N-terminus (AD1) <xref rid="pone.0022138-Massari2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In Drosophila the only E-protein, daughterless, is involved in sex determination and neurogenesis <xref rid="pone.0022138-Cronmiller1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Caudy1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In mammals, substantial functional overlap among E-proteins has hampered deciphering their exact roles. However, it is known that TCF4 is required for postnatal survival in mice <xref rid="pone.0022138-Zhuang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Bergqvist1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and has many cell lineage specific functions. For instance, TCF4 regulates development of B-, T- and plasmacytoid dendritic cells <xref rid="pone.0022138-Bergqvist1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0022138-Nagasawa1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, development of Sertoli cells <xref rid="pone.0022138-Muir1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and pontine nucleus neurons <xref rid="pone.0022138-Flora1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, myogenesis <xref rid="pone.0022138-Skerjanc1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, melanogenesis <xref rid="pone.0022138-Furumura1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and epithelial-mesenchymal transition <xref rid="pone.0022138-Sobrado1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The importance of TCF4 in human nervous system development is underscored by the association of a TCF4 allele with schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0022138-Stefansson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and identification of <italic>TCF4</italic> haploinsufficiency as the cause for Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (OMIM 610954), a rare disease featuring mental retardation, hyperventilation and seizures <xref rid="pone.0022138-Zweier1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0022138-Amiel1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study we show that <italic>TCF4</italic> is widely, but not equally expressed and its levels are particularly high in the nervous system. We demonstrate that usage of alternative 5â² exons for transcribing the human <italic>TCF4</italic> gene potentially yields in numerous TCF4 protein isoforms that differ in their subcellular localization and capacity to activate transcription.</p>

<italic>TCF4</italic> gene contains many mutually exclusive 5â² exons</title>
        <p>To describe the structure and alternative splicing of the human <italic>TCF4</italic> gene we performed bioinformatic analysis of mRNA and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences available in public databases and sequences of RT-PCR products from this study. In estimation of transcription start sites we relied on publicly available data from sequencing of oligo-cap, cap-trapping and SMART cDNA libraries <xref rid="pone.0022138-Maruyama1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0022138-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. <italic>TCF4</italic> gene is located on chromosome 18q21.2 and spans 437 kbs. It has 41 exons of which 21 are alternative 5â² exons situated at various positions throughout the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In this study <italic>TCF4</italic> exons are named as follows: initial 5â² exons are designated with a lowercase letter preceded by a number that shows the following internal exon in the gene; internal exons are numbered from 1 to 20; exon 21 is the only terminal 3â² exon. <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts are named according to the initial exon they contain. Initial exons 1a and 1b are located upstream of internal exon 1. Exons 3aâ3d precede and 4aâ4c follow internal exon 3. 4c is a 5â² extension of internal exon 4. There are three 5â² exons (5aâ5c) in front of exon 5; two (7a, 7b) in front of exon 7; four (8aâ8d) in front of exon 8; and three (10aâ10c) in front of exon 10. Generally, 5â² exons are spliced together with the next internal exon in the gene, apart from the cases when the following internal exon is a cassette exon and can be skipped (exons 1 or 2, exon 3, exons 8â9; see below). As an exception 5â² exon 1a is never used together with internal exons 1 or 2 and is always joined to internal exon 3 or 4. We identified several alternative splice donor sites in the 5â² exons: two (IâII) in exons 5a, 8b and 8c; three (IâIII) in exons 4a and 7a. In case of exon 7b the intron between 7b-I and internal exon 7 can be retained giving rise to 7b-II transcripts. Different usage of splice sites sometimes affects the coding potential of a transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, the reading frame shifts with alternative splicing of internal cassette exons 1 or 2 and exon 3. Examination of open reading frames and search for possible translation start codons demonstrated that, altogether, <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts potentially code for 18 N-terminally distinct protein isoforms named TCF4-A â TCF4-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022138.s001">S1</xref>) of which only isoforms TCF4-A, TCF4-B and TCF4-D have been described previously as SEF2-1A or ITF2-A, SEF2-1B or ITF2-B, and SEF2-1D, respectively <xref rid="pone.0022138-Corneliussen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Skerjanc1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Most of the TCF4 isoforms have a stretch of unique amino acids in their N-termini and the whole aminoterminal transactivation domain AD1 (coded by exons 3â6) is present only in isoforms with the longest N-termini such as TCF4-J, -K, -L and TCF4-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022138.s001">S1</xref>). Other TCF4 isoforms contain parts of AD1 or are completely devoid of it. More precisely, isoforms TCF4-C, -E, -M, -O and -P contain a region of AD1 coded by exons 4â6, isoforms TCF4-F, -N and -R contain a region coded by exons 5â6, isoform TCF4-Q has only a short sequence coded by exon 6, and the rest of the isoforms (TCF4-D, -G, -A, -H and -I) lack AD1.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Apart from differences in the N-termini, the number of TCF4 isoforms is increased by in-frame alternative splicing of internal exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022138.s001">S1</xref>). Firstly, simultaneous skipping of internal cassette exons 8 and 9 gives rise to TCF4 Î isoforms, as opposed to full-length isoforms that contain the amino acids coded by exons 8â9. Secondly, at exon 18 there are two alternative splice donor sites that enable to splice in or out a 12 bps sequence encoding amino acid sequence RSRS present in + isoforms and absent in â isoforms. Thirdly, exons 8 and 15 contain two alternative splice acceptor sites that lead to optional inclusion of the first three nucleotides (CAG) of an exon in mRNA and a glutamine or alanine residue, respectively, in the corresponding position in protein sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022138.s001">Figure S1</xref>). All TCF4 isoforms, regardless of their N-terminal or internal differences, contain transactivation domain AD2 (coded by exons 14â16) and the bHLH domain (coded by exon 19).</p>
        <p>The overall structure of <italic>TCF4</italic> gene is conserved in the mouse genome. The identity between human and mouse sequences for internal exons 3â20 and 3â² exon 21 is 92%. Out of the 21 <italic>TCF4</italic> 5â² exons in human genome at least 13 are also transcribed in mouse as assessed by the presence of respective ESTs in public databases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022138.s003">Table S1</xref>). Sequences of most human 5â² exons align to the respective region in the mouse genome with approximately 70â99% identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022138.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Exons 1b, 3c, 5b and 5c are more divergent and for exons 1a, 1 and 2 no alignment between human and mouse genes was obtained. Five out of the seven non-conserved human <italic>TCF4</italic> exons indicated above originate from exonization of various transposable elements. Namely, exon 1a overlaps with two LTR repeats, exon 1b overlaps with DNA transposon MER5B, exon 1 consists of SINE (Alu) and LINE repeat sequences, exon 2 consists of Alu repeat sequence and exon 5c consists of SINE (MIR) element sequence. In addition, 5â² exon 3a immediately follows a SINE (MIR) element in the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022138.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to determine the relative abundance of mRNAs initiated at different positions within the <italic>TCF4</italic> gene, we carried out ribonuclease protection assays with the probe spanning internal exons 3â11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Transcripts containing different number of internal exons were detected in human cerebellum and muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The longest protected fragment, containing exons 3â11, corresponds to transcripts initiated at 5â² exons 1a, 1b and 3aâ3d. The fragment comprising exons 4â11 represents the sum of transcripts containing the above mentioned 5â² exons in case of exon 3 skipping and transcripts initiated at 4aâ4c. The fragments comprising exons 5â11, 7â11 and 8â11 rise from transcripts initiated at 5aâ5c, 7aâ7b and 8aâ8d, correspondingly. The fragments comprising exons 3â7, 4â7 and 5â7 represent transcripts that are initiated at the same sites as fragments 3â11, 4â11 and 5â11, respectively, but that lack the cassette exons 8â9 as a result of alternative splicing. All Î8â9 transcripts additionally give rise to the fragment containing exons 10â11 and this fragment also includes transcripts initiated at exons 10aâ10c. Densitometric quantification of the protected fragments showed that the levels of <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts spanning different number of internal exons were comparable in both human cerebellum and muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

<italic>TCF4</italic> mRNAs are ubiquitously but not equally expressed</title>
        <p>We studied the usage of different 5â² exons in a variety of human tissues and brain regions by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Our results showed that although the majority of the alternative <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts were present in most tissues analyzed, there were a few that had a more limited expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). For instance we detected transcripts containing exon 1a only in testis, prostate and placenta. The use of 5â² exons 1b, 3a and 5c was restricted to testis, prostate and trachea. Furthermore, there were several transcripts, most remarkably 8d transcripts, that featured considerably higher expression levels in the nervous system than in other tissues. RT-PCR analysis also provided information about the occurrence of alternative splicing. The skipping of exon 3 (Î3) was a minor event in case of transcripts 1b, 3a, 3c, and 3d, whereas comparable levels of full-length and Î3 mRNAs were present in case of transcripts 1a and 3b. Several general observations were made concerning the usage of alternative splice donor sites at 5â² exons. Firstly, the prevalence of splice site utilization at exon 7a decreased in the row of II, III, I. Secondly, the levels of 7b-I transcripts were higher than those of 7b-II transcripts in most of the tissues analyzed, except in the nervous system where nearly equal levels of 7b-I and 7b-II transcripts were detected. Thirdly, 8b-I transcripts were present only in the cerebellum, whereas in all other tissues and brain regions splice donor site II of exon 8b was exclusively used. Fourthly, splice site II was predominantly used at exon 8c. The levels of 5a and 8c-I transcripts were too low for reliable expression analysis; nevertheless, the respective PCR amplification products were consistently detected in the brain samples (data not shown). Our analysis did not reveal the usage of splice donor site II at exon 4a in any of the tissues studied.</p>

        <p>Next, we examined in-frame alternative splicing of <italic>TCF4</italic> internal exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To monitor the splicing of cassette exons 8â9, we performed PCR with forward and reverse primers in exon 5 and 11, respectively. To evaluate the usage of two alternative splice donor sites at exon 18, we amplified the region spanning exons 10â20 and analyzed the PCR product by restriction with BglII, that has a unique recognition site in the 12 bp region present only in transcripts coding for the + isoforms. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g003">Figure 3B</xref> inclusion of exons 8â9 was prevalent and skipping of exons 8â9 a rare event in most tissues analyzed. Comparable amounts of full-length and Î8â9 transcripts were present only in the <italic>corpus callosum</italic>. The levels of transcripts containing or lacking the extra 12 bps of exon 18 were roughly equal in most tissues analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To compare <italic>TCF4</italic> expression levels in different human tissues more precisely, we performed quantitative PCR with three pairs of primers designed to amplify all <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts (products spanning exons 10â11, 17â18 or 19â20). The obtained relative values were normalized to the expression levels of four house-keeping genes as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. We found that <italic>TCF4</italic> mRNA levels were considerably elevated in fetal brain and adult cerebellum â approximately 200 and 100 times above the levels measured in colon, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Compared to the levels in colon, about 40-fold higher levels were detected in cerebral cortex and spleen and more than 10-fold higher levels were seen in uterus, lung, thymus and placenta. The lowest quantities of <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts were present in fetal liver, pancreas and colon. From these results we concluded that although the expression of <italic>TCF4</italic> is ubiquitous, its levels vary considerably between tissues. Particularly, we turned our attention to high expression levels of <italic>TCF4</italic> in the nervous system and carried out <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments on sections from human hippocampus and cerebellum to characterize <italic>TCF4</italic> expression at cellular level.

        <title>Several TCF4 protein isoforms are expressed in human tissues</title>
        <p>We next asked whether and which of the different TCF4 protein isoforms are translated <italic>in vivo</italic>. To address this question we monitored the expression of endogenous TCF4 isoforms in different human tissue extracts by western blotting with TCF4-specific antibodies that recognize an epitope present in all described TCF4 isoforms. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g005">Figure 5A</xref> multiple TCF4 isoforms were present in human lung, liver, kidney, muscle and testis. In these tissues we detected three prominent bands that were assigned as high, medium and low molecular weight (Mw) TCF4. In case of frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum low molecular weight TCF4 band was predominant and the signals of medium and high Mw TCF4 were very low. The levels of high or medium Mw TCF4 were elevated relative to other forms of TCF4 in testis or lung, respectively. To validate the specificity of the TCF4 antibodies, we implemented a RNAi based approach in Neuro2A mouse neuroblastoma cells. Similarly to the human tissue extracts, high, medium and low Mw bands were detected in the lysates of Neuro2A cells by western blotting with the TCF4 antibodies. Compared to mock and scrambled siRNA transfected cells the levels of all three forms were reduced in cells transfected with three different siRNAs targeting <italic>TCF4</italic> exon 12 or 20 that are present in all described <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), thus verifying that the TCF4 antibodies used in the current study specifically recognize TCF4 proteins.</p>

        <p>In order to define the nature of the three bands, we cloned the coding regions of isoforms TCF4-A â TCF4-I into pCDNA mammalian expression vector. In addition, we cloned variants coding for + and â isoforms, full-length and Î isoforms. We transfected the obtained plasmids into HEK293 cells and detected the overexpressed proteins by western blotting with TCF4-specific antibodies. The different TCF4 isoforms were expressed at variable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The levels of isoforms TCF4-B<sup>+</sup>, -B<sup>â</sup>, -BÎ<sup>+</sup>, -BÎ<sup>â</sup>, -CÎ<sup>â</sup>, -A<sup>+</sup>, -A<sup>â</sup>, -H<sup>â</sup> and -I<sup>â</sup> were high, those of TCF4-C<sup>â</sup> and -D<sup>â</sup> medium, and those of TCF4-E<sup>â</sup> and -F<sup>â</sup> low. Expression of TCF4-G<sup>â</sup> was not detected by western blotting. Although it was not possible to distinguish all isoforms from each other by size, we compared side by side the bands detected in human muscle and testis to different TCF4 isoforms translated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) and made the following conclusions about the nature of the three bands in human tissue extracts: the high Mw TCF4 fractionates similarly to TCF4-B and -C, the medium Mw TCF4 similarly to TCF4-D, and low Mw TCF4 to TCF4-A and TCF4-H. In addition, a few proteins with smaller molecular weight than any of the cloned TCF4 isoforms were detected in several tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These could be non-specific signals, represent TCF4 proteolytic fragments or undescribed TCF4 isoforms. In sum, the above described <italic>TCF4</italic> gene structure and expression data demonstrate that multiple TCF4 isoforms are present in human tissues and suggest that the isoforms could potentially differ in their functional properties.</p>

        <p>Since all isoforms with exclusively nuclear distribution contain the amino acids coded by exons 8â9 and the isoforms with broader intracellular localization are devoid of these amino acids, we searched for possible nuclear localization signal (NLS) in this region. Using PSORT software we identified a potential bipartite NLS that contains two clusters of basic amino acids (RRR and KKVRK) separated by a linker of 11 amino acids. The two clusters are conserved in TCF4 of <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, and also in two other E-proteins E2A and HEB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). To validate the NLS we performed site-directed mutagenesis in the context of TCF4-B<sup>â</sup> isoform and replaced the basic amino acids in cluster 1, 2 or both with alanines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g006">Figure 6C</xref> mutagenesis of either cluster 1 (M1) or 2 (M2) produced a protein that is partly cytoplasmic, but even when both clusters were mutated (M1+2) a substantial portion of the protein remained nuclear, similarly to the genuine TCF4 isoforms not containing the region coded by exons 8â9. As a next step we fused the NLS to the C-terminus of EGFP and monitored its localization in HEK293 cells. EGFP-NLS fusion protein was confined to the nucleus whereas control EGFP was distributed diffusely all over the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). From these results we concluded that the identified NLS is functional, but additional region(s) responsible for nuclear import of isoforms lacking the amino acids coded by exons 8â9 exist in TCF4 protein.</p>
        <p>Another region with high basic charge density is located in the DNA-binding domain of TCF4. To test whether this part of the protein is able to mediate nuclear import we constructed different fusion proteins where the entire bHLH domain or its N-terminal or C-terminal part is fused with EGFP. The fusion proteins were overexpressed in HEK293 cells and their localization was studied by direct EGFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). EGFP-bHLH was present in the nucleus and cytoplasm indicating that the bHLH domain was to some extent able to direct the protein to the nucleus, since in contrast to EGFP (29 kDa), the EGFP-bHLH (43 kDa) fusion protein cannot be transported to the nucleus by passive mechanisms due to its higher molecular mass. At the same time EGFP-bHLH-N (36 kDa) and EGFP-bHLH-C (37 kDa) were detected only in the cytoplasm, meaning that neither part alone was able to mediate nuclear import. These data led us to hypothesize that structural integrity of the bHLH domain is necessary for EGFP-bHLH nuclear localization mediated by heterodimerization with endogenous NLS bearing HLH-proteins. To test this assumption, we co-expressed EGFP and the described fusion proteins together with known TCF4 dimerization partners: E2-tagged NeuroD2 (Gene 18013), that features nuclear localization, and mCherry-fused Id2 (Gene 15902), that bears a nuclear export signal (NES) and is similarly to the described EGFP-Id2 fusion protein <xref rid="pone.0022138-Kurooka1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> predominantly cytoplasmic. The results of this assay showed that NeuroD2-E2 did not influence the distribution of EGFP and EGFP-bHLH-N, but was able to direct EGFP-bHLH and to lesser extent also EGFP-bHLH-C to the nucleus. Co-expression of mCherry-Id2 altered only the localization of EGFP-bHLH by excluding it from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). We additionally monitored the effects of NeuroD2-E2 and mCherry-Id2 co-expression on the localization of genuine NLS-lacking TCF4 isoform A<sup>â</sup>. Similarly to EGFP-bHLH, the distribution of TCF4-A<sup>â</sup> was guided by its heterodimerization partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Altogether these results demonstrate that TCF4 can be directed to the nucleus by two mechanisms. Firstly, isoforms that bear the NLS independently translocate to the nucleus. Secondly, all TCF4 isoforms can be transported to the nucleus by a piggy-back mechanism through heterodimerization with NLS containing bHLH partners. Additionally, isoforms lacking NLS can be exported from the nucleus by heterodimerization with NES containing partner proteins.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, we examined the intracellular distribution of endogenous TCF4. For this we chose to study human hippocampus and cerebellum because of high TCF4 expression levels in these brain regions. We performed immunohistochemical staining of the sections using TCF4 and neuronal marker NeuN or glial marker GFAP specific antibodies, followed by confocal microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g006">Figure 6F</xref>, TCF4 signal was found mainly in the neuronal nuclei but also in the cytoplasm of neurons in different hippocampal regions (CA, dentate gyrus, hilus) and cerebellar granular layer. Of note, the TCF4 antibody additionally marked processes of GFAP-positive cells in tissues and rat primary cultures, but to our knowledge this glial cytoplasmic signal is non-specific as no such staining was observed when tagged TCF4 isoforms were overexpressed in cultured rat glial cells and stained with tag-specific antibodies (data not shown).</p>

TCF4-C<sup>â</sup> activated reporter gene transcription over 10 and TCF4-C Î<sup>â</sup> almost 50 times.

The two isoforms with low expression level, TCF4-E<sup>â</sup> and -F<sup>â</sup>, activated reporter gene transcription about 7- and 21-fold, correspondingly.

Search for correlations revealed a strong positive relationship between the presence of full-length AD1 and isoform's ability to transactivate in HEK293 cells (point biserial correlation coefficient râ=â0.87, p&lt;0.00011). There were no significant correlations between the isoform's capacity to activate transcription and the presence of NLS, presence of only the C-terminal part of AD1 or presence of the extra four amino acids in the + isoforms. These results indicate that, although to a different extent, all TCF4 isoforms analyzed are able to activate transcription controlled by ÂµE5 E-boxes in HEK293 cells.</p>

        <p>To study further the individual role of TCF4 transcription activation domains AD1 and AD2, we took two approaches. Firstly, we compared the abilities of artificial TCF4-B<sup>â</sup> without AD2 (ÎAD2) and native TCF4-A<sup>â</sup> to regulate E-box controlled transcription. TCF4-B<sup>â</sup> ÎAD2 contains the AD1 and TCF4-A<sup>â</sup> the AD2 domain, both have the bHLH domain. Secondly, we used heterologic constructs where AD1 or AD2 is fused with GAL4 DNA binding domain and E2 epitope-tag. We assessed the ability of the GAL4 fusion proteins to activate reporter transcription from pG5luc vector that carries GAL4 binding sites in front of firefly luciferase <italic>luc</italic> gene. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g007">Figures 7B and 7C</xref> similar reporter gene activation levels were achieved with TCF4-B<sup>â</sup> ÎAD2 compared to TCF4-A<sup>â</sup>, and GAL4-AD1-E2 compared to GAL4-AD2-E2 in HEK293 cells. When joined to native bHLH DNA binding domain, 24 or 18 fold upregulation of reporter gene transcription were seen with AD1 or AD2 containing proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) When fused with heterologic GAL4 DNA binding domain, AD1 activated transcription about 10 times and AD2 about 24 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). We noted that when both activation domains are present in a single protein as is the case for TCF4-B isoforms, the activation of transcription exceeds the additive effect of AD1 and AD2, suggesting that the two domains may act synergistically in HEK293 cells. To test this we studied the transactivation capacity of GAL4 fusion proteins that contain both TCF4 activation domains joined by native or heterologic amino acids. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g007">Figure 7C</xref> these proteins activated reporter transcription approximately 100 and 50 times, respectively. In both cases the activation fold exceeded the additive effect of single TCF4 activation domain containing GAL4 fusion proteins. All the compared proteins were expressed at similar levels in HEK293 cells as determined by western blotting with TCF4 or E2-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022138-g007">Figures 7D and 7E</xref>). Altogether these data show that the two activation domains are capable of mediating transactivation to a similar extent in HEK293 cells. Additionally, the results indicate that when both activation domains are present in a single protein, the two domains act synergistically in HEK293 cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Large-scale human transcriptome analyses have revealed that more than 90% of protein-coding genes undergo alternative splicing and around half have two or more alternative promoters <xref rid="pone.0022138-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Gustincich1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0022138-Baek1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Additionally, over-representation of alternative promoters has been attributed to genes involved in development and regulation of transcription <xref rid="pone.0022138-Baek1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Here, we demonstrate that the human gene for the transcription factor TCF4 is transcribed using 21 mutually exclusive 5â² initial exons, many of which contain more than one transcription start sites and/or splice donor sites. These 5â² exons are located at various positions in the gene interspersed with internal exons 1â9, followed by constitutive internal exons 10â20 and 3â² exon 21. Therefore, <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts containing different number of internal exons are generated and, according to our data, these are expressed at comparable levels in human tissues and potentially encode for TCF4 protein isoforms with 18 different N-termini. We named the isoforms TCF4-A â TCF4-R in agreement with the previous studies that have described three N-terminally distinct isoforms, i.e. TCF4-A, -B and -D <xref rid="pone.0022138-Corneliussen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Skerjanc1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Additionally, several studies have described TCF4 isoforms differing by the presence or absence of four amino acids (RSRS) N-terminal to the bHLH domain <xref rid="pone.0022138-Corneliussen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Skerjanc1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, which are denoted here as + and â isoforms, respectively. These isoforms result from alternative splice donor site selection at exon 18 and their mRNAs are present at comparable levels in most human tissues analyzed here. We show that in human <italic>TCF4</italic> gene there is another site of alternative splicing at internal exons 8â9. Transcripts lacking these exons are expressed at low levels in human tissues and code for protein isoforms indicated with Î in this study.</p>
      <p>One by one analysis of alternative 5â² exons containing <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts' expression and quantitative analysis of overall <italic>TCF4</italic> expression in human tissues corroborated the concept of TCF4 being a ubiquitous transcription factor. Most alternative 5â² exons containing transcripts were broadly expressed. Nevertheless, expression of transcripts containing 5â² exons 1a, 1b, 3a and 5c was detected only in a few tissues including testis and prostate. These exons originate from exonization of different transposable elements (TEs) or are located immediately behind a TE in the human genome. Incorporation of TE-derived sequences into promoters or UTR or coding regions of genes has been documented by many studies <xref rid="pone.0022138-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0022138-vandeLagemaat1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In accordance with the restricted expression of TE-dependent <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts, TEs are known to be transcriptionally silenced in most mammalian tissues as a defense mechanism against potentially deleterious effects of their activity <xref rid="pone.0022138-Yoder1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Zamudio1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. TE-dependent <italic>TCF4</italic> transcripts code for 5 unique TCF4 protein isoforms with long N-termini (TCF4-J â TCF4-N). Since it was not possible to distinguish all TCF4 isoforms from each other by SDS-PAGE fractionation, we were not able to conclusively determine which protein isoforms are expressed in human tissues; nevertheless, we detected three prominent TCF4 forms of different molecular weight. Notably, high Mw TCF4 protein was relatively more abundant in testis, medium Mw TCF4 in lung and low Mw TCF4 was the major form in the brain tissue, insinuating that the ratio of different TCF4 isoforms with distinct N-termini is varied between human tissues.</p>
      <p>Our report reveals that although broadly expressed, <italic>TCF4</italic> transcript levels differ greatly between tissues. The highest levels are present in fetal brain, but expression remains elevated also in adult brain where we detected <italic>TCF4</italic> mRNA and protein in neurons. These findings are consistent with earlier studies that have demonstrated TCF4 expression in human or rodent nervous system <xref rid="pone.0022138-Skerjanc1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Pscherer1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0022138-dePontual1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and further support the important role for TCF4 in the development and functioning of the nervous system as exemplified by involvement of TCF4 in the pontine nucleus development in mice, association of <italic>TCF4</italic> with schizophrenia and identification of <italic>TCF4</italic> haploinsufficiency as the cause of Pitt-Hopkins mental retardation syndrome <xref rid="pone.0022138-Flora1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Stefansson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0022138-Amiel1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Interestingly, translocation that results in a <italic>TCF4</italic> allele without at least 6 upper 5â² exons has been described in a patient with mild mental retardation <xref rid="pone.0022138-Kalscheuer1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Possibly, in this patient, initiation of <italic>TCF4</italic> transcription at downstream 5â² exons still takes place, explaining the less severe phenotype than in classical Pitt-Hopkins syndrome patients. Nevertheless, it seems that for production of sufficient amounts of TCF4 protein and normal development, the presence of all transcription initiation sites is critical. Based on experiments with <italic>HEB</italic> and <italic>E2A</italic> knockout mice, it has been suggested that the overall E-protein dosage is more crucial in the development of nervous system than family member identity <xref rid="pone.0022138-Ravanpay1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. However, since even slight disturbances in <italic>TCF4</italic> expression in human cause a neurodevelopmental disorder and <italic>TCF4</italic> knockout mice display disrupted pontine nucleus development <xref rid="pone.0022138-Flora1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, it is apparent that other E-proteins are not able to compensate for the loss of TCF4 in all aspects of the nervous system development. Additionally, transgenic mice with mild overexpression of <italic>TCF4</italic> in forebrain display deficits in contextual and cued fear conditioning and sensorimotor gating <xref rid="pone.0022138-Brzozka1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, indicating that precise regulation of <italic>TCF4</italic> expression is crucial for correct brain function and deviations in either way result in cognitive disturbances. All this substantiates the complex structure and the high number of 5â² exons in <italic>TCF4</italic> gene, as these probably enable proper amounts of TCF4 protein to be synthesized. It is noteworthy that according to the <italic>TCF4</italic> gene structure described here, the SNP rs9960767 associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0022138-Stefansson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> is located in <italic>TCF4</italic> intronic sequence between 5â² exons 5b and 5c. However, whether and how this marker is coupled to dysregulation of <italic>TCF4</italic> expression remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>The variety of TCF4 isoforms raises a question â are they produced only for sufficient amount of TCF4 proteins or are the functions of different isoforms divergent? In the present study we have shown that the alternative TCF4 isoforms differ in two aspects: first, their intracellular distribution is differentially regulated depending on the presence or absence of a nuclear localization signal; second, their ability to activate E-box controlled transcription is varied depending mainly on whether they contain one or two functional transcription activation domains. We discovered in the region coded by exons 8â9, upstream of AD2, a bipartite NLS that is responsible for nuclear localization of TCF4 isoforms with longer N-termini. This NLS is conserved among E-proteins and mutating the second half of the NLS has been demonstrated to reduce nuclear import of E2A <xref rid="pone.0022138-Lingbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. TCF4 isoforms with shorter N-termini (TCF4-A, -H and -I) and Î isoforms do not contain the NLS. Our analysis shows that these proteins are transported to the nucleus via heterodimerization with NLS-bearing partners and directed to the cytoplasm by forming dimers with NES-containing proteins. As substantial amount of NLS-lacking TCF4 isoforms overexpressed in HEK293 cells is localized to the nuclei, there must be abundance of NLS-containing heterodimerization partners expressed endogenously. This is not surprising since TCF4 is able to form dimers with a variety of class B bHLH factors <xref rid="pone.0022138-Massari1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, we noticed that NLS-bearing TCF4-B isoform was not able to mediate nuclear redirection of NLS-lacking TCF4-A isoform (data not shown), suggesting that TCF4 homodimers are not efficiently formed in HEK293 cells.</p>
      <p>E-proteins function as transcription activators or repressors <xref rid="pone.0022138-Murre1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In our reporter assays all TCF4 isoforms were able to activate transcription from a promoter containing ÂµE5 E-boxes in HEK293 cells whereas TCF4-B isoforms were more potent transactivators than other isoforms. All the studied isoforms contain the AD2 domain, but only TCF4-B isoforms contain full-length AD1, including exon 3 encoded LDFS motif that is known to be required for AD1 mediated transactivation by recruiting histone acetyltransferases <xref rid="pone.0022138-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Massari3" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This motif is present also in some of the TE-dependent isoforms (TCF4-J, -K, and -L) that were not included in our reporter assays. We suggest that the AD1 acts synergistically with the AD2, since the additive effect of individual capacities of these domains to activate transcription is surpassed by proteins that contain both TCF4 activation domains. Similar synergism between two activation domains has been described in bHLH-zipper protein TFE3 and POU homeodomain protein Oct-2 <xref rid="pone.0022138-Artandi1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022138-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In contrast to a study on <italic>FGF-1</italic> promoter that proposed differential roles for TCF4 + and â isoforms <xref rid="pone.0022138-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, we saw no differences between the + and â isoforms in ability to activate transcription from ÂµE5 E-boxes controlled promoter. However, we noticed higher reporter gene transcription in the presence of Î isoforms than the respective full-length isoforms, probably due to higher expression levels of Î isoforms compared to full-length isoforms. This indicates that NLS coding region absent in Î isoforms could affect the stability of TCF4 proteins. In sum, we show that differences in the functioning of alternative TCF4 isoforms do exist. In the light of the knowledge that an isoform of HEB, homologous to TCF4-A, is specifically required for the generation of T-cell precursors <italic>in vivo</italic> and this function cannot be carried out by the HEB isoform homologous to TCF4âB <xref rid="pone.0022138-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, it would be of importance to study the distinct functions of TCF4 isoforms by rescue experiments with different TCF4 isoforms in <italic>TCF4</italic> knockout background.</p>

Both, constructs coding for native TCF4 and C-terminally V5/His-tagged TCF4 isoforms, were created. TCF4-B<sup>â</sup> amino acid sequence is used as a reference for the description of following TCF4 constructs. pEGFP-C1-C3 (Clontech) were used for generation of pEGFP-NLS, pEGFP-bHLH, pEGFP-bHLH-N and pEGFP-bHLH-C that code for EGFP fusion proteins containing TCF4 amino acids P156-P178, I541-M667, I541-K585 and E586-M667, respectively.

        <title>Luciferase assays</title>
        <p>Cells on 48-well plates were lysed 24 hours post-transfection in 50 Âµl Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Dual-Glo Luciferase assay (Promega) was performed following manufacturer's instructions and luminescence was measured with GENios pro (Tecan) plate reader. For data analysis background signals from untransfected cells were subtracted and firefly luciferase signal values were normalized to <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase signals. The obtained data were log-transformed, autoscaled, means and standard deviations (SD) were calculated and t-tests for analyses of statistical significance were performed. For graphical representation, the data were back-transformed to the original scale. Error bars represent upper and lower limits back-transformed as mean+SD and meanâSD, respectively. Correlation analysis was performed with tools at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/pbcorr.html">http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/pbcorr.html</ext-link>.</p>

The exons' names are given above each aligned region. The nucleotides in the aligned regions are numbered according to human genome assembly March 2006 NCBI36/hg18, chimp genome assembly March 2006 CGSC 2.1/panTro2, mouse genome assembly July 2007 NCBI37/mm9, rat genome assembly November 2004 Baylor 3.4/rn4 and rhesus genome assembly January 2006 MGSC merged 1.0/rheMac2. Alignments were produced with ClustalW and the percentages of identity were calculated between human TCF4 5â² exon sequence and the respective mouse sequence using Needleman-Wunsch global alignment. The exon sequences are in bold case, internal exons are in blue and sequences of primers used for expression analysis are underlined. Dotted blue lines above the sequences indicate transposable elements. Arabic numerals above exonic sequences indicate the number of human ESTs starting at the respective position and obtained from oligo-cap, cap-trapping and SMART libraries available in public databases through UCSC genome browser as of 3rd of November 2010. Possible in-frame translation start codons are shaded in gray. For each in-frame ATG codon NetStart translation start score is shown above the start codon. When needed the locations of alternative splice donor sites are indicated with blue roman numerals above the first intronic nucleotides (or above the first internal exon nucleotides in case of exon 7b-II).</p>
