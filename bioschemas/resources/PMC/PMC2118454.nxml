      <abstract>
        <p>Nearly 50 million people worldwide suffer from age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which causes severe loss of central vision. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the gene for the complement regulator factor H (FH), which causes a Tyr-to-His substitution at position 402, is linked to â¼50% of attributable risks for AMD. We present the crystal structure of the region of FH containing the polymorphic amino acid His402 in complex with an analogue of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that localize the complement regulator on the cell surface. The structure demonstrates direct coordination of ligand by the disease-associated polymorphic residue, providing a molecular explanation of the genetic observation. This glycan-binding site occupies the center of an extended interaction groove on the regulator's surface, implying multivalent binding of sulfated GAGs. This finding is confirmed by structure-based site-directed mutagenesis, nuclear magnetic resonanceâmonitored binding experiments performed for both H402 and Y402 variants with this and another model GAG, and analysis of an extended GAGâFH complex.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the major cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly population of the developed world (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The disease is characterized by loss of central vision, which is caused by progressive deterioration of the macula, with symptoms presenting in old age. A significant risk factor for development of the disease has recently been demonstrated to be a common allelic variant of complement factor H (FH) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), resulting in a tyrosine/histidine polymorphism at position 402 (384 in the mature protein) (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Individuals heterozygous for the His-form are 2.7-fold more likely to develop AMD (50% of the attributable risk factors) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), whereas risk of AMD increases by &gt;7.4-fold for His402 homozygotes (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The physiological role of FH, which consists of 20 short consensus repeat (SCR) or complement control protein (CCP) modules (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), is to regulate complement by accelerating the decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase and by acting as a cofactor for factor Iâmediated proteolysis of C3b (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). It is capable of complement regulation in both the fluid phase and on the surface of cells, where it is localized via binding to cell surface polyanions (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), such as sialic acid and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of proteoglycans. Specific polyanion binding has been definitively mapped to SCR20 at the C terminus of FH (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and also to SCR7 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), which contains the polymorphic residue 402. Sites in other SCRs have been proposed, but no final consensus has been reached on their possible physiological relevance (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, FH has been shown to bind C-reactive protein (CRP), also via SCR7, thereby contributing to noninflammatory phagocytosis of damaged tissue (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
    <p>The late onset of AMD implies that any alterations in natural function caused by the polymorphism are likely to be subtle, and may be linked to age-related alterations of retinal GAG composition (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It has been observed that the relative affinities of the two polymorphs for subtly different ligands vary greatly (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Collectively, the current data imply that the FH Tyr402His polymorphism alters the precise specificity and affinity of its interaction with GAGs and CRP on the cell surface, leading to altered levels of FH retention on the retinal/macular surface, and thereby affecting complement activity in the area. NMR structures of SCR7s from both polymorphs (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) have demonstrated that their structures are identical, including the orientation of the altered sidechain. To gain insight into the functional consequences of the Y402H polymorphism, we have determined the crystal structure at 2.35 Ã of the H402 variant of a three-domain region of FH surrounding the site of AMD-associated polymorphism (FH SCR6â8; hereafter termed FH-678<sub>402H</sub>) in complex with sucrose octasulfate (SOS), which is a highly sulfated sugar analogue of GAGs. To validate the SOS interactions to more physiologically relevant GAG interactions, we have performed NMR-monitored titrations using His402 and Tyr402 versions of various FH constructs, and of both SOS and a highly sulfated heparin tetrasaccharide. These experiments (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1</ext-link>) demonstrate that both of these sulfated analogues of natural GAGs have identical binding modes and validate our selection of SOS for the crystallographic studies of FHâGAG binding.</p>

        <title>Crystallographic structure of FH modules 6â8 in complex with SOS</title>
        <p>The inherently flexible nature of the 20-module-long FH renders it a difficult target for atomic resolution structure determination. Therefore, we designed constructs containing the disease-implicated SCR7 flanked on either side by a single SCR module (SCR6 and 8). Both histidine and tyrosine polymorphs were characterized for their different GAG interaction characteristics (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and both were shown to exhibit subtly different GAG-binding specificities (Fig S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Crystallization trials with both variants with and without a sugar ligand (SOS) were performed (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>); however, only the combination of the His402 construct with a 10-fold molar excess of SOS yielded crystals. NMR was used to check that another model GAG (a highly sulfated heparin-derived tetrasaccharide) binds in a similar way to SOS. The structure was solved using a combination of molecular replacement (with the NMR structure for SCR7 [reference <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) and experimental phases (see Materials and methods and Supplemental materials and methods). The FH678<sub>402H</sub> structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) adopts an extended, but slightly curved, conformation, with a tight interface between SCR6 and 7, and weaker interactions between SCR7 and 8.SOS is seen to mediate the vast majority of crystal contacts, explaining the observation that crystallization only occurred in the presence of SOS (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The NMR and crystal structures of FH7<sub>402H</sub> are identical, showing that the His402 sidechain adopts the same conformation in the absence or presence of SOS. The Tyr402 sidechain in the NMR structure of FH7<sub>402H</sub>, also adopted this conformation. These observations strongly imply that the NMR structure of FH7<sub>402H</sub>, together with the crystal structure of FH678<sub>402H</sub>, provide an excellent basis upon which to reliably model the structure of the FH678<sub>402Y</sub> structure, which could not be crystallized.</p>

        <title>Direct role for AMD-related polymorphic residue in glycan binding</title>
        <p>The crystals of FH678<sub>402H</sub> contain SOS bound to several distinct sites spanning multiple SCRs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Significantly, the AMD-associated His402 residue in SCR7 is directly hydrogen bonded to a sulfate group of the ligand; His402 and His360 from SCR6 form a histidine clamp around SOS sulfate groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1</ext-link>). The mode of sulfate recognition observed for this ligand is incompatible with the presence of a tyrosine sidechain at position 402, as observed in the previously solved three-dimensional structure of the isolated FH7<sub>402Y</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This explains the key earlier observations that the His402 and Tyr402 FH variants have altered affinities and specificities for differently sulfated GAGs (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The rest of this binding site is dominated by hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals contacts with the backbone, with an additional contribution from the more distant positively charged Lys405 (which has been previously implicated in heparin binding by mutagenesis [references <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Significantly, the SOS at this site is present in major and minor conformations in the native protein crystals, related by a rotation of the sulfated fructose ring (Fig. S4 and Supplemental materials and methods). This conformational difference in SOS is accompanied by reorganization of the sidechain of Tyr390 that accommodates one of the repositioned sulfate groups. In the ligand-free form of FH7, only the minor conformation of the tyrosine sidechain is observed (NMR structure of isolated FH7 [reference <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). A role for Tyr390 in binding heparin is consistent with NMR chemical shift perturbation studies on SCR7 studied in isolation from SCR6 and 8 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). A secondary SOS-binding site is observed on the opposite face of SCR7. However, ambiguous electron density at this site only allowed modeling of the coordinated sugar sulfates at this site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Supplemental materials and methods). These sulfates contact the Arg404 and Lys410 sidechains, which were previously implicated in heparin binding by mutagenesis (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and they are also consistent with the NMR chemical shift perturbation studies of isolated FH7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>

        <title>Definition of a novel glycan-binding site in SCR6 and additional sites across SCR7 and 8</title>
        <p>Unexpectedly, in addition to the involvement of H360 from SCR6 in the major SCR7-centered binding site, the structure reveals a previously undescribed GAG-binding site contained entirely within SCR6. This third site is chemically similar to that seen in SCR7, with a central positively charged residue (Arg341) flanked by two histidine sidechains (His337 and His371) that directly coordinate two ligand sulfate groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and Fig. S1). Analysis of the SOS surface area buried within the two major binding sites in SCR6 and 7, using the program MSDpisa (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), demonstrates that they have similarly sized ligand interfaces (253 and 217 Ã<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Finally, a fourth SOS-binding site in the crystal was observed in the linker between SCR7 and 8; it involves a salt bridge between an SOS sulfate and Arg444.</p>

        <title>Mutagenesis and chemical shift perturbations support the hypothesis of extended GAG interactions across the surface of SCR6â8</title>
        <p>Previous work has mapped GAG-binding sites on FH to single modules that are spread over the length of FH. In addition to SCR7 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the C-terminal module (SCR20) (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and SCR9 and 13 have been implicated in this respect (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The electrostatic potential computed from our crystal structure shows that the three GAG-analogue binding sites for which full density could be observed occupy a positively charged groove extending over all three modules of FH678<sub>402H</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1</ext-link>). In addition to the AMD-related polymorphism, which lies at the center of the major binding site in SCR7 within this channel, other residues (Arg387, Lys388, and Lys405) previously implicated in polyanion recognition by mutagenesis (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) also line this groove. Thus, we hypothesize that rather than binding to discrete modules of FH as previously supposed, a GAG molecule on the cell surface can span multiple neighboring modules within the protein. To test this model, and to show that GAG binding is not entirely SCR7 dependent, we performed NMR chemical shift perturbation studies. By titrating either SOS or a highly sulfated heparin tetrasaccharide into <sup>15</sup>N-labeled FH78 (in either allelic form), large chemical shift perturbations were observed for residues 443â447 in the SCR7â8 linker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>, and Fig. S1). This binding site includes the Arg444 seen to contact SOS in the crystal structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Interestingly, chemical shift perturbations corresponding to the secondary SOS-binding site in SCR7 (Arg404/Lys410), which was observed in NMR studies of SCR7 alone (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), are no longer observed in the context of FH78, suggesting that the FH78 linker site outcompetes the Arg404/Lys410 site. No appreciable chemical shift perturbations were detected for His402, implying the major SCR7-binding site observed in the crystal is not occupied in the absence of the contribution of His360 from SCR6.</p>
        <p>To further validate the multiple GAG-binding sites, we generated three domain-deletion FH constructs (FH56, FH67<sub>402H</sub>, and FH78<sub>402H</sub>) and mutated residues within the newly identified SCR6 GAG-binding site. GAG-binding was assayed using heparin-affinity chromatography (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>, and Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1</ext-link>). FH56, which completely lacks the previously defined GAG-binding site in SCR7, specifically binds to a heparin-affinity column, demonstrating binding by the SCR6 site in the absence of the SCR7-centered site. The presence of SCR8 greatly increases the affinity of the FH constructs for heparin, which is in agreement with the NMR studies. The contributions made by the various binding sites to heparin binding are further demonstrated by analysis of the pH dependency of the deletion constructs. FH56 and FH67<sub>402H</sub> bind with a higher affinity at a more acidic pH, presumably caused by increasing protonation of the His residues that dominate the binding sites in SCR6 and 7. Binding of FH78<sub>402H</sub> on the other hand, is not pH-dependent in the physiological range, confirming the dominance of Arg/Lys residues in the binding site at the SCR7â8 linker. To further probe the novel GAG-binding site in SCR6, point mutations were made in the FH67<sub>402H</sub> construct, and heparin-binding was assessed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Mutation of either His337 or Arg341 to Ala reduces the affinity of FH67<sub>402H</sub> for heparin relative to the native FH67<sub>402H</sub>, proving a role for these residues in GAG binding.</p>

        <title>Implications for natural function and the disease state</title>
        <p>The crystal structure and supporting characterization we present in this study formally demonstrate the presence of multiple GAG-binding sites in FH SCR6â8, which is consistent with a single bound GAG molecule spanning all three modules (Fig. S5). As a further test of this hypothesis, we have also performed an analytical ultracentrifugation analysis of a mixture of extended heparins (dp18 or dp24, selected to be long enough to bridge between the SCR6 and 8 binding sites) and FH678. This analysis (Fig. S7 and Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071069/DC1</ext-link>) reveals that the complex formed, with both variants, has a stoichiometry of 1 FH678:1 heparin molecule, as predicted by our hypothesis of extended interactions with long GAGs. Therefore, we propose a model by which GAG binding to all three modules acts in tandem with binding to SCR20 to localize FH to surface and simultaneously grasp C3b in a pincer grip, accelerating the decay of the C3 convertase assembly and promoting recruitment of factor I (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). We also demonstrate that the polymorphic AMD-associated residue is directly involved in this binding. Switching between histidine and tyrosine at position 402 of FH will alter the mode of GAG binding by changing the specificity for particular sulfation patterns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), as previously observed experimentally (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This ability of FH to register the presence or absence of a single, specific sulfate group within the context of a longer GAG is shown to be dependent on which amino acid residue occupies position 402. Such a subtle effect of the SCR 7 polymorphism is entirely consistent with the obvious fact that either allotype functions adequately in the majority of tissue contexts, and even in the macula until old age. In combination with age-related alterations of retinal GAG composition (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), differences in tissue localization and retention of the polymorphic forms of FH would become significant in the retina over the decades taken for AMD to develop.</p>

When repeated in the SeMet-1 density, the SOS was placed in an alternate conformation.

A secondary SOS-binding site was identified on another face of FH-678<sub>402H</sub> on a crystallographic twofold down the y axis. Attempts to fit an asymmetric SOS into the symmetric residual density were not satisfactory; therefore, only the major density residuals with a tetrahedral shape were modeled with sulfate molecules.</p>
