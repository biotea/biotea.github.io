        <p>The DEAD-box helicase DDX3 has suggested functions in innate immunity, mRNA translocation and translation, and it participates in the propagation of assorted viruses. Exploring initially the role of DDX3 in the life cycle of hepatitis C virus, we observed the protein to be involved in translation directed by different viral internal ribosomal entry sites. Extension of these studies revealed a general supportive role of DDX3 in translation initiation. DDX3 was found to interact in an RNA-independent manner with defined components of the translational pre-initiation complex and to specifically associate with newly assembling 80S ribosomes. DDX3 knock down and <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution experiments revealed a significant function of the protein in the formation of 80S translation initiation complexes. Our study implies that DDX3 assists the 60S subunit joining process to assemble functional 80S ribosomes.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic protein synthesis involves translation initiation, elongation, termination and the recycling of ribosomes. The canonical translation initiation process on capped mRNAs consists of two intricate steps that eventually lead to the assembly of 80S initiation complexes where the anticodon of an aminoacylated initiator tRNA (mostly MetâtRNAi) is base-paired with the mRNAâs initiation codon in the ribosomal P(peptidyl)-site. In the current model [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B2">2</xref>) and references herein; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F1">Figure 1</xref>], a pre-assembled 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) that consists of a small 40S ribosomal subunit, the translation initiation factors eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, conceivably eIF5 and the ternary eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi complex (TC), first associates with the 5â²-region of the mRNA. During this process, structures in the mRNAâs 5â²-untranslated region (5â²-UTR) are unwound in an ATP-dependent manner involving eIF4F and eIF4B. eIF4F is a protein complex that includes the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the helicase eIF4A and the âscaffoldâ protein eIF4G, the latter of which binds to eIF3, eIF4E, eIF4A and the poly A binding protein PABP. Interactions of eIF4F with the cap (<italic>via</italic> eIF4E) and with PABP and the poly A tail (<italic>via</italic> eIF4G) generates a loop structure of the mRNA. The PIC then scans in 5â²â3â² direction for translation initiation codons. A matching contact of an initiation codon with the anticodon in MetâtRNAi switches the scanning complex to a âclosed conformationâ that is discernible as 48S complex. Subsequent dislocation of eIF1 leads to eIF5-mediated GTP-hydrolysis in the TC. In the second step of translation initiation, eIF5B triggers the attachment of the 60S subunit to the 48S complex and the simultaneous displacement of eIF2âGDP, eIF1, eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4G and eIF5. The initiation process is concluded by eIF5B-mediated GTP hydrolysis and release of eIF1A and GDP-bound eIF5B from the assembled, elongation-competent 80S ribosome. The next codon-complementary aminoacylâtRNA may now associate into the A(aminoacyl)-site of the ribosome and the first peptide bond may be produced.
<fig id="gks070-F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Models of cap- and HCV IRES-directed translation; suggested participation of DDX3 in translation initiation. Canonical (cap-mediated) translation is depicted in four stages; â and â represent the translation initiation process (see text). â Binding of the 43S PIC and initiation factors to the 5â²-end of mRNA and formation of the 48S complex (5â²â3â² interactions of the mRNA not shown). â Joining of 60S and assembly of the 80S translation initiation complex. â Elongation and termination phase resulting in 80S post-termination complexes. â Recycling of 80S post-termination complexes and of free 80S ribosomes. In HCV IRES-directed translation initiation, the 43S PIC directly binds to the AUG initiation codon in the absence of eIF4F and without scanning to assemble the 48S complex â. Our data suggest that DDX3 joins the 43S PIC <italic>via</italic> direct (non-RNA mediated) interactions with eIF3 and the 40S subunit. This complex assembles with the mRNA to generate the 48S complex. DDX3 then is involved in conformational changes that favor the release of translation initiation factors and the joining of the 60S subunit. DDX3 remains bound to the 80S translation initiation complex but disassembles prior to the elongation process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gks070f1"/></fig></p><p>The genomes of positive-strand RNA viruses in particular contain highly structured internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) that enable non-canonical interactions of initiation factors and/or of the 40S ribosomal subunit and cap-independent ribosomal recruitment to internal RNA locations. Thus, in the case of the IRES encoded by the 5â²-region of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genome, the 43S PIC directly attaches to the RNA in the absence of scanning and without the participation of eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4B and eIF4F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B4">4</xref>).</p><p>A protein that has been implicated to contribute to the translation initiation process is the multifunctional DEAD-box helicase DDX3. DDX3 was found to be part of cytoplasmic complexes containing eIF2, eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4E and PABP, and mRNA translation was affected by DDX3 overexpression or DDX3 knock down. However, some data suggested that DDX3 acts as a translational suppressor while others indicated DDX3 as a supportive translation factor that gives preference to mRNAs with structured 5â²-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B5 gks070-B6 gks070-B7 gks070-B8">5â8</xref>). This study was set out to further elucidate the role of DDX3 in translation. Applying different experimental systems, we obtained complementary evidence indicating that DDX3 represents a general, auxiliary translation factor that is involved in the second step of the translation initiation process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The HCV constructs were derived from pSGR-JFH1 encoding the bi-cistronic replicon (kindly provided by Dr Wakita, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience).

This study was originally aimed at further investigating the function of DDX3 in the HCV life cycle, and it was initiated by testing the effect of a siRNA-directed intracellular depletion of DDX3 (âDDX3 knock downâ) on HCV replication. For this purpose, we first used Huh7 cells that were persistently transfected with a subgenomic, âbi-cistronicâ HCV replicon RNA [HCV subtype 2A âJFHâ; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B22">22</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>A]. In the bi-cistronic HCV replicon, the HCV IRES directs the translation of a neomycine/geneticin (Neo) resistance gene while synthesis of the viral replicase proteins is enabled by the IRES of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The DDX3 knock down was achieved by transfection of the Huh7/HCV replicon cells with two different siRNAs, each causing a reduction of cytoplasmic DDX3 to â¼15â25% of the original protein level at 72âh post-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Importantly, this moderate depletion of DDX3 had no impact on the cellular growth rate. DDX3 knock down with each of the two siRNAs did not affect the replication of the bi-cistronic HCV replicon in comparison to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>B). However, immunoblotting revealed that the expression levels of Neomycin phosphotransferase as well as that of the HCV-encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>C; reduction of HCV proteins exemplified by NS5A) were considerably lowered in both types of DDX3 knock down cells.

Accordingly, we next investigated the effect of DDX3 knock down on the replication of transiently transfected âmono-cistronicâ HCV replicon. Mono-cistronic HCV replicons resemble the genomic viral RNA such that translation of the NS proteins and RNA replication are exclusively governed by the authentic HCV UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B9">9</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Huh7 cells were first transfected with the anti-DDX3 siRNAs, and 72âh later, re-transfected with the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed HCV RNA. After 48âh, the cells were harvested and the HCV RNA and protein content analyzed. Control experiments ensured that comparable amounts of RNA were transfected in each experiment (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). Thus, in contrast to the data obtained with the established cell line persistently expressing HCV replicon we found a strong reduction of HCV replication in the DDX3 knock down cells that had been transiently transfected with the replicon RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>D). As before, a significantly lowered level of viral protein expression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>E).</p><p>These data suggest that DDX3 is an important functional determinant of HCV IRES- as well as EMCV IRES-mediated translation. The apparently contradictory effect of the DDX3 depletion on viral replication in transiently as opposed to stably transfected cell line is likely due to the fact that the former lack <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of the viral replicase proteins which are necessary for the replication of the viral genome. This is not the case with the persistently transfected cells where a pre-existing abundance of the viral proteins would conceivably sustain viral RNA replication even in the face of DDX3 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DDX3 is generally involved in translation</title><p>To next assess DDX3 for a general role in translation, we generated different types of luciferase-encoding reporter RNAs: i.e. a capped model mRNA (+/â polyâA tail), a capped RNA that contained the 5â²- and 3â²-UTRs of the West Nile virus (WNV) RNA genome, and RNAs that contained the 5â²-UTRs of the EMCV (+/â poly A tail) and HCV genomes (+/â HCV 3â²-UTR), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>F and G; EMCV and WNV data in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). The RNAs were transfected into naÃ¯ve and DDX3-depleted Huh7 cells and luciferase activity was measured in the cell lysates. Each reporter RNA was confirmed to exhibit equivalent amounts under the siGFP, siDDX3-1 and siDDX3-2 conditions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>). Interestingly, in the DDX3-depleted cells, protein synthesis was reduced with all reporter RNAs tested to â¼30â60% of the levels in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>F, G and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>).</p><p>The comparable negative effect of the DDX3 knock down on the translation of each of the different reporter mRNAs (i.e. cap and IRES-containing mRNAs) implicated a general role of the protein in translation. Associated with these observations, a function of the protein in the cap-specific scanning process could be excluded, since neither HCV IRES- nor EMCV IRES-mediated translation require scanning to assemble 48S complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B24 gks070-B25 gks070-B26">24â26</xref>). The impact of DDX3 on translation was further established to be independent of the presence of a polyâA tail in the mRNA or, in the case of the HCV RNA, an authentic viral 3â²-UTR.</p><p>A general role of DDX3 in translation was further supported by experiments where we transiently overexpressed the wild-type (wt) protein as well as a variant with disrupted ATPase and helicase functions in Hek293 cells. Subsequent transfection of these cells with the capped- or HCV UTR-containing reporter RNAs revealed a positive stimulation of translation by the wt protein. Interestingly, also the mutant DDX3 had a comparable activity indicating that the known enzymatic functions of the protein are not required for its supportive function in translation (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link> and Discussion section).</p></sec><sec><title>DDX3 interacts with the 40âS ribosomal subunit</title><p>To examine DDX3 for functional contacts with the translation machinery we applied translation-competent cytoplasmic (S10) extracts from Huh7 cells that were prepared according to the protocol of Yu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Testing first for interactions of DDX3 with 80S ribosomes or elongating polysomes, the extracts were prepared in the presence of the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide and fractionated by polysome sucrose gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B16">16</xref>). 80S ribosomes and polysomes were identified <italic>via</italic> the rRNA content in the gradient fractions and by immunoblot-probing for the ribosomal proteins rpS3 (40S component) and rpL26 (60S component); both ribosomal proteins were detectable in the 80S as well as in the polysomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Probing for DDX3 revealed that most of the protein remained in the upper (less concentrated) gradient fractions and that a small quantity of the protein tailed into the 80S fractions. DDX3 was untraceable in the polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F3">Figure 3</xref>B, high amounts of unbound DDX3 and eIF6 floated in the upper gradient fractions, and also rpS3 was found in these fractions. The latter observation could be attributable to the partial EDTA-mediated disruption of ribosomes, since in all other centrifugation analyses of this study, rpS3 sedimented exclusively with the 40S subunit and with the high molecular weight translation initiation complexes, respectively (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F5">Figure 5</xref>B). However, rpS3 and eIF6 were also present in the 40S fraction, and a portion of eIF6 sedimented, as expected, in the 60S fractions. DDX3 was not found at 60S but a small amount of the protein cofractionated with the 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F3">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>These results excluded DDX3 as a component of polysomes but revealed that a fraction of the protein associated with the 40S ribosomal subunit and, perhaps, with 80S ribosomes. We therefore reasoned that DDX3 was not participating in the elongation or termination phase of the translation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F1">Figure 1</xref> step â). Rather, the protein is likely to be a functional component of the translation initiation reaction active up to the assembly of functional 80S ribosomes or that it participates in ribosome recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F1">Figure 1</xref> steps â, â or â).</p></sec><sec><title>DDX3 specifically interacts with components of translation initiation complexes</title><p>Earlier studies already suggested interactions of DDX3 with the translation initiation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B5 gks070-B6 gks070-B7">5â7</xref>). To specify these findings, several experimental setups were applied. First, we performed immunoprecipitations (IP) of DDX3 from the cytoplasmic Huh7 S10 extracts and analyzed the precipitate for associated translation initiation factors by western blot. Thus, in comparison to control IPs with preimmune serum, DDX3 specifically coprecipitated with eIF3 confirming the data of Lee <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B6">6</xref>). Moreover, the 40S component rpS6 coprecipitated with DDX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Notably, these interactions of DDX3 with eIF3, and, presumably, 40S, were detected irrespective of whether the experiment was performed in the absence or presence of RNase. This was in contrast with the RNA-binding proteins IGF2BP1/2, which coprecipitated with DDX3 only in the absence of RNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

The PIC components and Flag-DDX3 were monitored by western blot with antisera directed against individual proteins (see input control, lane 1). As negative controls, the precipitations were carried out with fractions of Hek293 cells that expressed the untagged DDX3 (âmock controlâ; lanes 2, 4, 6, 8; see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S9</ext-link>).

During translation initiation, 43S further evolve to mRNA-containing 48S complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F1">Figure 1</xref>); DDX3 was hence assumed to be also part of the 48S complexes. As this would imply an association of the protein with various types of mRNAs, we repeated the IP with the DDX3-specific antiserum and S10 extracts of Huh7 cells that had been transiently transfected with HCV replicon and tested for coprecipitated RNAs by RTâPCR. In comparison to the controls, the HCV RNA was found to be â¼16-fold enriched in the DDX3 precipitates. Likewise, the mRNAs of GAPDH and HSP70 (each containing highly structured 5â²UTRs) as well as the mRNA of rpS13 (containing an unstructured 5â²UTR) were coprecipitated and found enriched over the control by 5-, 9- and 3.5-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F4">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>In the final experiment of this series, we tested DDX3 for direct interactions with individual components of the 43S PIC. Since DDX3 prepared from <italic>E. coli</italic> was non-applicable in these assays, a Flag-tagged version of the protein was overexpressed in Hek293 cells and purified with anti-Flag antibody. The purification was performed at stringent conditions to remove all associating proteins, and the Flag-DDX3 ensured to be free of components of the translation machinery (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S9D</ext-link> and S9E, and below). In a second, affiliated precipitation assay, which was performed again in the absence and presence of RNase, each component of the 43S PIC (eIF1, eIF1A, eIF2, eIF3, eIF5 and 40S ribosomal subunits) was individually tested for binding to the precipitated Flag-DDX3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S9</ext-link> shows the quality of the purified components). Coprecipitated components of the 43S PIC were identified by western blot; as a negative control we applied a mock purification where DDX3 was expressed without tag to the precipitation assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F4">Figure 4</xref>C, also in this constellation we observed a stable, RNA-independent association of DDX3 with eIF3. Conversely, eIF2 coprecipitated with DDX3 only in the absence of RNase. In addition, we obtained further evidence for protein-mediated interactions of DDX3 with components of the 40S ribosomal subunit, though purified 40S had the tendency to bind non-specifically to the applied sepharose beads. DDX3 did not directly interact with eIF1, eIF1A or eIF5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F4">Figure 4</xref>C).</p><p>The obtained results supported the idea of specific, functional interactions of DDX3 with the 43S PIC.

We therefore repeated the assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F5">Figure 5</xref>B and measured at 20âs the amounts of rpS3 (reflecting the number of 40S subunits) in the 48S initiation complexes in relation to the sum of rpS3 that were immuno-detectable in the 48S and 80S complexes at this time point. It became apparent that only â¼35% of the total of 40S subunits were present in 48S complexes and destined to form 80S translation initiation complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F6">Figure 6</xref>B; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F5">Figure 5</xref>B for a representative gradient profile).

Assessing now the total number of 80S ribosomes at 15âmin translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F6">Figure 6</xref>C) and the number of DDX3 molecules that cofractioned in the 80S fractions at this time, we could estimate that â¼50% of the newly assembled ribosomes contained DDX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F6">Figure 6</xref>D). This calculation revealed that the small fraction of cytoplasmic DDX3 that associates with the translation machinery nevertheless is sufficient to saturate a significant number of functional ribosomes.</p><p>Finally, we addressed the question whether the observed translocation of DDX3 into mRNA-containing 80S ribosomes was possibly caused by a non-specific association of the protein to the mRNA. For this purpose, we treated newly assembled translation initiation complexes with MN and analyzed these in the above-described manner (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>). The MN was confirmed to be fully active under the conditions of the translation initiation reaction, and the integrity of the 80S complexes remained, as expected, nearly unaffected by the nuclease-treatment. Interestingly, DDX3 remained detectable at 80S also after MN-treatment, which suggested a direct, non-RNA-mediated interaction of the protein with newly assembled 80S ribosomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>).</p><p>Taken together, these observations implied an evident function of DDX3 in translation initiation. That is, the protein was indicated to be entailed in either the formation of the 48S or of the 80S initiation complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F1">Figure 1</xref> steps â or â). The fact that DDX3 was not associated with âfreeâ monomeric 80S ribosomes that were detectable at all time points of the initiation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F5">Figure 5</xref>B, fraction 12; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>, fractions 13 and 14) further suggested that the protein does not participate in ribosome recycling.</p></sec><sec><title>DDX3 promotes the assembly of functional 80S ribosomes</title><p>The following experiments were aimed at dissecting if DDX3 is involved in 48S or 80S complex formation of the translation initiation process. For this purpose, we prepared cytoplasmic S10 extracts from Huh7 cells where the level of DDX3 had been significantly reduced to â¼25% of the original level by prior treatment of the cells with one of the DDX3-specific siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F7">Figure 7</xref>A). In accordance with the earlier cell transfection studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>), <italic>in vitro</italic> translation experiments with such âDDX3-depletedâ extracts and reporter mRNAs showed a translation activity that was â¼35â50% lower than that of mock-depleted extracts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S7</ext-link>).

For the assembly of 80S complexes (G), the 48S complexes were further incubated with purified eIF5B<sub>587â1220</sub> and 60S ribosomal subunits, respectively. The assembled 48S and 80S complexes were separated by centrifugation through a 5â25% linear sucrose density gradient and the positions are indicated. One representative experiment is shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gks070f7"/></fig></p><p>In the first test of this series we compared translation initiation in the DDX3- and mock-depleted extract using the same assays as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F5">Figure 5</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>) and capped- and HCV IRES-containing mRNAs as substrates. Again, these experiments resulted in analogous data with both mRNAs: i.e. the DDX3 knock down had no effect on the formation of the 48S complexes at the early time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F7">Figure 7</xref>B and D). However, at longer reaction times and compared to the non-depleted control extracts, the amounts of newly assembled 80S ribosomes were reduced by â¼40% in the DDX3-depleted extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F7">Figure 7</xref>C and E). Conversely, the total of 48S complexes was increased in the DDX3-depleted extracts, i.e. by an average factor of 1.3 (capped RNA) and 1.54 (HCV IRES-RNA), respectively. These results supported the concept that DDX3 accelerates the assembly of functional 80S ribosomal complexes during translation initiation. This conclusion was further confirmed by toe printing experiments, which showed that the depletion of DDX3 did not affect the formation of the 48S complex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S8</ext-link>).</p><p>The final experiment was directed to examine the effect of DDX3 on the assembly of 48S and 80S translation initiation complexes <italic>in vitro</italic>. For this purpose, we applied the above-described affinity-purified Flag-DDX3 and the corresponding mock-purified control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F4">Figure 4</xref>C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S9D</ext-link>). As mentioned above, the purified Flag-DDX3 was confirmed to be free of translation initiation factors and ribosomal subunits; immunoblots excluded contaminations with eIF2, eIF3, eIF5, 40S and 60S, and a translation initiation experiment performed with the DDX3-containing protein fraction revealed no residual formation of 48S and 80S complexes, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S9F</ext-link>). To investigate if the purified Flag-DDX3 affected the 48S assembly process, purified eIF3 and 40S subunits were coincubated with MetâtRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> under translation initiation conditions with labeled HCV 5â²-UTR-sORF-3â²-UTR RNA and <italic>in vitro</italic> formed 48S complexes monitored by gradient centrifugation. As expected from our earlier data, formation of 48S complexes occurred, irrespective of whether the experiment was supplemented with Flag-DDX3 or with the corresponding fractions of a mock-purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F7">Figure 7</xref>F, fractions 8 and 9). However, when we further supplemented the mixture with purified eIF5B<sub>587â1220</sub> and 60S subunits using the protocol of Terenin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B31">31</xref>) that enables the reconstitution of 80S ribosomes in the absence of eIF2, the 80S assembly occurred at considerably higher efficiency when Flag-DDX3 was present in the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F7">Figure 7</xref>G).</p><p>In sum, we concluded from these results that DDX3 functions as an auxiliary translation factor that promotes the assembly of functional 80S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F1">Figure 1</xref> step â).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The DEAD-box helicase DDX3 is involved in most steps of cellular gene expression. It was indicated to participate in the regulation of transcription of defined promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B32 gks070-B33 gks070-B34">32â34</xref>), to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm and to accelerate the nuclear export of specific RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B35">35</xref>). Data obtained with one of several DDX3 yeast homologs, Ded1, revealed that this protein is necessary for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B36">36</xref>), and there is evidence that Ded1 operates in an mRNA specific manner, during 5â²-UTR-unwinding and/or during mRNP remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B37 gks070-B38 gks070-B39">37â39</xref>). DDX3 was suggested to function in a similar way as Ded1 since it was also found to be important for translation and to interact with translation initiation factors (see Introduction section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F4">Figure 4</xref>). However, its precise function remained elusive.</p><p>Taking advantage of moderate DDX3 knock down procedures (see below) we initiated this study by investigating the impact of the protein on the translation and replication of HCV RNA in Huh7 cells. Comparing transiently and persistently transfected HCV RNAs, we observed in each case a significant reduction of protein synthesis in the DDX3-depleted cells, which revealed an evident role of DDX3 in HCV IRES- as well as EMCV IRES-directed translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>). The fact that a reduction of cytoplasmic DDX3 inhibited the replication of transiently transfected HCV RNAs but not of persistently transfected replicons was attributed to different concentrations of viral replicase in the cells.</p><p>It is important to note that the DDX3 knock down experiments were performed with two different siRNAs that reduced the intracellular amount of DDX3 to â¼15â25% of the original level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F7">7</xref>). We stayed with this depletion protocol since more effective siRNAs inhibited cell growth (unpublished observations). However, the remaining endogenous DDX3 certainly compromised the level of the measured effects. Despite this technical downside, we obtained further, comprehensive evidence supporting the notion that DDX3 functions to generally promote translation. That is, negative effects of DDX3 depletion on protein synthesis were measured irrespective of whether translation was monitored <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>, whether we applied different cap- or IRES-containing, short or long RNAs, and irrespective of whether the 5â²-UTRs of the RNAs were structured or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F7">7</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figures S2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">S7</ext-link>; e.g. the 5â²-UTR of the most frequently used 5â²cap-sORF-polyâA mRNA is not structured). Hence, our findings are in accord with those reports that indicated a positive role of DDX3 in translation. They were in contrast to data of Shih <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B5">5</xref>) who observed a translational repression with overexpressed DDX3. This discrepancy may be explained by adverse effects of large quantities of helicase proteins in the cell. Alternatively, it is conceivable that DDX3 overexpression blocks translation by the assembly of mRNA complexes that accumulate in stress granules, as it was recently shown with Ded1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B39">39</xref>). Actually, we found that a moderate overexpression of DDX3 stimulated translation (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). Our data also deviate in certain aspects from the report of Lai <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B7">7</xref>). Using DDX3 knock down cells, these authors observed discrepancies in the translation of reporter mRNAs with differently structured 5â²-UTRs and hypothesized a role of DDX3 in the scanning process. In our study, despite all types of mRNAs (with structured as well as with non-structured 5â²-UTRs) were present in the DDX3-containing translation initiation complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F4">Figure 4</xref>B), the fact that a depletion of the protein also inhibited IRES-mediated translation initiation, which does not involve scanning, strongly argues against a role of DDX3 in scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>G and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2A</ext-link>). DDX3 thus operates differently from the DEAH-box helicase DHX29, which was demonstrated to increase the processivity of scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B40">40</xref>). Since DDX3 knock down inhibited translation regardless of whether the RNA substrates contained a 3â²-UTR or a poly A tail, this also excluded DDX3 to be a functional part of RNA 5â²â3â² interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F2">Figure 2</xref>). Further experiments indicated that DDX3 neither is a component of translating polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F3">Figure 3</xref>) nor of âfreeâ 80S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F6">6</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that DDX3 does not contribute to the translation elongation or ribosome recycling processes.</p><p>Instead, our study supports the notion that DDX3 functions in the second step of translation initiation, the formation of the 80S translation initiation complex. Initial indications pointing in this direction came from the observation that DDX3 is not part of âfreeâ ribosomes, and that a fraction of the protein specifically joins newly assembled (i.e. mRNA-containing) 80S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F5">Figure 5</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>). Convincing evidence for such a role of DDX3 was obtained with S10 extracts of DDX3 depleted cells where the assembly of functional 80S ribosomes was disabled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F7">Figure 7</xref>C and E). In further support of this, 80S assembly from individual translation initiation compounds was enhanced in the presence of the purified protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F7">Figure 7</xref>G). Conversely, formation of 48S translation initiation complexes was unaffected by DDX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F7">Figure 7</xref>B, D and F; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S8</ext-link>). However, different experimental setups demonstrated that DDX3 specifically binds to eIF3 and to the 40S subunit, which fuels the assumption that DDX3 is a component of 43S PIC and, as such, becomes also part of 48S translation initiation complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F3 gks070-F4 gks070-F5">Figures 3â5</xref>).</p><p>The portion of DDX3 that cosedimented with the translation machinery was small with respect to the total cytoplasmic amount of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F3 gks070-F4 gks070-F5">Figures 3â5</xref>). This was not surprising considering the high abundance of the protein in the cell and its multifunctional character. However, our semi-quantitative estimations indicated that at least 50% of the newly assembled 80S ribosomes contained DDX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F6">Figure 6</xref>). It hence appears that this amount of DDX3 suffices to saturate a significant number of 40S/48S and newly formed 80S complexes, respectively, and to support efficient 80S assembly. In fact, the helicase protein DHX29, which is also involved in translation, was found to be associated with only 10% of the total number of 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B40">40</xref>).</p><p>Currently, one can only speculate about the molecular activity of DDX3 in 80S assembly. As the protein binds directly, i.e. in an RNA-independent manner to eIF3, to the 40S subunit and to the 80S initiation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F4">Figure 4</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>), respectively, it may act as a protein-bridge between different factors required for 40S/60S interactions. This concept is in accord with the current opinion of main functions of DEAD-box helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B41 gks070-B42 gks070-B43">41â43</xref>), and it strikingly resembles a scenario that was proposed for the Drosophila DEAD box protein Vasa. Vasa was indicated to assist the recruitment of eIF5B to the 40S subunit and thus to facilitate translation of certain mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B44">44</xref>). The idea that DDX3 acts as a protein-bridge moreover fits with observations in overexpression assays where not only the wild-type DDX3 was found to induce translation (see above) but also a variant with defective helicase and ATPase domains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). This suggests that the helicase and ATPase activities of DDX3 are not essential for its function in translation.</p><p>A particularly interesting aspect concerns the direct and stable interaction of DDX3 with eIF3. In translation initiation experiments with the HCV IRES, Pestova <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B3">3</xref>) showed that eIF3 was not essential for 48S complex assembly but required for 80S complex formation. eIF3 was accordingly speculated to modify the conformation of the 48S complex such that a 60S subunit can associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B31">31</xref>). Thus, a potential model of DDX3 function is that the protein, by interacting with eIF3 and the 40S subunit and as part of the 43S PIC enters the 48S complex on translatable mRNA. Then, in conjunction with eIF3, DDX3 may operate as a conformational modulator of the 48S complex supporting 80S assembly by proteinâprotein interactions. While eIF3 leaves the 48S complex during assembly of the 80S translation initiation complex, DDX3 remains bound to it but disassembles prior to the elongation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks070-F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>With DDX3, this study implicates another helicase, which, besides eIF4A and DHX29, has a defined role in mammalian cellular protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks070/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Materials and Methods, Supplementary Figures 1â9, Supplementary Tables 1â2 and Supplementary References (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks070-B46 gks070-B47 gks070-B48 gks070-B49 gks070-B50 gks070-B51">46â51</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Institute of Health</funding-source> â(grant number <award-id>5-RO1-DK-62847-3</award-id> to S.E.B)â; and the <funding-source>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</funding-source> â(grant number BE <award-id>1885/6</award-id> to R.G.).
