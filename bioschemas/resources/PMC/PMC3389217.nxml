      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">While studies on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure and dynamics have focused on the ER tubule forming proteins (reticulons and DP1/Yop1p) and the tubule fusion protein atlastin, nothing is known about the proteins and processes that act to counter-balance this machinery. Here we show that Lnp1p, a member of the conserved lunapark family, plays a role in ER network formation. Lnp1p binds to the reticulons and Yop1p and resides at ER tubule junctions in both yeast and mammalian cells. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the interaction of Lnp1p with the reticulon protein, Rtn1p, and the localization of Lnp1p to ER junctions are regulated by Sey1p, the yeast ortholog of atlastin. We propose that Lnp1p and Sey1p act antagonistically to balance polygonal network formation. In support of this proposal, we show that the collapsed, densely reticulated ER network in <italic>lnp1</italic>Î cells is partially restored when the GTPase activity of Sey1p is abrogated.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">The ER possesses a unique and highly conserved morphology that reflects the many essential roles it plays in all eukaryotic cells <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Within each cell, it typically forms one contiguous structure of interconnected sheets and tubules arranged into a polygonal network that makes numerous connections with the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope. This network is spread throughout the cell, all the way to its cortex, by a dynamic process of tubule extension and tubule fusion, leading to the formation of new polygons. At steady state, polygon formation is balanced by ring closure; the sliding of an ER junction along the side of a polygon until ultimately the polygon is lost <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P3">ER tubules and networks are generated and stabilized by the reticulons, DP1/Yop1p and atlastin. These components are conserved throughout evolution <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The reticulons are transmembrane proteins <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> that work synergistically with the reticulon interacting protein, DP1/Yop1p, to add positive curvature to the bilayer of the ER membrane <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Consistent with this role, these proteins are concentrated on tubular elements of the ER and the highly curved edges of ER sheets <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The dynamin-like GTPase atlastin binds to the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p and promotes ER tubule fusion. It localizes to the three-way junctions that interconnect the tubular elements of the ER to form the ER network <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In humans, mutations in either atlastin-1 or REEP1, a member of the DP1/Yop1p protein family <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, lead to a distal axonopathy of corticospinal neurons <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, when orthologs of the reticulons, DP1/Yop1p and atlastin are all disrupted in the same haploid yeast strain, growth is not affected. These observations suggest that neurons, which are highly elongated, may be particularly sensitive to defects in ER morphogenesis.</p>
      <p id="P4">In this study, we report that a member of the conserved lunapark protein family <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, Lnp1p, defined by two transmembrane domains and a zinc finger motif, is required for ER network formation. Lnp1p works in synergy with the reticulons and Yop1p, but in antagonism to Sey1p (yeast ortholog of atlastin). It resides at three-way ER tubule junctions in both yeast and mammalian cells and it interacts with the reticulons, Yop1p and Sey1p. Sey1p negatively regulates the interaction of Lnp1p with the reticulons and is necessary for the localization of Lnp1p to ER junctions. We propose that Lnp1p counterbalances Sey1p-directed polygon formation by promoting polygon loss through ring closure.</p>

        <title>Lnp1p is required to maintain the cortical ER network and localizes to ER tubule junctions</title>
        <p id="P5">To identify novel components of the machinery required to generate the cortical ER network in yeast, we screened the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> deletion library using Rtn1p fused to GFP (Rtn1p-GFP) as a marker for the ER. There are two genes in yeast encoding reticulons, <italic>RTN1</italic> and <italic>RTN2</italic>. Rtn1p is very abundant, while Rtn2p is only expressed in the presence of high salt <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.yeastgenome.org">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>). The advantage of using Rtn1p-GFP is that it is much brighter than the other markers that have previously been used to study the cortical ER network in yeast <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and it specifically labels the tubular ER, as well as the edges of ER sheets <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The screen we employed led to the identification of four ORFs (<italic>SCS2</italic>, <italic>PHO85</italic>, <italic>CHO1</italic> and <italic>YHR192W</italic>) whose loss disrupts the cortical ER network in yeast (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1a</xref>). Of these ORFs, only <italic>SCS2</italic> and <italic>YHR192W</italic> encode integral ER membrane proteins. The role of Scs2p in ER structure and inheritance has previously been reported <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Here we focus on <italic>YHR192W</italic>. For subsequent studies we disrupted this ORF in our strain background. When two different ER markers (Rtn1p-RFP and Sec61p-GFP) were used to analyze the ER in a strain deleted for <italic>YHR192W</italic>, the morphology was found to be abnormal in approximately 91% of the mutant cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, left and right). Large sectors of the cortex lacking cortical ER were observed and regions where the ER network appeared to have collapsed were also seen in the mutant (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a and 1c</xref>, left). A blast search of YHR192W revealed it to be the sole yeast member of a conserved protein family named Lunapark <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. This protein family is defined by the presence of two N-terminal predicted transmembrane domains and a C-terminal zinc finger motif (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Adjacent to the zinc finger, in animal homologues, is the sequence LNPARK, hence the gene name <italic>LNP1</italic>(<underline>LNP</underline>ARK).</p>
        <p id="P6">An <italic>lnp1</italic> mutant (<italic>lnp1-1</italic>), in which the four cysteine residues of the zinc finger (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, blue) were mutated to alanine, exhibited the same ER phenotype as <italic>lnp1</italic>Î, indicating a functional role for this motif (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To examine the consequences of disrupting this motif in more detail, we constructed strains that contain one (<italic>lnp1-5</italic>, C223A), two (<italic>lnp1-2</italic>, C223A C226A) and four (<italic>lnp1-1</italic>, C223A C226A C244A C247A) cysteine mutations in the zinc finger motif. Interestingly, the ER morphology became increasingly more aberrant as the number of cysteine mutations increased (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1b and S1c</xref>). Large cortical sectors devoid of ER appeared and the polygons became smaller on average with each additional mutation until they could no longer be resolved by light microscopy. These findings suggest that the ER became more densely reticulated with each mutation in Lnp1p. Thin section electron microscopy revealed short sections of ER between small, closely spaced openings in <italic>lnp1Î</italic> cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), confirming that the ER was densely reticulated in the mutant.</p>
        <p id="P7">Next, we performed colocalization studies with Lnp1p-3xGFP and the ER marker proteins Rtn1p-RFP, Sey1p-5xRFP and the ER retrieval sequence HDEL fused to DsRed. This analysis revealed that Lnp1p-3xGFP specifically resides on puncta that line the tubular ER (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), and at junctions where the tubular ER meets the nuclear envelope (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2a</xref>). When we deconvolved an area of the ER at the periphery of the cell using Openlab software, we were able to resolve the polygonal network marked by Rtn1p-GFP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, middle bottom panel). Lnp1p-3xGFP was found at the three-way junctions of the ER network (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, bottom), partially overlapping or adjacent to Sey1p-5xRFP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In mammalian cells, Lnp1 also localized to the three way junctions of the ER (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), suggesting that its function is conserved from yeast to higher cells. Interestingly, in the absence of Lnp1p, the ER junctions were no longer clearly resolved and Sey1p-5xRFP appeared to spread throughout the densely reticulated ER network (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Lnp1p acts in synergy with Rtn1p, but in antagonism to Sey1p</title>
        <p id="P8">To begin to address the relationship of Lnp1p to the reticulons and Yop1p, we disrupted <italic>LNP1</italic> in strains that lacked the reticulons and/or Yop1p. When we disrupted <italic>RTN1</italic> in haploid cells that were also disrupted for <italic>LNP1</italic>, we observed a growth defect (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, left panel, see white circles and doubling times in <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig.S3a</xref>). This growth defect was further enhanced when <italic>YOP1</italic> was deleted in the <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î mutant (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, middle panel, see white squares; <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3a</xref>), and was most dramatic when <italic>LNP1</italic> was disrupted in a strain that lacked both reticulon genes (<italic>RTN1</italic> and <italic>RTN2</italic>) and <italic>YOP1</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, right panel, see white triangles; <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3a</xref>). No growth defect was observed when <italic>lnp1Î</italic> was deleted in combination with <italic>rtn2Î</italic>, <italic>yop1Î</italic> or an <italic>rtn2Î yop1Î</italic> double deletion (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3a</xref>). Thus, the enhancement of the growth defect appears to be dependent on the loss of Rtn1p. Consistent with these genetic studies, we observed an enhancement of the cortical ER defect in <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î, <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î<italic>yop1</italic>Î and <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î<italic>rtn2</italic>Î<italic>yop1</italic>Î mutant cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). As previously reported <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, disrupting <italic>YOP1</italic> in mutant cells that lacked one or both reticulon genes also enhanced the cortical ER defect (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), however, no growth defect was associated with this phenotype (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Together these findings indicate that Lnp1p acts in synergy with Rtn1p to structure the cortical ER.</p>
        <p id="P9">To address if Lnp1p and Sey1p act in synergy, we deleted <italic>SEY1</italic> in the <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î double, <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î<italic>yop1</italic>Î triple and <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î<italic>rtn2</italic>Î<italic>yop1</italic>Î quadruple mutants. To our surprise, we found that the loss of Sey1p strongly suppressed the growth defects of each of these mutants (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, boxed area). These genetic findings indicate that Lnp1p acts in antagonism to Sey1p. Additionally, although the ER network appeared to be less branched in the <italic>sey1</italic>Î mutant (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3b</xref>), disruption of <italic>SEY1</italic>Î largely restored the collapsed, more highly branched network in the <italic>lnp1</italic>Î mutant (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3b</xref>) in over 70% of the cells examined (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). The loss of GTPase activity is sufficient for suppression, as a <italic>sey1</italic> mutant defective in GTP-binding (<italic>sey1<sup>K50A</sup></italic>), suppressed the cortical ER defect in the <italic>lnp1</italic>Î mutant as efficiently as <italic>sey1</italic>Î (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d and 4e</xref>). Deletion of <italic>SEY1</italic> also partially rescued the cortical ER defect in the <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î, <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î<italic>yop1</italic>Î and <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î<italic>rtn2</italic>Î<italic>yop1</italic>Î mutants (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3c</xref>).</p>

        <title>Sey1p-GTP restricts Lnp1p to ER tubule junctions</title>
        <p id="P10">To address how Sey1p acts in antagonism to Lnp1p, we examined the localization of Lnp1p-3xGFP in the <italic>sey1</italic>Î and <italic>sey1<sup>K50A</sup></italic> mutants. Interestingly, Lnp1p-3xGFP was no longer restricted to puncta on the cortical ER in these mutants (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, middle and bottom panel). Instead, similar to Sec61p-2xRFP and DsRed-HDEL, Lnp1p-3xGFP was spread evenly throughout both the cortical ER and nuclear envelope (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>; <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2a</xref>). Quantitation of the phenotype revealed that Lnp1p-3xGFP was spread throughout the ER in the majority of the <italic>sey1</italic>Î and <italic>sey1<sup>K50A</sup></italic> cells examined (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Unlike Lnp1p, the localization of Rtn1p-RFP and Yop1p-RFP was unaltered in the <italic>sey1Î</italic> mutant (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4a,b</xref>). A closer examination of the peripheral ER network in both the <italic>sey1</italic>Î and <italic>sey1<sup>K50A</sup></italic> mutants revealed that Lnp1p-3xGFP was in the ER sheets and not the ER tubule junctions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Interestingly, while Lnp1p-3xGFP was in the sheets, Rtn1p-GFP lined the more highly curved edges of the sheets in these mutants. Together these findings indicate that, unlike the reticulons and Yop1p, Lnp1p does not have an intrinsic ability to localize to highly curved membrane domains (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Additionally, these findings show that Sey1p-GTP appears to play an important role in restricting Lnp1p to ER tubule junctions.</p>

        <title>The interaction of Lnp1p with Rtn1p is regulated by Sey1p</title>
        <p id="P11">The observation that Lnp1p acts in synergy with Rtn1p and in antagonism to Sey1p suggests that Lnp1p might physically interact with Rtn1p and/or Sey1p. To begin to address this possibility, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments. Lysates prepared from three different strains containing Lnp1p-3xHA with either Rtn1p-3xFLAG, Sey1p-3xFLAG, or the Rtn1p interacting protein Yop1p (tagged with 3xFLAG) were incubated with anti-HA affinity matrix. The beads were then washed and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody. This analysis revealed that Lnp1p-3xHA specifically interacts with all three proteins, but not with Sec22p, a type II membrane protein that resides on the ER and Golgi <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>(<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). The interaction was dependent on the presence of the HA tag as no Rtn1p-3xFLAG, Sey1p-3xFLAG or Yop1p-3xFLAG was detected in the precipitate when lysate containing untagged Lnp1p was incubated with anti-HA affinity matrix (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4c</xref>). The amount of Rtn1p that co-precipitated with Lnp1p was similar to the amount of Sey1p that co-precipitated with Rtn1p (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P12">To determine if Sey1p regulates the interaction of Lnp1p with the reticulons, we examined the interaction of Lnp1p-3xHA with Rtn1p-3xFLAG in strains in which <italic>SEY1</italic> was either deleted or overexpressed from the inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. Interestingly, we precipitated more Rtn1p with Lnp1p when <italic>SEY1</italic> was deleted (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2), and less Rtn1p with Lnp1p when Sey1p was overexpressed (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4). Thus, Sey1p appears to negatively regulate the interaction of Lnp1p with Rtn1p. When we examined the consequences of overexpressing Sey1p on its localization and on the localization of Rtn1p, Yop1p and Lnp1p, we found that Sey1p forms large round structures that predominantly reside at the periphery of the cell (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5</xref>). These structures also contained Rtn1p and Yop1p (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5d and S5e</xref>), but not Lnp1p (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5a-c</xref>), consistent with the observation that less Rtn1p is precipitated with Lnp1p when Sey1p is overexpressed (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). EM analysis demonstrated that the large structures consist of tubular membranes (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5f</xref>). These tubular membranes were not present when Lnp1p was overexpressed from the inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5g</xref>). Lnp1p was found on the tubular ER and nuclear envelope within 2 hr after induction (<xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6a</xref>). After 4 hr, the nuclear envelope and cortical ER became aberrant and the localization of Rtn1p and Lnp1p no longer overlapped (<xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6a; S6b</xref>). Eventually, the overproduction of Lnp1p led to cell death (<xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6e</xref>). Interestingly, this growth defect was suppressed when Lnp1p was overexpressed in a strain that also overexpressed Sey1p (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6d and S6e</xref>). Under conditions of co-overexpression, Lnp1p-GFP and Sey1p-RFP were found to co-localize in large, round peripheral structures.

        <title>Sey1p, but not Lnp1p, is defective in cortical ER and nuclear ER fusion</title>
        <p id="P13">Atlastin, but not its putative homologue Sey1p, has been directly shown to promote the fusion of ER membranes <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. As Sey1p and Lnp1p appear to have opposing effects, we wanted to address if the loss of Lnp1p suppresses the presumed fusion defect in the <italic>sey1</italic>Î mutant. To do this, we established an assay that measures ER-ER fusion in vivo during the mating reaction.</p>
        <p id="P14">Yeast cells have two mating types, MAT<italic>a</italic> and MAT<italic>Î±</italic>. When cells of the opposite mating type come in contact with each other, in response to pheromone signaling, the wall at the contact site of each cell is degraded (cell wall remodeling) and the plasma membranes of the two cells fuse (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). This allows the ER in the two parent cells to fuse, mixing their lumenal contents, and the nuclei from each cell to fuse forming a zygote <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. To assess cortical ER-ER fusion, we mated one cell expressing the ER lumenal marker DsRed-HDEL with another cell expressing cytosolic GFP (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7</xref>). The time at which the plasma membranes fused, as indicated by the transfer of cytosolic GFP between the two parent cells, was defined as T=0 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). We then measured the time it took to initiate and complete ER lumenal mixing in wild type, <italic>lnp1</italic>Î, <italic>sey1</italic>Î and <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>sey1</italic>Î cells (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7</xref>). This analysis revealed that the start (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>) and completion (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>) of ER mixing was similar in wild type and <italic>lnp1Î</italic> cells. Mixing, however, was delayed in the <italic>sey1Î</italic> mutant. This delay was not significantly suppressed in an <italic>lnp1Îsey1Î</italic> double mutant. Consistent with the hypothesis that Sey1p mediates ER fusion at the contact zone where the two cells fuse, we found that Sey1p-5xRFP localizes to this zone in wild type zygotes (<xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8</xref>, top), while Lnp1p (<xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8</xref>, middle) and Rtn1p (<xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8</xref>, bottom) do not.</p>
        <p id="P15">We also assessed nuclear envelope fusion in the strains described above by mixing MAT<italic>a</italic> and MAT<italic>Î±</italic> cells that expressed Sec61p-GFP. The cell suspension was plated on a YPD plate for 4 hr at 25Â°C, and the zygotes that formed a new bud near the site of cell fusion were analyzed further (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). The mating pairs with unfused nuclei (three versus two nuclei) and the fraction that failed to go on to form diploid cells (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b and 8c</xref>) were measured. Cells were determined to be diploid if they were able to sporulate and failed to mate with either MAT<italic>a</italic> or MAT<italic>Î±</italic> tester strains. This analysis revealed that Sey1p, but not Lnp1p, is required for nuclear fusion, i.e. <italic>sey1</italic>Î is defective in karyogamy. Thus Sey1p is required for both cortical ER-ER and nuclear ER fusion. Additionally, similar to the ER-ER fusion defect, the nuclear fusion defect of the <italic>sey1</italic>Î mutant was not strongly suppressed in the <italic>sey1</italic>Î <italic>lnp1</italic>Î double mutant. Therefore, Lnp1p does not appear to antagonize Sey1p by inhibiting a Sey1p-independent ER fusion pathway.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P16">The ER is shaped through the addition of bilayer curvature by the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Curiously, although the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p are sufficient for the formation of tubules in vitro <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, the simultaneous loss of Rtn1p, Rtn2p and Yop1p does not lead to an appreciable growth defect in yeast. ER tubule interconnections are formed when the dynamin-like GTPase atlastin fuses ER tubules to each other to form a network <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Currently, it is unknown if atlastin is sufficient for forming ER tubular junctions, however, in its absence long unbranched tubules predominate <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. In yeast, the atlastin homologue Sey1p facilitates homotypic ER-ER and nuclear ER envelope fusion during the mating reaction. Additional, as yet unidentified components must be needed for ER network formation, as yeast cells lacking Sey1p, the reticulons and Yop1p are not impaired for growth.</p>
      <p id="P17">Here we show that a member of a conserved protein family, named Lunapark, is a player in ER network formation. Interestingly, like mutations in the Sey1p homologue atlastin or the Yop1p homolog REEP1, the <italic>lnp-1</italic> mutant of <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been linked to neuronal defects <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In yeast, the loss of Lnp1p in an <italic>rtn1</italic>Î<italic>rtn2</italic>Î<italic>yop1</italic>Î triple mutant leads to a striking growth defect and profound ER morphology defects, indicating that Lnp1p acts in synergy with the reticulons and Yop1p to structure the ER. Lnp1p contains two transmembrane domains and a zinc finger motif that is essential for its function. It interacts with Rtn1p, Yop1p and Sey1p and localizes to ER junctions where it partially overlaps with, or is adjacent to, Sey1p. The localization of Lnp1p to ER junctions is dependent on Sey1p-GTP, which also negatively regulates the interaction of Lnp1p with Rtn1p.</p>
      <p id="P18">The synergistic genetic interactions between <italic>LNP1</italic> and <italic>RTN1</italic> could indicate that Lnp1p and Rtn1p either have redundant functions, or they act on converging pathways. It seems unlikely that Rtn1p acts redundantly with Lnp1p since it is at least ten times more abundant than Lnp1p (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.yeastgenome.org">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>) and it localizes to the tubular ER and the edges of ER sheets <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, while Lnp1p resides at ER junctions. Furthermore, the phenotypes of <italic>lnp1Î</italic> and <italic>rtn1Î</italic> mutants, as revealed by electron microscopy, are distinct. Loss of Lnp1p leads to the formation of densely reticulated ER, while the loss of Rtn1p results in non-fenestrated sheets <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P19">The strong suppression by <italic>sey1</italic>Î of the growth defects of the <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î, <italic>lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î<italic>yop1</italic>Î <italic>and lnp1</italic>Î<italic>rtn1</italic>Î<italic>rtn2</italic>Î<italic>yop1</italic>Î mutants suggests that Lnp1p balances the function of Sey1p. Furthermore, the suppression of the ER morphology defects of <italic>lnp1</italic>Î by <italic>sey1</italic>Î indicates that this balance is important in forming a normal ER network. One possible role for Lnp1p is to balance the fusion activity of Sey1p by mediating ER fission. A balance of fission and fusion events is required to maintain normal mitochondrial morphology <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The dynamin-like GTPase Dnm1p, promotes mitochondrial fission <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, which balances the mitochondrial fusion activity of Fzo1p, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Unlike Dnm1p, Lnp1p is not a GTPase and fission of ER tubules has not been directly observed by live cell imaging. Alternatively, Lnp1p could also balance Sey1p function by directing ER polygon loss through ring closure. Lnp1p might be needed for the sliding of a three-way junction along an ER tubule to allow a polygon to shrink or perhaps for the final membrane scission event needed to resolve the residual hole, completing the process of ring closure. In either case, the loss of Lnp1p would be predicted to result in the accumulation of excess polygons of decreasing size. The densely reticulated cortical ER observed by electron microscopy in the <italic>lnp1</italic>Î mutant is consistent with this proposal.</p>

Yeast lysates were prepared from cells expressing either Lnp1p-3xHA and Rtn1p-3xFLAG (SFNY 2102), Lnp1p-3xHA and Yop1p-3xFLAG (SFNY 2103), or Lnp1p-3xHA and Sey1p-3xFLAG (SFNY 2104). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by western blot analysis using anti-FLAG, anti-HA and anti-Sec22p antibodies. Quantitation of the immunoprecipitates is shown on the bottom. Error bars represent S.D., n=3 <bold>b</bold>, Yeast lysates were prepared from cells expressing Lnp1p-3xHA and Rtn1p-3xFLAG when Sey1p was either absent or overexpressed (SFNY 2132, SFNY 2131). Overexpression of Sey1p was induced in YP medium with 0.1% galactose. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and western blot analysis was performed using anti-FLAG antibody.
