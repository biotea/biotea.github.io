        <p>FYCO1 recognition of LC3 on autophagosomes facilitates microtubule-mediated cytosolic transport of this degradative organelle.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Autophagy is the main eukaryotic degradation pathway for long-lived proteins, protein aggregates, and cytosolic organelles. Although the protein machinery involved in the biogenesis of autophagic vesicles is well described, very little is known about the mechanism of cytosolic transport of autophagosomes. In this study, we have identified an adaptor protein complex, formed by the two autophagic membrane-associated proteins LC3 and Rab7 and the novel FYVE and coiled-coil (CC) domainâcontaining protein FYCO1, that promotes microtubule (MT) plus endâdirected transport of autophagic vesicles. We have characterized the LC3-, Rab7-, and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphateâbinding domains in FYCO1 and mapped part of the CC region essential for MT plus endâdirected transport. We also propose a mechanism for selective autophagosomal membrane recruitment of FYCO1.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The term autophagy is commonly used to describe several distinct cellular processes during which cytosolic/nucleosolic proteins or organelles are transported into the lysosomes for degradation. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is considered the major pathway for delivery of cytosolic cargo to lysosomes. During autophagy, part of the cytosol is sequestered into a double-membrane vesicle, called an autophagosome, which subsequently fuses with endosomes and lysosomes. This way, the cytosolic cargo is delivered for degradation by lysosomal proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mizushima, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xie and Klionsky, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Genetic screens in yeast identified a group of â¼30 autophagy-related proteins (Atg) essential for autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsukada and Ohsumi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thumm et al., 1994</xref>). The majority of these proteins participate in the initial stages of autophagosome formation. Currently, very little is known about the protein machinery involved in intracellular transport of autophagosomes and their docking and fusion with other membranous compartments. In mammals, Rab7, the core class C Vps-tethering complex and UVRAG are important for fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gutierrez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">JÃ¤ger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2008</xref>). Several other Rab family members, including Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ravikumar et al., 2008</xref>), Rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fader et al., 2008</xref>), Rab24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MunafÃ³ and Colombo, 2002</xref>), Rab32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirota and Tanaka, 2009</xref>), and Rab33B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Itoh et al., 2008</xref>), are suggested to be involved in autophagy. Except for the Atg16LâRab33 complex, the autophagy-specific effectors of these small GTPases are currently unknown. Multiple studies on the importance of microtubules (MTs) for mammalian autophagy have been published in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Webb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">KÃ¶chl et al., 2006</xref>), but the protein machinery involved in MT-dependent transport of autophagosomes has not been characterized yet.</p>
      <p>The lipid phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) is also essential for autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seglen and Gordon, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blommaart et al., 1997</xref>). Although the exact function or functions of PI3P in autophagy are still unclear, it is generally accepted that PI3P-enriched membranes recruit and activate effector proteins containing FYVE (Fab1, YOTB/ZK632.12, Vac1, and EEA1) or PX (Phox) PI3P-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaullier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>ATG8/MAP1-LC3/GABARAP is a family of small globular proteins containing a C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and a short N-terminal arm formed by two amphipathic Î±-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sugawara et al., 2004</xref>). All members of the family are membrane associated via a phosphatidylethanolamine lipid anchor attached to a C-terminal glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirisako et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kabeya et al., 2004</xref>). In yeast, Atg8 localizes to phagophores and autophagosomes, where it participates in membrane expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirisako et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this paper, we identify FYCO1 (FYVE and coiled-coil [CC] domain containing 1) as a novel LC3-, Rab7-, and PI3P-interacting protein. The LC3âFYCO1 interaction is mediated by an LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif adjacent to the FYVE domain of FYCO1. We demonstrate that FYCO1 dimerizes via the CC region, interacts with PI3P via its FYVE domain, and forms a complex with Rab7 via a part of the CC region located in front of the FYVE domain. Overexpression of FYCO1 redistributes LC3- and Rab7-positive structures to the cell periphery in an MT-dependent manner. This effect is mediated by the central part of the CC region and suggests a role for FYCO1 in MT plus endâdirected transport of autophagic vesicles.</p>

        <p>To identify new interaction partners of LC3B, we performed affinity purification using GST-LC3B as an affinity ligand. HeLa cell lysate from â¼10<sup>8</sup> cells was incubated in a batch mode with GST-LC3B bound to glutathioneâSepharose. Bound proteins were eluted and resolved on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Protein bands were subjected to trypsin digestion, and the corresponding proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. One of the proteins identified by this approach was FYCO1, a novel protein with uncharacterized function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The identity of FYCO1 and the specificity of its interaction with LC3B were confirmed by GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, BâD</xref>).</p>

        <p>FYCO1 is a novel protein encoded by a gene located at chromosome 3 common eliminated region 1 (C3CER1; 3p21.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiss et al., 2002</xref>). Analyses using the Conserved Domain Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2009</xref>) and COILS web server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lupas et al., 1991</xref>) predict FYCO1 to be a long CC protein similar to two families of Rab effector proteins: RUN and FYVE domainâcontaining proteins (RUFY1â4) and EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rose et al., 2005</xref>). Similar to these proteins, FYCO1 contains a central, 850-aa-long CC region flanked by globular domains. The globular domain at the C-terminal end of the CC is common for all three protein groups and is a PI3P lipid-binding FYVE domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaullier et al., 1998</xref>). Similar to RUFY1â4 proteins, FYCO1 contains an N-terminal RUN domain, which is an Î±-helical proteinâprotein interaction domain shown to bind to the small GTPases of Rab and Rap families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Callebaut et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Recacha et al., 2009</xref>). Unique for FYCO1 compared with RUFYs and EEA1 is the presence of a 100-aa-long unstructured region C-terminally to the FYVE domain, followed by a globular GOLD (Golgi dynamics) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200907015/DC1">Fig. S2 C</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>Using GST pull-down assays, we mapped a 19-aa-long conserved LIR at aa 1,276â1,294 of FYCO1 as essential and sufficient for binding to LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200907015/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Deletion of LIR (Î1,282â1,294) resulted in loss of colocalization between FYCO1 and LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Similar to binding of other LIR-containing proteins, both N- and C-terminal domains of LC3B were needed for efficient binding to FYCO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Using GST pull-down with recombinant GST-LC3B and a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion of the C-terminal half of FYCO1, we confirmed a direct interaction between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>).</p>

        <title>FYCO1 localizes to autophagosomes, endosomes, and lysosomes</title>
        <p>Immunostaining showed that endogenous FYCO1 is localized to punctuated structures concentrated in the juxtanuclear region of the cytoplasm of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, left). Interestingly, FYCO1 puncta redistributed to other parts of the cytoplasm upon starvation of HeLa cells in Hanksâ buffer saline for 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, right). mCherry-FYCO1, stably expressed in HeLa cells, decorated cytosolic puncta (0.3â0.8 Âµm in diameter) and the rim of cytosolic vesicles (0.8â2 Âµm in diameter), with partial enrichment of these structures in the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Costaining and cotransfection experiments identified a partial colocalization of FYCO1 with LC3B, LAMP1, ATG5, and ATG16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). We also observed accumulation of mCherry-tagged p62 and HuntingtinQ68 inside FYCO1-decorated vesicles in untreated cells as well as endogenous p62 inside FYCO1 vesicles after bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). No colocalization could be seen between FYCO1 and EEA1 or p40phox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>), which are two markers of early endosomes. These data suggest that FYCO1 decorates autophagosomes or autophagosome-derived structures. Interestingly, FYCO1-positive structures larger than 0.8 Âµm were always seen as vesicles, with FYCO1 present on the rim but not inside the vesicles, independent of whether acid-sensitive GFP or acid-stable mCherry was used as a fusion tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In contrast, LC3 was easily detected inside FYCO1 vesicles on structures resembling autophagic bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). This suggests that FYCO1 localizes to the external but not to the internal membrane of autophagosomes, and upon autophagosome/late endosome (LE)/lysosome fusion, it stays on the external surface of autolysosomes.</p>

        <p>Because FYCO1 is homologous to two groups of Rab effector proteins and resides on the surface of autophagosomes/autolysosomes, we tested whether it colocalizes with Rab family members implicated in autophagy. We found that only Rab7 and not other Rab family proteins (Rab5, -11, -24, and -33B) strongly colocalized with FYCO1 when expressed as wild-type proteins in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).</p>

        <title>Membrane recruitment of FYCO1 requires both the FYVE domain and dimerization via its CC domain</title>
        <p>Despite the presence of a predicted PI3P-binding FYVE domain in FYCO1, we observed very little or no colocalization between FYCO1 and two protein probes commonly used as PI3P sensors, a tandem fusion of two FYVE domains from Hrs (2xFYVE<sub>Hrs</sub>) and the PX domain from p40phox (PX<sub>p40phox</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>), suggesting that other parts of FYCO1 contribute to membrane recruitment. To map the region involved in membrane recruitment, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of deletion mutants of FYCO1. Only constructs lacking the FYVE domain (Î1,158â1,232) but not those lacking RUN or GOLD domains, LIR, or the N-terminal part of the CC domain were deficient in vesicle recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref> and Fig. S1). Mutation of the PI3P-binding motif RRHHCR to AAHHCR in the FYVE domain confirmed the importance of the PI3PâFYVE domain interaction for the membrane recruitment of FYCO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Interestingly, neither the FYVE domain alone nor the C-terminal fragment of the protein containing FYVE, LIR, and GOLD domains were recruited to intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>), indicating that the FYVE domain is essential but not sufficient for membrane targeting of FYCO1.</p>

        <p>Several reported FYVE domainâcontaining proteins function as homodimers or contain tandem FYVE domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hayakawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kutateladze, 2006</xref>). Because FYCO1 can self-interact in a CC-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>), we decided to test whether the FYVE domain from FYCO1 also has to be part of a dimer for efficient membrane recruitment. An in vitro proteinâlipid overlay assay demonstrated that recombinant MBP-2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> (tandem fusion of two FYVE domains from FYCO1, similar to the 2xFYVE probe from Hrs; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200907015/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gillooly et al., 2000</xref>) and MBP-FYCO1<sub>863â1,233</sub> (single FYVE domain with dimerizing CC) but not MBP-FYCO1<sub>1,156â1,233</sub> (single FYVE domain) bound to PI3P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Surprisingly, we failed to detect binding of MBP-FYCO1<sub>863â1,478</sub> (C-terminal fragment of FYCO1) to any of the lipids by this assay (Fig. S2 A), suggesting that part of the protein C-terminally to the FYVE domain (unstructured region or GOLD domain) has an inhibitory effect on the binding of FYCO1 to lipids. Incubation of MBP-FYCO1<sub>863â1,478</sub> with recombinant GST-LC3B partially rescued the PI3P-binding activity of FYCO1 (Fig. S2 A). Interestingly, in cells, the 2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> construct showed a strong staining of the ER and nuclear envelope, as revealed by its colocalization with the ER-resident small GTPase Sar1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Although 2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> had similar domain borders and the same interdomain linker sequence (Fig. S3 A), it showed no colocalization with 2xFYVE<sub>Hrs</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>, left). Neither did it colocalize with the PX<sub>p40phox</sub> probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>, right). Inhibition of PI3P synthesis with wortmannin resulted in the partial release of 2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> from the membranes of the nuclear envelope and ER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200907015/DC1">Fig. S4 A</ext-link>). The retention of 2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> on some membranes was possibly caused by the highly hydrophobic nature of the membrane insertion loop (MIL) in the FYVE domain of FYCO1. Indeed, similar to the RRHHCR motif, the FYCO1-specific MIL was essential for the membrane recruitment of 2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> and could not be substituted with the MIL from EEA1 (Fig. S4 B). Surprisingly, the 2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> construct containing a C-terminal end of FYCO1 after the second FYVE domain (FYCO1<sub>1,156â1,233+1,156â1,478</sub>; Fig. S1) was only weakly recruited to the ER and could be seen together with LC3 in cytosolic punctuated structures (Fig. S4 C). In contrast, FYCO1 deletion constructs containing a dimerizing CC and a single FYVE domain showed a different pattern of subcellular distribution. The FYVE domain alone (FYCO1<sub>1,156â1,233</sub>) as well as the FYVE domain with a short CC (FYCO1<sub>1,138â1,233</sub> and FYCO1<sub>1,091â1,233</sub>) were diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol and nucleus without recruitment to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref> and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, bottom). FYCO1<sub>1,038â1,233</sub> was recruited to perinuclear vesicles in 30% of transfected cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, top and middle), whereas FYCO1<sub>990â1,233</sub>, FYCO1<sub>914â1,233</sub>, and deletion mutants with a longer CC could be detected on cytosolic vesicles in all transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref> and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). These data correlate well with the in vitro dimerization properties of deletion mutants of FYCO1. FYCO1<sub>990â1,233</sub> is the smallest FYVE domainâcontaining construct that efficiently interacted with full-length FYCO1 in in vitro immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>), suggesting that the dimer of the FYVE domain from FYCO1 but not a monomer is recruited to cellular membranes. Despite the recruitment to vesicles, FYCO1<sub>990â1,233</sub> showed very little or no colocalization with 2xFYVE<sub>Hrs</sub> or PX<sub>p40phox</sub> constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>, top). At the same time, FYCO1<sub>990â1,233</sub> staining completely overlapped with Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>, middle) and colocalized with LysoTracker and dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>, bottom), indicating a lysosomal/late endosomal localization of this construct. To confirm that the CC in front of the FYVE domain is responsible for recruitment to LEs/lysosomes, we generated a chimeric 2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> construct containing a CC region of different length in front of the first FYVE domain. As expected, FYCO1<sub>990â1,233+1,156â1,233</sub> showed a mixed ER and late endosomal/lysosomal localization but colocalized only weakly with PX<sub>p40phox</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>).</p>

        <p>There are several possible explanations for the difference in subcellular distribution of 2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> compared with FYCO1<sub>990â1,233</sub>. Although both probes bound only to PI3P in the in vitro assay, we cannot exclude the possibility that they have different lipid-binding preferences in vivo. Alternatively, the CC region in front of the FYVE domain could be involved in proteinâprotein interactions that would target FYCO1 to specific membrane subdomains. Interestingly, both EEA1 and RUFY1 can bind Rab5 or -4 with their CC regions in front of the FYVE domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simonsen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cormont et al., 2001</xref>). Multiple sequence alignment of FYCO1 from different species revealed that amino acid conservation in a region preceding the FYVE domain (aa 1,120â1,165) is much higher than in other parts of the CC and comparable to the conservation of the FYVE domain itself (Fig. S3 B), suggesting its important functional role.</p>

        <title>Rab7 forms a complex with FYCO1 and induces the recruitment of FYCO1 to intracellular membranes</title>
        <p>Because Rab7 strongly colocalizes with FYCO1<sub>990â1,233</sub> and full-length FYCO1, we tested whether it can recruit the FYVE domain from FYCO1 onto LEs/lysosomes in a CC-dependent manner. Although FYCO1<sub>1,038â1,233</sub> was recruited to membranes only in 30% of transfected cells, it colocalized with Rab7Q67L (GTP-locked mutant of Rab7)-decorated vesicles in 80% of cotransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, top and graph). Moreover, although the FYCO1<sub>1,091â1,233</sub> deletion mutant displayed only diffuse nuclearâcytosolic distribution when expressed alone, it was readily recruited to vesicles upon cotransfection with Rab7Q67L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, bottom). No such effect was observed with the FYCO1<sub>1,156â1,233</sub> construct lacking the CC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, middle). Similarly, the FYCO1<sub>1,091â1,233+1,156â1,233</sub> chimeric protein containing a 65-aa-long CC in front of the first FYVE domain of tandem repeat of two FYVE domains displayed an ER/nuclear envelope staining pattern when expressed alone and was redistributed to Rab7Q67L-decorated vesicles upon cotransfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). To confirm that such redistribution is mediated by a CC region and is not FYVE domain specific, we generated chimeric constructs containing a CC region from FYCO1 fused to a tandem of FYVE domains from Hrs (FYCO1<sub>1â1,160</sub> + 2xFYVE<sub>Hrs</sub> and FYCO1<sub>990â1,160</sub> + 2xFYVE<sub>Hrs</sub>). These two fusion proteins but not 2xFYVE<sub>Hrs</sub> were recruited to Rab7Q67L-decorated vesicles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200907015/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>). These data show that Rab7 can indeed recruit the FYVE domain from FYCO1 to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments in a CC-dependent manner. Consistently, Rab7 and FYCO1 were in the same complex and coimmunoprecipitated together from HEK293 cells lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). FYCO1 interacted preferentially with the GTP-locked Rab7Q67L mutant and not with the GDP-locked Rab7T22N mutant (Fig. S5 A). Moreover, mutation of conserved L1151 and W1152 in the CC region preceding the FYVE domain to alanines led to the dramatic redistribution of the FYCO1<sub>990â1,233</sub> construct to the nuclear envelope and ER in a pattern similar to the subcellular distribution of 2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> and strongly reduced its colocalization with Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>).</p>
        <p>RILP (Rab-interacting lysosomal protein) and ORP1L (oxysterol-binding proteinârelated protein 1 long) are two well-known Rab7 effector proteins. They can bind simultaneously to Rab7 and regulate the MT minus endâdirected transport of LEs/lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johansson et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of RILP but not ORP1L or Rab7 resulted in a strong decrease in the number of FYCO1-decorated vesicles in cells and a decrease in the number of cells with FYCO1 vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>), suggesting a competition between RILP and FYCO1 for binding to Rab7.</p>

        <title>FYCO1 redistributes Rab7- and ORP1L-decorated vesicles to the MT plus end</title>
        <p>Interestingly, although endogenous FYCO1 was stained in punctuated structures in the juxtanuclear region or throughout the cytosol, overexpressed FYCO1 was enriched in cytosolic dots and vesicles at the cell periphery, close to the MT plus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). This localization of overexpressed protein was dependent on intact MTs. Treatment of cells with the MT-depolymerizing agents colcemid and vinblastine led to the redistribution of FYCO1 vesicles from the cellular periphery to clusters throughout the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>), whereas actin-depolymerizing agents latrunculin A and cytochalasin B preserved FYCO1 vesicles in distinct peripheral cellular protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Movement of FYCO1 structures along the MT tracks was also detected by live cell imaging of HeLa cells transfected with GFP-tubulin and mCherry-FYCO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200907015/DC1">Video 1</ext-link>). Overexpressed FYCO1 was not only enriched close to the MT plus ends itself, but it also redistributed LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), Rab7, and ORP1L to this location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). There are several possible explanations for this phenotype. Overexpressed FYCO1 can compete with endogenous RILP for binding to Rab7, uncoupling the MT minus endâdirected transport. Alternatively, FYCO1 can actively participate in anterograde MT transport by linking Rab7 to kinesin motor proteins. The first hypothesis implies that any deletion mutant of FYCO1 that colocalizes with Rab7 should promote the redistribution of Rab7 vesicles to MT plus ends. This was not the case for small constructs such as FYCO1<sub>990â1,233</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>) and FYCO1<sub>914â1,233</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>), which, together with Rab7, decorated perinuclear vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). To map the region of FYCO1 important for the MT plus end transport, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of deletion mutants of FYCO1. RUN and GOLD domains as well as the N-terminal part of the CC were not essential for the FYCO1 overexpression phenotype. A FYCO1 mutant lacking the CC domain between aa 555 and 1,136 was localized to perinuclear vesicles instead of cellular periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>) and was not able to redistribute Rab7 or ORP1L to a peripheral location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). To increase the mapping accuracy, we compared the subcellular distribution of FYCO1 deletion mutants containing only a CC domain of different length, followed by the FYVE domain. Although FYCO1<sub>914â1,233</sub>, FYCO1<sub>863â1,233</sub>, and FYCO1<sub>771â1,233</sub> were localized to the perinuclear vesicles, similar to FYCO1<sub>Î555â1,136</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>), extension of the CC from aa 771 to 675 in the FYCO1<sub>675â1,233</sub> construct resulted in the dramatic redistribution of the FYCO1 deletion mutant to the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). A similar phenotype of peripherally enriched FYCO1 vesicles was also observed with FYCO1<sub>586â1,233</sub> and FYCO1<sub>483â1,233</sub> constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). Based on this data, we can conclude that the region of FYCO1 between aa 675 and 771 contains a determinant, likely a kinesin-binding site, for MT plus end targeting of FYCO1.</p>

Depletion of endogenous FYCO1 with two different siRNAs resulted in the accumulation of GFP-LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>), primarily in the form of perinuclear and peri-Golgi clusters of GFP-LC3âpositive vesicles and membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, B and C</xref>). These vesicles colocalized with mCherry-Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 D</xref>) but did not stain positive with LysoTracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 E</xref>), suggesting that they represent early autophagosomes or phagophores.</p>

      <p>The evolutionary expansion of ATG8 family proteins in mammals and plants implies a more versatile and diverse functions for these proteins in higher eukaryotes compared with yeast. The growing number of identified interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okazaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sagiv et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mansuy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MohrlÃ¼der et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cook et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nowak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwarten et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) suggests that similar to Rabs, ATG8 family proteins may function as adaptors, linking autophagosomal membranes to downstream effector proteins. Our results suggest that FYCO1, the novel interaction partner of LC3 identified in this study, functions as an effector of both LC3 and Rab7. It resides on the external surface of autophagosomes/LEs/lysosomes and promotes MT plus endâdirected transport of these membranous compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). FYCO1 contains an N-terminal RUN domain, a central CC region, and a C-terminal cluster of globular domains. The RUN domain of FYCO1 is likely to bind Rab or Rap family GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kukimoto-Niino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Recacha et al., 2009</xref>). The central CC region has several important functions. First of all, if fully extended, it spatially separates N- and C-terminal globular domains of FYCO1 a distance of â¼120â130 nm (predicted length of the CC of 850 nm). This enables FYCO1 to interact with two spatially distant proteinâprotein or proteinâlipid complexes and connect these complexes or associated membranous compartments into a single functional unit. Second, the CC region is responsible for the dimerization of FYCO1. Finally, the CC of FYCO1 has several protein-binding regions. The central part between aa 675 and 771 contains a determinant, likely a kinesin-binding site, for the targeting of FYCO1 to the MT plus end. The C-terminal part of the CC is responsible for the colocalization of FYCO1 with Rab7.</p>

      <p>The subcellular distribution of the 2xFYVE<sub>FYCO1</sub> and FYCO1<sub>990â1,233</sub>L1151A/W1152A constructs suggests that the FYVE domain of FYCO1 has intrinsic affinity for ER membranes. Recent studies show that in addition to PI3P binding, several other proteinâlipid interactions may determine the subcellular localization of the FYVE domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dumas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kutateladze et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to lipid binding, the subcellular distribution of full-length FYCO1 is fine-tuned by proteinâprotein interactions mediated by regions adjacent to the FYVE domain. C-terminally to the FYVE domain, an â¼100-aa-long acidic region lacking regular secondary structure connects the globular FYVE and GOLD domains and possibly forms a flexible acidic loop (Fig. S2 C). Because this region of FYCO1 showed an inhibitory effect on in vitro PI3P binding and reduced the recruitment of FYVE domainâcontaining mutants to intracellular membranes (Fig. S2 B), we speculate that it can fold onto the basic lipid interaction surface of the FYVE domain and maintain FYCO1 in a lipid-unbound state. Interestingly, the middle part of this unstructured region contains an LIR and can bind LC3. Recombinant LC3B partially rescues the PI3P-binding properties of FYCO1<sub>863â1,478</sub> in vitro, suggesting that the binding of LC3 to LIR can unfold the acidic loop from the lipid-binding surface and prime FYCO1 for the membrane binding (Fig. S2 D). This would ensure binding of FYCO1 only to membranes containing LC3 on their surface.</p>
      <p>The second proteinâprotein interaction determining the subcellular localization of FYCO1 is mediated by Rab7 and the conserved part of the CC region of FYCO1 directly adjacent to the N-terminal end of the FYVE domain. We suggest that, similar to RILP-Rab7 and GCC185-Rab6 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burguete et al., 2008</xref>), FYCO1 and Rab7 may form a heterotetrameric complex with the central parallel CC of FYCO1 binding two molecules of Rab7.</p>
      <p>Cytosolic dynein1 has previously been suggested as an MT minus endâdirected molecular motor for both autophagosomes and LEs/lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johansson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). RILP and ORP1L bound to Rab7 are responsible for the recruitment of the dynactinâdynein complex to the surface of LEs/lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johansson et al., 2007</xref>), whereas little is known about the adaptor complex that links autophagosomes to microtubular molecular motors. Competition between FYCO1âkinesin and RILPâdynactinâdynein1 complexes for Rab7 binding and recruitment to LEs/lysosomes is a plausible mechanism for reciprocal regulation of the number of molecular motors with opposite direction specificity on the surface of these vesicles.</p>
      <p>Based on our experimental data, we suggest the following model of FYCO1 function. At sufficient nutrient supply, FYCO1 preferentially resides on the membranes of perinuclear ER in a conformation that prevents its binding to kinesins. Upon amino acid starvation, it binds to the MT plus endâdirected motors and redistributes preautophagosomal membranous compartments to the sites of autophagosome formation throughout the cytosol. After the formation of autophagosomes, FYCO1 competes with the dynein recruitment complex for binding to Rab7 and membrane recruitment and provides regulated bidirectional transport of autophagosomes along the MT track.</p>
      <p>We identified a hypothetical FYCO1 orthologue in the genome of the morphologically simplest multicellular metazoan <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic> (NCBI accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="genpept" xlink:href="XP_002109478.1">XP_002109478.1</ext-link>) but failed to find orthologues in the single-cell choanoflagellate <italic>Monosiga brevicollis</italic> or yeasts. Interestingly, the dependence of autophagy on the MT cytoskeleton seems also to be restricted to metazoans. Although an intact MT network is required for starvation-induced autophagy in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fass et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">KÃ¶chl et al., 2006</xref>), no such dependence was observed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirisako et al., 1999</xref>). Multiple studies suggest that the actin cytoskeleton rather than MTs is important for several types of autophagy in yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reggiori et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monastyrska et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>FYCO1, similar to EEA1 and RUFY proteins, has two predicted Rab-binding sites flanking the CC region, potentially enabling binding to Rab proteins located on different vesicles tethering these together. Indeed, overexpressed FYCO1 is localized onto the surface of LEs/lysosomes of up to 2 Âµm in diameter in HeLa cells and up to 15 Âµm in HEK293 cells, suggesting that it promotes the fusion and enlargement of these compartments. The nature of the compartments that undergo fusion is presently unknown. Despite tight clustering of FYCO1-decorated vesicles, we observed very few homotypic fusions between these structures, suggesting that FYCO1 does not facilitate the homotypic fusion of autophagosomes/LEs/lysosomes. In conclusion, in this study, we identified FYCO1, a novel protein harboring a long CC, binding to PI3P via its FYVE domain and acting as an LC3 and Rab7 effector protein with MT plus endâdirected transport and possible membrane-tethering functions.</p>

Video 1 shows the movement of mCherry-FYCO1âpositive vesicles along the MTs. Table S1 lists the plasmids used in this study. Table S2 lists descriptions of some of the cDNA constructs made by traditional subcloning or site-directed mutagenesis in this study. The supplemental text lists other cDNA constructs made by traditional subcloning or site-directed mutagenesis and Gateway LR reactions in this study.
