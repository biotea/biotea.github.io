      <abstract>
        <p>Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) directs migration of blood monocytes to inflamed tissues. Despite the central role of chemotaxis in immune responses, the regulation of chemotaxis by signal transduction pathways and their in vivo significance remain to be thoroughly deciphered. In this study, we examined the intracellular location and functions of two recently identified regulators of chemotaxis, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent phospholipase (iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î²) and cytosolic phospholipase (cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î±), and substantiate their in vivo importance. These enzymes are cytoplasmic in unstimulated monocytes. Upon MCP-1 stimulation, iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² is recruited to the membrane-enriched pseudopod. In contrast, cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± is recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum. Although iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² or cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN)âtreated monocytes display reduced speed, iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² also regulates directionality and actin polymerization. iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² or cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± antisense ODNâtreated adoptively transferred mouse monocytes display a profound defect in migration to the peritoneum in vivo. These converging observations reveal that iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² and cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± regulate monocyte migration from different intracellular locations, with iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² acting as a critical regulator of the cellular compass, and identify them as potential targets for antiinflammatory strategies.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Chemokine-induced recruitment of peripheral blood leukocytes to tissues is a critical step in development of inflammatory responses. Hence, specific inhibition of leukocyte migration is envisaged as a rational therapeutic approach for inflammatory diseases (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which is a critical ligand for monocyte chemotaxis, binds to its receptor CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and recruits monocytes to inflamed sites in a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). MCP-1 or CCR2 knockout mice exhibited a severe reduction in monocyte chemotaxis to thioglycolate-induced peritonitis and resistance to atherosclerosis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), suggesting that MCP-1 and CCR2 are required for monocyte migration in both health and disease.</p>
    <p>Despite the significance of MCP-1 and monocytes in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, our understanding of how MCP-1 transforms random migration of monocytes to directed migration is limited to identification of a few regulatory signaling molecules. These include phospholipase C (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), Src, Syk, MAPKs p42/44ERK1/2, p38, JNK (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), Pyk2 (unpublished data), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), protein kinase CÎ² (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and association of Arp2/3 with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Earlier, we discovered Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent phospholipase (iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î²) and cytosolic phospholipase (cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î±) as critical regulators of monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1. Monocytes rendered deficient in iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² by treatment with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) displayed normal cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± activity, and vice versa. Furthermore, monocytes rendered deficient in iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² or cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± by their antisense ODNs are restored for chemotaxis to MCP-1 if treated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or arachidonic acid (AA), respectively, yet both enzymes are required for monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These observations led us to hypothesize that iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² and cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± might be recruited to different intracellular locations, and that they might regulate distinct properties of monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1. In this study, we tested these possibilities by examining MCP-1âinduced redistribution of these phospholipases and by evaluating their contributions to the characteristics of monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1. We report that MCP-1 induces iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² recruitment to the membrane-enriched pseudopod, whereas cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± is recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum. Although both enzymes regulate speed and net migration of monocytes toward MCP-1, directionality is governed by iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î², likely by regulating F-actin polymerization. Finally, we validate the requirement for both of these phospholipases for monocyte chemotaxis in vivo using a novel mouse model.</p>

        <title>iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² regulates monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1</title>
        <p>The antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (AS-ODN) used in our previous study to identify the involvement of iPLA<sub>2</sub> was directed against the form of iPLA<sub>2</sub> that was eventually classified as iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). iPLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms (Î²/Î³) display different sensitivities to R or S enantiomers of the pharmacological inhibitor bromoenol lactone (BEL), with iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² being 10 times more sensitive to (S)-BEL than to (R)-BEL (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). As predicted, (S)-BEL caused stronger reduction of MCP-1âinduced monocyte chemotaxis compared with (R)-BEL at all concentrations tested, providing additional evidence that monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1 is indeed regulated by iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p>

<bold>MCP-1 induces recruitment of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² to the cell membraneâenriched pseudopod of monocytes.</bold> (A) To identify the iPLA<sub>2</sub> isoform regulating monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1, monocytes were treated with racemicâBEL (â), (R)-BEL (â¢), or (S)âBEL (â´) at various concentrations (as indicated) for 1 h at 37Â°C. Chemotaxis to MCP-1 was assessed using the microchamber assay. Migration of untreated monocytes in the presence (â¡) and absence (âª) of MCP-1 were used as controls. (B) MCP-1 induces redistribution of iPLA<sub>2</sub>b. The mean fluorescent intensity of iPLA<sub>2</sub>b in the tail, midbody, and pseudopod of polar monocytes, either in the presence or absence of MCP-1, was determined. Data represent the mean Â± the SEM of 40â50 monocytes from 3 independent experiments. (CâH) Colocalization iPLA<sub>2</sub>b (Alexa Fluor 488) and F-actin, Cdc42, or Na-K ATPase (Alexa Fluor 594) was visualized by observing the distribution of chromophores in a single plane passing through the nucleus.

          <title>iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² is recruited to the plasma membrane and the pseudopod.</title>
          <p>Unstimulated monocytes showed different morphologies that varied from spherical to polar with diffuse, cytoplasmic iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C, E, and G</xref>, left). Upon MCP-1 stimulation, migrating cells displayed polar morphology, and iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² showed increased distribution at the cell periphery, particularly in the membrane-enriched pseudopod (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C, E, G</xref>, right). Quantification of mean fluorescent intensity of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² in the tail, midbody, and pseudopod of migrating monocytes suggests that, in the absence of MCP-1, iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² was localized predominantly in the tail of monocytes; however, in response to MCP-1, the distribution was reversed and the majority of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² was detected in the pseudopod of moving cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). These observations demonstrate that MCP-1 induces preferential recruitment of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² from the tail to the pseudopod of migrating monocytes.</p>
          <p>Because MCP-1âinduced chemotaxis of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î²-deficient cells could be rescued with LPA (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), which is known to induce focal adhesion assembly (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), it is likely that iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² affects monocyte migration by interacting with an essential component of the pseudopod. Therefore, we evaluated the colocalization of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² with F-actin and Cdc42, which are two known markers of the pseudopod (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and E</xref>). In the presence of MCP-1, F-actin was enriched in the pseudopod of migrating monocytes and showed increased colocalization with iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, right, merged image). Quantitative evaluation showed that the MCP-1âinduced increased colocalization of F-actin with iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² was not dependent on the polar morphology of monocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, filled versus black-hatched bar), and that it correlated with significantly enhanced colocalization of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² with Cdc42 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E and 1F</xref>). Together, these results show that MCP-1 induces redistribution of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² in nonpolar monocytes that eventually culminates in the increased presence of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² in the pseudopod of polar monocytes.</p>
          <p>Association of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² with the cell membrane was evaluated by visualizing the colocalization of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² with Na-K-ATPase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Quantitative evaluation suggested that MCP-1âtreated polar monocytes displayed significantly higher colocalization of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² with Na-K-ATPase compared with untreated monocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). To rule out the possibility that this was an artifact caused by the small size of the monocytes, the percentage distribution of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² associated with the cell membrane was also determined by quantifying pixel intensity of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² on the peripheral cell membrane and in the whole cell (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). As shown in Fig. S1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071243/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071243/DC1</ext-link>), MCP-1 induced approximately twofold induction of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² recruitment to the cell membrane in both polar or nonpolar monocytes, suggesting that recruitment of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² to the cell membrane is specifically induced by MCP-1, regardless of cell polarity.</p>

          <title>cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± is recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum.</title>
          <p>Because of the stimulus and cell typeâdependent variability in intracellular locations of cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î±, we initially explored the recruitment of cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± to early endosomes, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum by costaining with Rab 5, lectin GS-II, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), respectively. cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± showed minimal or no localization with the Golgi or early endosomes (unpublished data). In the absence of MCP-1, cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± was distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, left) and did not reveal specific colocalization with PDI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, arrowhead). In MCP-1âstimulated cells, cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± was concentrated in the posterior region of the cell and colocalized with PDI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, right). MCP-1 induced a significant increase in recruitment of cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± to the endoplasmic reticulum, irrespective of cell polarity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, filled versus black-hatched bar).</p>

          <title>iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² and cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± do not colocalize.</title>
          <p>To further substantiate that MCP-1 induces localization of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² and cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± to different intracellular sites, both enzymes were visualized together, and the percentage of colocalization of the phospholipases was determined. In MCP-1âstimulated monocytes, cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± was concentrated in the posterior main body of the cell; in contrast, iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² was concentrated in the pseudopod (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, right, merged image). Furthermore, the cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î±-rich posterior region was relatively devoid of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² staining, whereas the iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î²-enriched pseudopod showed minimal cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, right, merged image, arrow versus arrowhead). The colocalization of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² with cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± (28 Â± 6%), or vice versa (32 Â± 6%), remained statistically unaltered because of MCP-1 treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>).</p>
          <p>In summary, microscopic observations reveal that MCP-1 induces redistribution of both enzymes; cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± is recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² is recruited to the membrane-enriched pseudopod of monocytes, and these phospholipases do not colocalize.</p>

        <title>iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² and cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± regulate MCP-1âinduced net distance of monocyte migration</title>
        <p>To gather insight as to how cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± and iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² modify chemotaxis of monocytes to MCP-1, we evaluated their effects on the net distance traveled by monocytes in a gradient of MCP-1 using an under-agarose assay. For these studies, we used previously characterized antisense ODNs to assess the effect of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² and cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± deficiency on MCP-1âinduced chemotaxis of monocytes. It is important to note that these antisense ODNs have been shown to specifically target these enzymes and do not modulate the expression of CCR2 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Monocytes were allowed to respond to MCP-1 for 1 h, fixed, and analyzed for net distance. Net distance was determined by measuring the distance of all migrated cells from the periphery of the well to their final position, and it reflects the cumulative effect of change in speed and direction. As shown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), MCP-1 increased the chemotaxis of monocytes and the migrated cells traveled to 1.82-fold greater net distance (3,082.2 Î¼m) than unstimulated cells (1,722 Î¼m). When treated with iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² antisense ODN, 98.7% reduction was observed in MCP-1âinduced chemotaxis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). These monocytes displayed reduced net distance (88%) in response to MCP-1 (1,631.4 Î¼m) compared with MCP-1âstimulated cells that were not treated with ODN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± expression with antisense ODN caused 94% reduction in MCP-1âinduced chemotaxis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and 84% inhibition of net distance traveled compared with ODN-untreated, MCP-1âunstimulated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These observations suggest that, upon MCP-1 stimulation, more monocytes migrate toward MCP-1, and that migrating monocytes travel twice the distance compared with unstimulated cells.</p>

        <title>iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² regulates both speed and directionalityof monocyte chemotaxis</title>
        <p>Reduced net distance of migration of monocytes rendered deficient in phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> by antisense ODN, as described in the previous section, in response to MCP-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) can be caused by a change in the total distance, speed, or net migration of monocytes toward MCP-1 (net-X distance). Therefore, the relative contribution of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² and cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± to these parameters was delineated by quantitative analysis of time-lapse photomicrographs.</p>
        <p>As shown in wind-rose plots (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), in the absence of MCP-1, monocytes showed random migration (top left). Upon MCP-1 stimulation, cells migrated toward the source of MCP-1 and traveled longer distances (bottom left). Cells treated with sense ODN to iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² migrated similarly to untreated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, middle). Interestingly, monocytes treated with iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² antisense ODN showed a more clustered migratory pattern both in the absence or presence of MCP-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, right top and bottom). Quantitative analysis of all cells that could be tracked for 60 min (<italic>n</italic>) revealed that in response to MCP-1, monocytes migrated significantly faster than unstimulated monocytes and equally to sense ODNâtreated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In contrast, treatment of monocytes with antisense ODN to iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² significantly decreased the speed of migrating monocytes from 7.58 Â± 0.62 to 5.93 Â± 0.49 m/min (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Furthermore, iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² antisense ODNâtreated cells showed a significant reduction in net distance, whereas the net distance traveled by sense ODN-treated monocytes remained unaltered (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>).

        <p>We reasoned that speed or net distance merely reflect migration of monocytes, irrespective of their direction. In contrast, the ability of monocytes to reach inflamed sites depends on their ability to navigate toward the source of MCP-1. Hence, the contribution of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² in directed migration of monocytes toward MCP-1 was determined by quantification of net-X distance that denotes the net value of the X coordinate toward MCP-1. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>, MCP-1 induced a fivefold induction in net-X. Treatment of monocytes with sense ODN to iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² had no effect; in contrast, monocytes treated with antisense ODN to iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² displayed significant reduction in net-X.</p>
        <p>To further probe whether the loss of directionality contributed to the reduced net-X distance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>) and clustered migratory pattern of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² antisense ODN-treated monocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, bottom right), turn analysis was performed. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>, MCP-1âtreated monocytes make fewer wide turns (â¥30 degrees, 9 Â± 0.81), which is similar to monocytes treated with sense ODN to iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² (9.66 Â± 0.76). In contrast, iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² antisense ODNâtreated monocytes make more frequent wide turns (&gt;30 degrees, 14.2 Â± 1.39). The MCP-1âstimulated monocytes without the ODN treatment showed a significant reduction in average angle per turn from 71.08 Â± 7.37 to 35.54 Â± 4.18 degrees compared with monocytes without MCP-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). This effect was totally abrogated in iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² antisense ODNâtreated monocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>), suggesting that iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² is a contributor to the cellular compass.</p>

        <p>MCP-1âinduced recruitment of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² to the F-actinârich pseudopod and the significant loss of directionality of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² antisense ODNâtreated monocytes suggested that iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² might be involved in actin polymerization. We tested this possibility by evaluating the effect of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² inhibition on MCP-1âinduced actin polymerization. MCP-1 induced a significant increase in the level of F-actin. Interestingly, inhibition of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² by BEL caused significant reduction in F-actin levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Furthermore, iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² antisense ODNâtreated monocytes displayed a significant reduction in actin polymerization compared with ODN-untreated or iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² sense ODNâtreated monocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>).

        <p>We developed a novel adoptive transfer mouse model to validate the regulatory functions of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² and cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± in monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1 in vivo. It is based on the following: (a) migration of monocytes to the peritoneum in thioglycolate-induced peritonitis in wild-type mice is dependent on MCP-1(7); (b) mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cell preparations do not contain neutrophils, and lymphocytes do not respond to MCP-1; (c) monocytes, by virtue of being fluorescently labeled with a stable PKH26, can be distinguished from unlabeled endogenous cells of the recipient mice; (d) we hypothesize that treatment of cells with phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>âspecific inhibitors or antisense ODNs before adoptive transfer will cause migration of fewer adoptively transferred monocytes; and (e) because adoptively transferred cells constitute only a small fraction of total blood cells (11â14%), migration of endogenous leukocytes of the recipient mouse to the peritoneum will not be affected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>).</p>

          <title>Pharmacological inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î±/iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² suppresses monocyte migration in vivo.</title>
          <p>Earlier, we reported that the iPLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor racemic-BEL and the cPLA<sub>2</sub>/iPLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF<sub>3</sub>) both suppressed MCP-1âinduced chemotaxis of primary monocytes (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As predicted from these in vitro data, significantly fewer AACOCF<sub>3</sub>-treated monocytes migrated to the peritoneum in the adoptive transfer model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Surprisingly, no significant difference was observed in the migration of monocytes treated with racemic-BEL compared with untreated monocytes. The inefficiency of racemic-BEL to inhibit monocyte migration in vivo was found to be caused by time-dependent recovery of BEL-treated monocytes at 37Â°C in vitro (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071243/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071243/DC1</ext-link>). To determine whether the apparent efficacy of AACOCF<sub>3</sub> in vivo was caused by toxicity, we examined monocyte survival and chemotaxis to MCP-1 24 h after treatment with AACOCF<sub>3</sub> in vitro. As shown in Fig. S3, AACOCF<sub>3</sub> treatment did not affect monocyte survival, and the monocytes still displayed significant reduction in chemotaxis to MCP-1 compared with untreated monocytes. These observations suggest that effectiveness of AACOCF<sub>3</sub> was caused by the stable inhibitory effect of AACOCF<sub>3</sub> on cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± and iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î². As expected, no change was observed in either total monocytes or total leukocytes in the peritoneal lavage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>).</p>

          <p>Because AACOCF<sub>3</sub> inhibits both iPLA<sub>2</sub> and cPLA<sub>2</sub> and racemic-BEL proved ineffective in vivo, we tested the effect of specific antisense ODNs. iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² antisense ODN used in this study has previously been demonstrated to reduce iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² protein expression in both murine and human monocytes/macrophages (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).

Similarly, cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± antisense ODN reduced monocyte chemotaxis in vitro without affecting iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² protein expression or enzyme activity (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It reduced the expression of cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± both in human and murine monocytes (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071243/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071243/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Our studies characterize the important relative contributions of cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± and iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² for regulating monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1. Reduced migration of adoptively transferred, phospholipase-antisense ODNâtreated mouse monocytes to the peritoneum in response to thioglycolate indicates the important signaling roles of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² and cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± in monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1 in vivo.</p>
      <p>The intracellular locations of these phospholipases vary with the type of cell and nature of stimulus. For example, in INS-1 cells, iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² translocates to the perinuclear region during endoplasmic reticulum stress or stimulation with glucose (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), whereas in smooth muscles cells, iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² is associated with the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Similarly, cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± has been reported to be associated with the nuclear membrane, Golgi complex, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and an undefined intracellular compartment (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Our observations of the significant increase in colocalization of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² with membrane and pseudopod markers and of cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± with the ER marker in nonpolar but MCP-1âstimulated monocytes suggest that their recruitment to distinct intracellular locations is induced by MCP-1. This conclusion is further supported by the insignificant colocalization of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² with cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î±, and vice versa.</p>
      <p>Earlier, we showed the restoration of chemotaxis of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î²-deficient monocytes to MCP-1 with LPA (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). LPA has been reported to induce phospholipase D (PLD) activity, cytoskeleton rearrangements, and assembly of focal adhesions (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). PLD can generate phosphatidic acid (PA) from membrane phospholipids (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Interestingly, PA is a preferred substrate of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î², yielding LPA (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).We have observed that PLD activity is induced by MCP-1 and required for monocyte chemotaxis (unpublished data). Furthermore, PLD is required for LPA-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements, likely through LPA formation (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). As schematically represented in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, these observations tempt us to speculate that in response to MCP-1, PLD acts on membrane phospholipids to generate PA, and then iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² acts on PA to liberate LPA. LPA possibly interacts with components of pseudopod assembly and regulates cytoskeletal reorganization; hence, speed and directionality of monocytes. This conjecture is reinforced by observations that actin polymerization is spatially localized to the membrane-enriched pseudopod, where iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² is recruited in response to MCP-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>), MCP-1 induces association of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² with F-actin, irrespective of cell polarity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), and MCP-1âinduced actin polymerization is significantly reduced in response to iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² inhibition or reduced expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

Both enzymes regulate the net migration of monocytes; therefore, deficiency of either of them inhibits chemotaxis of monocytes.</p>

      <p>MCP-1 chemotaxis can be restored in cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î±-deficient monocytes by AA (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Thus, cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± may contribute to monocyte migration by generating AA in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). AA can be converted into various metabolites, such as prostaglandins, lipoxins, LTB4, and H(P)ETEs via COX-2, cytochrome P450, or lipoxygenase pathways (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Lipoxins induce RhoA- and Rac-mediated actin reorganization in monocytes/macrophages (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), whereas prostaglandin 2 increases migration of dendritic cells (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Our observations, in view of these reports, call for identification of key metabolites of AA that regulate monocyte migration to MCP-1.</p>
      <p>Directed cell migration is initiated by sensing of chemotactic stimuli, and culminates in the directed migration of cells. During this process, an external shallow gradient of chemokine is perceived, translated, and amplified into a stable intracellular gradient of signaling molecules that results in the formation of pseudopod at the front and uropod in the rear of a migrating cell. The pseudopod is formed by the activation of the heterotrimeric GTP binding protein Gi, whereas the uropod is formed by the activation of heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein G<sub>12/13</sub>. Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate (PtdIns[3,4,5]P<sub>3</sub>), a key lipid messenger, is synthesized in the leading edge by PI(3)Ks and is degraded by PTEN in the rear edge of migrating cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This vectorial metabolism gives rise to an intracellular gradient of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. Pseudopod is organized by Rac/PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>/actin and is stabilized by the scaffold Hem-1 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In contrast, the uropod is organized by Rho-mediated, myosin-based contractions (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). This distinct intracellular hierarchy is thought to commence polarity and ensure directed migration of cells in a chemokine gradient. Multiple signaling molecules are believed to orchestrate these distinct events at the opposing edges of a migrating cell. For example, Cdc42 regulates stability and location of the leading edge, whereas Rac, which transforms random migration of fibroblasts and epithelial cells to directed migration (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), only controls morphological and invasion characteristics of macrophages (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Vav1 is supposed to control the speed of migrating macrophages (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In neutrophils, deficiency of Rho GEF Lsc causes faster migration and loss of directionality (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), whereas deficiency of PI3KÎ³ causes only loss of directionality (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum,</italic> PTEN regulates levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>; in contrast, in neutrophils, it is metabolized by the PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> phosphatase SHIP1 rather than PTEN. These observations not only point toward evolution of cell-based variability in key signaling molecules, they also provide an impetus to search for unknown members of these cascades (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p>
      <p>Once considered a probable cellular compass, recent reports suggest that PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is primarily a component of positive-feedback loop controlling persistent actin dynamics (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Emerging concepts argue for the existence of parallel signaling pathways for chemotaxis and indicate that an unknown cellular compass exists upstream of PI3KÎ³ (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Interestingly, a calcium-independent phospholipase (PLA<sub>2</sub>A) that liberates AA from phosphatidylcholine and acts in parallel with PI3K/PTEN has recently been implicated in chemotaxis of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Because iPLA<sub>2</sub> does not show a preference for the fatty acyl moiety at the sn-2 position of phospholipids, and <italic>D. discoideum</italic> does not contain cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î±, it is possible that PLA<sub>2</sub>A merely performs twin functions of cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± and iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² by liberating LPA and AA. Our observations on loss of directionality of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î²-deficient monocytes raise the possibility that iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² is either a cellular compass or a component of a cellular compass. Our observations, together with recent reports (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), suggest that phospholipases are critical components of parallel signaling pathways regulating monocyte chemotaxis as schematically represented in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>. How iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² directs monocytes toward MCP-1, as well as whether it is a universal regulator of chemotaxis, remains to be deciphered. One key function ascribed to iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² is membrane remodeling and membrane trafficking that brings about changes in shape and fluidity of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). It will be interesting to explore whether iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² regulates monocyte chemotaxis by changing lipid composition of membrane rafts, thereby modifying assembly of signaling molecules in the pseudopod of migrating cells (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p>
      <p>The impaired in vivo migration of adoptively transferred mouse monocytes that contain either inactive PLA<sub>2</sub> (by AACOCF<sub>3</sub>) or were rendered deficient in PLA<sub>2</sub> by AS-ODN validates our in vitro observations (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) in a dynamic in vivo milieu. We now have adapted this in vivo assay to monitor human monocyte chemotaxis (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Our reports show the importance of in vitro studies for identification of potential signaling components. Our in vivo MCP-1 chemotaxis assay provides a straightforward approach to verify the relevance of signaling pathways that appear promising for regulating MCP-1âdependent chemotaxis in vitro.</p>
      <p>In summary, our studies provide insight into how two seemingly similar phospholipases regulate directed migration of monocytes from different intracellular sites. We report that MCP-1 induces chemotaxis of monocytes by increasing speed, as well as introducing directionality. By translocating to the pseudopod and regulating directionality and speed, iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² acts front and center, whereas in contrast, cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± is recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum and regulates only speed. The profound defects in migration of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î²- or cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î±-deficient mouse monocytes in vivo validate the important roles for these enzymes in regulating extravasation of blood monocytes to sites of inflammation.</p>

        <p>Monocytes were pretreated with Racemic-BEL or its R or S enantiomers (0.1â5 Î¼M) or AACOCF<sub>3</sub> (50 Î¼M) at 37Â°C in 10% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1 h, and washed in serum-free DME before being used for chemotaxis. The sense and antisense ODN sequences for phospholipases used in this study were phosphorothioate modified and purified by HPLC (Sigma-Aldrich). These ODNs were of proven efficacy and specificity, and were delivered under standardized experimental conditions, as described (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).

        <p>Monocytes were allowed to migrate using the under-agarose cell migration assay (1 h), fixed, and permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1% in PBS for 4 min). Nonspecific sites were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS (37Â°C for 1 h). Cells were incubated with primary antibody (for 1 h at 37Â°C), washed, and visualized with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (for 1 h at 37Â°C). Stained cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (DMR XE attached to TCS SP2; Leica). Horizontal sections were imaged using a 63Ã objective (magnification 5Ã, pinhole 1, and format of 1,024 Ã 1,024). Images were analyzed by Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics) and processed using Photoshop CS (Adobe).</p>

        <title>Time-lapse microscopy</title>
        <p>For this purpose, under-agarose cell migration was performed in serum-coated polystyrene six-well culture dishes, essentially as described in the previous section. The plate was placed on a preheated stage at 37Â°C under 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. Images were acquired with an inverted microscope (DMIRB; Leica) using a 10Ã phase objective. Images were acquired at 3-min intervals using 30-ms exposure times and recorded with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Cool SNAP HQ; Roper Scientific) using Metamorph software (Universal Image).</p>

        <title>Image analysis</title>
        <p>Image analysis was conducted with Image-Pro Plus. In the absence of MCP-1, randomly migrating cells often return to the well where they originated. Because of the large number of cells in the well itself, returning cells could not be followed after reentering the well. Therefore, cells that can be tracked for the 60-min duration were used for migration analysis. Total distance depicts total length of a migratory path, speed denotes total distance/60 min, and net distance depicts the linear distance between the first and the last position of a migrating cell. Net-X is the net value of the X coordinate after 60 min. The turn angle is the absolute value of the angle between successive positions of migrating cell measured from the direction of the preceding position. Average angle/turn depicts the average angles of the turns taken by a migrating cell during 60 min of migration at 3-min intervals.</p>

BALB/CJ female mice (7â8 mo, two donors per recipient) were anesthetized with avertin (0.4 ml/animal). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture in a 1-ml syringe containing 0.05 ml of EDTA (0.5 M). Blood (10 ml) was diluted with 10 ml of Tricine-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mM, pH 7.4) and mixed with 5 ml of OptiPrep (Sigma-Aldrich). Blood was transferred to a suitable tube, overlayed with 0.5 ml of TBS and centrifuged at 1,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 20Â°C without the brake. The supernatant, containing mononuclear cells, was collected, diluted with 2 volumes of TBS, and centrifuged at 400 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min.

Peritoneal inflammation was induced by thioglycolate injection (1 ml, 4% in physiological saline) into the peritoneal cavity. Tail veins were dilated with limonene and cleaned with 95% ethanol. The labeled mononuclear cells (1.4â1.8 million per animal) were injected into the tail vein, and the time of injection was recorded. Injected cells represent only 11â14% of total peripheral blood mononuclear cells of similar weight recipient animals. After 24 h, peritoneal cells were harvested, washed, resuspended in PBS (1 ml), and counted. Cells were fixed and used to prepare 10 cytospins for each sample. Half of them were stained with HEMA per the manufacturer's (Thermo Fisher Scientific) instruction, to determine the number of monocytes. The remainder was mounted in Vectashield. PKH26-positive cells were counted on an upright microscope (model DMR; Leica) using a Texas red filter.</p>

        <p>Fig. S1 presents data indicating that MCP-1 induces membrane localization of iPLA<sub>2</sub>Î² in both polar and nonpolar monocytes. Fig. S2 demonstrates the transient nature of BEL inhibition of monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1 in a time-dependent manner. Fig. S3 shows the stable inhibitory effect of AACOCF<sub>3</sub> on monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1, and that AACOCF<sub>3</sub> does not affect monocyte viability under these conditions. Fig. S4 shows inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub>Î± protein expression in murine monocytes/macrophages by treatment with antisense ODN. Supplemental materials and methods are also provided.
