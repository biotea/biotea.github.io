      <abstract>
        <p>Ser/thr phosphorylation is the primary reversible covalent modification of proteins in eukaryotes. As a consequence, it is the reciprocal actions of kinases and phosphatases that act as key molecular switches to fine tune cellular events. It has been well documented that ~400 human ser/thr kinases engage substrates via consensus phosphosite sequences. Strikingly, we know comparatively little about the mechanism by which ~40 human protein ser/thr phosphatases (PSPs) dephosphorylate ~15000 different substrates with high specificity. The identification of substrates of the essential PSP calcineurin (CN) has been exceptionally challenging and only a small fraction has been biochemically confirmed. It is now emerging that CN binds regulators and substrates via two <underline>s</underline>hort <underline>li</underline>near <underline>m</underline>otifs (SLiMs), the well-studied PxIxIT SLiM and the LxVP SLiM, which remains controversial at the molecular level. Here we describe the crystal structure of CN in complex with its substrate NFATc1 and show that the LxVP SLiM is correctly defined as ÏÉ¸LxVP. Bioinformatics studies using the ÏÉ¸LxVP SLiM resulted in the identification of 567 potential CN substrates; a small subset was experimentally confirmed. This combined structural-bioinformatics approach provides a powerful method for dissecting the CN interaction network and for elucidating the role of CN in human health and disease.</p>

  <body>
    <p>One of the primary cellular signaling mechanisms used to transmit information is phosphorylation, with â¥98% of all known phosphorylation events occurring on serine and threonine residues (ser, thr). As such, it is the opposing activities of more than 428 ser/thr kinases and only ~40 ser/thr phosphatases (PSPs; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref> for abbreviations) that ensures signaling pathway fidelity. While ser/thr kinases recognize their substrates using specific phosphosite consensus sequences, PSPs act on phosphosites that share little or no sequence similarity making the identification of substrates using sequence alone challenging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. As a result, our understanding of the role of PSPs in systems wide investigations has been severely limited.</p>
    <p>Calcineurin (CN; Protein Phosphatase 2B or 3) is a ubiquitously expressed Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin activated PSP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. It is composed of a catalytic CNA subunit, which includes a calmodulin-binding and an auto-inhibitory domain, constitutively bound to a regulatory CNB subunit that binds 4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Increases in the cytoplasmic levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activate CN, which then catalyzes the dephosphorylation of a plethora of substrates critical for a diverse set of biological processes including development, learning and memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, in spite of its established role in these processes, thus far only ~50 CN substrates have been experimentally confirmed; this likely represents only a small fraction of the actual CN interaction network based on its cellular distribution and abundance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Clearly, new approaches for identifying CN substrates are needed.</p>
    <p>One process in which CN plays a critical role is in the activation of T-cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. CN activation results in the dephosphorylation of the NFAT family of transcription factors (<underline>N</underline>uclear <underline>F</underline>actor of <underline>A</underline>ctivated <underline>T</underline>-cell; NFATsc1-c4), resulting in their import into the nucleus and the induction of genes that activate T-cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. A molecular understanding of how CN dephosphorylates its target substrates with high specificity in both space and time is only now beginning to emerge.</p>
    <p>The efficient dephosphorylation of NFATs and other substrates by CN is not mediated by its recognition of specific phosphosite consensus sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Rather, recent studies have shown that the NFATs bind directly to CN using two distinct <underline>s</underline>hort <underline>li</underline>near <underline>m</underline>otifs (SLiMs), the âPxIxITâ and the âLxVPâ motifs. These motifs were originally defined based on their conservation within the NFAT family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and function to tether CN near the NFAT phosphosites, which, in some cases, can be dozens of residues away from the SLiM sequences themselves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The mechanism by which PxIxIT motifs bind CN is well established (PxIxIT residues bind an extended hydrophobic pocket present on the catalytic CNA subunit) and has led to a precise definition of this SLiM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In contrast, a detailed understanding of how LxVP motifs engage CN is just developing. The first crystal structure of a CN-LxVP complex revealed that LxVP motifs bind CN using a second hydrophobic pocket that is ~30âÃ from the PxIxIT binding site and is located at the CNA/B dimer interface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Unexpectedly, the structure also revealed that this binding pocket is identical to that of the well-known immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK-506. Thus, in addition to providing a molecular explanation of how immunosuppressants prevent NFAT dephosphorylation (they block LxVP containing substrates from binding CN), this observation also provides the proof-of-principle that drugs and small molecules that bind directly to SLiM interaction pockets, such as the LxVP binding pocket, are potent, specific inhibitors of PSPs.</p>
    <p>A molecular description of how multiple distinct PxIxIT and LxVP SLiMs bind CN will also lead to a comprehensive definition of these SLiM sequences, which can then be used to identify novel CN substrates based on sequence alone, something that thus far has been unachievable due to the lack of conservation of CN phosphosites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The identification of these novel interactors will then lead to the discovery of new processes that are regulated by CN and, as a consequence, greatly expand CN protein interaction networks. While this approach has been successful for the PxIxIT SLiM in yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, a lack of structural data has not allowed the LxVP SLiM to be defined to an accuracy suitable for such a genome wide analysis. Furthermore, the location of the LxVP binding pocket for LxVP-containing substrates (versus inhibitors) is still not fully resolved. Namely, while multiple studies suggest that LxVP-containing substrates and inhibitors bind the same pocket at the CNA/B interface, a study using only the CNA subunit suggested that LxVP-containing substrates may also bind near the PxIxIT binding pocket<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Both issues have hampered the identification of novel CN substrates. Here, we combine structural biology and biochemistry to establish a structure-based definition of the LxVP SLiM and molecularly describe how LxVP-containing substrates bind CN. We then leverage this information with bioinformatics to obtain genome wide insights into CN function and tested our predictions on a small subset of targets experimentally. This analysis resulted in the identification of nearly 600 novel potential CN substrates and significantly expands the potential physiological roles of CN in both health and disease.</p>

        <title>The NFATc1 LxVP SLiM is <sup>384</sup>DQY<underline>LAVP</underline>
<sup>390</sup></title>
        <p>To determine how LxVP-containing substrates bind CN, we determined the 2.6âÃ crystal structure of the CN:NFATc1<sub>LxVP</sub> complex (CNA-CNB-NFATc1<sub>LxVP;</sub>
<sup>383</sup>DDQY<underline>LAVP</underline>QHPYQWAKPK<sup>400</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>). Electron density was present for NFATc1<sub>LxVP</sub> SLiM residues <sup>384</sup>DQY<underline>LAVP</underline><sup>390</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, S2A). The absence of electron density for NFATc1<sub>LxVP</sub> residues 391â400 suggests that these residues remain flexible upon complex formation. To verify that only NFATc1<sub>LxVP</sub> SLiM residues <sup>384</sup>DQY<underline>LAVP</underline><sup>390</sup> are required for CN binding, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Both peptides (<sup>383</sup>DDQYLAVPQHPYQWAKPK<sup>400</sup> and <sup>383</sup>DDQYLAVPQH<sup>392</sup>) bind CN with statistically identical K<sub>D</sub>âs, 1.8âÂ±â0.1 and 1.6âÂ±â0.3âÎ¼M, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>). These K<sub>D</sub>s are similar to those reported for other LxVP motifs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and confirms that the residues visible in the CN:LxVP<sub>NFATc1</sub> crystal structure define the NFATc1 LxVP sequence that is necessary and sufficient for CN binding.</p>
        <p>The NFATc1<sub>LxVP</sub> SLiM, which buries ~950âÃ<sup>2</sup> of solvent accessible surface area, binds CN in an extended conformation to an expansive hydrophobic pocket located at the CNA/B interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This is the same pocket occupied by LxVP-containing inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. As expected, the NFATc1 residues that interact most extensively with CN are Leu387<sub>NFATc1</sub> and Val389<sub>NFATc1</sub>. Leu387<sub>NFATc1</sub> binds into a deep hydrophobic pocket formed by CN residues Trp352<sub>CNA</sub>, Phe356<sub>CNA</sub> and Val119<sub>CNB</sub> while Val389<sub>NFATc1</sub> is anchored by a comparatively shallower hydrophobic pocket formed by Trp352<sub>CNA</sub>, Pro344<sub>CNA</sub>, Leu343<sub>CNA</sub>, Try341<sub>CNA</sub> and Leu123<sub>CNB</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>, S2B). The canonical âPâ in the LxVP sequence, Pro390<sub>NFATc1</sub>, binds a third shallow hydrophobic pocket defined by residues Trp352<sub>CNA</sub>, Pro344<sub>CNA</sub> and Leu343<sub>CNA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>, S2B). While the backbone of Ala388<sub>NFATc1</sub>, the âxâ in the LxVP sequence, forms a hydrogen bond with the sidechain of Trp352<sub>CNA</sub>, its side chain makes no interactions with CN. This explains the lack of a specific amino acid requirement in this position.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>The PxIxIT and LxVP SLiM binding sites do not overlap</title>
        <p>Our structure shows that all known LxVP-containing CN interacting proteins (substrates, regulators, inhibitors) bind the same hydrophobic pocket on CN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This contrasts with a recent study which suggested that the NFATc1 peptide <sup>383</sup>DDQY<underline>LAVP</underline>QHPYQWAKPK<sup>400</sup> binds the CN PxIxIT, and not LxVP, binding pocket<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. This raised the intriguing possibility that this SLiM sequence might bind to multiple, distinct pockets on a single enzyme, something that was previously thought impossible. To test this, we used ITC. Our data shows that the NFATc1<sub>LxVP</sub>
<sup>383</sup>DDQYLAVPQHPYQWAKPK<sup>400</sup> peptide binds weakly to CNA<sub>1â348</sub> (~2-fold more weakly than to CNA/B). However, the core NFATc1<sub>LxVP</sub> peptide, <sup>383</sup>DDQYLAVPQH<sup>392</sup>, which binds CNA/B with the same affinity as the longer peptide, fails to bind CNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>). This demonstrates that the weak interaction observed between NFATc1<sub>LxVP</sub>
<sup>383</sup>DDQYLAVPQHPYQWAKPK<sup>400</sup> and CNA is not due to an interaction with its LxVP sequence, but instead is due to non-specific interactions with <sup>393</sup>PYQWAKPK<sup>400</sup>, the residues that are C-terminal to the LxVP motif. This confirms that the LxVP motif in NFATc1 binds, as our structure demonstrates, only the LxVP binding pocket.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Defining the LxVP SLiM: ÏÉ¸LxVP</title>
        <p>NFATc1-c4 LxVP sequences, which are highly but not perfectly conserved, bind CN with distinct affinities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Previous reports suggested that these differences were due to the variable number of residues between the LxVP motif and a second conserved sequence known as the WxK motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>; this motif, which is just C-terminal to the LxVP motif, was previously hypothesized to bind directly to CN)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Our structure and ITC data show that while the NFATc1 LxVP motif (<sup>387</sup>LAVP<sup>390</sup>) binds directly to CNA/B, the NFATc1 WxK motif (<sup>396</sup>WAK<sup>398</sup>) does not. This result is fully consistent with a previous NMR study which showed that no chemical shift perturbations are observed for Trp396<sub>NFATc1</sub> in the presence of CNA/B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
        <p>Thus, these data suggest that the binding affinity differences between the NFATs for CN originate from residues N-terminal to and/or including the LxVP motif. The residues immediately preceding the NFATc1-c4 LxVP motifs are similar, but not identical. First, the residues immediately N-terminal to the âLâ of the LxVP motif are always hydrophobic (i.e., Tyr386 in NFATc1, Ile387 in NFATc2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This suggests they may bind CN using a similar mechanism. Comparing the CN:NFATc1<sub>LxVP</sub> complex with CN:A238L shows that Tyr386<sub>NFATc1</sub> overlaps perfectly with Phe288<sub>A238L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This structural conservation confirms, as previously suggested, that the LxVP motif is more accurately defined as É¸LxVP, where É¸ represents a hydrophobic residue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
        <p>Second, Tyr386<sub>NFATc1</sub> (É¸ residue) is part of a newly identified 3-residue hydrogen bond network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>) between the É¸LxVP peptide and CNB. The network is centered on the sidechain of Gln385<sub>NFATc1</sub>, which forms hydrogen bonds with both Tyr386<sub>NFATc1</sub> and Gln50<sub>CNB</sub>. To date, 10 LxVP motifs in CN interacting proteins have been biochemically confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>). However, in all 10 motifs, the sidechains of amino acids in the -2 position ([-2]-É¸-L-x-V-P), such as Gln385<sub>NFATc1,</sub> function as hydrogen bond donors/acceptors. These data demonstrate that a residue capable of forming polar interactions in the -2 position is a defining feature of this motif. This is further supported by the observation that mutating the É¸ residue to an amino acid capable of hydrogen bonding in two CN substrates, DNML1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and NFATc2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, both of which have polar residues in the -2 position, enhances CN binding. Together, these data demonstrate that the LxVP SLiM is most accurately defined as ÏÉ¸LxVP, where Ï and É¸ represent a polar and hydrophobic residue, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Identifying novel, potential CN substrates using the expanded ÏÉ¸LxVP SLiM</title>
        <p>The ability to use the LxVP SLiM to identify new CN interacting proteins was previously hindered by conflicting models of LxVP binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and the lack of specificity of the motif. Our structure of CN in complex with its most well-studied substrate, NFATc1, overcomes these limitations as it confirmed that all structurally characterized LxVP sequences bind the same pocket on CN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Our structure also led to the discovery that the NFATc1 LxVP SLiM is more specific than previously thought and defined as ÏÉ¸LxVP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). A search of the Uniprot human database using this expanded SLiM, which includes all residues that have polar donor/acceptor sidechains in the -2 position as well as all residues in the 10 experimentally confirmed LxVP sites in the -1 position (Ï-É¸-LxVP: [NQDESRTH]-[YTDFILV]-L-x-V-P), results in 518 hits in 499 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>
        <p>To maximize the likelihood that these ÏÉ¸LxVP-containing proteins represent bona fide CN substrates, we applied three additional filters. The first filter ensured that all identified motifs were present in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or regions (IDRs; IUPREDââ¥â0.4) of their corresponding proteins. This is because all known SLiMs are intrinsically disordered and, thus far, all experimentally confirmed LxVP SLiMs have been found in IDRs. This IDP filter reduced the number of hits by more than 65%, resulting in 173 motifs in 161 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>; 4 proteins contained multiple ÏÉ¸LxVP motifs). The second filter ensured that the identified proteins had been previously observed to be phosphorylated on one or more ser/thr residues (Uniprot). This reduced the number of proteins to 133 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In parallel, a third filter was used to show that 126 of the 161 original ÏÉ¸LxVP-IDR containing proteins also contained the CN-specific PxIxIT SLiM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). By taking the intersection of these two sets, we identified that 89 distinct proteins contain both a pSer/pThr residue and a PxIxIT SLiM. This provides compelling support that, at minimum, 89 (55%) of the 161 proteins with expanded ÏÉ¸LxVP motifs in IDPs or IDRs are highly likely CN substrates. Interestingly, 37 proteins contained PxIxIT SLiMs but lacked pSer and/or pThr residues, indicating that this subset of hits might be modulators of CN activity but are not CN substrates, or that their phosphorylation/dephosphorylation sites are currently unknown.</p>
        <p>An analysis of the cellular distribution of these 89 likely CN substrates revealed that the highest fraction (33%) is found in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>), consistent with the known roles of CN to dephosphorylate transcription factors and DNA binding proteins that are critical for the G1-S transition of the cell cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.

        <title>Redefining the minimal four residue LxVP core sequence</title>
        <p>In parallel, we compiled a database of the 48 proteins that have been experimentally demonstrated to interact directly with CN (referred to as CN<sup>con</sup> â <underline>c</underline>o<underline>n</underline>firmed <underline>CN</underline> interactors; to date, no LxVP SLiM has been identified for ~80% of these interactors; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). We then searched for a ÏÉ¸LxVP SLiM in each protein. Interestingly, only 20% of CN<sup>CON</sup> returned hits on our expanded ÏÉ¸LxVP SLiM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>), showing that the expanded ÏÉ¸LxVP definition is too conservative and fails to detect CN interactors that have similar, yet also binding compatible sequences. Because all CN structures determined to date (free and CN complexes), including that described here, confirm that the conformation of the LxVP pocket is rigid, the structure of the CN-based âlockâ is viewed as conformationally fixed while the SLiM-based âkeyâ is viewed as flexible. Therefore, we used the structure of the CN:ÏÉ¸LxVP<sub>NFATc1</sub> complex to identify amino acids that can be readily accommodated in the Leu, Val and Pro hydrophobic binding pockets. Critically, this structure-based approach is not biased in regards to the interaction strength of the individual LxVP sequence, i.e. all predicted sequences are most likely binding competent. This is important, as different K<sub>D</sub>âs for the same SLiM binding pocket are likely important for driving distinct signaling events.</p>
        <p>The Leu binding pocket is very narrow and fails to accommodate other amino acids without significant changes in the sidechain rotomer conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Thus we conclude that the Leu residue of the LxVP motif is conserved in the majority of CN interactors. The Val binding pocket, in contrast, is comparatively shallow and readily accommodates a Pro, Ile, His, or Leu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Indeed, the confirmed LxVP motif of KCNK18 (NTLqLP) contains a Leu in the Val position of this SLiM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The Pro pocket is also very shallow, allowing for a broad range of substitutions at this site. In the CN:A238L complex (NFLcVK; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>) the Lys residue, which lies across the Pro pocket, is nearly completely solvent exposed. Thus, we allowed this position to be any residue in a search against CN<sup>CON</sup>. Searching CN<sup>CON</sup> using this structure-based motif ([NQDESRTH]-[YTDFILV]-L-x-[VPLIH]-x â Ï-É¸-L-x-[VPLHI]-x) returned 43 of the 48 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). A sequence alignment (Weblogo, V.3.4) of the 43 identified motifs identified favored residues in the Val and Pro positions of the ÏÉ¸LxVP SLiM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. This data immediately shows that most residues can be accommodated in the Pro position with only a slight preference for Pro and Lys, which are also experimentally, structurally confirmed residues. Interestingly, Val, Leu and Pro are nearly equally probable in the Val position, with a much lower population of Ile and His. By combining the structural data with the CN<sup>CON</sup> derived data, we derived the optimized definition for this SLiM: [NQDESRTH]-[YTDFILV]-L-x-[VPL]-[PK] â Ï-É¸-L-x-[VPL]-[PK]. Searching for this motif using ScanProsite yielded 3251 human proteins. After employing the same secondary filters used previously (requires a PxIxIT site, the motif is present in an IDP or IDR and the protein has experimentally confirmed pSer/pThr residues), the list condenses to 567 proteins, 89 of which contain a canonical âÏ-É¸-LxVPâ motif and 478 that contain a âÏ-É¸-L-x-VPL-PKâ motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>The cellular distribution of these new potential CN substrates remains virtually unchanged compared to that identified using the conservative SLiM definition, with the largest fraction of CN interacting proteins having key roles in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). An analysis of these 567 proteins also showed that the preferred average distance of the first pSer/pThr from the Ï-É¸-L-x-VPL-PK site is within 50 residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). Notably, there is a preference for phosphosites to be C-terminal to the SLiM (80%), similar to what is observed for the canonical CN substrate, protein kinase A (PKA) subunit RII. In contrast, there are fewer predicted interactors with phosphosites that are N-terminal of the SLiM (20%), which is where the phosphosites are located in NFATs.</p>

          <title>JNK signaling</title>
          <p>Our data suggest that CN has a prominent role in multiple signal transduction pathways. In particular, we show that CN likely plays a critical role in the JNK signaling pathway by directly modulating the activity of mitogen activated kinases MAP3K7/TAK1 (ÏÉ¸LxVP: <sup>420</sup>NILDVP<sup>425</sup>; activates JNK and p38 pathways), MAP3K10 (ÏÉ¸LxVP: <sup>634</sup>SYLSVP<sup>639</sup>; activates the JNK pathway), MAP3K11 (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>659</sup>RDLQPP<sup>664</sup>; activates the JNK pathway) and MAP3K19 (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>640</sup>NYLDLK<sup>645</sup>).

          <title>DNA Repair</title>
          <p>This study also suggested new roles for CN during the cell cycle and in particular, DNA repair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>). Specifically, a cluster of proteins implicated in the breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) mediated DNA repair mechanism are identified. PALB2 (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>220</sup>SVLIPP<sup>225</sup>) is an essential regulator of DNA double strand break repair whose phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of BRCA2 (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>3378</sup>DYLRLK<sup>3383</sup>) and RAD51 (not predicted to bind CN)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. By dephosphorylating PALB2 and BRCA2, CN is able to modulate the DNA damage response. CN further moderates BRCA2 activity in the context of transcriptional repression due to its predicted direct interaction with the BRCA2-interacting transcriptional repressor (EMSY: ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>1045</sup>QVLAVK<sup>1050</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Taken together, this work establishes that CN has a prominent role in modulating the DNA damage response and may be a primary mediator of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
          <p>As DNA repair is a novel role for CN, we experimentally confirmed the interaction between PALB2 and CN. PALB2<sub>178â295</sub>, which includes the predicted PxIxIT and LxVP SLiMs, interacts directly with CN, as shown by pulldown and ITC assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>, S1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>).</p>

          <title>Ubiquitination</title>
          <p>Our analysis also suggested that CN is important for protein ubiquitination, a novel role for CN. Namely, CN is predicted to bind and regulate the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase CBLB (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>803</sup>DLLIPP<sup>808</sup>; Cbl Proto-Oncogene B) and the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase adaptor protein CBL (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>540</sup>RDLPPP<sup>545</sup>), both of which negatively regulate T-cell and B-cell receptor pathway activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. CN is also suggested to bind the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2 (ÏÉ¸LxVP: <sup>3350</sup>SYLGVP<sup>3355</sup>), an enzyme that is an integral regulator of the DNA damage response to ionizing radiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Lastly, RNF8 (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>255</sup>RILRLK<sup>260</sup>), which fulfills a key role in the DNA damage response via histone ubiquitination as it recruits repair machineries, including TP53BP1/BRCA1, and activates ATM kinase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, is also a potential CN interactor.</p>

          <title>Transcription</title>
          <p>This work also expands the CN-transcription factor interactome beyond NFATs. Our analysis suggests that CN regulates the phosphorylation state of more than 100 distinct transcription factors that affect multicellular organism development and function from embryogenesis through adulthood, including Homeobox regulating proteins Cux1 (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>739</sup>TILTPK<sup>744</sup>), MSL1 (ÏÉ¸LxVP: <sup>471</sup>SVLAVP<sup>476</sup>) and SIX4 (ÏÉ¸LxVP: <sup>674</sup>DLLSVP<sup>679</sup>). Furthermore, CN may play a larger role in general transcriptional regulation through interactions with components of the Mediator complex, responsible for transcription from RNA polymerase II genes, MED1 (ÏÉ¸LxVP: <sup>904</sup>NTLGVP<sup>909</sup>), MED12 (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>1637</sup>QLLPLP<sup>1642</sup>) and MED14 (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>1183</sup>NILLLP<sup>1188</sup>).</p>
          <p>Lastly, CNâs importance for neuronal function is well established. Here we identify 48 potential interactors that correlate CN dephosphorylation with neuronal activity and highlight an unexplored role of CN in axon generation and guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). We demonstrate, by pulldown and ITC, that the synapse defective protein 1 homolog 2 (SYDE2) (residues 232â289; ÏÉ¸Lx-V-P: <sup>235</sup>RVLSVP<sup>240</sup>) binds CN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>, S1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Despite the clear biological importance of CN, elucidating a human genome wide interaction network for this essential enzyme has been exceptionally challenging and thus far only a small subset of proteins has been experimentally confirmed to be CN substrates (CN<sup>CON</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). This is because, in contrast to protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), identifying PSP substrates has been comparatively difficult, as the approaches for identifying substrates of PTPs, including substrate trapping mutants and selective inhibitors, are much less developed for PSPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Thus, identifying and defining novel SLiMs that are specific for distinct PSPs, such as the PxIxIT SLiM in CN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, provides a key avenue to overcome these challenges. Here we leveraged our novel structural insights to accurately define the LxVP SLiM, Ï-É¸-L-x-VPL-PK, and then used this motif to identify novel, potential CN interacting proteins/substrates. Indeed, the structure-based SLiM analysis presented here can be thought of as a molecular ruler, in which the rigid enzyme (CN) reduces the primary sequence space of the interacting SLiM. The advantage of this technique is that all identified Ï-É¸-L-x-VPL-PK SLiMs will be binding competent. The disadvantage is that it likely only selects for strong(er) binders. However, in a cellular environment where multiple substrates compete for the same CN binding site, the stronger interactors are likely often the preferred interactors. Our analyses resulted in the discovery of 89 predicted interactors that contain a conservative Ï-É¸-L-x-V-P SLiM and 478 predicted interactors that contain the structure-based, comprehensive Ï-É¸-L-x-VPL-PK SLiM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). We confirmed the quality of our prediction method, by randomly selecting a couple of predicted interactors and experimentally confirming their interaction with CN.</p>
      <p>The effectiveness of our study is furthermore immediately apparent as novel ÏÉ¸LxVP sites were identified in well-established, bone fide CN substrates, including <sup>2156</sup>TLLSPK<sup>2161</sup> in Cain/Cabin1 and <sup>678</sup>RDLMPK<sup>683</sup> in Dynamin1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. We also identified new ÏÉ¸LxVP sites in proteins identified as potential CN interactors in the BioGRID3.4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and STRING10.0<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> protein interaction databases, including the membrane receptor KLRG2 (ÏÉ¸LxVP: <sup>149</sup>RFLKVP<sup>154</sup>), the ser/thr kinase SIK3 (ÏÉ¸Lx-VPL-PK: <sup>472</sup>SLLQPP<sup>477</sup>) and the transcriptional regulator MEF2A (ÏÉ¸LxVP: <sup>212</sup>TDLTVP<sup>217</sup>). Critically, however, our study also identified hundreds of new potential CN interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The analysis identified CN interactors that have functions previously not associated with CN, including protein ubiquitination (HERC2, CBLB, CBL) and DNA repair (PALB2, BRCA2). It also substantially expanded that number of interactors that are essential for well-established functions, such as transcription (SIX4, MED12, among others). This immediately suggests a plethora of expanded and novel functions of CN in key signaling pathways and critical cellular processes in the cell. Over the next years, it will be exciting to test these predictions further and to leverage the information for the analysis of the functional consequences of CN dephosphorylation of its novel substrates in cell physiology.</p>

Based on the focus on CN <italic><underline>substrates</underline></italic>, only proteins with experimentally confirmed phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues (using UniProt) were further considered as the final filter. Phosphosite distances relative to the N and C-terminal end(s) of the Ï-É¸-L-x-VPL-PK motif were also determined and analyzed. A cutoff of 9 residues was used for phosphosites C-terminal to the SLiM. A distance of 9 residues is sufficient to cover the ~30âÃ gap to the active site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. A cutoff of 20 residues was used for phosphosites N-terminal to the SLiM. Hits were cross-validated via literature searches and/or interaction databases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.</p>
