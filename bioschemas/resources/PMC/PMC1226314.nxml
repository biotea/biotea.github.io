      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Gfi-1B</italic> (growth factor independence-1B) gene is an erythroid-specific transcription factor, whose expression plays an essential role in erythropoiesis. Our laboratory has previously defined the human <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter region and shown that GATA-1 mediates erythroid-specific Gfi-1B transcription. By further investigating the regulation of the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter, here we report that (i) Gfi-1B transcription is negatively regulated by its own gene product, (ii) GATA-1, instead of Gfi-1B, binds directly to the Gfi-1-like sites in the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter and (iii) Gfi-1B suppresses GATA-1-mediated stimulation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter through their protein interaction. These results not only demonstrate that interaction of GATA-1 and Gfi-1B participates in a feedback regulatory pathway in controlling the expression of the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> gene, but also provide the first evidence that Gfi-1B can exert its repression function by acting on GATA-1-mediated transcription without direct binding to the Gfi-1 site of the target genes. Based on these data, we propose that this negative auto-regulatory feedback loop is important in restricting the expression level of Gfi-1B, thus optimizing its function in erythroid cells.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is an erythroid-specific Gfi-family transcriptional factor, which was identified by low stringency hybridization screening with a partial <italic>Gfi</italic>-1 cDNA probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Both Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B contain a SNAG domain that mediates transcriptional repression and a zinc finger domain at its C-terminus for their DNA binding to the TA<bold>AATC</bold>AC(A/T)GCA recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Expression of Gfi-1B is confined in erythroid lineage cells and megakaryocytes in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), whereas Gfi-1 is more abundant in the lymphopoietic thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). So far, <italic>p21</italic> (<italic>cip1/waf1</italic>), <italic>Socs1</italic> and <italic>Socs3</italic> are known as the target genes of Gfi-1B-mediated transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Since p21 is a cell cycle inhibitor and SOCS family members are known to suppress cytokine signaling, the functional role of Gfi-1B is considered to be important in controlling proliferation of erythrocyte/megakaryocyte-lineage cells. Its importance in erythropoiesis has been further highlighted by gene targeting experiment showing that <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> gene disruption results in embryonic lethality due to loss of red blood cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>Enforced expression experiment in early erythroid progenitor cells has shown that Gfi-1B induces a drastic expansion of erythroblast independent of its SNAG repression domain with a parallel increase of GATA-2 expression, which is required for proliferation of erythroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). On the other hand, a recent study has shown that Gfi-1B plays a critical role in terminal differentiation through its transcription repression function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Likely, the function of Gfi-1B in erythropoiesis is highly dependent on cell stage and the sequence context of its targeted gene promoter. Despite the differential roles of Gfi-1B in different stages of differentiation, results of both studies indicate that elevation of Gfi-1B level alters the program of normal erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). However, it remains unclear how Gfi-1B expression is regulated in erythroid cells and whether there is a direct relationship between Gfi-1B and other transcription factor that is involved in erythropoiesis.</p>
      <p>The expression of many eukaryotic transcription factors has been shown to be auto-regulated positively and negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In most auto-regulatory cases, a given factor binds to its own promoter and either activates or represses transcription. In this study, we observed negative auto-regulation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> in K562 cells. By analyzing the sequence of human <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> gene promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), we found the presence of two tandem repeats of Gfi-1-like sites located at â59/â56 and â47/â44 relative to its transcription start site. Very recently, a report has demonstrated that mouse Gfi-1B directly binds to the Gfi-1 binding sites near the mRNA transcription start site of the mouse <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter and is able to auto-repress its own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). However, here we showed that mutations in these two Gfi-1-like sites reduced the promoter activity of the human <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter in K562 cells, indicating that these sites mediate transcriptional activation rather than silencing. By detailed DNA-binding analyses, we proved that GATA-1, instead of Gfi-1B, is the main transcription factor preferentially binding to these non-typical GATA sites. Furthermore, we found that the Gfi-1B can form a complex with GATA-1, by which GATA-1-mediated transcription is repressed by Gfi-1B. Coincidentally, one recent report also showed that Gfi-1B forms a complex with GATA-1 and associates with the <italic>myc</italic> and <italic>myb</italic> promoters in mouse erythroleukemic (MEL) cells. Given the facts that overexpression of Gfi-1B in erythroid progenitors induces growth arrest and that expression of <italic>myc</italic> and <italic>myb</italic> is often associated with cell proliferation, they hypothesized that GATA-1/Gfi-1B is a repressive complex that suppresses transcription of <italic>myc</italic> and <italic>myb</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Our results, on the other hand, present the first direct evidence that transcriptional repression function of Gfi-1B can work through its interaction with GATA-1 independent of its direct DNA binding to the gene promoter. Since our previous study has shown that GATA-1 is a necessary transcription factor for Gfi-1B expression, the auto-regulatory mechanism observed in this study reflects that the expression of Gfi-1B and the function of GATA-1 are mutually regulated in K562 cells.</p>

        <p>Nuclear extracts prepared from K562 and 293T cells and gel-shift reaction were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Competitive DNA oligomer, GATA-1 (C-20, Santa Cruz, CA), Gfi-1B (H-150, Santa Cruz) or FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibody was added to the nuclear extracts for 30 min on ice prior to the DNA-binding reaction. After DNA-binding reaction at room temperature for 25 min, samples were analyzed by electrophoresis at 150 V for 2.5 h through the nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were then dried for autoradiography.</p>

        <p>Two AATC sites at â59/â56 and â47/â44 within the promoter region were simultaneously mutated to <underline>GG</underline>TC in the pGL2-hG (â325/+19) using Quick-Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). A 3XGATA-T81-Luc reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting oligonucleotide containing three tandem copies of GATA-1 binding site (5â²-GATCAGAAGCTT CACTT<underline>GATA</underline>ACAGAAAGT<underline>GATA</underline>ACAGAAAGT<underline>GATA</underline>ATCTGTCGACCGTCGT-3â²) upstream of a minimal herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter in the pT81 luciferase vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), which was provided by A. Iwama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) (Laboratory of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Experimental Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan). Expression vector of Gfi-1B-FLAG, in which FLAG is tagged at the C-terminus of Gfi-1B, was constructed by ligating the PCR DNA fragment spanning the open reading frame region with the EcoRI/SalI digested pRK5-FLAG plasmid. To generate the expression vectors of the wild-type and deleted mutants of Myc-GATA-1, the regions covering 1â414, 1â199, 1â255 or 1â287 amino acids of mGATA-1 cDNA were amplified by PCR and inserted to the XhoI site of plasmid pCS2-MT (provided by Dave Turner, University of Michigan). The wild-type and deleted mutants of FLAG-Gfi-1B covering 1â330, 164â330 and 1â137 amino acids of hGfi-1B cDNA were each subcloned into the KpnI and XbaI sites of plasmid pCMV2 to generate the pCMV2-Gfi-1B (wild type), pCMV2-Gfi-1B (N-del) and pCMV2-Gfi-1B (C-del) constructs. Another deleted mutant construct covering 45â330 amino acids of hGfi-1B cDNA was subcloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of plasmid pCMV2 to generate the pCMV2-Gfi-1B (<bold>Î</bold>SNAG) constructs. The VP16-Gfi-1B construct was generated by inserting the fragment covering 161â330 amino acids of hGfi-1B cDNA to the EcoRI site of pVP16 vector. The retroviral vector for expressing Gfi-1B with C-terminal FLAG-tag was constructed by ligating the coding region of Gfi-1B-FLAG with the HpaI-digested pS2 plasmid. All constructs were verified by dideoxy termination sequencing.</p>

        <title>Gfi-1B transcription is down-regulated by ectopic expression of Gfi-1B protein</title>
        <p>To test the effect of Gfi-1B on its own promoter, a plasmid expressing the C-terminus FLAG-tagged Gfi-1B under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was co-transfected with the human Gfi-1B promoter-luciferase construct into K562 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, overexpression of Gfi-1B-FLAG strongly reduced the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter activity to 30% of the control set, while a slight reduction of SV-40 promoter activity was seen under the same transfection condition, indicating promoter-specific repression by Gfi-1B. To know whether this auto-inhibition can occur under a condition where Gfi-1B expression level is elevated moderately, we constructed a retroviral expression vector of Gfi-1B-FLAG under the control of LTR promoter. K562 cells were infected by retrovirus generated from the empty and Gfi-1B-FLAG retroviral vectors containing neomycin resistance gene. Followed by clonal selection, G418 resistant clones were pooled and subjected to RTâPCR and western blot analyses. Since endogenous <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> RNA transcript contains a 5â²-untranslated region (5â²-UTR) covering from exon1 to exon2 of the human <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), we amplified this 5â²-UTR sequence of endogenous <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> RNA from total cellular RNA by RTâPCR to distinguish from Gfi-1B-FLAG transcript, which does not have the 5â²-UTR sequence and was specifically amplified by the FLAG primer for detection. In accordance with the results from the reporter assay, cells stably expressing moderate amount of Gfi-1B-FLAG exhibited a marked reduction of the expression level of endogenous Gfi-1B transcript as compared with the cells selected from the control virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similarly, the western blot analysis also showed that endogenous Gfi-1B protein was no longer detectable in cells expressing Gfi-1B-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that the endogenous <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> gene in K562 cells is suppressed by enforced expressed Gfi-1B-FLAG.</p>

Sequence analysis of the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter has revealed two potential tandem Gfi-1-like sites (AATC) at â59/â56 and â47/â44 of the promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The <italic>in vivo</italic> footprint analysis also clearly showed that this region was well protected in genomic DNA of K562 cells as a contrast to no protection in that of myeloid U937 cells (data not shown). It is known that both Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B exhibit DNA-binding activity to the same consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). If this region were directly recognized by Gfi-1B, it would be also protected in U937 cells which contain Gfi-1 but not Gfi-1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). We then tested whether these two tandem AATC sequences play a role in negative regulation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter. The <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter reporter plasmid containing mutations of these two sites was constructed. The wild-type and mutated-type reporters were transfected into K562 cells for the promoter activity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, mutation of these two AATC sequences reduced the promoter activity to 34% relative to the wild-type promoter, indicating that these two AATC sites act as critical positive, rather than negative, <italic>cis</italic>-elements in controlling the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter activity in K562 cells. Overexpression of Gfi-1B significantly decreased the luciferase activity expressed from the wild-type promoter, but not the AATC mutated-type reporter, indicating that these two AATC sites still contribute to the responsiveness to Gfi-1B-mediated repression. Accordingly, we speculated that a positive regulator binding to these two AATC sites may mediate repression effect of Gfi-1B on its own promoter.</p>

        <title>GATA-1 binds to the AATC sites</title>
        <p>To examine whether the sequence containing two tandem repeats of AATC can be recognized by Gfi-1B, we performed the <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA gel-shift assay using radio-labeled DNA fragment covering â70/â41 region of the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter sequence. Incubation of this probe with nuclear extract of K562 cells gave rise to DNAâprotein complexes I and II. These two complexes were abolished by excess amounts of the unlabeled oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but not by the oligomer carrying mutations in two AATC sites, indicating their specificity to the sequence containing AATC. One retarded complex seen in the assay was indicated to be non-specific, because various oligomers, including â70/â41 of Gfi-1B promoter, GATA, Gfi-1, AP2 and Sp1 consensus sequences, could also compete for its formation. Excess amount of unlabeled Gfi-1 oligomer, which contains typical AATC core sequence, was unable to compete for complex II formation, but with some capacity of competing for complex I. However, complex I formation was unaffected by pre-incubation of K562 extract with specific Gfi-1B antibody. Interestingly, complex II formation could be supershifted by the specific GATA-1 antibody and competed by excess amount of unlabeled consensus GATA oligomer, while the mutated GATA oligomer with a deviation of GATA to <underline>CT</underline>TA was unable to compete for complex II formation. Unlike the denoted non-specific complex, complex II formation was unaffected by either AP2, Sp1 or Gfi-1 oligomers. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that GATA-1 binds to the tandem AATC sites within the â70/â41 region. Since complex I could not be competed by the GATA consensus oligomer, binding of GATA-1 is unlikely to be involved in this complex formation. Although there is a third AATC site located on the reverse strand within the â70/â41 region, we found that GATA-1 was unable to bind to the AATC mutated probe, which retains the intact third AATC sequence on the reverse strand (data not shown). Nor did mutation of this third AATC site decrease the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter activity expressed in K562 cells (data not shown). Here, we excluded the possibility that GATA-1 can bind to the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter via the third AATC on the reverse strand.</p>
        <p>Since 293T cells do not express Gfi-1B and GATA-1, we then ectopically expressed GATA-1 or Gfi-1B-FLAG in this cell line for nuclear extract preparation and gel-shift assays. Radio-labeled â70/â41 probe formed specific complexes I and II with nuclear extracts of cells expressing GATA-1. These two complexes were abolished by excess amount of unlabeled GATA consensus oligonucleotide but not by Gfi-1 oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, nuclear extract of cells expressing Gfi-1B was unable to form any specific 7complex with the â70/â41 probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). One complex formed in these gel-shift assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> was denoted non-specific, since this complex could be competed by various unrelated oligomers when using 293T cell extracts expressing either Gfi-1B-FLAG or GATA-1 for the assays. To test whether Gfi-1B protein in this nuclear extract is functional in binding to the consensus Gfi-1 oligonucleotide, we then prepared the radio-labeled Gfi-1 consensus oligomer for the gel-shift assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, nuclear extracts of cells expressing Gfi-1B-FLAG did form specific complex with consensus Gfi-1 oligomer probe, which could be super-shifted by the specific Gfi-1B or FLAG antibody and abolished by excessive amount of unlabeled consensus oligomer. Therefore, lack of complex formation between the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter probe with extracts containing Gfi-1B protein is not due to that the Gfi-1B-FLAG protein expressed in 293T cells is defective in specific DNA binding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> showed the ectopic expression of Myc-GATA-1 and Gfi-1B-FLAG in nuclear extracts of 293T cells. These gel-shift data led us to conclude that GATA-1, instead of Gfi-1B, binds to the AATC sites within the â70/â41 region of the human <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter.</p>

        <title>Both non-typical and typical GATA sites contribute to GATA-1-mediated transcriptional activation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> gene</title>
        <p>Our previous study has shown that in K562 cells GATA-1 binds to the typical GATA-site located at â132/â129 of the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter to mediate transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Here, we further compared the contribution of the typical GATA (G1) site at â132/â129 and non-typical GATA sites (two AATC at â59/â56 and â47/â44 positions) in GATA-1-mediated transcription of the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter. Co-transfection with GATA-1 expression vector for the reporter assay indicated that either mutation of GATA site at the G1 or two AATC sites reduced the GATA-1-activating effect significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, both GATA and AATC sites are recognized by GATA-1 for transcriptional activation.</p>

        <title>Gfi-1B inhibits GATA-1-mediated transcription</title>
        <p>Given that GATA-1 is essential for activating the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter, we then raised the question whether GATA-1-mediated transcription is inhibited by co-expression of Gfi-1B protein. To address this question, we transfected 293T cells with 3XGATA-reporter plasmid and the control plasmid pT81-Luc with expression vector of GATA-1 in the presence or absence of Gfi-1B-FLAG co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). It turned out that co-expression of Gfi-1B specifically repressed GATA-1-dependent activation of luciferase activity derived from 3XGATA-reporter. Similar results were also seen in the cells that were transfected with <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter luciferase construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Clearly, Gfi-1B negatively auto-regulates its own promoter through repressing GATA-1-mediated transcription. Since Gfi-1B is unable to bind to GATA sequence, these data also suggest that Gfi-1B-mediated repression need not work through its binding to the recognition sequence.</p>

        <title>Gfi-1B interacts with GATA-1</title>
        <p>To assess the mechanism responsible for the repression of GATA-1-mediated transcription by Gfi-1B, we then tested whether Gfi-1B interacts with GATA-1 by transfecting 293T cells with expression vectors of Gfi-1B-FLAG and Myc-GATA-1 for the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, Myc-GATA-1 was co-immunoprecipiated with Gfi-1B-FLAG by anti-FLAG M2 antibody in the cell lysate co-expressing Gfi-1B-FLAG and Myc-GATA-1, while no myc-GATA-1 was precipitated in the cell lysate expressing Myc-GATA-1 alone. This result suggests that co-expression of both proteins can form a specific complex in the cells. We then further defined the domain necessary for their interaction. GATA-1 contains two zinc fingers. One is the carboxyl finger spanning 257â287 amino acids which is essential for DNA binding and the other N-terminal finger at 199â255 amino acids which stabilizes its binding to the GATA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). We then constructed different deleted forms of pMyc-GATA-1 for the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. After co-expression with Gfi-1B-FLAG in 293T cells, we found that both the wild-type and 1â287, but not 1â199 or 1â255, forms of Myc-GATA-1, formed a complex with Gfi-1B-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that carboxyl finger of GATA-1 is necessary for its interaction with Gfi-1B protein.</p>
        <p>Gfi-1B contains a SNAG domain in the N-terminus mediating its transcriptional repression and six zinc-finger domains at its C-terminus for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). To examine the domain of Gfi-1B that is involved in complex formation with GATA-1 protein, we expressed various deleted forms of FLAG-Gfi-1B with Myc-GATA-1 in 293T cells for co-immunoprecipitation experiment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, deletion of carboxyl zinc-finger (C-del) abrogated the interaction of FLAG-Gfi-1B with myc-GATA-1, indicating the requirement of the carboxyl zinc-finger of Gfi-1B for its interaction with GATA-1.</p>

        <title>The SNAG domain of Gfi-1B is required for inhibiting GATA-1-mediated <italic>trans</italic>-activation</title>
        <p>To know whether overexpression of Gfi-1B affects the DNA-binding activity of GATA-1, we performed the gel-shift assay using consensus GATA binding oligonucleotides as the probe with the 293T nuclear extracts expressing GATA-1. Inclusion of increasing amounts of Gfi-1B-FLAG in nuclear extract did not perturb the specific GATA-1/DNA complex formation in the binding reaction (data not shown), indicating that Gfi-1B does not interfere with DNA-binding activity of GATA-1. We then turned to determine whether the repression domain of Gfi-1B is responsible for suppressing GATA-1-mediated <italic>trans</italic>-activation. Toward this end, <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter luciferase construct was co-transfected with various deleted forms of FLAG-Gfi-1B constructs and GATA-1 expression vector into 293T cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, removal of SNAG repression domain relieved the repressive effect of Gfi-1B on GATA-1-mediated transcription, suggesting the SNAG domain is required for suppressing GATA-1-mediated transcription of the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter. Because the C-del Gfi-1B loses the ability to interact with GATA-1, as expected, its expression did not affect GATA-1-mediated <italic>trans-</italic>activation. Furthermore, replacement of SNAG domain by a herpes virus <italic>trans</italic>-activating protein, VP16, converted Gfi-1B to an activator for GATA-1-mediated transcriptional activation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter. Thus, the interaction between GATA-1 and Gfi-1B does not affect the DNA-binding activity of GATA-1, and the SNAG domain of Gfi-1B contributes to its repression function on GATA-1-mediated transcription. To ascertain that the functional effect of Gfi-1B on its own promoter is indeed through GATA-1 binding to the AATC sites, we compared the effect of VP16-Gfi-1B on GATA-1-mediated activation of wild-type and AATC-mut <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter reporter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, stimulation of GATA-1-mediated activation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter by VP16-Gfi-1B was diminished by disrupting the AATC sites. In summary, Gfi-1B can specifically interact with GATA-1, by which GATA-1-dependent transcription can be suppressed by Gfi-1B-mediated repression via its SNAG domain.</p>

        <title>GATA-1-dependent binding of Gfi-1B to its own promoter</title>
        <p>Finally, we tested whether GATA-1 is required for Gfi-1B-FLAG binding to the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter in K562 cells. Toward this end, we depleted the expression of GATA-1 in K562 cells stably expressing Gfi-1B-FLAG by transfecting these cells with siRNA of <italic>GATA-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We then performed the chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in Gfi-1B-FLAG expressing cells with FLAG antibody to determine the effect of GATA-1 depletion on Gfi-1B-FLAG binding to the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter region. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, FLAG antibody was able to immunoprecipitate formaldehyde-fixed chromatin containing endogenous <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter DNA from cells without GATA-1 depletion. For cells depleted of GATA-1, FLAG antibody no longer immunoprecipitated endogenous <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter DNA, indicating the necessary role of GATA-1 in mediating Gfi-1B association with its own promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our previous study has shown that NF-Y binds to the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter for transcriptional activation. Here, we showed that GATA-1 depletion did not significantly alter NF-Y binding with the endogenous <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter region, indicating the specific effect of GATA-1 on Gfi-1B-FLAG binding to the human Gfi-1B promoter. These ChIP results further supported the role of GATA-1 as a mediator in Gfi-1B auto-regulation.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>It is well known that the auto-regulatory loop provides a mechanism by which the concentration of the transcriptional regulator is highly controlled. Gfi-1B is a transcriptional repressor, whose function has been shown to directly repress transcription of <italic>Socs1</italic> and <italic>Socs3</italic> in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Recent studies using retroviral vector-mediated expression of Gfi-1B further showed that elevated expression of Gfi-1B alters behavior of proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells at different developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), suggesting that its expression level needs to be regulated within the erythroid differentiation program. In this work, our data suggest that Gfi-1B is auto-regulated in a negative manner. However, unlike other auto-regulatory loop, here we show that the expression of Gfi-1B regulates its own promoter through its interaction with GATA-1. These results also suggest a new mode of Gfi-1B action, in which Gfi-1B negatively modulates GATA-1-mediated transcription through protein interaction without direct binding to its recognition sequence.</p>
      <p>Our previous study has shown that GATA-1 binds to the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter at â132/â129 GATA site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and plays a necessary role in <italic>trans-</italic>activating the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter in K562 cells. However, GATA mutation at the â132/â129 site did not abolish GATA-1-mediated activation of the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> transcription, indicating that additional GATA-1 recognition site is present in the promoter. Using nuclear extracts from cells overexpressing GATA-1, our gel-shift data revealed that GATA-1 also binds to the region containing two tandem AATC (GATT in the reverse strand) sites at â59/â56 and â47/â44. Moreover, GATA-1-mediated activation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter was diminished by mutations introduced to these two AATC sites, suggesting GATA-1 works on these two non-typical GATA sites for <italic>trans</italic>-activation.</p>
      <p>The gene targeting experiments have demonstrated that both <italic>GATA-1</italic> and <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> genes are essential for erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The expression patterns of these two genes have been shown to be well correlated throughout successive differentiation stages from erythroid-blast-forming units to mature erythroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Data from our studies using the promoter analysis indicate that GATA-1 works on GATA and AATC sites to activate <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> transcription, which accounts for their co-expression pattern. Interestingly, here we show that the mechanism of GATA-1-mediated transcriptional activation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> expression is intriguingly restricted by negative auto-regulation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> through their interaction, by which GATA-1-mediated transcription is repressed via the SNAG domain of Gfi-1B. Conceivably, this auto-regulatory mechanism provides a means to limit the expression level of Gfi-1B in erythroid cells. Since GATA-1 is a central regulator in terminal differentiation of erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), this auto-regulatory loop is particularly important in controlling the amount of Gfi-1B expression in a range that would not perturb the transcription function of GATA-1 during erythropoiesis.</p>
      <p>Up to now, LMO-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), FOG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), Pu.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), Fli-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>), Ski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), EKLF/Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) and Herp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) have been shown to interact with GATA-1. Among them, Pu.1 and Ski repress GATA-1-mediated <italic>trans-</italic>activation by inhibiting its DNA-binding activity through their physical interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Unlike these two negative regulators but similar to Herp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), Gfi-1B did not affect DNA-binding activity of GATA-1. Rather, the inhibitory effect is dependent on its SNAG repression domain, since replacement of SNAG domain by VP16 converts Gfi-1B from a co-repressor to a co-activator in GATA-1-dependent transcription. Our finding adds Gfi-1B to the list of transcriptional regulators that interact with GATA-1. It should be mentioned that we did not find the direct interaction between these two proteins when yeast two-hybrid system was used for the interaction assay (data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that Gfi-1B and GATA-1 may require the involvement of other cellular factor or certain post-translational modification for their complex formation. If this is true, it would suggest that the inhibitory effect of Gfi-1B on GATA-1 is modulated in a cell context-dependent manner. Alternatively, it is also possible that the effect of Gfi-1B on GATA-1 function depends on other interacting factors and the gene promoter context as well. More experiments are needed to define the factors involved in their functional interaction for further understanding how the interplay between GATA-1 and Gfi-1B is regulated during terminal maturation and survival of erythroid cells.</p>
      <p>While this manuscript was in its revision preparation, Rodriguez <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) reported that Gfi-1B is present in the pull-down complexes containing GATA-1 protein in MEL cells and that Gfi-1B and GATA-1 are bound to the <italic>myc</italic> and <italic>myb</italic> promoters <italic>in vivo</italic>. Accordingly, they proposed that GATA-1 forms a repressive complex with Gfi-1B to repress expression of <italic>myc</italic> and <italic>myb</italic>, thus prohibiting proliferation of erythroid cells that express elevated level of Gfi-1B. While their hypothesis remains to be elucidated, data from our ChIP and reporter analyses demonstrated that Gfi-1B represses and binds to its own promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> dependent on the presence of GATA-1, providing the first direct evidence of Gfi-1B/GATA-1 repression mechanism. Apparently, the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter is one typical target gene for GATA-1/Gfi-1B complex-mediated repression in erythroid cells. Taken together, we propose that the expression of Gfi-1B and the function of GATA-1 in erythroid lineage cells are mutually regulated to finely tune their functions.</p>
      <p>Although AATC is the core sequence of a consensus Gfi-1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), data from different approaches in this study suggest that Gfi-1B cannot bind to this DNA region of its own promoter. First, we found that the DNAâprotein complexes formed in the gel-shift assay using â70/â41 probe with nuclear extracts of K562 cells could not be competed by Gfi-1 binding consensus oligomer. Although this probe could also form another prominent complex with K562 extract, we found that all unrelated oligomers tested in this study competed for this complex formation, indicating the non-specific nature of this complex in our gel-shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Second, Gfi-1B expressed in 293T cells did not form any specific complex when <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter sequence was used as the probe for the gel-shift assay, while the same extract could form specific complex with the Gfi-1 consensus oligomer probe. All our results suggest that these two AATC sites are preferentially recognized by GATA-1 in K562 cells for transcriptional activation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> gene.</p>
      <p>Contradictory to the results shown here, the report by Vassen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) has described that <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Gfi-1B formed specific complexes with the mouse <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter sequence probe covering the two AATC sites in the gel-shift assays. Their results suggest that Gfi-1B can repress its own promoter by recognizing these AATC sites directly. The discrepancy in Gfi-1B binding to these AATC sites in these two studies could be due to the difference in preparation of Gfi-1B protein for the gel-shift assays. In the present study, we used Gfi-1B expressed in nuclear extract for the binding assay, while <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Gfi-1B in reticulocyte lysate was used in their assay condition. Perhaps, co-factor present in reticulocyte lysate can assist or promote the binding of Gfi-1B to this sequence. It is worth of noting that in their report, inclusion of excess amount of unlabeled <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter sequence did not abolish the DNA/protein complex formation between the consensus Gfi-1 oligomer and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Gfi-1B, indicating a higher binding affinity of Gfi-1B to the consensus Gfi-1 oligomer than to the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter sequence. Their study has shown that enforced expression of Gfi-1B under the control of the <italic>vav</italic> promoter in transgenic mice inhibits endogenous <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> transcription in spleen but not in bone marrow, suggesting that negative auto-regulation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> is highly dependent on the cellular context. According to our data in K562 cell, the preferential binding of GATA-1 to the AATC sites and the interaction capability between GATA-1 and Gfi-1B make a cellular context for the negative auto-regulation of <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> through GATA-1. Nevertheless, here we do not exclude the possibility that Gfi-1B when expressed in abundant amount may still be able to recognize the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter through direct binding to the AATC sites in NIH3T3 cells that are deficient in GATA-1 expression. Our findings in K562 cells may represent a situation that an increase of Gfi-1B expression leads to a repression complex formation through interacting with GATA-1 that has occupied at the promoter. Thus, GATA-1 acts as an activator or a repression mediator by sensing the amount of Gfi-1B present in K562 cells.</p>

          <p>GATA-1 is required for Gfi-1B-FLAG occupancy at the Gfi-1B promoter. (<bold>A</bold>) The pS2-Gfi-1B-FLAG retrovirus integrated K562 cells (3 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>) were electroporated with or without <italic>GATA-1</italic> siRNA. Total cell lysates from the electroporated K562 cells were subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies against GATA-1 (C-20), Gfi-1B (H-150) and Î²-tubulin. (<bold>B</bold>) ChIP assays were performed with equal amount of the electroporated pS2-Gfi-1B-FLAG cells (3 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>) as described in Materials and Methods. Samples of sonicated and purified chromatin were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads or anti-NF-YB (C-20) antibody as indicated, and DNA isolated from immunoprecipitated material was amplified by PCR with primers specific for the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter. Different amounts of chromatin samples prior to immunoprecipitation were also amplified to indicate the linearity of PCR for the <italic>Gfi-1B</italic> promoter and relative amount of total input chromatin.</p>
