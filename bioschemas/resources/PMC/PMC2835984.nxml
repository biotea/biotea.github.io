    <p id="P4">Maintenance of DNA integrity is critical for all cell types, but neurons are particularly sensitive to mutations in DNA repair genes, which lead to both abnormal development and neurodegeneration <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. We describe a previously unknown autosomal recessive disease characterized by <italic>m</italic>icro<italic>c</italic>ephaly, early-onset, intractable <italic>s</italic>ei<italic>z</italic>ures and developmental delay (MCSZ). Using genome-wide linkage analysis in consanguineous families, we mapped the disease locus to chromosome 19q13.33 and identified multiple mutations in <italic>PNKP</italic> that results in severe neurological disease, whereas a splicing mutation is associated with more moderate symptoms. Surprisingly, while patient cells are sensitive to radiation and other DNA damaging agents, no patient has yet developed cancer or immunodeficiency. Unlike other DNA repair defects that affect humans, <italic>PNKP</italic> mutations universally cause severe seizures. The neurological abnormalities in MCSZ patients may reflect a role for PNKP in several DNA repair pathways.</p>
    <p id="P5">We identified the autosomal recessive disorder MCSZ with the following features: microcephaly, infantile onset seizures, developmental delay, and variable behavioral problems especially hyperactivity. MCSZ was observed in multiple pedigrees of Middle Eastern and European origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The first three pedigrees were Arabic Palestinians living in Jordan and the USA. Three other families with similar manifestations were Arabic (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), Turkish, and of mixed European ancestry (USA). We later found less severely affected patients from Family 7, which is also American of mixed European heritage (USA). Brain MRIs consistently show microcephaly with preserved brain structures, without apparent neuronal migration or other structural abnormalities, and with no evidence of degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The patients did not develop ataxia or other neurological symptoms. Routine clinical genetic and metabolic screening showed no abnormalities. Despite careful inquiry, MCSZ patients did not have a higher frequency of common or uncommon infections, offering no clinical evidence of immunodeficiency. Cells from one patient showed sensitivity to irradiation in a standard colony survival assay<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. However, no patient has developed cancer by age 21 and heterozygous carriers have not developed early onset cancer or any sign of immunodeficiency (see Clinical Information and Summary in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">Genome-wide linkage screens suggested a single common homozygous region on chromosome 19q in all six MCSZ patients in the consanguineous Families 1-3. This same locus showed homozygosity in the two patients from Family 4 and the single patient from Family 5 whose parents were not known to be related. No other regions of linkage were observed including known primary microcephaly loci. Interestingly, all six patients in the three Palestinian families (Families 1-3) were homozygous for the same 3cM/1.5Mb haplotype (between markers D19S879 and D19S907) at chromosome 19q13.33, suggesting a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information Figure 1</xref>). Further investigation revealed a common town of origin for these families. Linkage analysis of Families 1-4 and 6 generated a combined maximum two point LOD score of 5.60 at D19S867 with Î¸ =0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information Table 2</xref>) and a maximum multipoint LOD score of 7.12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information Figure 2</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">We sequenced 41 genes within the minimal region (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>) and only the <italic>PNKP</italic> gene contained mutations. Homozygous mutations were present in each of the first five families and compound heterozygous mutations were found in Families 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information Figure 3</xref> for detailed analyses of all mutations). The three Palestinian Families (Families 1-3) shared a homozygous base pair substitution in exon 11 (975G&gt;A), resulting in the non-conservative amino acid change E326K. The families from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Family 4) and Turkey (Family 5) had the same homozygous 17 bp duplication (17 bp dup) in exon 14 (1250_1266dup), resulting in a frame-shift, T424GfsX48. Family 6 (European) had two heterozygous mutations: the same 17 bp dup in exon 14 as the Saudi and Turkish families and a point mutation in exon 5 (526C&gt;T) resulting in L176F. The moderately affected members of Family 7 (European) displayed compound heterozygosity, carrying the 17 bp dup mutation in exon 14 and a 17 bp deletion in intron 15 that disrupts proper mRNA splicing.</p>
    <p id="P8">To confirm that these mutations were pathogenic, we analyzed patient-derived, Epstein Bar Virus (EBV)-transformed, lymphocytes from Families 3 (E326K) and 7 (17 bp dup/intron 15 del). The samples from the severely affected patient (Family 3) and the mildly affected patients (Family 7) had greatly diminished PNKP protein compared to unaffected or heterozygous family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). RT-PCR analysis showed that the intron 15 deletion in Family 7 disrupts mRNA splicing and causes skipping of exon 15; a barely detectable level of properly spliced mRNA remains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). The low levels of PNKP protein and the indistinguishable phenotype among severely affected individuals from Families 1-6 suggest that all of these mutations impair PNKP severely or completely, whereas patients in Family 7 that exhibit a slightly milder phenotype and carry one non-coding mutation may retain some PNKP activity.</p>
    <p id="P9">Surprisingly, despite their diverse ancestries (Saudi, Turkish, and mixed European), all chromosomes with the 17 bp dup mutation appear to share the same haplotype for 18 SNPs in or near the <italic>PNKP</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). The low frequency of this mutant haplotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>), suggests that the 17 bp dup in exon 14 is likely of shared origin and very old in all or most of these families. Nonetheless, the mutation shows an extremely low carrier frequency in the general population, as the 17 bp dup mutation was absent in 1080 Middle Eastern or Caucasian control chromosomes, while all other mutations were absent in all of at least 280 control chromosomes screened.</p>
    <p id="P10"><italic>PNKP</italic> has been implicated in repair of both double strand breaks (DSBs) and single strand breaks (SSBs) <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, since its phosphatase domain removes 3â² phosphates and the kinase domain phosphorylates 5â² hydroxyl groups, required for DNA ligation <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. PNKP's forkhead domain mediates interaction with the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) complex via XRCC4, or the SSB and base excision repair (BER) pathways via XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 6 a and b</xref>)<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. <italic>PNKP</italic> has been further implicated in the repair pathway disrupted in an ataxic neurodegenerative disease, spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy, SCAN1 (<italic>TDP1</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information Figure 6</xref> for additional details). The abnormalities in a clinical irradiation sensitivity test already reflect deficiencies in NHEJ required to repair radiation induced DSBs. Because PNKP potentially plays roles in additional repair pathways, we tested cells in response to other DNA damaging agents.</p>
    <p id="P11">The response to free radical damage from hydrogen peroxide, predominately requiring BER, and camptothecin, requiring TDP1 via its activity on topoisomerase I, was examined via alkaline comet assay which detects both SSBs and DSBs by quantitating the amount of DNA that moves from a nucleus after electrophoresis. Typical nuclei with various amounts of DNA damage are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>. The relative amount of DNA damage was determined by measuring the % Tail DNA (DNA that has moved out of the nucleus). The relative amount of DNA damage repair was quantitated as % Tail DNA after toxin exposure at various times of recovery (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref> for all data) and normalized to the maximum and minimum damage for each cell line in each experiment. MCSZ derived cell lines were significantly impaired in their ability to repair hydrogen peroxide induced damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>) and were also delayed in repairing camptothecin induced damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). However, MCSZ derived cells were eventually able to repair the camptothecin induced damage after 45 minutes while they were not able to repair all hydrogen peroxide induced damage even after 90 min. These data suggest that camptothecin induced damage may be easier to repair than free radical damage in the setting of <italic>PNKP</italic> mutations. Although MCSZ patients do not develop the ataxia that characterizes <italic>TDP1</italic> mutations that also have camptothecin sensitivity <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, our patients are perhaps too young (oldest 21 years) or maybe there is a compensatory mechanism for the loss of PNKP.</p>
    <p id="P12">Microcephaly can result from failure to produce enough neurons during development (primary microcephaly) or degeneration after normal development. MCSZ patients have no evidence of brain atrophy or clinical regression, making degeneration unlikely (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Note, Clinical Information</xref> for further details). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization indicated that human and mouse <italic>PNKP</italic> mRNAs are expressed in both dividing neuronal precursors in the cerebral cortical ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 a and c VZ</xref>) as well as post-mitotic neurons of the cortical plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d CP</xref>) consistent with potential roles in both dividing and post-mitotic neurons. In addition, we found that when levels of Pnkp were reduced in dissociated mouse neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> via RNAi, there was a small but statistically significant increase in apoptosis in both neuronal precursors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Information Figure 7c</xref>) and differentiated neurons (7d) compared to cells transfected with control plasmids.

The intriguing similarity of phenotypes between patients with mutations in <italic>PNKP</italic> and mice with targeted deletion of <italic>Xrcc1</italic> does suggest a potential common mechanism demonstrating the requirement for the BER/SSB pathways in the prevention of seizures, potentially via an interneuron specific requirement of the BER/SSB pathway.

        <title>Pedigrees of MCSZ families</title>
        <p>Family 1 represents a consanguineous Palestinian pedigree in Jordan. Family 2 shows another consanguineous Palestinian pedigree reportedly unrelated to Family 1 also in Jordan. Family 3 is also consanguineous and Palestinian but now in the USA. Family 4 is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the parents were not known to be consanguineous. Family 5 is from Turkey and the parents were not known to be related. Family 6 is of mixed European descent from the USA (German-Irish). Family 7 is also of mixed European (Swedish, Italian, Irish and English) heritage from the USA. The individuals from whom samples were obtained are labeled âDNAâ. The individuals from whom we established lymphoid cell lines are labeled âCellsâ. Cells and DNA were available for all Family 7 members.</p>

        <title>Brain MRIs of MCSZ patients</title>
        <p>Representative MRI images are shown from Families 4 (a, severely affected) and 7 (b, moderately affected) with aged matched controls. MRIs of severely affected patients from other families were similar to the representative images in a. Sagittal images are shown on the left (T1), axial images in the middle (T2) and coronal images on the right (T2 (a) and FLAIR (b)) with the MRI sequence noted above the image. The MRIs illustrate that despite the microencephaly (small brain), the gyral pattern is not clearly abnormal indicating absence of visible neuronal migration abnormality. The cerebellum is proportionately small compared to the cerebrum and the subpallium (basal ganglia or ventral cerebrum) is proportionately with the pallium (dorsal cerebrum). There is no evidence of atrophy or glial scarring. Bar=5 cm for both unaffected and MCSZ images.</p>

        <title><italic>PNKP</italic> mutations in MCSZ patients</title>
        <p>(a) Four different mutations diagrammed in human <italic>PNKP</italic> genomic DNA, mRNA, and protein including domains (forkhead is FHA). The human <italic>PNKP</italic> gene consists of 17 exons shown as boxes and encodes a peptide of 521 amino acids. Filled boxes represent untranslated regions and open boxes represent coding regions. Lines connecting the exons represent introns. (b) Western blot for PNKP, the first and second lanes show a MCSZ patient (VI:3 with E326K mutation) and unaffected brother (VI:1), respectively, from Family 3. The third and fourth lanes show MCSZ patients (II:1 and 4, both with 17 bp dup and 17 bp intron 15 del) while the fifth and sixth lanes the father (I:1) and brother (II:3) both heterozygous for 17 bp intron 15 del. The band is ~60 kD (57 kD predicted size). Anti-Î²-actin is a loading control. (c) RT-PCR products of mRNA from members of Family 7 show the expected size from the normal copy of <italic>PNKP</italic> cDNA, 636 bp, seen in lanes 3 and 4 from non-affected carriers. The 17 bp dup results in a 653 bp long fragment seen in lanes 1, 2 and 3. The 548 bp band in lanes 1, 2, and 4 show samples with the intron 15 deletion lacking exon 15 (determined from sequencing, data not shown). A small amount of normal sized transcript is seen in lanes 1 and 2 with higher exposure (data not shown), indicating that a small amount of normal PNKP mRNA by be produced.</p>

        <title>Patient derived lymphocytes show abnormal DNA repair</title>
        <p>(a) Examples of comet assay results are shown. The intensity of the fluorescence is represented in pseudocolor while the electrical field drives damaged, loose DNA from left to right. (I) Shows a cell with 50% Tail DNA with the body of the nucleus (green) on the left and the tail of the comet derived from the damaged DNA extending to the right. (II and III) show progressively less damage, 29% and 11% Tail DNA respectively. (b) After hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) treatment with 0 minutes for recovery, cells show their maximum damage. Cells derived from MCSZ patients (blue, red), show significant impairment in their ability to repair DNA after hydrogen peroxide was removed, while cells derived from unaffected family members were able to repair DNA much more efficiently. (c) After camptothecin (CPT) treatment, there was also statistically significantly slower repair in cells derived from MCSZ patients compared to unaffected family members (green, purple) as well. However, after 45 minutes, the MCSZ derived cells were able to repair all CPT damage, in contrast to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells. All cells derived from Family 7. Blue diamond and red square were from MCSZ patients with exon 14 17 bp duplication and intron 15 17 bp deletion (II:1 and II:4 respectively), green triangle were from unaffected parent heterozygous for the intron 15 17 bp deletion (I:1) and purple X from unaffected sibling with no mutation (II:2). *(P=0.05), **(P&lt;0.005) and ***(P&lt;0.0005).
