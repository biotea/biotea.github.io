      <abstract>
        <p>We present evidence that Tim establishes a physical and functional interaction with DDX11, a super-family 2 iron-sulfur cluster DNA helicase genetically linked to the chromosomal instability disorder Warsaw breakage syndrome. Tim stimulates DDX11 unwinding activity on forked DNA substrates up to 10-fold and on bimolecular anti-parallel G-quadruplex DNA structures and three-stranded D-loop approximately 4â5-fold. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that Tim enhances DDX11 binding to DNA, suggesting that the observed stimulation derives from an improved ability of DDX11 to interact with the nucleic acid substrate. Surface plasmon resonance measurements indicate that DDX11 directly interacts with Tim. DNA fiber track assays with HeLa cells exposed to hydroxyurea demonstrated that Tim or DDX11 depletion significantly reduced replication fork progression compared to control cells; whereas no additive effect was observed by co-depletion of both proteins. Moreover, Tim and DDX11 are epistatic in promoting efficient resumption of stalled DNA replication forks in hydroxyurea-treated cells. This is consistent with the finding that association of the two endogenous proteins in the cell extract chromatin fraction is considerably increased following hydroxyurea exposure. Overall, our studies provide evidence that Tim and DDX11 physically and functionally interact and act in concert to preserve replication fork progression in perturbed conditions.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Accurate transfer of genetic information is critical for survival of living organisms. Checkpoint control pathways prevent the transmission of incompletely replicated or damaged DNA to daughter cells (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Stabilization of stalled replication forks in the presence of DNA damage or at difficult-to-replicate templates is necessary in order to prevent their collapse and consequential inability to restart synthesis. In budding/fission yeast stabilization of paused forks is carried out by a complex (âfork-protection complexâ or âpausing complexâ) consisting of Tof1/Swi1 and Csm3/Swi3, which act in concert with a third protein factor named Mrc1 and collectively mediate the replication checkpoint (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The fork-protection complex is believed to prevent uncoupling of replicative DNA polymerases from the DNA unwinding machinery, when DNA synthesis is halted at sites of DNA damage or natural replication fork barriers. Moreover, Mrc1, Tof1/Swi1 and Csm3/Swi3 are associated with the replication fork during S phase and assist its smooth progression even in unperturbed conditions (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Similar mechanisms of fork stabilization and coordination of DNA synthesis and unwinding during normal replication are believed to operate also in metazoans, in which Claspin, Tim (also known as Timeless) and Tipin serve as the orthologs of Mrc1, Tof1/Swi1 and Csm3/Swi3, respectively (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Like their yeast counterparts, these proteins act as S phase checkpoint mediators. In human cells, Tipin is required for efficient cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Depletion of Tipin or Tim by RNA interference renders human cells sensitive to ionizing radiation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and causes a great reduction in Chk1 activation upon <italic><underline>h</underline></italic>ydroxy<italic><underline>u</underline></italic>rea (HU) or ultraviolet radiation exposure (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts, Tipin is required for stalled replication forks to recover after removal of the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin by promoting DNA polymerase Î± re-priming on the leading strand (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). As in yeast (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), the fork-protection complex was demonstrated to be associated with the advancing replication complexes either in human cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) or <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Components of the fork-protection complex are also reported to promote sister-chromatid cohesion in various systems, including yeasts (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and human cell lines (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Cohesion is the process that ensures tethering of newly replicated sister chromatids until they separate in metaphase. The role played by Tim and Tipin in facilitating the cohesion process has not yet been clarified (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Important clues may derive from genetic studies in yeast that revealed a functional link between Tof1/Swi1-Csm3/Swi3 and the cohesion establishment factor Chl1 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Chl1, also known as ChlR1 or DDX11 in vertebrates, is a <italic><underline>s</underline></italic>uper-<italic><underline>f</underline></italic>amily 2 (SF2) ATP-dependent DEAH-box DNA helicase that unwinds DNA with a 5â²- to 3â²-directionality. DDX11 shares sequence similarity to the Fe-S cluster-containing DNA helicases FANCJ, XPD and RTEL1 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) that play important roles in genome stability maintenance and are implicated in rare genetic syndromes and cancer development (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Autosomal recessive mutations of the DDX11-encoding gene are responsible for a rare cohesinopathy-related disease named <italic><underline>Wa</underline></italic>rsaw <italic><underline>b</underline></italic>reakage <italic><underline>s</underline></italic>yndrome (WABS). Affected individuals display severe microcephaly, facial dysmorphy, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, intellectual disability and at the cellular level, increased drug-induced chromosomal breakage and sister-chromatid cohesion defects (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Interestingly, WABS-related mutations were found to severely impair DDX11 DNA helicase activity, as demonstrated by biochemical analysis of purified recombinant mutated proteins (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>â<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). A role of budding yeast Chl1 in sister-chromatid cohesion was first suggested by genetic studies (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Thereafter, it was reported that downregulation of DDX11 causes cohesion defects and increased sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents in human cell lines (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>â<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Sister-chromatid cohesion is expected to be tightly coordinated with the DNA replication process (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In fact, genetic deficiency in a number of replication factors in addition to Tim and Tipin was found to cause cohesion defects (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). A model was proposed in which enzymes involved in Okazaki fragment processing are believed to act in concert with DDX11 at the lagging strand to facilitate cohesion (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In agreement with these findings, DDX11 was found to be maximally active <italic>in vitro</italic> on substrates that mimic key intermediates of DNA replication/repair/recombination reactions (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>â<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we report that human Tim directly interacts with DDX11 and specifically stimulates DDX11 helicase activity on structurally distinct DNA substrates including forked duplex DNA, a three-stranded D-loop substrate and an anti-parallel bimolecular G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structure. Co-immuno-precipitation experiments on chromatin fraction have revealed that interaction between the two proteins is increased upon replication stress induction by treating cells with HU. DNA fiber track analyses have indicated that Tim downregulation by RNA interference in HeLa cells substantially reduces DNA replication rate in unperturbed conditions, whereas DDX11 depletion does not affect replication fork progression. Treatment of Tim- and/or DDX11-depleted cells with HU causes reduced fork rate and impaired fork restart capability. These findings show for the first time a direct functional interaction between a replication fork stabilizing factor and a DNA helicase implicated in the sister-chromatid cohesion process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Proteins</title><p>Recombinant human FLAG-Tim, Tipin-His<sub>6</sub>, the His<sub>6</sub>Tim-HA/His<sub>6</sub>-Tipin-3xFLAG complex, DDX11â3xFLAG and FANCJ were produced as previously described (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>â<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>DNA substrates</title><p>PAGE-purified oligonucleotides used for the preparation of DNA substrates were purchased from Primm (Milan, Italy).

In these experiments, we used Protein A-agarose beads conjugated with anti-Tim antibodies that were incubated with mixtures containing recombinant DDX11 and Tim proteins. The results of this analysis confirmed that the two proteins interact each other. On the other hand, we were unable to co-immuno-precipitate DDX11 and Tipin from mixtures of the two purified recombinant proteins using either anti-DDX11 or anti-Tipin antibodies in similar pull-down experiments (CalÃ¬ <italic>etÂ al</italic>., data not shown). This might depend on the weaker interaction between DDX11 and Tipin or on the intrinsic properties of the antibodies used for the pull-down assays.</p><p>We also analyzed whether Tim and DDX11 are associated in cells, as suggested by our <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis using purified recombinant proteins. Co-immuno-precipitation experiments, carried out on nuclear extracts of HEK 293T cells using anti-DDX11 polyclonal antibodies bound to Protein A agarose beads, revealed that endogenous Tim interacts with DDX11 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). When cells were treated with HU to induce replication stress, a substantially greater amount of Tim was co-pulled down with DDX11 from the chromatin fraction using anti-DDX11-specific antibodies (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). This finding reveals that in replication stressful conditions recruitment of Tim and DDX11 onto chromatin is markedly enhanced.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Effect of Tim and/or DDX11 depletion in HeLa cells on DNA replication dynamics</title><p>We next analyzed the effect of depleting Tim and/or DDX11 in HeLa cells on the replication fork progression by DNA fiber track assays. Cells were transfected with distinct sets of siRNAs, which were already reported to efficiently downregulate expression of Tim (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) or DDX11 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), in order to rule out possible off-target effects. When the labeling protocol depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> was used, transfected cells were pulse-labeled with the thymidine analog CldU (<italic>red label</italic>) for 20 min, followed by labeling with a second thymidine analog, IdU, (<italic>green label</italic>) for additional 20 min. To evaluate the efficacy of gene silencing Tim and DDX11 protein level was analyzed by western blot of whole cell extracts. As reported in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, HeLa cells depleted of DDX11 showed a reduction in Tim protein level; similarly, HeLa cells depleted of Tim showed a reduction in DDX11 protein level. Similar results were also obtained when Tim and/or DDX11 depletion was carried out by an additional couple of siRNAs (see Supplementary Figure S5). IdU-tract length (or CldU-tract length) was then measured in DNA fibers containing either red or green label (as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">D</xref> and in Supplementary Figure S3). These analyses revealed that a deficiency in Tim reduced fork tract length 2-fold, whereas loss of DDX11 had only a modest effect on fork progression. Cells that were depleted of both Tim and DDX11 displayed a shortened tract length that was comparable to Tim depletion alone. Based on these results, we conclude that the marked reduction in replication as a consequence of Tim depletion is not further exasperated by co-depletion of DDX11, suggesting that the residual Tim protein in DDX11-depleted cells is enough to maintain near normal replication. We then tested the effect of HU treatment on advancement rate of replication forks that were active at the time of drug administration (length of green tract in fibers labeled with both thymidine analogs, CldU and IdU) in Tim- and/or DDX11-depleted cells. The results revealed that replication forks progression was impaired with respect to control cells, when either Tim or DDX11 were downregulated; whereas no additive effect was observed by co-depletion of both Tim and DDX11 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">F</xref>). This finding suggests that Tim and DDX11 operate in concert in the same cellular pathway required for efficient progression of DNA replication forks in perturbed S-phase conditions.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>DNA fiber track assays on Tim- and/or DDX11-depleted HeLa cells.

These results appear to be consistent with the finding that Tim and/or DDX11 depletion causes a slight reduction in Chk1 phosphorylation (less than 30% with respect to control cells, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5) in response to our mild genotoxic treatment protocol (addition of HU at 2 mM into the cell culture medium for 20 min).</p><p>Moreover, we analyzed the effect of longer IdU-labeling time (40 min) and we found that in unperturbed conditions Tim downregulation still caused shorter IdU-tract relative to control siRNAs treated cells; whereas, following HU exposure, either Tim- or DDX11-depleted cells still showed IdU-tract length reduction (see Supplementary Figure S6).</p><p>In a subsequent set of experiments, we monitored the ability of replication forks to restart synthesis after HU treatment. Cells, depleted of Tim and/or DDX11, were pulse-labeled with CldU for 30 min and then treated with HU for 14 h before a second labeling pulse with IdU for 60 min. In this setting, forks arrested by HU administration incorporated only the first nucleotide analog, whereas those able to restart synthesis were labeled with both analogs (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">B</xref>). Loss of either Tim or DDX11 impaired the ability of cells to rescue HU-challenged replication forks. Co-depletion of Tim and DDX11 did not result in an additive effect on reduction of restarted DNA replication forks upon HU treatment suggesting an epistatic relationship between the two proteins in the forks rescue process in stressful conditions (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Analysis of IdU tract length in DNA fibers labeled with CldU and IdU revealed that Tim and DDX11 are both required for fork progression following rescue from HU treatment (see Supplementary Figure S7).</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Replication fork restart in Tim- and/or DDX11-depleted cells following HU treatment.

We determined that Tim enhances the DNA unwinding activity of DDX11 <italic>in vitro</italic> on substrates that mimic key intermediates of DNA replication/repair/recombination reactions, including forked duplex, anti-parallel bimolecular G-quadruplex and three-stranded D-loop DNA molecules. Moreover, we found that Tim directly interacts with DDX11 as demonstrated by Biacore measurements and co-immuno-precipitation experiments performed on the purified recombinant proteins. Interaction between endogenous Tim and DDX11 was also observed in the chromatin fraction of cell extracts by co-immuno-precipitation analysis. This interaction was noticeably increased following prolonged HU-treatment of cell cultures suggesting that two proteins are co-recruited on chromatin upon replication stress induction. Furthermore, stability of Tim and DDX11 proteins in human cells is mutually interdependent since depletion of either one will lead to a significant reduction of its interacting partner as demonstrated by western blot analyses of whole cell extracts, a result consistent with a direct interaction between the two proteins in a cellular context. These findings are in accordance with previous analyses performed in HEK 293T cells by the Noguchi's group that reported disappearance of DDX11 from cell extracts as a consequence of RNAi-dependent downregulation of Tim (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Overall, our findings are consistent with the phenotypic similarities between cells lacking either Tim or DDX11 suggesting that both proteins are involved in the same cellular pathways to preserve chromosomal integrity and genome homeostasis.</p><p>Our analysis has revealed that human Tim (but not Tipin) is able to enhance the DNA helicase activity of DDX11 on structurally diverse DNA substrates. The observed stimulation appears to derive from a direct interaction of Tim with DDX11, as suggested by the fact that the two proteins establish a tight physical association either <italic>in vitro</italic> or in cells. We believe that it is unlikely Tim stimulates DDX11 in a nonspecific manner, simply by stabilizing melted single-stranded DNA. In fact, we previously reported that the DNA-binding affinity of Tim is very low (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Moreover, Tim stimulated DNA unwinding activity catalyzed by DDX11, but not the sequence-related FANCJ DNA helicase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>;Â <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The high Tim:DDX11 molar ratio required to detect the stimulatory effect on the DNA helicase activity might depend on the fact that Tim forms various oligomeric assemblies in solution when it is produced in isolated form, as we observed by a glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of the recombinant human protein (CalÃ¬ et al., data not shown). This result is consistent with a biochemical study of the mouse Tim ortholog (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Nonetheless, in our experiments Tim concentration values were calculated assuming that it has a monomeric structure. Besides, we cannot rule out that the high Tim:DDX11 molar ratio required to detect the DNA helicase stimulation might depend on any cell cycle dependent post-translational modification, which would be retained only by a fraction of the purified recombinant proteins used in our <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic assays. We found that Tim enhances the capability of DDX11 to bind various DNA substrates (forked duplex, anti-parallel bimolecular G-quadruplex and three-stranded D-loop DNA molecules) and also its DNA-dependent ATP-hydrolysis activity (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Based on these findings, we postulate that the observed stimulation of DDX11 unwinding activity by Tim derives from an improved ability of the DNA helicase to bind and utilize the nucleic acid substrate.</p><p>Our data are fully consistent with the proposal that human Tim and DDX11 participate in the same functional network that operates at the crossroad between genome maintenance and sister-chromatid cohesion (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We speculate that Tim acts in concert with DDX11 at the replication fork and enhances its ability to unwind difficult to replicate DNA structures, such as hairpins present in the 5â²-flaps of the Okazaki fragments and/or other DNA secondary structures (including bimolecular anti-parallel G-quartets) that potentially form between the two duplicated DNA strands and could interfere with smooth interaction of the replisome with the cohesin ring. Further studies are required to determine the precise molecular mechanism by which the interaction of DDX11 and Tim with the cohesin ring and/or other components of the replication machinery promotes sister-chromatid cohesion and genomic stability. In this context it is worth mentioning that <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> Chl1, the ortholog of mammalian DDX11, was implicated in chromosomal stability, G-quadruplex DNA metabolism and repair of unresolved structures during DNA replication (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>The stimulation of DDX11 helicase activity on the D-loop DNA substrate with an invading 3â²-strand may be relevant to recombinational DNA repair transactions that occur when sister chromatids are closely paired to one another (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In this context, DDX11 was reported to be required for efficient sister-chromatid exchange in mammalian cells (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The ability of Tim to stimulate DDX11 to resolve D-loop-containing DNA molecules might be important for replication or repair of the chromosome telomeric regions, if we consider that the above substrate is structurally similar to a T-loop. A direct role of DDX11 in telomere metabolism can be inferred from the finding that DDX11 downregulation caused a significant reduction of chromosomal length in human melanoma cells compared to control experiments (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Similarly, in human cells Tim depletion was found to cause a dramatic delay of telomere replication, as well as increased level of DNA damage leading to telomere aberrations (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that Tim and DDX11 may cooperate to metabolize DNA structures that can be recognized and bound by the telomeric capping proteins or favor DNA synthesis through telomeric ends by the replication machinery.</p><p>Tim and Tipin are components of the fork-protection complex that is known to have a role in allowing the smooth passage of the replication fork at difficult-to-replicate sequences. Presumably, an important aspect of Tim and Tipin in this capacity is to coordinate the activities of various proteins of the replication machinery that bind and/or remodel DNA structures to maintain genomic stability. DNA fiber analysis confirmed that Tim depletion results in shorter DNA tracks of nascent DNA synthesis; however, DDX11 depletion alone or in co-depletion with Tim did not lead to further reduction in tract length, suggesting that Tim is the primary determinant of how a cell deals with endogenous impediments to replication and this function of Tim is independent of the binary complex it forms with DDX11. On the other hand, efficient rescue of replicons in stressful conditions requires the concerted action of both proteins, because loss of either one substantially reduced fork rate displacement after HU treatment. This finding is consistent with previous reports suggesting a role for DDX11 in replication recovery from DNA damage (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that in fission yeast during meiosis the TimâTipin complex recruits the <italic><underline>D</underline></italic>bf4-<italic><underline>d</underline></italic>ependent <italic><underline>k</underline></italic>inase (DDK) to the replication fork and the fork-associated DDK phosphorylates the meiosis-specific factors Mer2, which in turns recruits other proteins responsible for DNA double-strand break formation (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52,53</xref>). This Tim-Tipin-mediated mechanism that allows a temperospatial coordination of meiotic DNA replication with recombination could be paradigmatic for how other chromosomal processes can be locally and timely regulated and connected with the replication fork passage. Future studies will address the importance of Tim-DDX11 interaction for supporting DNA damage repair and/or S-phase stress checkpoints and the role of the fork-protection complex in coordinating all these chromosomal transactions with smooth replisome progression.</p></sec>
