      <abstract>
        <p>Periostin (PN, gene name POSTN) is an extracellular matrix protein that is up-regulated in bronchial epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts by TH-2 cytokines. Its paralog, TGF-Î²-induced protein (Î²ig-h3, gene name TGFBI), is also expressed in the lung and up-regulated in bronchial myofibroblasts by TGF-Î². PN and Î²ig-h3 contain fasciclin 1 modules that harbor putative recognition sequences for Î³-glutamyl carboxylase and are annotated in UniProt as undergoing vitamin K-dependent Î³-carboxylation of multiple glutamic acid residues. Î³-carboxylation profoundly alters activities of other proteins subject to the modification, e.g., blood coagulation factors, and would be expected to alter the structure and function of PN and Î²ig-h3. To analyze for the presence of Î³-carboxylation, proteins extracted from fibrotic lung were reacted with monoclonal antibodies specific for PN, Î²ig-h3, or modification with Î³-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). In Western blots of 1-dimensional gels, bands stained with anti-PN or -Î²ig-h3 did not match those stained with anti-Gla. In 2-dimensional gels, anti-PN-positive spots had pIs of 7.0 to &gt;8, as expected for the unmodified protein, and there was no overlap between anti-PN-positive and anti-Gla-positive spots. Recombinant PN and blood coagulation factor VII were produced in HEK293 cells that had been transfected with vitamin K 2, 3-epoxide reductase C1 to optimize Î³-carboxylation. Recombinant PN secreted from these cells did not react with anti-Gla antibody and had pIs similar to that found in extracts of fibrotic lung whereas secreted factor VII reacted strongly with anti-Gla antibody. Over 67% coverage of recombinant PN was achieved by mass spectrometry, including peptides with 19 of the 24 glutamates considered targets of Î³-carboxylation, but analysis revealed no modification. Over 86% sequence coverage and three modified glutamic acid residues were identified in recombinant fVII. These data indicate that PN and Î²ig-h3 are not subject to vitamin K-dependent Î³-carboxylation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins periostin (PN, gene name POSTN) and TGF-Î²-induced protein (Î²ig-h3, gene name TGFBI) were discovered in the early 1990s [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135374.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nearly two decades later, Coutu et al. described evidence that these proteins are modified by Î³-carboxylation [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Î³-carboxylation is a vitamin K-dependent post-translational modification that has profound effects on protein structure-function, e.g., vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors or the ECM proteins matrix-Gla protein and osteocalcin [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135374.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Î³-carboxylation should have similarly important effects on the structure and function of PN and Î²ig-h3. The original goal of the present study was to describe these effects; however, the study evolved into a re-analysis of whether the proteins are indeed Î³-carboxylated.</p>
      <p>PN and Î²ig-h3 vary most strikingly in their C-terminal tails [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These proteins have a similar domain structure for the remainder of the molecule, with each containing a single N-terminal cysteine-rich EMI domain [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135374.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], followed by 4 tandem fasciclin 1 (FAS1) modules [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135374.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The FAS1 modules of PN and Î²ig-h3 harbor putative recognition sequences for Î³-glutamyl carboxylase. This feature of the modules was recognized when it was found that 2-dimensional isoelectric focusing/electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) of proteins secreted by cultured mouse mesenchymal stromal cells resolved acidic proteins of the size of PN and Î²ig-h3 that reacted with monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the Î³-carboxyl-glutamic acid (Gla) modification and yielded peptides from PN and Î²ig-h3 when excised, trypsinized, and analyzed by mass spectrometry [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Based on these observations and putative carboxylase recognition sequences in 3 of the 4 FAS1 modules of both proteins, UniProt as queried on May 5, 2015, annotates PN ([Q15063-POSTN_HUMAN]) as containing up to 24 Gla residues, and Î²ig-h3 ([Q15582-BGH3_HUMAN]) up to 29 Gla residues. To our knowledge, no further investigations of Î³-carboxylation of PN or Big-h3, <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., the actual numbers of Gla residues in these proteins, have been attempted or published.</p>
      <p>We took a 2-pronged approach to the study of Î³-carboxylation of human PN and Î²ig-h3. Periostin is up-regulated in bronchial epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts by TH-2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and deposited in airway of asthmatic subjects, of rodents provoked to model the inflammation of asthma [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and of patients with idiopathic lung fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Î²ig-h3 is expressed in the lung and up-regulated in bronchial myofibroblasts by TGF-Î² [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To determine if the proteins deposited in ECM are Î³-carboxylated, we extracted proteins from normal or fibrotic lung and analyzed for reaction with Gla-specific antibody and acidic shift in isoelectric point due to introduction of extra carboxyl groups. We also attempted to produce recombinant Î³-carboxylated PN in HEK293 cells that had been transfected with VKOR (vitamin K 2, 3-epoxide reductase C1) for the purpose of increasing the yield of Î³-carboxylated vitamin K-dependent proteins. We now report that, despite using reagents and methods similar to those that led Coutu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] to conclude that PN and Î²ig-h3 are Î³-carboxylated, we find no evidence for the modification.</p>

        <p>Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed according to the carrier ampholine method of isoelectric focusing [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135374.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] by Kendrick Labs, Inc. (Madison, WI). Briefly, isoelectric focusing was carried out using 2% pH 3â10 Isodalt Servalytes (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) for 9600 volt-hrs. One Î¼g of tropomyosin (pI 5.2) was used as an internal standard. The focused proteins were then reduced, and the tube gel overlaid onto an 8 or 10% SDS PAGE gel. After electrophoresis the gel was transferred to PVDF membrane, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, documented, and sent to our lab where it was probed in Western blot.</p>

        <p>Lung extracts, conditioned cell media or purified proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels in reducing conditions then transferred to PVDF membranes. Primary antibodies were diluted as follows; mouse mAb anti-PN, mouse mAb anti-Gla, and rabbit anti-PN were used at 0.5 Î¼g/mL. Anti-Î²ig-h3 mAb was diluted to 2.0 Î¼g/mL, and sheep anti-fII was diluted 1/10,000. Positive bands were detected by species- and isotype-specific peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1/20,000), and enhanced chemiluminescence technology (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).

Stable transfectants were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and selection antibiotics puromycin (1.75 Î¼g/mL) (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and G418 (450 Î¼g/mL)(Hyclone Labs, Logan, UT). For serum free expression, cells were plated in serum containing media plus 10 Î¼g/mL vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and grown to 80% confluence, after which the cells were gently washed twice with PBS and serum free DMEM/F-12, 50/50 with L-glutamine (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) media supplemented with selection antibiotics, 1x ITS (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) and 10 Î¼g/mL vitamin K<sub>1</sub> was added to the plates. Conditioned media was collected and replaced with fresh on day 3 and collected again on day 7. Secreted PN0, which has a C-terminal thrombin-cleavage site followed by hexa-histidine tag, was purified by Ni-chelate chromatography in the presence of 6M urea. PN0 has a calculated molecular weight of 79.9 kDa. In SDS-PAGE, PN0 separated into a monomer of ~76 kDa and lesser amounts of an apparent dimer of ~162 kDa without reduction and a monomer of ~78 kDa with reduction (<xref rid="pone.0135374.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
          <p>Factor VII harboring the R152A (R15A by chymotrypsin numbering) mutation was produced as a secreted protein in HEK293VKOR cells and is referred to hereafter merely as factor VII or fVII. The cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+)(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transfected into HEK293VKOR cells using FuGENE6 (Promega, Madison, WI). Stable transfectants were grown in DMEM/F12, 50/50 (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 5ug/mL vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1.75ug/mL puromycin (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), and 400 Î¼g/mL G418 (RPI, Mount Prospect, IL). After growth to 80% confluence, cells were washed with HBSS (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) and media replaced with DMEM/F12, 50/50 with L-glutamine (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 1x ITS (Mediatech, Manassas, VA), 5 Î¼g/mL vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, 200 Î¼g/mL G418 and 1.75 Î¼g/mL puromycin every 2â3 days until cell confluence was &lt;10%. This serum-free media was concentrated ~10-fold with a 30kDa MWCO filter (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) in a stirred cell concentrator and purified by serial column chromatography with the calcium-dependent anti-fVII antibody 1150 [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], then with the anion exchange resin monoQ (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). The calcium-dependent antibody recognizes fVII regardless of Î³-carboxylation status (unpublished observation). Homogeneity was confirmed by single bands on silver-staining of SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="pone.0135374.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Polyethelene glycol (PEG) 8000, 0.1%, was added to fVII for stabilization.</p>

        <title>Detection of PN and Î²ig-h3 extracted from lung</title>
        <p>Increased amounts of PN are deposited in lung tissues of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as assessed by immunocytochemistry [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is not known if the deposited protein is modified by vitamin K-dependent Î³-carboxylation. To determine this, tissue samples from fibrotic and normal lung were pulverized, and proteins extracted with SDS or urea/EDTA, and analyzed by Western blotting looking for congruent bands that react with anti-PN mAb and the same anti-Gla mAb used to demonstrate Î³-carboxylation by Coutu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
        <p>Western blot analysis using anti-PN mAb demonstrated increased density in extracts of fibrotic versus normal lung of a band that migrated similarly to recombinant PN0 (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). PN0 is the smallest of the PN splice variants, migrates in SDS-PAGE at ~78kDa, and has a calculated mass of 79.9kDa. A second band slightly below the PN band was variably found in control blots in which the primary antibody was omitted and likely represents cross-reactivity of the secondary goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate with albumin in the extract. Anti-Gla recognized 4â5 bands specifically, including 2 close in migration to the band that stained specifically with anti-PN. These bands did not align exactly, however, and when a single lane was split in half, each half was blotted separately with anti-PN or anti-Gla, and the two halves were matched prior to imaging, the band that stained specifically with anti-PN was slightly below the most slowly migrating band that stained specifically with anti-Gla (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) A representative Western blot of proteins extracted with SDS from pulverized lung tissue (10mg tissue per 0.1 mL extraction buffer). SDS extracts (2.5 Î¼l/lane) of fibrotic (F) and normal (N) lung sample, were blotted with mouse anti-PN (left) and anti-Gla (right). PN-positive bands in lung extracts migrate at approximately 79 kDa, similar to the migration of PN0 expressed in HEK293VKOR cells (PN0). (B) Urea/EDTA extracts (10.0 Î¼l/lane) of fibrotic lung (F) have protein patterns similar to those seen with the SDS extracts. A lane has been split (side slashes) and probed with both anti-PN (left) and anti-Gla (right) antibodies. The anti-PN- and anti-Gla-positive bands do not align exactly but bands do overlap.

        <p>We reasoned that the anti-Gla-staining bands may represent, in part, staining of vitamin-K dependent plasma proteins present in lung vasculature or interstitial fluid. We therefore ran standards of plasma-derived human fII, protein S, and fIX alongside the fibrotic lung extract and blotted with anti-Gla. All 3 proteins reacted strongly with anti-Gla. Bands in the fII and fIX samples co-aligned, respectively, with Gla-positive bands of 84 kDa and a diffuse band of 67 to 77kDa in the lung extract (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Protein S had a slightly slower migration than fII and did not line up with an anti-Gla staining band in the extract. A parallel blot with anti-PN revealed a band that co-migrated with PN0 and slightly faster than the fII standard or the 84 kDa band in the extract that reacted with anti-Gla (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Western blots with fII specific antibodies detected a band of 84kDa in fibrotic lung extracts (<xref rid="pone.0135374.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Based on these results, we conclude that the Gla-positive 84kDa band in lung extracts represents fII.</p>

        <p>Were PN modified by Î³-carboxylation, each Gla modification would be expected to lower its isoelectric point (pI) due to addition of a carboxyl group. In UniProt, PN is annotated to have 24 potential Gla modifications. Isoelectric point calculations of the un-carboxylated splice variants of PN by the Expasy PI/Mw Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/">http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/</ext-link>) ranged between a variant that includes three of the alternatively spliced exons ([POSTN_HUMAN isoform 5; UniProt: Q15063-5]) with pI of 7.08 and a variant which includes one of the exons ([POSTN_HUMAN isoform 4; Uniprot: Q15063-4]) with pI 8.40. Addition of 24 Gla modifications was calculated to change the pIs to 4.5 to 5.5. To look for this acidic shift in pI and allow for a more critical comparison of PN- and Gla-positive bands, proteins extracted with SDS from fibrotic lung samples were subjected to 2-dimensional isoelectric focusing/electrophoresis and blotted in parallel with monoclonal anti-PN and anti-Gla mAbs (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Coomassie blue staining of the membranes prior to blotting demonstrated similar protein patterns (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). PN-positive spots were detected between 73 and 79 kDa (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), consistent with migration observed with recombinant PN in reducing conditions and the predicted range of molecular weights of the PN splice variants. The isoelectric points of PN-positive spots ranged between pH 7.0 and &gt; pH 8.0, which are the calculated pIs of the various splice variants of un-Î³-carboxylated PN. Anti-Gla identified an array of spots with sizes ranging from approximately 87 to 47 kDa and pIs ranging from 4.0 to 6.0; these spots were far away from the PN-positive spots (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). To address the possibility that the epitope of the anti-PN monoclonal is lost upon Î³-carboxylation and to explore the nature of the unexpectedâYâ shaped spot (~50 kDa with pI between pH 6.5 and 7.0) that stained with anti-PN mAb (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), immunoblotting was also done with polyclonal antibodies to PN. The pattern was similar to what was found with the mAb to PN except for the appearance of several low mw spots in the basic range, one low mw spot in the acidic range, and that theâYâ shaped spot was not seen (<xref rid="pone.0135374.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). All PN-positive spots were negative with the anti-Gla antibody (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). FII and fIX, which have pIs of 4.7â4.9, and 4.0â4.5 [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], respectively, presumably account for acidic Gla-positive spots with apparent sizes similar to PN. We have not done further analysis to identify these and the other Gla-staining spots definitively.</p>

The pulverized and SDS-extracted normal and fibrotic lung samples were immunoblotted for the presence of Î²ig-h3 and Gla residues.

        <p>Although immunochemistry of lung of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis revealed abundant deposition of PN [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] we could not know for sure whether there was a fraction of deposited PN that was not solubilized by extraction with SDS and for that reason was not analyzed in our Western blotting. Therefore, we interrogated the spectra of peptides generated by digestion of SDS-insoluble fractions of experimental metastatic tumors [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] allowing carboxylation [+44] to be a modification. The fractions, which were generated from mice with xenografts of human colon cancer had been found to contain PN and Big-h3 derived from both human tumor and murine host [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A small number of carboxylated peptides were identified. These carboxyls mapped to both Asp and Glu. Most of the modified peptides were from tubulin and tubulin-associated proteins. A single Î²-carboxylated peptide from mouse Î²ig-h3 was identified, carboxylated on Asp221. The only Î³-carboxylated residue detected in a protein that would have passed through the endoplasmic reticulum was Glu230 of the murine fibrinogen Î²-chain. Although this analysis did not find the presence of Î³-carboxylation on PN or Î²ig-h3, data mining alone of spectra of peptides not specifically enriched for identification of Î³-carboxylation cannot be taken as evidence that PN or Î²ig-h3 was completely free of modifications because carboxylated sites could have been below the instrumentâs limit of detection.</p>

        <title>Expression and analysis of recombinant PN from mammalian cells</title>
        <p>Recombinant PN secreted into the media from HEK293 grown in medium containing vitamin K had previously been reported to react with anti-Gla mAb in Western blots [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In preliminary experiments we obtained positive results using anti-Gla at the 5 Î¼g/ml concentration recommended by the manufacturer with PN secreted from insect SF9 or human HEK293 cells cultured both with or without vitamin K; contaminating proteins and the molecular weight markers reacted positively by Western blotting as well (<xref rid="pone.0135374.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>). When we used a known vitamin K-dependent protein, blood coagulation factor VII (fVII), as a positive Î³-carboxylation control, we found that the anti-Gla antibody could be diluted to concentrations at which reaction with contaminating proteins and proteins produced in insect cells in the absence of vitamin K (PN0 and FN70K) was minimized whereas reaction with fVII remained strong (<xref rid="pone.0135374.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>). We then expressed PN and fVII in parallel in HEK293VKOR cells. These are HEK293 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding VKOR, which catalyzes both the reduction of vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K and the conversion of vitamin K to vitamin K hydroquinone, the rate-limiting step in producing vitamin K-dependent Î³-carboxylation. VKOR overexpression has been shown to increase the fraction of recombinant protein that is Î³-carboxylated [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135374.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PN was detected by Western blotting in conditioned media of HEK293 cells co-transfected with PN0 and cultured in the presence of 10 Î¼g/mL vitamin K, but nothing was secreted that reacted with anti-Gla antibody at a concentration of 0.5 Î¼g/ml (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). PN0 purified from serum-free conditioned media by Ni-chelate chromatography in the presence of 6M urea, which was added because it has been reported that denaturing of the protein is necessary for purification of the Î³-carboxylated PN [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], also did not react with anti-Gla at 0.5 Î¼g/ml (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). The fVII positive control, in contrast, stained strongly with anti-Gla, 0.5 Î¼g/ml (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). The anti-Gla antibody, although it detects Gla residues irrespective of context, has been shown to vary in its ability to react with different Î³-carboxylated proteins [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To address the protein-specific sensitivity issue, we compared fVII and PN over a 100-fold mass range (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Reactivity was found when as little as 0.1pmol fVII was analyzed whereas no reactivity was found with 10pmol PN. To detect Gla by a second method, we carried out mass spectrometry of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of the two proteins with ETD and AI-ETD, techniques that have been optimized for identification of post translational modifications [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135374.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>UniProt annotates PN and Î²ig-h3 to have up to 24 and 29 Gla modifications, respectively, which would easily make these two proteins the most extensively Î³-carboxylated proteins in the proteome. Î³-carboxylation profoundly changes the structure/function of the proteins it modifies, such that coagulation cascade factors II, X, IX, and VII; Proteins C, S, and Z; Gas6; osteocalcin; and matrix Gla protein [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0135374.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] are dependent on this modification for normal function. The initial aim of this study was to determine impact of Î³-carboxylation state on PN structure-function. Studies of PN and Î²ig-h3 are commonly done using recombinant proteins from bacteria, insect or mammalian cells cultured in the absence of vitamin K (i.e. expression systems lacking the ability to Î³-carboxylate). If Î³-carboxylated PN and Î²ig-h3 are the functional form of these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, published and ongoing studies would be irrelevant. However, we were unable to obtain Î³-carboxylated PN and, because the question of whether PN and Î²ig-h3 are Î³-carboxylated is important, now describe our attempts in detail. First, we found that PN extracted from fibrotic lung is not Î³-carboxylated as assessed by its pI and lack of reactivity with antibody that recognizes Gla residues irrespective of context [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Second, we failed to make any detectible Î³-carboxylated PN in a cell culture system that was optimized for production of Î³-carboxylated fVII, which is considered to be one of the more difficult of the vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors to produce recombinantly in an active form [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our studies were done with the same anti-Gla mAb that, along with acidic shift in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, provided the most persuasive evidence for Î³-carboxylation in the publication by Coutu et al. showing Gla modification of PN secreted from cultured mouse and human mesenchymal stromal cells and recombinant PN produced by HEK293 cells [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The immuno-blotting studies were complemented by ETD and AI-ETD mass spectrometry analyses of PN isolated from VKOR transfected 293 cells that failed to identify any Î³-carboxylated peptides whereas analysis of a positive control (Î³-carboxylated) sample of purified recombinant fVII localized three sites of Î³-carboxylation. We did not investigate Î³-carboxylation of Î²ig-h3 to the same depth as we did PN, but in one-dimensional gel electrophoresis done in parallel with analysis of PN extracted from fibrotic lung, we found no evidence of modification. Also, our mass spectrometric analyses of PN are compatible with previous mass spectrometric analysis of Î²ig-h3 extracted from cornea, which failed to reveal any post-translational modifications of either the whole protein or of peptides after digestion [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Finally, we were unable to find evidence for Î³-carboxylated peptides from PN and Î²ig-h3 in a database of mass spectra deposited from a study describing the composition of the SDS-insoluble fraction of tumors, which is known to contain PN and Î²ig-h3[<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It should be emphasized that the analyses of the mass spectrometric database and our mass spectrometry of PN and fVII, were of peptides that were not specifically enriched for Î³-carboxylation. Further directed investigations would be needed to evaluate the lack of evidence for Î³-carboxylation of fVII at the eight other previously described locations (<xref rid="pone.0135374.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) even though seven of them are reported to be reliably carboxylated in recombinant protein made by BHK cells [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] or the evidence of Î³-carboxylation of fVII at Glu280, which has not been reported previously.</p>
      <p>For most Î³-carboxylated peptides or proteins, substrate recognition for the carboxylase resides in an N-terminal pro-sequence that is removed as the modified C-terminal peptide or protein matures in the endoplasmic reticulum and more distal secretory apparatus [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Matrix-Gla protein, which has a 16-residue Î³-carboxylase recognition sequence embedded within a 77-residue protein [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], is an exception to the bipartite nature of Î³-carboxylation and a model for the Î³-carboxylase recognition of PN and Î²ig-h3 as proposed by Coutu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There is no precedent, however, for Î³-carboxylase having multiple recognition sequences embedded in a multi-modular protein as is proposed for PN and Î²ig-h3 with putative recognition sequences identified in 3 of the 4 FAS1 modules [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Propeptides harboring <italic>bona fide</italic> Î³-carboxylase recognition sequences have a propensity to form Î±-helices in 40% trifluoroethanol, and the prevailing view is that Î³-carboxylation is determined by a chemical surface with a topology that is complementary to the surface of the propeptide binding site of the carboxylase [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the residues that allowed identification of putative Î³-carboxylase recognition sequences in FAS1 modules [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] appear to be contributing importantly to tertiary structure rather than to surface topology. FAS1 modules have a distinctive global fold that was first revealed by the crystal structure of the third and fourth tandem FAS1 modules of <italic>Drosophila</italic> fasciclin-1[PDB ID code 1o70] [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and shown to be true for the fourth FAS1 module of human Î²ig-h3 by crystallography [PDB ID code 2VXP, not published], NMR [PDB ID code 2LTB] [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and modeling [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. An 11-residue sequence stretching from the Î²1-sheet to the Î±3-helix, which is the most conserved region of FAS1 modules in alignments of fasciclin-1 and Î²ig-h3[<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], overlaps with and includes 8 of the 16 residues in the putative Î³-carboxylase recognition sequence. When one examines the structures of the fourth FAS1 module of Î²ig-h3, side-chains of 3 of the 4 residues that are most conserved compared to known vertebrate Î³-carboxylase recognition sequences [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], F540, A546, L550, and R555, are localized on the inner faces of the Î²-sheet and Î±-helix, with only R555 being solvent accessible [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A number of other side-chains also are oriented to the interior of the molecule. Side chains of the phenylalanines at the same position as F540 in the fasciclin-1 modules are, like F540, buried in a cavity surrounded by a 4-stranded Î²-sheet [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. All-in-all, it is difficult to reconcile Î³-carboxylation of FAS1 modules with what is known about Î³-carboxylation of known substrates and the structure of FAS1 modules.</p>
      <p>We can only speculate as to why our results contradict the findings of Coutu et al. One set of differences is with the characterization of recombinant PN made by 293 cells. Our system, which was geared toward expression of Î³-carboxylated proteins and allowed production of Î³-carboxylated fVII, produced PN that was not Î³-carboxylated. The concentration of anti-Gla antibody used by Coutu et al. and us to test for Î³-carboxylation status in Western blots is a potentially important variable because of the tendency of the antibody to react non-specifically when bands contained copious protein or the antibody was at a concentration &gt; 1 ug/ml (<xref rid="pone.0135374.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Another difference concerns the locations of PN and Gla-containing proteins on 2D gels. In the present study, we found that 3 Î³-carboxylated proteins, fII, fIX, and protein S, migrated in the same region as PN on 1D SDS-PAGE and that fII was in our lung extracts by Western blotting. The major anti-Gla-staining band in the region co-migrated with fII and not with PN. In 2D gels, fII and fIX presumably account for some of the acidic Gla-positive, PN-negative spots of similar MW to that of PN. Coutu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] made no mention of whether the 2D gels were Western blotted with anti-PN or anti-Î²ig-h3 antibodies, whether peptides from known Î³-carboxylated proteins were found in the acidic region of the gel from which the PN- and Î²ig-h3-derived peptides were identified, or whether any of the peptides from PN or Î²ig-h3 contained Gla. Regarding why peptides from PN and Î²ig-h3 could be generated from protein focusing to the acidic region [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], one possibility is that the different reagents used to prepare samples for the first dimension of the 2D separation, SDS by us and âDestreak rehydration bufferâ by Coutu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], resulted in variable amounts of streaking. A second possibility is that PN or Î²ig-h3 secreted from mesenchymal stromal or adenocarcinoma cells undergo loss of N- or C-terminal basic residues as a result of proteolysis, thus lowering the pI. Such has been demonstrated for Î²ig-h3 from cornea [<xref rid="pone.0135374.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A final possibility is that PN or Î²ig-h3 carry other acidic modifications or are phosphorylated. PhosphoSitePlus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org">www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>) lists 10 residues in PN that have been identified as being phosphorylated in various phosphoproteomic screens.</p>
