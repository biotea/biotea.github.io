      <abstract>
        <p>In animal cells, the centrosome is the main microtubule-organizing centre where microtubules are nucleated and anchored. The centriole subdistal appendages (SDAs) are the key structures that anchor microtubules in interphase cells, but the composition and assembly mechanisms of SDAs are not well understood. Here, we reveal that centrosome-binding proteins, coiled-coil domain containing (CCDC) 120 and CCDC68 are two novel SDA components required for hierarchical SDA assembly in human cells. CCDC120 is anchored to SDAs by ODF2 and recruits CEP170 and Ninein to the centrosome through different coiled-coil domains at its N terminus. CCDC68 is a CEP170-interacting protein that competes with CCDC120 in recruiting CEP170 to SDAs. Furthermore, CCDC120 and CCDC68 are required for centrosome microtubule anchoring. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis for centriole SDA hierarchical assembly and microtubule anchoring in human interphase cells.</p>

    <p>Microtubules play important roles in many cellular events, including vesicular trafficking, cell migration, polarization and division. Temporal and spatial regulation of microtubule dynamics are crucial for proper cellular function. The major microtubule-organizing centre in animal cells is the centrosome, which is surrounded by pericentriolar material and contains mother and daughter centrioles. In contrast with daughter centrioles, mother centrioles are characterized by two projection structures, the distal appendages (DAs) and subdistal appendages (SDAs), which are localized to the distal and subdistal ends, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The DAs mainly function in membrane docking and ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, while the SDAs anchor the microtubule minus-ends to the centrosome in interphase cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
    <p>Microtubule nucleation and anchoring at centrosomes are essential processes for microtubule organization in interphase cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Protein complexes that function in microtubule nucleation at centrosomes, such as the Î³-tubulin ring complex, have been well studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In contrast, although some centrosome proteins, including Ninein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, ODF2 (also known as cenexin)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, CEP170 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), CEP110 (also known as centriolin)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, CC2D2A (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and É-tubulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, have been classified as SDA components by electron microscopy or three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, the composition and functions of the SDAs are just beginning to be revealed. Ninein acts as a microtubule-anchoring protein that recruits microtubule nucleation protein complex Î³-tubulin ring complex via its N terminus and localizes to the centrosome via its C terminus in mouse cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. CEP170 interacts with Ninein and associates with microtubules through its C terminus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Unlike Ninein and CEP170, ODF2 is localized much closer to the âbarrel' of the mother centriole and is critical for DA and SDA formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Recent studies have shown that ODF2 controls DA and SDA assembly through different domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Depleting these SDA proteins disturbs microtubule anchorage to the centrosomes in interphase cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Other proteins, including those comprising the dynein/dynactin complex (containing p50/dynamitin, p150<sup>Glued</sup> and p24), EB1, Kif3a and trichoplein (TCHP), which localize near SDAs or the subdistal ends of centrioles, also function in anchoring microtubules to mother centrioles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In addition to their functions in microtubule anchoring, proteins that localize to or near the SDAs also regulate endosome recycling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, spindle orientation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Although recent studies have made progress in understanding the molecular basis of microtubule regulation of SDA components in interphase cells, the molecular connections and assembly order remain poorly understood.</p>
    <p>Coiled-coil domain containing 120 (CCDC120) was first identified as a centrosome protein by a centrosome proteomics study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. CCDC120 interacts with cytohesin-2 to regulate vesicular trafficking and neurite growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Coiled-coil domain containing 68 (CCDC68) was recently reported as a tumour suppressor in a study of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. However, the functions of CCDC120 and CCDC68 in the centrosome are unknown. In this study, we identify CCDC120 and CCDC68 as SDA components and propose a hierarchical assembly model of SDAs by uncovering their roles in cooperating with known SDA components such as ODF2, Ninein and CEP170, as well as in microtubule anchoring in interphase cells.</p>

        <title>CCDC120 is an SDA component</title>
        <p>Human CCDC120 contains 630 amino acids and is predicted to contain two short coiled-coil domains in its N terminus and a long proline-rich domain through its C terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). To characterize CCDC120, we generated rabbit and mouse polyclonal antibodies against its N terminus (1â200 amino acids (aa), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Both antibodies recognized a band at â¼85âkDa by immunoblotting in U2OS cells, which was of similar size as that recognized by a commercial anti-CCDC120 antibody (generated against 281â630 aa), and nearly abolished after transfection with short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>), although a nonspecific band at â¼60âkDa was detected by the rabbit polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). CCDC120 co-fractionated with centrosome components hNinein, CEP170, ODF2 and Î³-tubulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), and was localized at the centrosome through its two coiled-coil domain-containing regions (1â90 aa and 91â320 aa) during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1eâg</xref>), indicating that CCDC120 is a centrosome protein.</p>
        <p>To investigate the localization of CCDC120 at the centrosome in detail, we performed immunostaining to detect CCDC120. Three CCDC120-positive dots were observed in the centrosome with both lab-generated and commercial antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1h</xref>), of which one relatively poorly defined dot was partially co-localized with Centrin-3, a marker of the distal centriole ends, in one centriole, whereas the other two dots co-localized with C-Nap1, a marker of the proximal centrioles ends, in both centrioles during the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, top). This asymmetric CCDC120 localization changed as the cells entered the G2 phase, when CCDC120 was localized at the distal and proximal ends of the parental centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, bottom). To further assess CCDC120 localization at the distal end of the centriole, 3D-SIM was performed. Interestingly, we observed that CCDC120 appeared as two âdim dots' in the side views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, top) or as a âring-like' structure in the top views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, central, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1i</xref>) at the distal part of one centriole in G1 phase cells; these structures were localized near CP110 and appeared at both parental centrioles in G2 phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, bottom).</p>
        <p>Because the localization of CCDC120 is very similar to that of Ninein, a centrosome protein localized to the SDAs of mother centrioles and proximal ends of both centrioles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, we co-immunostained CCDC120 with human Ninein (hNinein) and SDA proteins CEP170 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and ODF2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1câe</xref>). In the top and side views, the diameter of the ring formed by CCDC120 (491.0Â±42.5ânm diameter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1câf</xref>) was slightly smaller than that of hNinein (527Â±31.7ânm diameter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,f</xref>) or CEP170 (550.3Â±15.8ânm diameter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,f</xref>), but was much larger than that of ODF2 (374.5Â±28.6ânm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Similar results were obtained after overexpressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1j</xref>). We also co-immunostained CCDC120 with TCHP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and CEP164 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), markers of the subdistal parts of centrioles and DAs, respectively, and found that the diameter of the ring formed by CCDC120 was also larger than those formed by TCHP and CEP164 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g,h</xref>). Finally, immuno-EM results confirmed that CCDC120 is an SDA component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Taken together, these results show that CCDC120 is localized to the SDAs of mother centrioles and proximal ends of both centrioles in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>).</p>

        <title>CCDC120 is recruited to SDAs by ODF2</title>
        <p>ODF2 is essential for SDA and DA assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. To investigate whether ODF2 is also required for localization of CCDC120 to SDAs, we examined the functional relationship between ODF2 and CCDC120. Depletion of ODF2 in U2OS cells by siRNA moderately reduced the protein level of CCDC120, and significantly inhibited localization of CCDC120 at SDAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2aâd</xref>), but not its localization at the proximal ends of centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). Depletion of CCDC120 by siRNA altered neither the protein level of ODF2 nor its centrosome localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2aâc</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous CCDC120 immunoprecipitated with ODF2 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). These results suggest that ODF2 interacts with and recruits CCDC120 to SDAs.</p>
        <p>To identify the region of ODF2 that mediates interaction with CCDC120, we constructed a series of ODF2 truncation mutants. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that 1â100 aa of ODF2 is required for its binding to CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Considering that 1â59 aa of ODF2 is important for SDA assembly in mouse cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> as well as the high orthology between human and mouse ODF2, we generated a 1â60 aa deletion mutant of human ODF2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). In comparison with full-length ODF2, the mutant showed significantly weakened interaction with CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Moreover, overexpressing full-length, but not the 1â60 deletion mutant of siRNA-resistant ODF2, rescued SDA localization of CCDC120 in ODF2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i,j</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). However, the interaction between ODF2 and CCDC120 was not detected by yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>), suggesting that their interaction is indirect.</p>

        <title>CCDC120 recruits hNinein and CEP170 to centrosomes</title>
        <p>To explore the function of CCDC120 in SDA assembly, we first depleted CCDC120 using siRNA and examined the centrosome localization of other SDA components. Loss of CCDC120 disrupted recruitment of hNinein and CEP170 to the centrosomes as indicated by Centrin-2, but not affecting their total protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3aâe</xref>). Overexpression of mouse CCDC120 in CCDC120-depleted U2OS cells rescued the SDA localization of CEP170 and hNinein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3fâh</xref>). In contrast, depletion of either hNinein or CEP170 by siRNA did not affect both the centrosome localization and total protein level of CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3aâe</xref>). These results suggest that CCDC120 is necessary for recruitment of hNinein and CEP170 to SDAs. Moreover, depletion of CCDC120 affects neither the centrosome localization of DA protein CEP164 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3aâc</xref>) nor ciliogenesis in hTERT RPE-1 cells after serum starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3dâf</xref>), suggesting that CCDC120 is specifically involved in assembly of SDAs but not in assembly of DAs.</p>

        <title>hNinein and CEP170 bind to different domains of CCDC120</title>
        <p>To further examine the relationships among CCDC120, CEP170 and hNinein, we coexpressed CCDC120-mCherry with hNinein-GFP or CEP170-GFP in U2OS cells. CCDC120-mCherry showed good co-localization with hNinein-GFP as aggregates throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), and co-localized with microtubule-binding filaments formed by CEP170-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Next, immunoprecipitation assays showed that endogenous hNinein and CEP170, but not CEP164, bound to CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). Furthermore, we mapped the domains of hNinein and CEP170 mediating the interactions with CCDC120, revealing that the N terminus (1â480 aa) of hNinein and C terminus (1,015â1,460 aa) of CEP170 were required for their binding to CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4bâf</xref>). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation was performed to identify the regions of CCDC120 responsible for associating with hNinein and CEP170. The N terminus of CCDC120 (1â320 aa) was able to bind hNinein and CEP170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4gâi</xref>). We further confirmed that both purified 1â480 aa of hNinein and 1,015â1,460 aa of CEP170 bound to 1â320 aa of CCDC120 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4j</xref>). Overexpression of 1â320 aa of CCDC120 resulted in a marked decrease in the centrosome localization of endogenous hNinein and CEP170, but not that of CEP164, in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4k,l</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4d,e</xref>). These results suggest that the N terminus of CCDC120 is required for SDA localization of hNinein and CEP170.</p>
        <p>To map the hNinein- and CEP170-binding regions of CCDC120 in more detail, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays using two coiled-coil domains of CCDC120 as bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). The first coiled-coil domain-containing region (1â90 aa) of CCDC120 bound to the C terminus of CEP170 (1,015â1,460 aa), while its second coiled-coil domain-containing region (91â320 aa) interacted with the N terminus of hNinein (1â480 aa, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>). Immunoprecipitation and glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) pull-down assays further confirmed that the two coiled-coil domain-containing regions of CCDC120 at 1â90 aa and 91â320 aa bound to CEP170 and hNinein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h,i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4g,h</xref>).</p>
        <p>Collectively, these results suggest that CCDC120 interacts with hNinein and CEP170, most likely in a direct manner, through different coiled-coil domains at its N terminus.</p>

        <title>CCDC68 is a CEP170-interacting protein localized to SDAs</title>
        <p>To identify additional components participating in SDA assembly, we screened CEP170-interacting proteins by mass spectrometry analysis and chose to focus on CCDC68 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). A specific band at â¼45âkDa was detected by anti-CCDC68 antibody in U2OS cells; this band was diminished after CCDC68 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). The interaction between CCDC68 and CEP170 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-CCDC68 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Next, we co-immunostained CCDC68 with Centrin-3 in U2OS cells, revealing asymmetric localization of CCDC68 on the two centrioles in G1 phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, top), similar to that of CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and other SDA proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Also, the asymmetric localization of CCDC68 became symmetrical, followed by maturation of old daughter centrioles in G2 phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, bottom).</p>
        <p>To investigate the detailed localization of CCDC68 at the centrosomes, we co-immunostained CCDC68 with SDA proteins hNinein, CEP170, ODF2 and CCDC120, and observed them under 3D-SIM. Both endogenous and Flag-tagged CCDC68 formed a ring-like structure at the distal part of the mother centriole similar to those formed by CCDC120 and hNinein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5câf</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). The CCDC68 ring was co-localized with the detected SDA proteins in the top and side views; moreover, it was localized to the proximal parts of both centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5bâf</xref>). The diameter of the ring formed by CCDC68 (461.5Â±41.1ânm diameter) was slightly smaller than that of hNinein, CEP170 or CCDC120, but larger than that of ODF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5câg</xref>).

        <title>CCDC68 and CCDC120 independently recruit CEP170</title>
        <p>Next, we performed experiments aimed at clarifying the function of CCDC68 in SDAs assembly. First, loss of ODF2 strikingly weakened the SDAs localization of CCDC68 in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>), although the interaction between ODF2 and CCDC68 was barely detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>), suggesting that ODF2 does not directly recruit CCDC68 to SDAs. Because CCDC68 interacts with CEP170 and the diameter of the CCDC68 ring at SDAs is slightly smaller than that of CEP170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,d</xref>), we assessed whether CCDC68 also recruits CEP170 to SDAs. Depletion of CCDC68 in U2OS cells by siRNA resulted in â¼40% loss of the CEP170 signal at the centrosomes without changing its protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>), whereas loss of CEP170 altered neither the localization of CCDC68 at the centrosome nor the protein level of CCDC68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>), suggesting that CCDC68 is involved in recruiting CEP170 to SDAs. In addition, cilia formation was not affected after depletion of CCDC68 in hTERT RPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5fâh</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine which domains mediate the interaction between CCDC68 and CEP170, we constructed several truncation mutants of CCDC68. Immunoprecipitation showed that the truncates of CCDC68 containing a long coiled-coil domain in the middle region (101â305 aa) interacted with CEP170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). When 101â305 aa of CCDC68 was overexpressed in U2OS cells, the centrosome localization of endogenous CEP170 was remarkably diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>), similar to the phenotype observed in the cells overexpressing the N terminus of CCDC120 (1â320 aa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4k</xref>). We also mapped the CEP170-interacting domain of CCDC68 in detail using yeast two-hybrid assay, revealing that 101â200 aa of CCDC68 mainly bound to CEP170 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>).</p>
        <p>An unstable isoform of CCDC68 (CCDC68Î69â114) that lacks tumour-suppressive ability has been reported in 31% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. In comparison with full-length CCDC68, CCDC68Î69â114 showed similar SDA localization and CEP170-binding ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6câe</xref>), suggesting that the tumour-suppressive function of CCDC68 may not rely on its functions at SDAs.</p>
        <p>Next, we investigated the domains of CEP170 involved in its association with CCDC68. Unexpectedly, the C terminus of CEP170 (1,015â1,460 aa), which was shown to mediated the centrosome localization of CEP170 and its interaction with CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>), also co-immunoprecipitated with CCDC68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6f</xref>). To determine whether CCDC120 and CCDC68 recruit CEP170 to SDAs in a competitive manner, we incubated the purified C terminus of CEP170 sequentially with lysates from HEK293T cells individually overexpressing a constant amount of CCDC120 and an increasing amount of CCDC68. The results showed that increased binding of CCDC68 to the C terminus of CEP170 was associated with reduced interaction between CCDC120 and the C terminus of CEP170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h</xref>). In contrast, increasing CCDC120 level barely displaced CCDC68 from the C terminus of CEP170 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6g</xref>). These data suggest that CCDC68 and CCDC120 bind to the same region, or to overlapping regions, in the C terminus of CEP170 in a competitive manner.</p>
        <p>The competitive binding of CCDC68 and CCDC120 to CEP170 suggests that they may function independently in SDA assembly. Indeed, compared with depleting CCDC120 alone, double-knockdown CCDC68 and CCDC120 further impaired centrosome localization of CEP170 in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6h</xref>). However, the interaction between CCDC68 and CCDC120 was barely detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6i</xref>), and localization of CCDC68 at SDAs was not dependent on the presence of CCDC120 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6jâl</xref>). Together, these results reveal that CCDC120 and CCDC68 function independently in recruiting CEP170 and SDA localization.</p>

        <title>CCDC120 and CCDC68 are required for microtubule anchoring</title>
        <p>On the basis of the localization of CCDC120 and CCDC68 at SDAs and their relationships among hNinein, CEP170 and ODF2, which are essential for microtubule anchoring to SDAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, we determined the functions of CCDC120 and CCDC68 in microtubule organization at the centrosome. First, flow cytometry analysis showed that depletion of neither CCDC120 nor CCDC68 significantly affected the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6j</xref>). Next, microtubules were depolymerized by cold treatment and allowed to recover after the addition of warm medium to the cells. After 1âmin of recovery, strong microtubule asters were observed in the control cells, whereas fewer and weaker asters were found in the CCDC120- and CCDC68-depleted cells (1âmin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig 7aâd</xref>). Ten minutes after regrowth, cytoplasmic microtubules had grown well in the cells in each group. However, in the CCDC120- and CCDC68-knockdown cells, the number of cells with microtubules anchored to the centrosome was significantly decreased in comparison with that of the control cells (10âmin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7aâd</xref>). Microtubule-anchoring defects of greater severity than those observed in either single depletion group were observed in the CCDC120/CCDC68 double-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). Thus, CCDC120 and CCDC68 function independently and both are required for centrosome microtubule anchoring in interphase cells.</p>
        <p>Because CCDC120 interacts with hNinein and CEP170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), while CCDC68 associates with CEP170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6bâl</xref>), we performed microtubule regrowth assays in cells subjected to double knockdown of CCDC120/hNinein, CCDC120/CEP170 or CCDC68/CEP170. In these double-knockdown cells, the percentage of cells showing microtubule anchoring to the centrosome did not decrease significantly after 10âmin of recovery, in comparison with the percentages of CCDC120 and CCDC68 single-knockdown cells showing such anchoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7aâd</xref>). Together, these results suggest that CCDC120 promotes centrosome microtubule anchoring in interphase cells mediated by hNinein and CEP170, while CCDC68 functions mainly requiring CEP170.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we identified two new SDA components, CCDC120 and CCDC68, which cooperate with known SDA components ODF2, hNinein and CEP170, and are required for hierarchical SDA assembly and microtubule anchoring in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
      <p>Like other SDA proteins such as ODF2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), CEP170 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and hNinein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, CCDC120 and CCDC68 form a ring structure during the G1 phase; two rings appear during the G2 phase, as the old daughter centriole matures. Using 3D-SIM, we showed that the rings formed by CCDC120 and CCDC68 at SDAs are a similar diameter, and much larger than that of ODF2, but slightly smaller than those of hNinein and CEP170. These results suggest that the protein rings formed by SDA components ODF2, CCDC68, CCDC120, hNinein and CEP170 overlapped to form a ring-like structure at the SDAs of mother centrioles in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>).</p>
      <p>ODF2 is essential for organization of DAs and SDAs via the actions of two distinct fragments. Amino acids 188â806 of mouse ODF2 are necessary for DA formation, whereas SDA formation requires 1â59 aa and 188â806 aa regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Interestingly, we found that 1â60 aa of human ODF2, which is highly orthologous to 1â60 aa of mouse ODF2, recruits CCDC120 to SDAs without affecting its localization at the proximal ends of centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, we did not detect a proteinâprotein interaction between CCDC68 and ODF2, suggesting that other proteins may mediate the interaction between these two components.</p>
      <p>TCHP acts as a bridge between ODF2 and hNinein at SDAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, we found no detectable effect of TCHP on centrosome localization of CCDC120 or vice versa, suggesting that hNinein may be simultaneously recruited by CCDC120 and TCHP at different domains. In mouse cells, Ninein targets the centrosome through its C terminus, whereas at least four centrosome target sites of hNinein have been found in human cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. We showed that CCDC120 interacts with 1â480 aa of hNinein, one of hNinein centrosome target sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that hNinein may be recruited by TCHP through its other centrosome target sites.</p>
      <p>CEP170 is recruited by hNinein in human cells, as the C terminus of CEP170 directly interacts with the middle region and C terminus of hNinein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Here our results suggest that the N terminus of CCDC120 interacts with hNinein and CEP170, most likely directly, through two distinct coiled-coil domains; the first interacts with the C terminus of CEP170 (1,015â1,460 aa), whereas the second interacts mainly with the N terminus of hNinein (1â480 aa). These results are consistent with a previous report that the N terminus of hNinein mediates its centrosome localization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, as well as with a report that the C terminus of CEP170 is essential for its targeting to the centrosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Interestingly, we found that compared with CCDC120, CCDC68 shows more dominant in binding the C terminus of CEP170, as CCDC68 efficiently outcompeted CCDC120 for the C terminus of CEP170 in the binding assays. In addition, we did not detect strong interaction or direct recruitment relationships between them, further demonstrating their independent functions in SDA assembly. Future investigations should assess whether CCDC120 and CCDC68 sequentially recruit CEP170 during maturation of SDAs in mother centrioles. Thus, our results suggest that SDA assembly might be a hierarchical process with downstream branching, rather than a simple linear process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b,c</xref>).</p>
      <p>The relationship between SDA components and cilia formation has been the subject of several studies. ODF2 is required for primary cilia formation in fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and proper basal bodies' organization at the cell cortex in multiple ciliated cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Loss of SDA protein CC2D2A causes deficient cilia formation and SDA localization of ODF2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study reported that the loss of SDA components such as ODF2, CEP170 and Ninein change neither the length of primary cilia nor the percentage of ciliated cells, but affects the spatial configuration of cilia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In this study, our data also showed that depletion of CCDC120 and CCDC68 changes neither the percentage of ciliated cells nor the ciliary length. Future investigations should assess the effects of depletion of CCDC120 or CCDC68 on ciliary position and signal sensing.</p>
      <p>Similar to CEP170 and Ninein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, CCDC120 and CCDC68 are required for microtubule anchoring at centrosomes. Our preliminary data did not show any microtubule-binding activity of CCDC120 or CCDC68; therefore, CCDC120 may indirectly regulate microtubule organization through hNinein and CEP170, while the functions of CCDC68 in microtubule anchoring are mainly mediated by CEP170. Furthermore, loss of CCDC120 or/and CCDC68 also affected microtubule nucleation at the early stage of microtubule regrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>, 1âmin), indicating that CCDC120 and CCDC68 may also be involved in microtubule nucleation processing. Consistently, depletion of microtubule-anchoring proteins such as EB1, Kif3a and p150<sup>Glued</sup> delays microtubule nucleation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, suggesting a close relationship between microtubule nucleation and anchoring.</p>
