      <abstract>
        <p>Cellular senescence-inhibited gene (CSIG) protein, a nucleolar protein with a ribosomal L1 domain in its N-terminus, can exert non-ribosomal functions to regulate biological processes, such as cellular senescence. Here, we describe a previously unknown function for CSIG: promotion of apoptosis in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-induced CSIG upregulation. We identified p33ING1 as a binding partner that interacts with CSIG. After UV irradiation, p33ING1 increases its protein expression, translocates into the nucleolus and binds CSIG. p33ING1 requires its nucleolar targeting sequence region to interact with CSIG and enhance CSIG protein stability, which is essential for activation of downstream effectors, Bcl-2-associated X protein, to promote apoptosis. Thus, our data imply that p33ING1âCSIG axis functions as a novel pro-apoptotic regulator in response to DNA damage.</p>

    <p>The nucleolus is the site for rRNA synthesis and ribosome assembly in the cell. Recent studies showed that the nucleolus has emerged as a highly complex and multifunctional regulatory compartment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> The nucleolus is an extremely sensitive structure to monitor; it responds to cellular apoptotic stresses such as radiation, or exposure to cytotoxic agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Nucleolar proteins such as nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), nucleostemin, L11, Net1 and ARF (alternate reading frame product of the CDKN2A locus) have important roles in these non-ribosomal functions, including regulation of cell growth and death, stress responses, mitosis and the cell cycle; we are only just beginning to understand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Cellular senescence-inhibited gene (CSIG) protein (RSL1D1/PBK1/L12) is a protein first cloned by several labs including ours. It is a nucleolar protein that has a ribosomal L1 domain in its N-terminus and a lysine-rich domain in its C-terminus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> This protein can delay cellular senescence through inhibition of phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) translation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> It also can regulate the nucleolar localization of nucleostemin through physical interaction by its C-terminus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Whether CSIG can modulate response to pro-apoptotic stimuli is currently unknown.</p>
    <p>Protein complex shuttles between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm are important for many non-ribosomal processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Protein movement is mostly out of, rather than into, the nucleolus in response to DNA damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Few proteins seem to be targeted to the nucleoli after damage; the known examples include p33ING1, RelA, DEDD, heat-shock protein-70 (Hsp70) and PML, which migrate from the nucleoplasm or cytoplasm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> The p33ING1 tumor suppressor has been reported to be downregulated in breast, gastric and lymphoid tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> p33ING1 promotes apoptosis, and its movement to the nucleolus increases apoptosis after ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> p33ING1 possesses a nucleolar targeting sequence (NTS); mutation in this sequence was found to reduce p33ING1 apoptotic function after UV treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> ARF protein, which localizes predominantly in the nucleolus, physically associates with p33ING1 and causes cell-cycle arrest in the absence of UV stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> However, ARF moves from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in response to UV â in a direction opposite to p33ING1 movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Why p33ING1 protein targets the nucleolus to promote apoptosis in response to UV has been unclear.</p>
    <p>Here, we report that increased protein expression of CSIG sensitizes cells to UV irradiation-induced apoptosis. p33ING1 targets the nucleolus and stabilizes CSIG protein after UV irradiation. We show here that p33ING1 needs its NTSs to interact with CSIG, which is required for CSIG protein stabilization and p33ING1-dependent apoptosis after UV stress. Also, knocking down CSIG expression decreases p33ING1-dependent apoptosis after UV irradiation. Our results provide a new possible molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of apoptosis after UV irradiation.</p>

        <title>CSIG promotes UV irradiation-induced apoptosis</title>
        <p>Many nucleolar proteins respond to DNA damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> To examine whether CSIG affects the ability of cells to undergo apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress, we initially analyzed CSIG expression levels after DNA damage. When HEK293 cells were treated with UV, etoposide, low and high concentrations of cisplatin and doxorubicin to induce genotoxic stress, the cells significantly upregulated CSIG after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To further investigate a possible role for CSIG in UV-induced apoptosis, we transfected HEK293 cells with a control vector or a plasmid expressing wild-type CSIG and subjected the cells to UV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Apoptosis was shown by Annexin-V and PI double staining; percentage of the sub-G1 fraction by FACS analysis; and chromatin condensation by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. The results showed that overexpression of CSIG did not induce apoptosis in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, after UV treatment, CSIG increased the population of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>). Overexpression of CSIG also increased the population of apoptotic cells after doxorubicin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Cell-cycle profiles of the cells were also shown; overexpression of CSIG slightly decreased G<sub>1</sub>-phase percentage and increased S-phase and G<sub>2</sub>/M-phase cell numbers, but there was no significant difference compared with controls, both in non-UV and UV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c and d</xref>).</p>

        <title>Ultraviolet irradiation can induce both CSIG and p33ING1 protein expressions</title>
        <p>We found that CSIG protein induction after UV is independent of p53 status (data not shown). So there may be other proteins participating in this process. p33ING1 is a putative tumor suppressor, which promotes apoptosis in a p53-dependent or -independent manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Ultraviolet irradiation targets p33ING1 to the nucleolus to promote apoptosis; CSIG primarily localizes in the nucleolus, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and CSIG increased UV-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To determine if there is a functional relationship of CSIG with p33ING1 in UV-induced apoptosis, their cellular localizations and expression patterns were examined.</p>
        <p>Subcellular distributions of CSIG and p33ING1 were determined by high-resolution confocal analyses. The results showed that CSIG protein localized predominantly in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> upper panel). Endogenous p33ING1 was mostly distributed in the nucleus without treatment and gathered within the nucleolus after UV irradiation. Ectopically expressed p33ING1 increased its distribution both in the nucleus and in the nucleolus without UV irradiation; after UV irradiation, the exogenous p33ING1 gathered within the nucleolus. To a great extent, CSIG colocalized with both endogenous and exogenous p33ING1 protein in the nucleolus after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> lower panel). These data suggest a physiological connection between CSIG and p33ING1 after UV irradiation.</p>
        <p>Previous studies reported that p33ING1 increases the protein expression after DNA damage in some cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Also, CSIG protein levels upregulate after DNA damage treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). So, we analyzed whether UV irradiation could induce p33ING1 and CSIG protein expressions in cell lines with different p53 status. Results showed CSIG and p33ING1 to be simultaneously induced after UV irradiation in HEK293 (p53 deregulation), HeLa (p53 deficient), HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> (p53 wild-type) and HCT116 p53<sup>â/â</sup> (p53 null), but not RKO (p53 wild-type) and RKO-E6 (p53 deficient), cells. These results indicated that UV induced CSIG and p33ING1 expressions, which were p53 independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In addition to UV irradiation, p33ING1 and CSIG were simultaneously induced by the DNA damage treatments, including high concentration of cisplatin, etoposide and doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further study the protein expression profile of CSIG and p33ING1 after UV irradiation, we analyzed CSIG and p33ING1 expressions at different time points after UV irradiation. The results indicated that the expression pattern of p33ING1 paralleled CSIG after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The CSIG and p33ING1 protein expressions were rapidly induced in as early as 2âh after UV irradiation, reached their peak at 8â10âh and declined 12âh later. To determine whether the same kinetics of CSIG and p33ING1 after UV treatment was due to cell-cycle arrest, expressions of cyclin A, cyclin B and cyclin D1, which indicated different cell-cycle phase, were also detected. The results showed that the induction of CSIG and p33ING1 levels after UV treatment was not consistent with any phase of cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>

        <title>p33ING1 inhibits CSIG protein degradation after UV irradiation</title>
        <p>To directly determine the correlation of CSIG and p33ING1 upregulation after UV irradiation, HEK293 cells were transfected with CSIG or p33ING1 plasmids, and then subjected to UV irradiation. Protein levels of CSIG under the condition of p33ING1 overexpression were examined, and vice versa. Western blot analysis showed that p33ING1 induced endogenous CSIG expression, and the induction of CSIG remained for at least 24âh after UV radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>), while CSIG overexpression was unable to increase p33ING1 levels after UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To examine whether CSIG protein induction by p33ING1 after UV irradiation was due to increased CSIG transcription, CSIG mRNA levels were probed. Under the same conditions as the p33ING1 transfection, in which CSIG protein was significantly induced, CSIG mRNA levels just slightly increased (data not shown), indicating that p33ING1 may affect CSIG protein levels through other mechanisms. To examine whether induction of CSIG by p33ING1 was due to increased CSIG protein stability, we treated cells with proteasome inhibitor MG-132; adding MG-132 led to increased CSIG protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Also, p33 increased CSIG protein by reducing its ubiquitination after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We performed CSIG half-life assays in control and p33ING1-overexpression cells. After UV radiation, endogenous CSIG appeared to be unstable after 10âh of chasing in control cells (t1/2=16.9âh). However, in the presence of p33ING1 overexpression, CSIG protein became more stable and its protein level appeared to be unstable after 18âh of chasing (t1/2=20.5âh) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3b</xref>). We also examined the half-life of CSIG protein in control small interfering RNA (siRNA)- and p33ING1-specific siRNA-transfected cells after UV irradiation. Knocking down p33ING1 protein destabilized CSIG protein after UV treatment; endogenous CSIG appeared to be unstable after 5âh of chasing in p33 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p>

        <title>p33ING1 interacts with CSIG</title>
        <p>p33ING1 can stabilize p53 levels through interaction with it in different cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Having shown that p33ING1 increases CSIG protein stability and that they colocalized subcellularly in the nucleolus after UV irradiation, we investigated whether p33ING1 interacts with CSIG to stabilize its protein level.</p>
        <p><italic>In vitro</italic> pull-down assays using purified GST fusion proteins revealed a specific interaction between GSTâCSIG and <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated p33ING1, suggesting a direct CSIGâp33ING1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The association between these two proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> was studied by immunoprecipitation (IP), followed by western blotting. Using total protein extracts from cells transfected with p33ING1 construct, a specific antibody against CSIG used in IP, we were able to detect both CSIG and p33ING1 in the immunocomplex. The interaction was specific, as shown by the use of a non-related serum. The association could also be observed in a reverse experiment, using the anti-p33ING1 IP antibody, indicating that the two proteins can associate in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Similar results were obtained using H1299 cells (data not shown). To confirm whether the observed interaction occurred between the endogenous proteins, we carried out IP experiments in untransfected 2BS cells. Using nuclear or cytoplasm protein extracts, a specific antibody against CSIG was used for IP. Western blotting revealed a specific band comigrating with p33ING1 in the CSIG immunoprecipitate of nuclear protein extracts, indicative of interaction between the endogenous p33ING1 and CSIG proteins in the nucleus. We did not detect another nucleolus protein, ARF, which reportedly mediates nucleolar localization of p33ING1 in the p33ING1/CSIG complex under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). After UV irradiation, the association between p33ING1 and CSIG increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Together, the data indicate that CSIG interacts physically with p33ING1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>The p33ING1 NTS region is required for binding and stabilizing the CSIG protein</title>
        <p>After establishing that p33ING1 and CSIG coexist in the same complex, we investigated which domains are involved in the p33ING1âCSIG interaction. We constructed deletion mutants of both proteins, expressed them in HEK293 cells and tested their binding using Co-IP. FLAG-tagged CSIG (amino acids 1â490), CSIG-NT (amino acids 1â275) or CSIG-CT (amino acids 261â490) was expressed in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. Western blotting revealed that p33ING1 associates with FLAG-CSIG and FLAG-CSIG-CT. FLAG-tagged CSIG-NT did not associate significantly with p33ING1. The association could also be observed in a reverse experiment, using the anti-p33ING1 antibody for IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). On the other hand, FLAG-tagged p33 (amino acids 1â279), p33-NT (amino acids 1â212) and p33-CT (amino acids 70â279) were expressed in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. Western blotting revealed that both p33ING1 deletion mutants were able to interact with CSIG; the association could also be observed in a reverse experiment, using the anti-CSIG antibody for IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). This interaction region of p33ING1 compassed the lamin interaction domain and nuclear localization signal (NLS).</p>
        <p>Reportedly, p33ING1 possess two distinct four amino-acid sequences in its NTS within the NLS region, directing the protein to the nucleolus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> We have shown that CSIG and p33ING1 colocalized in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). To examine whether the NTS region of p33ING1 is necessary for binding CSIG, we constructed point mutations or deletion mutant of the NTS regions in p33ING1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), and then investigated their nucleolar localization and interaction with CSIG. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, the p33/Q153P, p33/Q153P/K185N/K186E and p33Î142â194 mutants of the NTS region were impaired in their ability to target p33ING1 to the nucleolus. Through IP of CSIG from cells expressing wild-type p33, p33/Q153P, p33/Q153P/K185N/K186E and deletion mutant p33Î142â194, we found that wild-type p33 coimmunoprecipitated to a larger extent with CSIG than did the two mutants p33/Q153P and p33/Q153P/K185N/K186E, and the deletion mutant of NTS region p33Î142â194 completely abolished binding between p33ING1 and CSIG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). These results demonstrate that the nucleolus targeting domain of p33ING1 is essential for binding the CSIG protein C-terminus.</p>
        <p>We next investigated whether p33ING1 needs this region to increase CSIG protein stability after UV irradiation. We found that wild-type p33ING1 increased CSIG protein stability after UV irradiation; this effect was abolished when the p33Î142â194 deletion mutant was transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).</p>

        <title>p33ING1 requires CSIG protein to increase apoptosis after UV irradiation</title>
        <p>Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and HSP70, which regulate apoptosis, have been identified as direct downstream targets of p33ING1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> We previously reported that CSIG could regulate PTEN protein translation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> To determine whether CSIG is required for p33ING1 function after UV irradiation, HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type p33, p33/Q153, p33/Q153/K185N/K186E or deletion mutant p33Î142â194, and the expression levels of CSIG and their target genes were examined after UV treatment. p33ING1 overexpression increased CSIG protein level and elevated its downstream target Bax expression after UV radiation, while HSP70 and PTEN expression did not greatly change. Compared with the effects of wild-type p33ING1, overexpression of CSIG-binding defective mutants p33/Q153, p33/Q153/K185N/K186E and particularly the deletion mutant p33Î142â194 reduced the elevation of CSIG and Bax expressions, while HSP70 and PTEN expressions did not change much (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Similar results have been obtained using HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4a</xref>). Bax induced the release of apoptotic stimulators, such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to the cytoplasm, constituting a critical step in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. As wide-type p33, but not p33Î142â194 mutant, induced CSIG and Bax expressions, we next determined the effects of p33 and p33Î142â194 on Bax-dependent apoptosis in mitochondria after UV irradiation. The results showed that p33, but not the p33Î142â194 mutant, induced Bax expression and distribution on the mitochondria, which coincides with the increased translocation of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to the cytoplasm compared with control vector after UV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Consistent with these results, overexpression of p33ING1 enhanced UV-induced apoptosis, as shown by cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Annexin-V and PI double staining. Again, these effects were reduced by expression of p33ING1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7b and c</xref>). Thus, p33ING1 requires its NTS sequence to interact with CSIG, increase CSIG protein stability and activate target gene Bax after UV irradiation.</p>
        <p>To directly determine whether p33ING1 requires CSIG protein to activate target gene and promote apoptosis after UV irradiation, HEK293 cells were transfected with vectors expressing p33ING1 and CSIG, or CSIG-specific siRNA, alone or in combination, followed by UV irradiation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, CSIG overexpression increased Bax expression. Overexpression of p33ING1 increased CSIG level and the target gene Bax expression to an extent that was comparable with cotransfection with CSIG. Knocking down CSIG protein significantly reduced activation of Bax by p33ING1 introduction, suggesting that CSIG is essential for p33ING1 signaling. Moreover, CSIG and p33ING1 overexpression did not change HSP70 and PTEN expressions. Similar results have been obtained using HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4b</xref>). To further determine the effect of knocking down CSIG on Bax-dependent apoptosis in mitochondria induced by p33ING1, we examined the mitochondrial distribution of Bax and release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to the cytoplasm after UV. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>, knocking down CSIG decreased induction of mitochondrial Bax expression and translocation of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to the cytoplasm by p33 introduction.</p>
        <p>Consistent with these results, overexpression of p33ING1 and CSIG enhanced UV-induced apoptosis, as determined by cleaved caspase 3, cleaved PARP, and Annexin-V and PI double staining. Apoptosis analysis by cotransfection of p33ING1 and CSIG was comparable to transfection with p33ING1 or CSIG alone, while knocking down CSIG protein abrogated the effect of p33ING1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7d and f</xref>). Overexpression of p33ING1 did not increase CSIG protein stability and apoptosis markedly without UV treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that p33ING1âCSIG functions in UV-induced apoptosis and CSIG is required for p33ING1 signaling after UV irradiation.</p>

        <title>The p33ING1âCSIG axis functions in differential apoptotic responses of the young and old 2BS cells after UV irradiation</title>
        <p>We previously showed that in human diploid 2BS fibroblasts, senescent fibroblasts are more resistant than young fibroblasts to apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Here, we showed that young 2BS cells were more sensitive than senescent cells to UV-induced apoptosis, as shown by cleavage of PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Based on the above results, we hypothesized that the p33ING1âCSIG axis has a role in differential apoptotic responses of 2BS cells during replicative senescence. To study this possibility, expressions of CSIG and p33ING1 in early passage (young, â¼20 population doublings (pdl)) and late-passage (senescent, â¼60 pdl) 2BS cells were examined by western blot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, compared with early passage 2BS cells (young, Y), we found CSIG and p33ING1 levels in late-passage 2BS cells (senescent, S) were significantly reduced. Expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> is an indication of 2BS cells undergoing replicative senescence. We then analyzed the expression and cellular localization of CSIG and p33ING1 in young and senescent 2BS cells after UV irradiation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, CSIG and p33ING1 protein increased within 6âh and remained at relatively high levels after UV irradiation in young 2BS cells, while in senescent 2BS cells, CSIG and p33ING1 levels decreased after UV. Using immunocytochemistry, we found that after UV irradiation, p33ING1 colocalized extensively with CSIG to the nucleolus in young 2BS cells; however, in senescent 2BS cells, the expression levels and the nucleolar colocalization of p33ING1 and CSIG decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). p33ING1 facilitated UV-induced apoptosis, while knockdown CSIG expression reversed the effects of p33ING1 in 2BS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). These results suggest the p33ING1âCSIG axis may have a role in differential apoptotic responses of the young and old 2BS cells after UV irradiation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>There is now a compelling body of evidence showing that, in addition to ribogenesis pathway, nucleolar proteins have important roles in regulating cell-cycle transition, cell proliferation and apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> We set out to determine if nucleolar protein CSIG is involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and found, for the first time, that CSIG is induced after UV irradiation and overexpression of CSIG increases apoptotic cells. Although CSIG does not induce apoptosis in the absence of DNA damage, it promotes apoptosis after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Ultraviolet irradiation produces DNA lesions that perturb DNA metabolism, activating some proteins that regulate cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. High-level damage can overwhelm the ability of the repair mechanism to remove lesion such as 6â4PPs, and it may lead to cell-cycle arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase, which often precedes the onset of apoptosis. Inability to repair replication-induced damage over time triggers apoptosis. We showed here that CSIG could slightly decrease G1-phase cells, and increase S-phase and G2/M-phase cells, after UV irradiation; however, there was no significant difference compared with control. These results suggest that CSIG's function after UV irradiation relates to apoptosis rather than cell-cycle control.</p>
      <p>The most common isoform of ING1 is p33ING1; agents that damage DNA could increase p33ING1 expression in certain cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Although p33ING1 and p53 have a functional relevance in certain biological process,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> there are studies showing p33ING1 could exert a p53-independent function in apoptosis or cell growth inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> A previous investigation reported that UV stress could translocate the p33ING1 protein from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus though two distinct four amino-acid sequences in NTS region; this translocation of p33ING1 is essential for UV-induced apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> However, the mechanism by which the nucleolar targeting of p33ING1 promotes apoptosis is not clear.</p>
      <p>We found that the proteins p33ING1 and CSIG are highly colocalized in the nucleolus after UV stress, and p33ING1 expression induction corresponds with nucleolar protein CSIG after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). More importantly, the NTS region of p33ING1 is required to bind and increase CSIG protein stability, which in turn is essential for p33-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). We show here that CSIG is necessary for the p33ING1 pro-apoptosis function. Expression of the p33ING1 downstream target gene, <italic>Bax</italic>, is controlled by CSIG in UV-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
      <p>After DNA damage, some nucleolar proteins can regulate p53-dependent apoptosis through inhibition of Mdm2, enhancing p53 translation and enhancing p53 translocation to mitochondria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Therefore, a possible mechanism of regulatory Bax expression by CSIG could be activation of p53 leading to Bax activation after UV treatment. Some other nucleolar proteins have pro-apoptotic functions involving regulation of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase activity or cell surface receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> A subset of nucleolar proteins can directly control gene transcription or functionally modulate transcriptional regulators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Reportedly, CSIG upregulates the <italic>uPA</italic> (urokinase-type plasminogen activator) gene transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> The p33ING1 protein is a stoichiometric component of HAT and HDAC complexes, and p33ING1 can regulate gene transcription through recognition of H3K4me3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Therefore, it is also possible that CSIG may by itself or cooperate with p33ING1 to regulate target gene expression, and after UV irradiation, the regulatory functions of CSIG or p33ING1âCSIG on downstream targets may be enhanced. There are several possible regulatory mechanisms of this process and further studies will be required to elucidate the possibilities.</p>
      <p>The above observations led us to propose a model for the pro-apoptotic function of p33ING1âCSIG axis after UV irradiation. This model is also supported by our findings in human diploid 2BS fibroblasts, in which p33ING1âCSIG axis may function in differential apoptotic responses of the young and senescent 2BS cells after UV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In summary, our study establishes a novel pro-apoptosis function of CSIG and its relationship with p33ING1 after UV irradiation.</p>
