        <p>The noncatalytic RabGAP protein TBC1D14 regulates the Rab11- and ULK1-positive recycling endosomes required for autophagosome formation upon starvation</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Autophagy is a bulk degradation process characterized by the formation of double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. The exact molecular mechanism of autophagosome formation and the origin of the autophagosomal membrane remain unclear. We screened 38 human Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 domainâcontaining Rab guanosine triphosphataseâactivating proteins (GAPs) and identified 11 negative regulators of starvation-induced autophagy. One of these putative RabGAPs, TBC1D14, colocalizes and interacts with the autophagy kinase ULK1. Overexpressed TBC1D14 tubulates ULK1-positive recycling endosomes (REs), impairing their function and inhibiting autophagosome formation. TBC1D14 binds activated Rab11 but is not a GAP for Rab11, and loss of Rab11 prevents TBC1D14-induced tubulation of REs. Furthermore, Rab11 is required for autophagosome formation. ULK1 and Atg9 are found on Rab11- and transferrin (Tfn) receptor (TfnR)âpositive recycling endosomes. Amino acid starvation causes TBC1D14 to relocalize from REs to the Golgi complex, whereas TfnR and Tfn localize to forming autophagosomes, which are ULK1 and LC3 positive. Thus, TBC1D14- and Rab11-dependent vesicular transport from REs contributes to and regulates starvation-induced autophagy.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Macroautophagy (here referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved degradative process discovered in yeast as a response to starvation but now recognized in multicellular organisms as a response to a wide range of pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizushima et al., 2008</xref>). In mammalian cells, the autophagosome, a double-membrane vesicle, arises from a phagophore or isolation membrane; a subset of Atg (autophagy related) proteins localize here and work together to expand it. During expansion, the autophagosome encloses portions of cytoplasm that are targeted for degradation by fusion with endosomes and lysosomes, completing the process of autophagy.</p><p>Among the set of phagophore-localized early autophagy proteins is the ULK1/2 kinase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan and Tooze, 2009</xref>). The activity of ULK1/2 is regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin, a key nutrient sensor that, under normal growth conditions, inhibits autophagy by repressing ULK1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2010</xref>). The ULK1/2 complex, together with a class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase complex that generates the autophagy-specific phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate pool, is the key initiator of phagophore formation and expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>). After the action of these Atg complexes, two ubiquitin-like conjugates, Atg5-12-16 and phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3 (LC3-II), are sequentially recruited to the phagophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itakura and Mizushima, 2010</xref>). LC3-II associates with autophagosome membranes and is used as a marker for autophagosomes.</p><p>Many questions remain about autophagosome initiation and formation, the origin of the membrane, and phagophore expansion. The membrane trafficking events involved in autophagosome biogenesis are complex, poorly understood, and likely influenced by the conditions used to induce autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Longatti and Tooze, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Intracellular membrane trafficking events are regulated by the Rab family of small monomeric GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). In their GTP-bound form, Rab proteins recruit effectors to regulate vesicle trafficking. The Rab proteins involved in starvation-induced autophagosome formation remain relatively unexplored. Rab1a has been shown to be involved in antibacterial autophagosome formation, and Rab1a and Rab5 are involved in the removal of aggregated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Winslow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). Several Rab GTPases have also been implicated in autophagosomeâlysosome fusion during starvation-induced autophagy: The best characterized is Rab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gutierrez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">JÃ¤ger et al., 2004</xref>); Rab33b has been shown to be required for autophagosome maturation, and its activity has been shown to be regulated by OATL1 (TBC1D25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itoh et al., 2011</xref>); and in K562 cells, Rab11 is required for autophagosomeâmultivesicular body fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fader et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Rab GTPase activity is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). At least 38 putative RabGAPs have been identified in humans through the presence of a Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>), which contains two conserved catalytic residues, an arginine and a glutamine, that promote GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr and Lambright, 2010</xref>). Overexpression of a RabGAP can inactivate its target Rab and disrupt the trafficking step mediated by the Rab GTPase. We undertook an overexpression screen testing 38 TBC domain proteins for inhibition of LC3-II formation to identify Rab proteins involved in starvation-induced autophagosome formation. Our candidate RabGAPs were further screened by testing their ability to colocalize with ULK1, the rationale being to identify Rabs acting in early formation events. Reflecting the complexity of autophagosome formation, we identified 11 RabGAPs that inhibit autophagy when overexpressed. One of these, TBC1D14, binds ULK1 and Rab11 and disrupts recycling endosome (RE) traffic. We show that REs contain two early acting autophagy proteins, ULK1 and mAtg9, and that TBC1D14 and Rab11, in a starvation-dependent mechanism, control the transport of membrane from ULK1- and transferrin (Tfn)-positive REs to forming LC3-positive autophagosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>A RabGAP overexpression screen identifies negative regulators of autophagy</title><p>We screened a library of 38 TBC domainâcontaining proteins, predicted to be RabGAPs, for their ability to inhibit autophagosome formation when overexpressed in HEK293A cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 (2GL9 cells). To measure autophagosome formation, we assayed GFPâLC3-II accumulation after a 2-h starvation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). We included the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin in the Earleâs balanced saline solution (EBSS) starvation medium, which prevented GFPâLC3-II degradation in the lysosome, thus excluding the detection of RabGAPs that are involved in autophagosome maturation. We considered a 40% or more reduction in GFPâLC3-II as a strong inhibition: 11 RabGAPs were chosen based on this cutoff. To test whether GAP activity, and therefore Rab inactivation, was necessary for inhibition of autophagosome formation, we tested whether mutation of the catalytic arginine to alanine (RA mutant) within the TBC domain would abolish this inhibition. An arginine fitting the consensus site was identified in silico for 8 of the 11 RabGAPs, and these mutants were analyzed using GFP-LC3 lipidation. Indeed, we found that seven out of the eight RA mutants tested did not inhibit autophagosome formation to the same extent as the wild-type (WT) protein when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>A screen of 38 human RabGAPs reveals that 11 inhibit autophagy.</bold> (A) An overexpression screen for RabGAPs, which are autophagy inhibitors. 38 myc-TBC domainâcontaining proteins were expressed in 2GL9 cells for 24 h, and then, cells were fed or starved in EBSS with leupeptin (leu) for 2 h. GFPâLC3-II was quantified by the Odyssey system with antibodies against LC3, actin, and myc. Black bars show levels of GFPâLC3-II after starvation normalized to the renilla vector control.

We chose to examine colocalization of the overexpressed RabGAPs with endogenous ULK1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201111079/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1</ext-link>), which is present on early autophagosomes. We found that of the RabGAPs tested, overexpressed TBC1D14 colocalizes extensively with ULK1: GFP-TBC1D14WT, RA, and RAQA mutants form tubular structures in the cytosol and recruit ULK1 to subdomains of these tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, Fig. S1, and not depicted). Approximately 35.3 (Â± 4.3)% of WT TBC1D14 colocalizes with endogenous ULK1. A small number of TBC1D14 tubules also contain low levels of LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

In HEK293A cells, we could detect an interaction between the TBC domain of TBC1D14 and HA-ULK1 by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. S2, C and D). We were unable to coprecipitate the endogenous proteins possibly because the interaction is weak or the available antibodies have low affinity. TBC1D14 binds to full-length ULK1 but not the N-terminal 1â429 aa or the C-terminal domain (828â1,051 aa), suggesting the binding site is in the spacer domain (429â828 aa) of ULK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). The interaction between ULK1 and TBC1D14 was mapped to residues 224â330 in the TBC domain of TBC1D14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>; and Fig. S2 D).</p></sec><sec><title>TBC1D14 is a negative regulator of starvation-induced autophagy</title><p>Nonselective long-lived protein degradation (LLPD) of [<sup>14</sup>C]valine-labeled proteins is a measure of autophagic flux.

As the single mutant R472A (TBC1D14RA) also inhibited GFP-LC3 lipidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), we mutated the second catalytic residue, glutamine 508, to alanine creating the TBC1D14R472A/Q508A (RAQA) mutant. Surprisingly, expression of TBC1D14RAQA inhibited LLPD to the same extent as WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). We asked whether the degradation of p62, a well-characterized selective autophagic cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>), was inhibited by overexpression of WT or the RAQA mutant of TBC1D14 but saw no effect on loss of p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). However, although WT TBC1D14 inhibited the formation of endogenous LC3-II in starvation and in the presence of leupeptin, the TBC1D14RAQA mutant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The level of autophagic inhibition was also assayed using tandem fluorescent-tagged (mRFP-GFP) LC3-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>).

Conversely, p62 is a selective autophagic substrate, and the lack of effect of TBC1D14 overexpression on p62 suggests that p62 recruitment to LC3-II is independent of TBC1D14 function. In the presence of TBC1D14, oligomeric p62 may be efficiently recruited to the phagophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itakura and Mizushima, 2011</xref>), although this remains to be tested.</p><p>If TBC1D14 negatively regulates autophagy, loss of TBC1D14 should increase autophagy. Therefore, we depleted TBC1D14 with two different siRNAs and measured endogenous LC3 lipidation induced by starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref> and Fig. S2 E). In cells in which TBC1D14 levels are substantially reduced, LC3 lipidation and turnover during starvation increase significantly. TBC1D14-depleted cells showed little increase in LC3 lipidation in fed conditions, suggesting that the inhibitory role of TBC1D14 is confined to starvation-induced autophagy. This is supported by the lack of effect of TBC1D14 overexpression on the distribution of endosome and lysosome markers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201111079/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S3</ext-link>), which when perturbed can inhibit both basal- and starvation-induced autophagic flux.</p></sec><sec><title>TBC1D14 binds to Rab11, which acts as a positive regulator of autophagy</title><p>To our knowledge, the target Rab GTPase for TBC1D14 remains unknown.

The exact mechanism of membrane tubulation caused by the overexpressed TBC1D14 remains to be elucidated but requires Rab11.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for role of TBC1D14 and Rab11 mediating vesicular transport from the RE to the expanding phagophore.</bold> Under fed conditions, Rab11-positive REs function in recycling to the plasma membrane. Upon amino acid starvation, Rab11 mediates vesicle formation from the RE directed to forming autophagosomes. This process is negatively regulated by TBC1D14, which functions as an effector for Rab11. TBC1D14 dissociates from Rab11-positive REs in starvation and accumulates on the Golgi complex. Overexpression of TBC1D14 causes tubulation of REs, accumulation of the ULK1 complex and Rab11 on REs, and inhibition of vesicular transport from the RE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201111079_Fig10"/></fig><p>We propose a population of ULK1 and mAtg9 resides on REs in normal conditions, and upon nutrient starvation, the ULK1âTfnR-positive REs contribute to the forming autophagosome. Our results show that overexpression of TBC1D14 tubulates REs and sequesters the ULK1 complex and TfnR, thus inhibiting autophagosome formation. Rab11 on REs is required for autophagosome formation, and we predict that Rab11 performs the function of targeting the REs to the growing autophagosome. Although we cannot exclude Rab11 inactivation as the principal mechanism of autophagy inhibition by overexpressed TBC1D14, we propose that TBC1D14 may function as a non-GAP effector for Rab11. This would be similar to the interaction between RUTCB1 and Rab9a: RUTCB1 binds Rab9a and alters Rab9-dependent processes but does not function as a Rab9a GAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nottingham et al., 2011</xref>). However, mAtg9 trafficking may also be disturbed, as its RE localization is decreased on TBC1D14 overexpression (unpublished data), and this could result in an inhibition of autophagy. During nutrient starvation, although ULK1 remains with the RE, mAtg9 moves away from REs and may be involved in transport of other membranes, such as the Golgi, to the growing autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohashi and Munro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van der Vaart et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>TBC1D14 was identified in an overexpression screen in which we tested 38 putative human RabGAPs for their effect on autophagy. Out of these, 11 RabGAPs inhibited autophagy by 40% or more, highlighting autophagosome formation as a complex, multistep process that may well require the activity of several Rab proteins. Within the group of 11 RabGAPs classified as having a substantial effect on LC3 lipidation, the Rab target of some of these has been shown to have a role in autophagy. Recently, 14 RabGAPs were identified as LC3-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Popovic et al., 2012</xref>), and out of these 14, we identified seven as being inhibitors of GFP-LC3 lipidation, including TBC1D17, shown to bind Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Itoh et al., 2006</xref>). We also identified RUTBC1/SGSM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), which binds Rab9a and was shown to be a GAP for Rab32 and Rab33b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nottingham et al., 2011</xref>), both have been implicated in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Itoh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirota and Tanaka, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that TBC1D14 acts in the TfnRâRab11 recycling pathway, and our data strongly support the hypothesis that TBC1D14 acts as a Rab11 effector. Overexpression of TBC1D14 may sequester Rab11 or downstream effectors, thus inhibiting vesicular transport from the RE and autophagosome formation. In support of this, we have shown that a DN mutant of Rab11 inhibits autophagy. Although we have not yet identified any other Rab targets for TBC1D14, TBC1D14 may be recruited by active Rab11 to act on another Rab immediately upstream as part of a Rab cascade. In yeast, the Rab Ypt32 recruits the RabGAP Gyp1 to inactivate the upstream Rab Ypt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rivera-Molina and Novick, 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, in the same Rab cascade, Trs85, a subunit of the novel Ypt1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor TRAPPIII (transport protein particle III), is recruited to the yeast phagophore assembly site, allowing it and Ypt1 to function in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lynch-Day et al., 2010</xref>). Rab11 is proposed to be the mammalian orthologue of Ypt32, whereas Ypt1 is thought to be the orthologue of Rab1. Thus, our future studies on the role of TBC1D14 in autophagy will encompass an examination of its effect on the TRAPPIII complex and the function of Rab11 and Rab1a.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Constructs</title><p>HA-tagged ULK1 was generated by amplifying human ULK1 by PCR from a full-length IMAGE (Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression) clone (ID 40080552) containing human ULK1 using 5â²-GGCCGGATCCÂ­GCCACCATGGAÂ­GTACCCATACGÂ­ACGTACCAGATÂ­TACGCTGGCGCÂ­CATGGAGCCCGÂ­GCCGCGGCGGC-3â² and 5â²-GGCCGAATTCÂ­TCAGGCACAGAÂ­TGCCAGTCAGC-3â² and inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). 38 human RabGAP constructs were myc-tagged and cloned into pcDNA3.1 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>).
