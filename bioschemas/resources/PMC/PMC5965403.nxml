        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Perrault syndrome (PS) is a rare recessive disorder characterized by ovarian dysgenesis
and sensorineural deafness. It is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and previously
mutations have been described in different genes, mostly related to mitochondrial
proteostasis. We diagnosed three unrelated females with PS and set out to identify the
underlying genetic cause using exome sequencing. We excluded mutations in the known PS
genes, but identified a single homozygous mutation in the <italic>ERAL1</italic> gene
(c.707Aâ&gt;âT; p.Asn236Ile). Since ERAL1 protein binds to the mitochondrial 12S rRNA and
is involved in the assembly of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, the identified
variant represented a likely candidate. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of a 3D model
for ERAL1 suggested that the mutated residue hinders protein-substrate interactions,
potentially affecting its function. On a molecular basis, PS skin fibroblasts had reduced
ERAL1 protein levels. Complexome profiling of the cells showed an overall decrease in the
levels of assembled small ribosomal subunit, indicating that the <italic>ERAL1</italic>
variant affects mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Moreover, levels of the 12S rRNA were
reduced in the patients, and were rescued by lentiviral expression of wild type ERAL1. At
the physiological level, mitochondrial respiration was markedly decreased in PS
fibroblasts, confirming disturbed mitochondrial function. Finally, knockdown of the
<italic>C. elegans ERAL1</italic> homologue <italic>E02H1.2</italic> almost completely
blocked egg production in worms, mimicking the compromised fertility in PS-affected women.
Our cross-species data in patient cells and worms support the hypothesis that mutations in
<italic>ERAL1</italic> can cause PS and are associated with changes in mitochondrial
metabolism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Perrault syndrome (PS) (MIM 233400) is a rare disorder that is inherited in an autosomal
recessive manner. It is clinically characterized by sensorineural hearing loss in both male
and female patients, while females also present with ovarian dysgenesis, which results in
amenorrhea and infertility (<xref rid="ddx152-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Some patients
also present with neurological manifestations, including ataxia, mild mental retardation and
peripheral neuropathy (<xref rid="ddx152-B2" ref-type="bibr">2â4</xref>). Because of the clinical heterogeneity, the disorder has been classified into
type I, which is static and without neurological manifestations, and type II that includes
progressive neurological symptoms (<xref rid="ddx152-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
      <p>The clinical heterogeneity of PS may partly be due to its genetic heterogeneity; to date,
mutations in five different genes have been identified as disease-causing in different cases
of PS. The first mutations were reported in <italic>HSD17B4</italic>, a gene encoding a
peroxisomal enzyme involved in fatty acid Î²-oxidation and steroid metabolism (<xref rid="ddx152-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Later on, mutations in two genes encoding the
mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases HARS2 and LARS2 (<xref rid="ddx152-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ddx152-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) were identified,
which are components of the mitochondrial translation machinery. Finally, two more genes
encoding mitochondrial proteinsâthe peptidase CLPP involved in mitochondrial protein
homeostasis (<xref rid="ddx152-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ddx152-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and the helicase Twinkle that is required for mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) maintenance (<xref rid="ddx152-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)âwere found mutated in
some PS patients. Altogether, four out of five PS causing genes are involved in
mitochondrial gene expression and proteostasis, suggesting that mitochondria play a critical
role in the development of the disease.</p>
      <p>Here, we report a homozygous c.707Aâ&gt;âT (p.Asn236Ile) missense mutation in the
<italic>ERAL1</italic> gene (NM_005702.2) identified by exome sequencing in two unrelated
patients, and found a third PS patient with the same variant during the course of our study.
The human ERAL1 protein (UniProtKB O75616) has been described as an rRNA chaperone
indispensable for the assembly of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (<xref rid="ddx152-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ddx152-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In line with this, patient skin fibroblasts and <italic>C. elegans</italic>
with knockdown of the <italic>ERAL1</italic> homologue display mitochondrial dysfunction,
strongly suggesting that the identified mutation in <italic>ERAL1</italic> is the cause of
PS in our patients.</p>

        <title>Identification of a homozygous missense mutation in the ERAL1 gene in three PS
patients</title>
        <p>Two women of Dutch ancestry, unrelated but both from the same village, presented at our
clinic with symptoms of PS. In PS patient 1 (aged 66âyears) hearing loss was diagnosed
when she was 20âyears old, but probably started much earlier and appeared to be
progressive. She had normal menarche at 11âyears of age, with irregular menses until the
age of 27, when menopause occurred. One sister also had sensorineural hearing loss and
premature ovarian failure, but did not participate in our study. PS patient 2 (aged
38âyears) was diagnosed at 4âyears of age with sensorineural hearing loss, which was more
severe in the high frequencies and slowly progressive. At the age of 18âyears she
presented with primary amenorrhea and underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed streak ovaries and a small uterus. An ovary biopsy showed
fibrous tissue without primordial follicles. Her father had sensorineural hearing loss
since childhood, but no fertility problems. Her mother and two sisters were healthy.</p>
        <p>In order to identify the underlying genetic cause for the disease, we performed whole
exome sequencing (WES), which excluded the presence of mutations in the known PS genes
<italic>HSD17B4</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>),
<italic>HARS2</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>),
<italic>LARS2</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>),
<italic>CLPP</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and
<italic>C10orf2</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Because
both patients originate from a small village, a known genetic isolate, recessive
inheritance and shared genetic cause were suspected. Subsequent filtering of all variants
found in WES for homozygous variants that were shared in both patients, and with a minor
allele frequency ofâ&lt;1% in public or in house databases yielded only one variant: a
homozygous nucleotide substitution at position c.707Aâ&gt;âT (p.Asn236Ile) in
<italic>ERAL1</italic> (NM_005702.2), a gene encoding the Era-like 12S mitochondrial
rRNA chaperone 1.</p>
        <p>The substituted residue is highly conserved in vertebrates as well as in fruit flies and
in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).
Moreover, the variant is predicted to be "probably damaging" by PolyPhen-2 (HumDiv score
1.000, HumVar score 0.992), SIFT (score 0) and MutationTaster (p-value 1). Subsequent
sequencing of family members of patient 2 showed that the healthy females are heterozygous
while the affected father is homozygous for this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The identified variant is not present in any public
database. However, from the genotyping of 530 individuals of the same village as the
patients, 49 were found heterozygous and 0 homozygous for the variant, demonstrating an
allele frequency of 4.6% in this genetic isolate. This would suggest a relatively high
prevalence (0.2%) of PS in this village. Indeed, during the course of our study a third PS
patient, presenting with progressive sensorineural hearing loss since birth and primary
amenorrhea, visited our outpatient clinic and was found to be homozygous for the same
<italic>ERAL1</italic> variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F1">Fig.
1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>ERAL1 protein is indispensable for the assembly of the small 28S subunit of the

therefore involved in the translation of mtDNA-encoded proteins. To predict <italic>in
silico</italic> whether the p.Asn236Ile variant could affect the rRNA-ERAL1 interaction,
we constructed a 3D model of the protein based on the crystal structure of the bacterial
orthologue ERA, which has been characterized in the bacterium <italic>Aquifex
aeolicus</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We performed a 3D
structural alignment between the bacterial ERA crystal and the human ERAL1 model in order
to visualize the position of the residue found mutated in our patients in comparison to
its bacterial counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, left
panel). The alignment showed that the position of the asparagine 236 (N236) in human ERAL1
corresponds to the <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> ERA asparagine 123 (N123), which has
been described to directly interact with GTP through the formation of hydrogen bonds
(<xref rid="ddx152-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, middle panel). Additionally, ERA N123 interacts with two amino acids,
valine 14 (V14) and alanine 156 (A156) (corresponding to the ERAL1 residues A124 and
A310), that are part of the loops flanking the substrate and, therefore, crucial for
maintaining the active centerâs integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F1">Fig.
1D</xref>, middle panel). Binding of ERA with GTP is necessary for its function, causing
changes in its conformation, followed by further interaction of ERA-GTP with the bacterial
16S rRNA (<xref rid="ddx152-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Substitution of the polar
amino acid asparagine with the hydrophobic isoleucine at position 236 in the human ERAL1
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, right panel) is likely to impair
interactions with GTP and the A124 and A310 residues, and predicted to disrupt protein
conformation and its interaction with the human 12S rRNA.</p>

        <title>ERAL1 protein levels and assembly of the 28S ribosomal subunit are compromised in PS
patients</title>
        <p>To test whether the sequence variant identified in our patients affects ERAL1 protein
levels, we performed a Western blot on lysates from cultured skin fibroblasts of PS
patients and control subjects. We observed that in both PS patients, ERAL1 protein levels
were decreased when compared to fibroblasts from healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F1">Fig. 1E and F</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since ERAL1 is involved in the assembly of the small 28S mitochondrial ribosomal subunit
(<xref rid="ddx152-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ddx152-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), we next investigated whether the PS patient cells showed an impaired
assembly of the 28S subunit. We assessed the abundance of assembled mitochondrial
ribosomal subunits using complexome profiling (<xref rid="ddx152-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). With this technique migration profiles and relative abundance of protein
complexes are identified using a combination of blue native electrophoresis and shotgun
proteomics. Although the migration profiles of the proteins composing the small (28S) and
large (39S) mitochondrial ribosomal subunits were similar between PS patients and controls
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F2">Fig. 2A and B</xref>), we observed a remarkable
decrease (30â40%) in the overall abundance of proteins composing the small 28S subunit in
the PS patients compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F2">Fig. 2A

was comparable between cells from PS patients and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx152-F2">Fig. 2B and D</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Three women from three different families presented with signs of PS, including deafness
and ovarian dysgenesis. We employed exome sequencing and identified a homozygous missense
mutation in the <italic>ERAL1</italic> gene, c.707Aâ&gt;âT. The mutation leads to a damaging
p.Asn236Ile substitution that is likely to interfere with the GTP binding capacity of the
ERAL1 protein. Specifically, the observation that the assembly of the small mitochondrial
ribosomal subunitâfor which ERAL1 is known to play a pivotal role (<xref rid="ddx152-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ddx152-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)âis
compromised in the PS cells, implies that the identified mutation affects the proper
function of ERAL1 protein. Importantly, the impaired 12S rRNA levels in PS fibroblasts and
their rescue upon expression of wild type ERAL1 underlines the causal link between the
mutation and mitochondrial function. Additionally, the decreased respiration that was noted
in the PS fibroblasts demonstrates disturbed mitochondrial function, confirming that the
identified mutation affects mitochondria and is pathogenic. Finally, we performed RNAi
experiments in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> to demonstrate the role of ERAL1 in
fertility. Knockdown of the worm <italic>ERAL1</italic> homologue <italic>E02H1.2</italic>
indeed impaired egg production presenting a crucial role of this protein in the nematodeâs
fecundity. Our cross-species findings on both patient fibroblasts and the model organism
<italic>C. elegans</italic> identified the <italic>ERAL1</italic> variant as the cause for
the clinical symptoms in our three PS patients.</p>
      <p>The identification of <italic>ERAL1</italic> as a causative gene for PS extends the
mutational spectrum for this disease. So far, mutations in five different genes have been
described to cause Perrault syndrome. These include the <italic>HARS2</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and <italic>LARS2</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) genes, both encoding mitochondrial tRNA
synthetases, the <italic>CLPP</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) that
codes for a protease of the mitochondrial matrix and the <italic>C10orf2</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) encoding the mitochondrial helicase Twinkle.
These findings imply that mitochondria are involved in the development of the disease.
Interestingly, recent work on <italic>CLPP</italic> deficient mice (<xref rid="ddx152-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) elegantly links ERAL1 mechanistically to CLPP by demonstrating
that removal of ERAL1 from the assembled 28S ribosomal subunit is essential for the final
maturation of the whole 55S mitochondrial ribosome, and that this removal requires CLPP. Our
identification of ERAL1 as a Perrault syndrome gene further ties CLPP and ERAL1 together, as
mutations in either of them lead to similar pathology in humans.</p>
      <p>The involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in development of deafness is already well
established (<xref rid="ddx152-B18" ref-type="bibr">18â20</xref>). On
the other hand, the role of mitochondria in infertility is less known and is only recently
starting to emerge. Studies in mice have shown that perturbations of mitochondrial function
can affect oocyte maturation (<xref rid="ddx152-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ddx152-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In humans, age-related decline in oocyte
quality and quantity has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired OXPHOS,
while dietary supplementation with the OXPHOS enhancer CoQ10 improved ovulation in aged
women (<xref rid="ddx152-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>,
knockdown of the mitochondrial tRNA synthetase <italic>hars-1</italic> led to smaller gonads
and to loss of fertility, which was partly due to germ cell apoptosis (<xref rid="ddx152-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>lars-2</italic> mutant worm had
underdeveloped gonads and was completely sterile (<xref rid="ddx152-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Also, sub-lethal disruptions in OXPHOS subunits cause sterility in worms
(<xref rid="ddx152-B24" ref-type="bibr">24â26</xref>). Our findings
of compromised fertility and mitochondrial respiration after knockdown of the worm
<italic>ERAL1</italic> homologue serve as additional proof for the importance of
mitochondria in fertility. The exact mechanisms through which mitochondria regulate
fertility, however, remain to be resolved.</p>
      <p>Collectively, our results indicate that mutations in another mitochondrial gene,
<italic>ERAL1</italic>, can cause sensorineural deafness and ovarian dysgenesis of PS,
strengthening the notion that this syndrome is caused by dysfunctional mitochondria.
Detailed functional mitochondrial assays with cells from other unresolved cases of PS may
shed more light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease and reveal other
PS-causing genes.</p>

Tris-HCl pH7.4, 150âmM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 1%
Triton X-100) with the addition of Complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).
Samples were sonicated to ensure complete lysis, and briefly centrifuged to discard
debris. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For
immunoblot analysis, lysates were diluted in NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer and Sample Reducing
Agent (Life Technologies) and heated to 70âÂ°C. Protein extracts were separated on pre-cast
NuPAGE 4â12% Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies), and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. Membranes were blocked with 3% (w/v) milk powder in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v)
Tween-20 (PBS-T), and incubated overnight at 4âÂ°C with the primary antibody. The following
day membranes were washed with PBS-T and incubated for 1âh at room temperature with the
secondary antibody. Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR) was used for imaging of membranes
incubated with IRDye secondary antibodies (LI-COR). Membranes incubated with HRP-linked
secondary antibodies were detected using the ECL prime western blotting detection reagent
(Amersham) and imaged with the ImageQuant LAS4000 (GE Healthcare). Primary antibodies:

        <p>For the functional complementation assay, cells were infected with viral particles for
stable overexpression of either ERAL1 or GFP (pLenti/ERAL1, pLenti/GFP). The pLenti/ERAL1
vector was constructed using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen). Specifically, the ERAL1
ORF PCR product containing attB sites was cloned to the entry plasmid pDONR 221
(Invitrogen) using the BP Clonase enzyme mix (Invitrogen) and further cloned to the
destination vector pLENTI 6.3/TO/V5-DEST (Invitrogen) using the LR Clonase enzyme mix
(Invitrogen). The pLenti/GFP vector was a kind gift of Prof. Dr. Noam Zelcer (Department
of Biochemistry, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam). For virus production,
HEK293 cells at â¼50% confluency were transfected with the ERAL1 or GFP overexpressing
plasmids, together with the lentiviral packaging plasmids pMD2G, pMDL/RRE, pRSV/REV using
the DNA and siRNA transfection reagent jetPRIMEÂ® (VWR) in the normal DMEM culture medium.
The following day the medium was refreshed, and viral supernatant was collected and
filtered 48 and 72âh post-transfection. Patient fibroblasts at â¼70% confluency were
infected with the viral supernatant, grown under blasticidine selection (10âÂµg/ml) for
2âweeks, and further expanded in blasticidine-free medium for four more passages. Cells
were regularly checked for GFP expression. Overexpression of ERAL1 was confirmed by
Western blot analysis.</p>

al.</italic> (<xref rid="ddx152-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Protein identification
and data analysis was done essentially as previously described (<xref rid="ddx152-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) using MaxQuant (version 1.5.0.25 (<xref rid="ddx152-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)).</p>
        <p>Protein abundancies were determined by label-free quantitation using the composite iBAQ
values determined by MaxQuant (<xref rid="ddx152-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and
normalized considering multiple migration profiles of individual proteins, that is taking
into account iBAQ values from all 180 gel slices (60 slices per sample). The profiles were
hierarchically clustered by distance measures based on Pearson correlation coefficient
(uncentered) and the average linkage method and further analyzed by manual correlation
profiling. The clustering and the visualization and analysis of the heat maps were done
with the NOVA software v0.5 (<xref rid="ddx152-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>

Primary skin fibroblasts were plated in 96-well Seahorse plates at a density of 10,000
cells per well and incubated overnight under normal cell culture conditions. The following
day, medium was replaced by DMEM (Sigma, D5030) containing 25âmM glucose (Sigma), 1âmM
sodium pyruvate (Lonza), and 2âmM L-Glutamine (Life technologies). Basal respiration was
measured three times, followed by measurements after addition of 1.5 ÂµM oligomycin, 1 ÂµM
FCCP and 2.5 ÂµM antimycin A and 1.25 ÂµM rotenone. For respiration assays in worms, animals
were transferred in 96-well Seahorse plates (20 worms per well) and basal oxygen
consumption was measured six times.</p>

obtained from The Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC, University of Minnesota). Worms
were cultured and maintained as described previously (<xref rid="ddx152-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) in 20âÂ°C incubators and fed with <italic>E. coli</italic>
OP50 strain, also obtained from the CGC. RNAi experiments were carried out as previously
described (<xref rid="ddx152-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The RNAi clone targeting the
ERAL1 worm orthologue (E02H1.2) is an <italic>E. coli</italic> HT115 strain and was a kind
gift of Dr. Yelena Budovskaya (SILS, Science Park, University of Amsterdam).</p>
        <p>For the fertility assays, hermaphrodite worms were treated with E02H1.2 RNAi from L4
stage of development, and allowed to lay eggs. Their progeny (F1) was continuously exposed
to the RNAi treatment, and observed throughout development. The number of F2 progeny from
individual F1 worms (<italic>nâ=</italic>â30) was counted daily for the 4 first days of
adulthood. Images of F1 worms before and after reaching adulthood were taken with a Leica
DFC320 camera, using an Axio Observer.A1 (Zeiss) microscope and a 10x magnification
objective. For imaging, worms were placed on top of a 2% agarose pad on slides, and
anesthetized using 1âmM Levamisole in M9 buffer. For the respiration assays, F1 worms at
day 1 of adulthood were used.</p>
