        <p>Intracellular calcium signaling is critical for initiating and sustaining diverse cellular functions including transcription, synaptic signaling, muscle contraction, apoptosis and fertilization. Trans-membrane 203 (TMEM203) was identified here in cDNA overexpression screens for proteins capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels using activation of a calcium/calcineurin regulated transcription factor as an indicator. Overexpression of TMEM203 resulted in a reduction of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) calcium stores and elevation in basal cytoplasmic calcium levels. TMEM203 protein was localized to the ER and found associated with a number of ER proteins which regulate ER calcium entry and efflux. Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Tmem203 deficient mice had reduced ER calcium stores and altered calcium homeostasis. Tmem203 deficient mice were viable though male knockout mice were infertile and exhibited a severe block in spermiogenesis and spermiation. Expression profiling studies showed significant alternations in expression of calcium channels and pumps in testes and concurrently Tmem203 deficient spermatocytes demonstrated significantly altered calcium handling. Thus Tmem203 is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of cellular calcium homeostasis, is required for spermatogenesis and provides a causal link between intracellular calcium regulation and spermiogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Calcium is a ubiquitous second messenger that controls a large number of functions, both cell specific, such as muscle contraction and synaptic activity, and broad, such as modulation of gene transcription and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Central to its use as a second messenger, cytoplasmic calcium concentrations are kept very low (less than 0.1Î¼M) by actively pumping calcium out of the cell and into intra-cellular stores, the best characterized of which is the endo(sarco)plasmic reticulum (ER) where calcium concentration are ~ 1 mM [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The ER calcium reserve is largely achieved by the ATP dependent ER calcium pump, SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase), that continuously pumps calcium into the ER. The ER provides a store that allows rapid calcium release to trigger a large array of responses to extracellular signals. In addition, the Plasma Membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA) family of membrane pumps are involved in extruding cytosolic calcium and thus helps in achieving low cytosolic calcium concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>Two of the general functions of calcium are to regulate rapid transcriptional responses and cell death and apoptosis. Calcium dependent transcription is critical for control of a variety of immunologic, neurologic and metabolic functions through the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) and cAMP Responsive Element Binding (CREB) regulated transcription co-activator/ Transducer of regulated cAMP response element-binding protein (CRTC/TORC) transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Upon stimulation of a variety of receptors including, the B- and T-cell antigen receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors and G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), phospho-lipase C (PLC) is activated which, in turn, leads to production of inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds and activates the IP3 Receptor (IP3R), an ER localized calcium conducting channel. The resulting depletion of the ER calcium store is sensed by a single pass EF domain containing calcium sensor protein called stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which then oligomerizes and interacts with the plasma membrane localized Calcium Release Activated Calcium (CRAC) channel, CRAC Modulator (known as ORAI or CRACM) on the plasma membrane. Orai proteins are four-pass plasma calcium channels that, upon oligomerization, allow rapid entry of extracellular calcium. This influx of calcium triggered by ER depletion is termed store operated calcium entry (SOCE) [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This leads to a more sustained increase in cytoplasmic calcium which activates the calcium dependent phosphatase, calcineurin which dephosphorylates NFAT and CRTCs allowing their nuclear re-localization. ER calcium stores are also key regulators of cellular apoptosis. Low levels of calcium release by the ER, through a B-cell lymphoma protein 2 alpha (BCL-2) dependent mechanism are thought to promote cell survival, while large releases of ER-calcium likely result in apoptosis in a BCL2 associated X protein (BAX)/ BCL2 antagonist killer (BAK)dependent manner[<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The complexity of regulation of calcium stores and its link to apoptosis is illustrated by the observation that individual members of the BCL-2 family appear to act both to increase and decrease ER-calcium stores depending on the physiologic setting [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>Intracellular calcium plays critical roles in fertility as well [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Many recent studies have shown that intracellular calcium is critical for sperm motility, capacitation, and the acrosome reaction [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Fusion of spermatozoa with an oocyte is followed by activation of the fertilization process that begins with Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in the egg [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Intracellular calcium is also involved in the progression of meiosis in mammalian oocytes [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The role of intracellular calcium in the regulation of the spermatogenesis, however, is unknown. Various calcium mobilizing channels/pumps, calmodulin and other calcium binding proteins are differentially expressed during mammalian spermatogenesis and in the support cells suggesting that calcium could be involved in the regulation of mammalian spermatogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>Spermatogenesis is the process of formation of mature spermatozoa from primordial germ cells in the testes. It is a complex process that can be broadly divided into three stages involving mitosis, meiosis and spermiogenesis. In the first stage, spermatogonia, germ-cell precursors undergo mitotic divisions to produce primary spermatocytes. These are diploid cells that are committed to meiosis and give rise to four haploid round spermatids. In spermiogenesis, the round spermatids differentiate into species-specific shaped spermatozoa, with dramatic morphological changes, including elongation and condensation of the nucleus, and formation of the flagellum. Finally, the mature sperm is released into the tubules by a process called spermiation. At all stages of differentiation, the spermatogenic cells are in close contact with Sertoli cells which provide structural and metabolic support to the developing sperm cells. Spermatogenesis is regulated by a variety of hormones and local factors. The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of these different stages of mammalian spermatogenesis have been aided by the study of a large number of mouse knockout strains though the roles of second messengers, and calcium in particular are not well understood [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
      <p>We have used a cDNA over-expression strategy to discover proteins capable of regulating intracellular calcium signaling. This report describes a previously uncharacterized predicted multi-pass trans-membrane protein (TMEM203) whose exogenous expression induced nuclear localization of both CRTC1 and NFAT due to increased cytoplasmic calcium levels and activation of calcineurin. TMEM203 is a highly conserved ER protein which associates with SOCE components. Inhibition of Tmem203 expression reduced basal ER calcium stores. Tmem203 deficient male mice were sterile and exhibited a profound defect in spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. Concomitant with the loss of spermiogenesis, loss of Tmem203 resulted in a profound deficit in the ability of spermatocytes to maintain cytoplasmic calcium concentrations after stimulation. Thus, TMEM203 is a novel regulator of intracellular calcium homeostasis and is required for spermatogenesis.</p>

        <p>
<italic>Tmem203</italic> resides immediately upstream of exon 1 of Ndor1 (NADPH dependent diflavin oxido-reductase 1) in anti-sense orientation. It is also 6 kb upstream of a putative gene C430004E15Rik in the sense orientation. Therefore the targeting construct was designed to maximize disruption of the <italic>Tmem203</italic> allele while preserving the functionalities of the two neighboring genes. In the KO+neo allele, the translational initiation ATG of <italic>Tmem203</italic> as well as 44 nt of its 5â UTR was replaced with a FRT flanked neo cassette. After removing the neo cassette, a fragment of 102 nt from the vector including one FRT site remains in the genome (KO). The targeting construct had a 4.7 kb 5â homology arm and a 2.7 kb 3â homology arm surrounding a FRT flanked neo cassette. The targeting construct was transfected into mouse C57BL/6 embryonic stem cells and G418 resistant colonies were selected and homologous recombination events were identified by standard genomic PCR and Southern-blot methods. Correctly targeted ES clones were injected into C57BL/6J host blastocysts and germline transmission was followed. Subsequently, heterozygous mice were crossed with Flpe deleter mice to remove the neo cassette.</p>
        <p>Genomic PCR was used to amplify relevant regions and determine the genotypes of mice. The genotyping primers were 5â- agcaggcggtcgccaggtctgc (forward) and 5â caccaacagggccagcaggtgc (reverse).

        <p>Previously we described a high content microscopy based cDNA screen to identify genes that induced nuclear translocation of the CREB coactivator, CRTC1 [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This and other work demonstrated translocation of the CRTC1, is induced by elevations in cAMP or intracellular calcium through rapid calcineurin dependent dephosphorylation of CRTC1 [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition to known regulators of calcium and cAMP signaling, several novel proteins were identified and retested here for the ability to induce nuclear translocation of CRTC1. Of the genes analyzed, TMEM203 transfection resulted in efficient CRTC1 translocation without inducing gross morphologic and/or apoptotic changes (<xref rid="pone.0127480.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="pone.0127480.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, exogenous expression of TMEM203 in CRTC1-eGFP expressing HeLa cells resulted in nuclear translocation which was blocked by the calcineurin inhibitors Cyclosporine A (CsA) and FK506. Addition of the calcium chelator, EGTA, also blocked TMEM203 induced nuclear CRTC1, and this inhibition was reversed by the addition of excess calcium (data not shown). In addition expression of TMEM203-FLAG induced nuclear localization of NFAT1(1â402)-GFP in cotransfected HeLa cells (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).

        <title>Overexpressed TMEM203 depletes ER calcium stores</title>
        <p>TMEM203 might increase cytoplasmic calcium levels via either directly activating SOCE or via lowering ER calcium stores. To distinguish between these models, we first examined ER calcium stores indirectly by measuring the increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels after release of ER stores. HEK293 cells stably containing an IPTG-inducible TMEM203 construct were treated with various levels of IPTG and the ER flux into the cytosol was measured in the absence of extracellular calcium after exposure to thapsigargin (TG) or ionomycin. IPTG induced TMEM203 expression (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) resulted in significantly lowered calcium release from the ER in response to both TG and ionomycin (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2Dâ2F</xref>). This demonstrates that TMEM203 overexpression causes a significant depletion of ER calcium stores. Influx of extracellular calcium after TG induced store depletion was unaffected by TMEM203 over-expression (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>) suggesting that TMEM203 does not affect SOCE directly.</p>

        <p>TMEM203 deficient mice were created (See <xref rid="pone.0127480.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) and ER calcium levels in Tmem203 deficient and wild type (WT) MEF cells were compared. Surprisingly, TG-induced total calcium release from the ER was substantially lower in <italic>Tmem203</italic> null MEF cells as compared to Het or WT MEFs (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Treatment with m-3mFBS, a PLC agonist which depletes ER by the activation of the IP3R, or ionomycin, also produced much lower calcium release from the <italic>Tmem203</italic> null MEF cells (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). These data suggest that TMEM203 deficiency also resulted in lower ER calcium stores. The role of TMEM203 on ER calcium stores in human HEK293 cells was also examined by measuring ER calcium stores directly using the D1ER calcium sensor after siRNA knockdown of TMEM203. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0127480.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>, TMEM203 siRNA treatment significantly lowered basal calcium levels. Treatment with TG further reduced ER calcium with similar kinetics and magnitude in TMEM203 and control siRNA treated cells suggesting that the steady state levels of ER calcium were reduced by TMEM203 inhibition but SERCA refilling was unaffected. Inhibition of TMEM203 expression by siRNA was confirmed by QPCR and the extent of reduction of TMEM203 expression with multiple siRNAs correlated well with the observed reduced constitutive ER calcium levels (data not shown).</p>

(D) Single cell fluorescent microscopy based direct ER calcium measurements in D1ER-HEK293 cells transfected with non-targeting or TMEM203 specific siRNA. Basal ER calcium levels and ER calcium release upon TG treatment was monitored in siRNA or control siRNA transfected D1ER-HEK293 cells. The measurements showed reduced calcium levels in TMEM203 knock down cells but similar TG induced calcium leak kinetics. [Mean; +/- SE; n = 47 (non targeting siRNA) &amp; n = 54 (TMEM203 siRNA)].</p>

        <p>To determine the nature of azoospermia in <italic>Tmem203</italic> null mice, spermatogenesis was examined in detail. We first evaluated the distribution of propidium iodide stained testicular cells from 35 day old or 30 week old <italic>Tmem203</italic> null and wild type mice. DNA staining during the first wave of spermiogenesis at day 35 was indistinguishable from WT mice (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). In contrast, at 30 weeks old, there was a large reduction of the PI stained population of Tmem203 deficient spermatocytes corresponding to the post-meiotic condensed haploid population (1n-C) (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>).

The predominant morphological changes observed in the seminiferous tubules of <italic>Tmem203</italic> null mice were characterized by: a) an overall but subtle reduction in numbers of late stage post-meiotic spermatids (steps 9â16) in the stages of the cycle of spermatogenesis in which progressive elongation and condensation of the nucleus occurs [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], b) degenerative intra-cytoplasmic vacuolar changes most prominent in step 16 spermatids, c) complete lack of spermiation (disengagement of step 16 spermatozoa from the Sertoli cell and release into the tubular lumen), and d) retention of step 16 spermatids in stage VIII seminiferous tubules. Morphological abnormalities were not observed microscopically in <italic>Tmem203</italic> null mice in non-spermatogenic cells including Sertoli cells and interstitial Leydig cells. In <italic>Tmem203</italic> null mice, atrophy of individual seminiferous tubules was occasionally observed multifocally scattered randomly throughout testes (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Transmission electron microscopy performed on testes harvested from 32-week-old Tmem203 null mice and age-matched wild type mice confirmed changes observed by bright field light microscopy including degenerative intra-cytoplasmic vacuolar changes as well defective spermiation. In addition, ultra-structural evaluation of the testes from Tmem203 null mice revealed abnormalities associated with the shape of the head of individual elongated spermatids (teratozoospermia) despite apparent normal condensation of chromatin and morphology of the acrosome (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). Numerous, large, ovoid phagocytic structures which contained degenerate and fragmented elongated spermatids as well as remnants of elongated spermatid tail fragments were often observed throughout all levels of the seminiferous tubule; in Stage VII tubules these structures were most commonly observed near the lumina of seminiferous tubules (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). Abundant amounts of intra-cytoplasmic material which ultra-structurally resembled endoplasmic reticulum were often observed in association with ovoid phagocytic structures. Despite degenerative changes associated with the head of elongated spermatids in Tmem203 null mice, the cytoskeletal components of the connecting, middle, principle and end pieces of the flagellum of individual mature elongated spermatids appeared to be ultra-structurally normal including the axoneme, axoneme complex of microtubules (two central microtubules surrounded by nine microtubule doublets) and fibrous sheath. Individual mitochondria helically wrapped around the outer dense fibers in the middle piece of the sperm tail (mitochondrial sheath) associated with step 15 spermatids in Stage VI seminiferous tubules and step 16 spermatids in Stage VII seminiferous tubules also appeared to be ultra-structurally normal (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). To summarize, spermatogenesis defects appeared post-meiotically in Tmem203 deficient mice resulting in a severe reduction of late stage spermatids, appearance of only abnormal condensed haploid spermatocytes that fail to undergo spermiation.</p>

The expression profile comparisons between <italic>Tmem203</italic> wild type and null mice showed significant changes in testes (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) and little or no significant alterations in skeletal muscle (data not shown). 163 and 129 known genes were found to be increased or decreased by &gt; 1.5 fold (<xref rid="pone.0127480.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127480.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Tables). Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for pathway enrichment using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). The most significantly up-regulated pathways were those involved in fibrosis and inflammation. It is unclear if these changes were due directly to <italic>Tmem203</italic> deletion or secondary responses due to altered development of the testes. Interestingly, the most significantly down-regulated pathway was that composed of proteins annotated to regulate intracellular calcium levels. This set of genes included increased expression of inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate receptor 1 (Ip3r1) and ATPase, Ca<sup>++</sup> transporting, plasma membrane 1 (Atp2b1 / Pmca1) RNAs and reduction ofTrpv6, Trpm5 and Trpm8 calcium channel RNAs in Tmem203 deficient testes. The differential expression of these genes was further validated by real-time quantitative RT PCR (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). The differential expression of channels and transporters suggest that Tmem203 deficient spermatogenic cells would have altered calcium handling capacity. It should also be noted that the IPA also suggested a significant up-regulation in Germ Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction signaling genes {Ras Homolog Family Member Q (Rhoq), P21 Protein Activated Kinase 6 &amp; 3 (Pak6, Pak3), Rho family GTPase 3 (Rnd3), integrin, alpha 6 (Itga6), catenin (cadherin-associated protein), alpha 1 (Ctnna1), junction plakoglobin (Jup)} The up-regulation of this gene-set was not pursued further as there was no obvious relevant morphological defects seen in ultra-structural studies of testes from <italic>Tmem203</italic> null mice.</p>

Calcium flux was measured in response to release of intracellular calcium stores before (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>) and after addition of extracellular calcium (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). The <italic>Tmem203</italic> null cells exhibited modestly lower basal cytoplasmic calcium levels at rest. The rises in intracellular calcium immediately after store depletion were modestly lower than WT mice. <italic>Tmem203</italic> null cells exhibited a reduction of cytosolic calcium after store depletion by TG in contrast to WT cells which showed a continuous rise in cytoplasmic calcium. <italic>Tmem203</italic> null cells showed a more pronounced reduction of cytosolic calcium after the peak levels induced by ionomycin (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). After addition of calcium to the media after store depletion by either TG or Ionomycin, <italic>Tmem203</italic> null cells exhibited significantly reduced cytoplasmic calcium accumulation compared to WT cells (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). These data are consistent with both reduced calcium uptake and increased cellular extrusion predicted by the expression profiling data which showed reduced expression of calcium import channels and increased expression of the predominant cellular calcium pump. These data suggest that the defective spermiogenesis in Tmem203 deficient mice is due to alterations in calcium homeostasis.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study describes the identification of TMEM203 as a novel regulator of ER calcium levels. TMEM203 was identified here by its ability upon overexpression to mediate calcium dependent nuclear relocalization of the CRCT1 and NFAT transcription factors. TMEM203 is an evolutionary conserved resident ER protein that bears little amino acid sequence similarity to other proteins. TMEM203 was required to maintain normal ER calcium levels in a variety of cell types. Mice lacking Tmem203 expression were viable though male knockout mice were infertile and exhibited a severe block in spermiogenesis and spermiation which were also accompanied by altered accumulation of cellular calcium. Thus Tmem203 represents an evolutionarily conserved regulator of intracellular calcium homeostasis and provides a causal link between intracellular calcium regulation and spermiogenesis.</p>
      <p>The ability of TMEM203 to induce nuclear translocation of NFAT and CRTC1 required activation of calcineurin likely following severe loss of ER calcium stores and activation of store operated calcium entry (SOCE). The mechanism by which TMEM203 overexpression releases ER calcium stores is not clear. Exogenously expressed TMEM203 was localized to the ER (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and was found in a complex with a number of calcium regulatory proteins, including STIM1, SERCA2 and IP3R (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The activity of TMEM203 could be explained by regulation of one or more complexed proteins, for example by either inhibition of calcium refilling via SERCA2 or activation of the IP3R. Alternatively, overexpressed TMEM203 could form a pore, increasing the leak of calcium stores as has been suggested for other overexpressed proteins such as BCL-2, the Bax inhibitory protein-1 or presinillins [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
      <p>TMEM203 depletion, either via siRNA or through gene disruption also lowered ER calcium stores (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3Aâ3D</xref>). Thus, at least in some cell types, TMEM203 appeared to play an essential role in maintaining ER calcium. It is not clear why overexpression and loss of TMEM203 expression both resulted in reduction of ER calcium stores. One explanation is that overexpression of TMEM203 may act in a dominant negative fashion, perhaps titrating out either endogenous TMEM203 or TMEM203 interacting proteins. However, it is worth noting that the effects of TMEM203 inhibition and overexpression are distinct in some ways. For instance, while overexpression of TMEM203 appears to elevate the basal cytosolic calcium levels and activate NFAT and CRTC1 (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1Aâ1D</xref>), loss of Tmem203 has an inhibitory effect on NFAT dependent gene expression in mouse fibroblasts (<xref rid="pone.0127480.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). These observations suggest that overexpression and reduction of TMEM203 have distinct physiologic affects and that TMEM203 likely regulates ER calcium via multiple mechanisms.</p>
      <p>In this regard it is worth noting that other proteins, notably of the BCL-2 family, have been reported to have bidirectional/opposing effects on ER calcium stores. For example, overexpression of BCL-2 lowers ER calcium stores by several reported mechanisms including acting as a leak channel, inhibiting refilling by SERCA and by enhancing activation and calcium release by the IP3R [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Conversely BCL-2 has also been suggested to act as an inhibitor of the IP3R, preventing calcium release during stress. Similarly, BAX overexpression has been reported to reduce ER calcium stores [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], whereas inactivation of BAX and BAK also reduces ER calcium levels through enhanced calcium leak and IP3R activation [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The precise mechanism by which TMEM203 affects ER calcium stores will await further studies including the biochemical purification and characterization of TMEM203 and associated protein complexes.</p>
      <p>Tmem203 deficient male mice were infertile with a failure to complete spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. At present, morphologic analysis does not pinpoint a single aspect of spermatogenesis affected by TMEM203 deficiency. Haploid spermatids appear to be reduced in numbers and spermiogenesis fails after nuclear condensation, resulting in a large reduction in elongated spermatids, and accumulation of small numbers of degenerative malformed sperm heads which fail to undergo spermiation (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5Aâ5E</xref>).While the exact cause of spermiogenic failure is not clear, calcium homeostasis in testicular cells was clearly defective; suggesting that defective spermiogenesis may be due to altered handling of calcium stores (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7Aâ7D</xref>). Expression profiling experiments demonstrated significantly altered expression of calcium pumps and channels in Tmem203 deficient mice (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). The increased expression of the main calcium extrusion pump, Pmca1 and decreased expression of multiple import channels seems likely to contribute to modestly reduced basal calcium levels and highly reduced retention of calcium after SOCE seen <italic>in vitro</italic> with primary spermatocytes. The altered expression of calcium pumps and channels might be due to either an attempt by cells to compensate for loss of Tmem203 or indirectly due to developmental defects. It is worth noting that loss of Bcl2 also appears to result in a dramatically increased rate of calcium extrusion in pancreatic acinar cells due to increased function of the Pmca calcium pump [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
      <p>A clear role for calcium stores in spermiogenesis has not been directly described although a number of genes regulated by calcium have been shown to be essential for sperm development. <italic>C elegans</italic> lacking expression of mammalian homologs of calreticulin (Crt-1)âthe calcium binding chaperone protein or calcineurin (Cna or Cnb)âthe calcium dependent phosphatase are sterile due to defects in sperm development in addition to oocyte development and fertilization [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]</p>
      <p>A similar spermiogenesis defect as in <italic>Tmem203</italic> null mice was described with Calcium and integrin binding 1 (CIB1)/calmyrin null mice [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. CIB1 is a homolog of Calmodulin and Calcineurin B and regulates calcium dependent signaling events [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It will be of interest to determine if CIB1 and Tmem203 act in a common pathway involved in calcium/calcineurin signaling and spermatogenesis in mammals. Finally, Bax is also required for spermiogenesis in mice [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and as mentioned above, also modulates levels of ER calcium similar to Tmem203. The similarity in phenotypes seen in Tmem203 and Bcl2 family protein deficient mice [<xref rid="pone.0127480.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] suggests that these proteins may converge on common mechanisms that govern ER calcium stores and cellular calcium handling.</p>
      <p>The defective calcium handling in testicular cell preparations, which were predominantly haploid spermatocytes (<xref rid="pone.0127480.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7Aâ7D</xref>), suggests that Tmem203 deficiency directly affects development or survival of spermatocytes. However, it is also possible that defects Sertoli and Lydig cells could also play some or a major role in the infertility in Tmem203 deficient mice. Spermiation, the process of releasing mature sperm from the Sertoli cells into the seminiferous tubule was completely absent in Tmem203 deficient mice, while it is possible that Tmem203 is directly involved in spermiation, it seems likely this defect is due to the severe loss of maturing spermatids, miss-shappen post meiotic spermatids and the likely clearance of remaining malformed spermatids by Sertoli cells before spermiation. The simplest explanation for the phenotypes observed is that the defective calcium handling within spermatocytes results in developmental arrest or cell death of spermatocytes shortly after the stage of nuclear condensation.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Tmem203</italic> is a highly conserved gene and is absolutely requirement for fertility. Tmem203âs role in maintaining steady state ER calcium levels suggests it may modulate a variety of biological processes. Indeed, preliminary analysis suggests that TMEM203 deficiency also results in other phenotypes. TMEM203 deficient mice are about 10% smaller than WT siblings, have mild immunologic defects at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, and exhibit evidence for impaired neurologic function, though these phenotypes have not been sufficiently characterized for publication yet. The absolute requirement for TME203 in fertility would seem to be sufficient to explain its high level of evolutionary conservation. <italic>Tmem203</italic> null mice may serve as an excellent tool to understand the regulation of intracellular calcium levels and its interdependence on carefully orchestrated modulation of ER calcium stores. Tmem203âs role in spermatogenesis adds to the complexity of this fascinating process and strongly suggests a role of intracellular calcium homeostasis during mammalian spermatogenesis.</p>
