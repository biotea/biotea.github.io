      <abstract>
        <p>Through their interaction with the TNF receptorâassociated factor (TRAF) family, members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily elicit a wide range of biological effects including differentiation, proliferation, activation, or cell death. We have identified and characterized a novel component of the receptorâTRAF signaling complex, designated TRIP (TRAF-interacting protein), which contains a RING finger motif and an extended coiled-coil domain. TRIP associates with the TNFR2 or CD30 signaling complex through its interaction with TRAF proteins. When associated, TRIP inhibits the TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation that is required for cell activation and also for protection against apoptosis. Thus, TRIP acts as a receptorâproximal regulator that may influence signals responsible for cell activation/proliferation and cell death induced by members of the TNFR superfamily.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Members of the TNF receptor (TNFR)<sup>1</sup> superfamily play important roles in the induction of diverse signals leading to cell growth, activation, and apoptosis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Whether the signals induced by a given receptor leads to cell activation or death is, however, highly cell-type specific and tightly regulated during differentiation of cells. For example, the TNFRs can exert costimulatory signals for proliferation of naive lymphocytes but also induce death signals required for deletion of activated T lymphocytes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The cytoplasmic domains of these receptors lack intrinsic catalytic activity and also exhibit no significant homology to each other or to other known proteins. Exceptions to this include Fas(CD95) and TNFR1 that share a significant homology within an 80âamino acid region of their cytoplasmic tails (called the âdeath domainâ; 2, 3). Therefore, it is suggested that the TNFR family members can initiate different signal transduction pathways by recruiting different types of intracellular signal transducers to the receptor complex (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p>
    <p>Indeed, several types of intracellular signal transducers have been identified that initiate distinct signal transduction pathways when recruited to the members of TNFR superfamily (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Recent biochemical and molecular studies showed that a class of signal-transducing molecules are recruited to Fas(CD95) or TNFR1 via interaction of the death domains (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). For example, Fas(CD95) and TNFR1 recruit FADD(MORT1)/RIP or TRADD/FADD (MORT1)/RIP through the interactions of their respective death domains (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Clustering of these signal transducers leads to the recruitment of FLICE/ MACH, and subsequently, to cell death (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>
    <p>The TNFR family members can also recruit a second class of signal transducers called TRAFs (TNFR-associated factor), some of which are responsible for the activation of NF-ÎºB or JNK (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). TRAF proteins were identified by their biochemical ability to interact with TNFR2, CD40, CD30, or LT-Î²R (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These receptors interact directly with TRAFs via a short stretch of amino acids within their cytoplasmic tails, but do not interact with the death domain containing proteins (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). To date, five members of the TRAF family have been identified as signaling components of the TNFR family members. All TRAF members contain a conserved TRAF domain, â¼230 amino acids in length, that is used for either homo- or heterooligomerization among the TRAF family, for interactions with the cytoplasmic regions of the TNFR superfamily, or for interactions with downstream signal transducers (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In addition to the TRAF domain, most of the TRAF family members contain an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal RING finger and several zinc finger structures, which appear to be important for their effector functions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
    <p>Several effector functions of TRAFs were revealed by recent experiments based on a transfection system. TRAF2, first identified by its interaction with TNFR2 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), was subsequently shown to mediate NF-ÎºB activation induced by two TNF receptors, CD40 and CD30 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). TRAF5 was also implicated in NF-ÎºB activation mediated by LTÎ²R (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), whereas TRAF3 (also known as CRAF1, CD40bp, or LAP1; references <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, and <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) was shown to be involved in the regulation of CD40-mediated CD23 upregulation in B cells (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The role of other TRAF members in the TNFR familyâmediated signal transduction is not clear. They may possess some effector functions as yet to be revealed, or work as adapter proteins to recruit different downstream signal transducers to the receptor complex. For example, TRAF1 is required for the recruitment of members of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (c-IAP) family to the TNFR2-signaling complex (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In addition to the signal transduction by the TNFR family members, TRAFs may regulate other receptor-mediated signaling pathways. For example, TRAF6 is a component of IL-1 receptor (IL1R)âsignaling complex, in which it mediates the activation of NF-ÎºB by IL-1R (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Since TRAFs form homo- or heterooligomers, it is suggested that the repertoire of TRAF members in a given cell type may differentially affect the intracellular signals triggered by these receptors. This may be accomplished by the selective interaction of TRAFs with a specific set of downstream signal transducers. Although many aspects of TRAF-mediated effector functions leading to cellular activation have been defined, it needs to be determined whether TRAF proteins will also mediate the apoptotic signals induced by the âdeath-domain-lessâ members of the TNFR superfamily (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>â<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel component of the TNFR superfamily/TRAFs signaling complex, named TRIP (TRAF-interacting protein). TRIP associates with the receptor/TRAF signaling complex, and inhibits the TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation. Biochemical studies indicate that TRIP associates with the TNFR2 or CD30 receptor complex via its interaction with TRAF proteins, suggesting a model which can explain why the ligation of these receptors can promote different cell fates: proliferation or death.</p>

        <title>Isolation of TRIP as a TRAF-interacting Protein.</title>
        <p> Previous experiments have suggested that TRAF1 may function as an adapter protein to recruit additional signaling proteins such as c-IAPs to the receptor complex (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), or that TRAF1 may initiate an as yet uncovered signaling pathway. To determine the potential role of TRAF1 in the receptor signaling complex, we searched for additional TRAF1-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. By screening cDNA libraries derived from mouse thymocytes, multiple cDNA clones representing several distinct proteins were isolated (data not shown). Among these, one set of cDNAs encoded proteins which could interact with both TRAF1 and TRAF2 in the two-hybrid assay.</p>
        <p>Analysis of the DNA sequence of the TRAF1- and TRAF2-interacting cDNA clones revealed that they were derived from a single novel gene named <italic>TRIP.</italic> Since TRIP interacted strongly with both TRAF1 and TRAF2 in the two-hybrid assay, we tested whether these proteins interacted in mammalian cells. Expression vectors encoding TRAF1 or TRAF2 were coexpressed in 293 cells in the presence of an expression vector encoding either GST alone or GST-TRIP fusion protein. Cell lysates were precipitated with glutathioneâSepharose beads, and analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-TRAF1 or anti-TRAF2 antibodies. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid assay, GST-TRIP coprecipitated both TRAF1 and TRAF2, demonstrating that TRIP can interact directly with TRAF1 and TRAF2 in human cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). </p>

<italic>A</italic>). <italic>TRIP</italic> mRNA is predicted to encode proteins of 470 amino acids. Using a murine <italic>TRIP</italic> as a hybridization probe, we also isolated several human <italic>TRIP</italic> cDNA clones from a human thymocyte cDNA library. Human <italic>TRIP</italic> encodes a 469âamino acid protein that is overall 76% identical to murine TRIP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). The amino acid sequence identity between the NH<sub>2</sub>terminal half of mTRIP and hTRIP (residues 1â270) is even higher (87% identical). A homology search of the TRIP amino acid sequence revealed that TRIP is a novel protein with an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal RING finger sequence motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal RING finger motif of TRIP is followed by an extended putative coiledcoil domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). The putative coiled-coil domain of TRIP can be further devided into the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal coiled-coil structure, similar to the rod-like tails of myosin heavy chains (residues 56â150; reference <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and the COOH-terminal leucine zipper-like coils (residues 221â 260; reference <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), both of which are implicated in proteinâprotein interactions. A helical representation of the putative leucine zipper (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>C</italic>) shows that the position next to the zipper is always hydrophobic or uncharged, whereas other sides of the wheel contain many charged but few hydrophobic residues, suggesting an amphipathic structure that can interact with another helix. </p>
        <p>To characterize <italic>TRIP</italic> further, its expression pattern was examined. Northern blot analysis of various mouse tissue RNA samples revealed that <italic>TRIP</italic>-specific probes detected a â¼2.1-kb mRNA species present in various tissues, but most abundant in testes, thymus, and spleen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). To characterize further the expression of <italic>TRIP</italic> in lymphocytes, we analyzed its expression during lymphocyte proliferation by semiquantitative PCR. The expression of <italic>TRIP</italic> was significantly reduced when lymphocytes were stimulated to proliferate via antigen receptors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). This is in contrast to that of other components of the TNFRâ TRAF signaling complex. For example, the expression of <italic>TRAF1</italic> and <italic>c-IAP1</italic> was upregulated upon lymphocyte proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>

        <title>The Putative Coiled-coil Domain of TRIP Interacts with the TRAF Domains of TRAF1 and TRAF2.</title>
        <p>The yeast twohybrid assay was used to determine the structural requirements for the interaction of TRIP with TRAF1 or TRAF2. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, a mutant TRIP comprising the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal half of the protein (TRIP[1â275]) interacted with TRAFs, whereas a mutant TRIP lacking the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal RING finger and the coiled-coil domain (TRIP[275â470]) failed to interact with TRAFs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>

Further deletion analysis suggested that the putative coiledcoil region of TRIP mediates the interaction with TRAFs, since a mutant TRIP lacking the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal RING finger motif still interacted with TRAFs (TRIP[56â275]) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). In addition, both TRIP(56â185) and TRIP (186â275) interacted with TRAFs, suggesting that TRIP contains two independent TRAF binding sites within the long coiled-coil domain of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>

        <title>TRIP Associates with the ReceptorâTRAF Signaling Complex.</title>
        <p>TRIP did not directly interact with the cytoplasmic domains of TNFR2 or CD30 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). However, since the interaction of TRAFs with the cognate members of the TNFR superfamily is mediated through the TRAF-C domain rather than the entire TRAF domain (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), it was important to determine whether TRIP can indirectly interact with the receptors through TRAFs. To test this, HA-epitopeâtagged TRIP and GST fusion proteins with the cytoplasmic domains of TNFR2 (GST-TNFR2) or CD30 (GST-CD30) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) were coexpressed in 293 cells in the presence or absence of TRAFs. Cell lysates were precipitated with glutathioneâSepharose beads, and analyzed on Western blots with anti-HA, anti-TRAF1, and antiTRAF2 antibodies. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid assay, TRIP was not coprecipitated by the GST-TNFR2 or GST-CD30 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). When TRAF2 was coexpressed, however, TRIP was readily coprecipitated by the GSTTNFR2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). GST-TNFR2, which does not strongly interact with TRAF1 oligomer (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), did not readily coprecipitate the TRAF1âTRIP complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Coexpression of both TRAF2 and TRAF1 did not increase the amount of TRIP coprecipitated with GST-TNFR2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Similar to GST-TNFR2, GST-CD30 also coprecipitated TRIP efficiently in the presence of TRAF2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Although TRAF1 homooligomer can interact with CD30 or TRIP efficiently in 293 cells, only low level of TRIP was coprecipitated by GST-CD30 in the presence of TRAF1 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that TRIP can be recruited to the TNFR2 or CD30 through the TRAF2 homooligomer. However, whether TRIP is also recruited to the receptor via TRAF2âTRAF1 heterooligomer cannot be excluded. </p>

        <title>TRIP Overexpression Inhibits TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB Activation.</title>
        <p>The ability of TRIP to bind the receptorâTRAF signaling complexes raised the possibility that TRIP may regulate the receptor-mediated signal transduction. In particular, the association of TRIP with TRAF2 suggests that TRIP expression may regulate TRAF2-mediated effector function such as NF-ÎºB activation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Therefore, we tested the effect of TRIP expression on TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºBâdependent reporter gene activation using a transient transfection assay in 293 cells. When overexpressed, TRIP significantly inhibited TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). This inhibition was similar to that exerted by overexpression of a dominant negative form of TRAF2 (TRAF2[241â501]; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>A</italic>; references <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The inhibition of NF-ÎºB activation by TRIP required the same domains of TRIP which mediate the interaction. An NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal deletion mutant of TRIP which lacks the TRIPâTRAF interaction domain (TRIP[275â 470]) failed to inhibit TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). Moreover, a COOH-terminal deletion mutant of TRIP containing the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal RING finger motif and the putative coiled-coil domain (TRIP[1â185]) was sufficient to inhibit TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). However, further deletion analysis showed that the RING finger motif of TRIP was not required for inhibition of TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation because a mutant TRIP containing only the putative coiled-coil domain (TRIP[56â275]) was sufficient to inhibit TRAF2mediated NF-ÎºB activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). Overexpression of a mutant TRIP expressing only the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal RING finger motif failed to inhibit NF-ÎºB activation (data not shown). These results suggested that the coiled-coil domain of TRIP (amino acids 56â275) is required for TRIPâ TRAF interaction and also for inhibition of TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation. </p>
        <p>Since TRIP associates with the receptor complex, we also tested the effect of TRIP on NF-ÎºB activation induced via TNFR2 or CD30. As previously shown, overexpression of chimeric receptors with the extracellular domain of CD8 fused to the cytoplasmic domain of TNFR2 (CD8-TNFR2) or CD30 (CD8-CD30) induced NF-ÎºB activation in 293 cells without further cross-linking (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>B</italic>; reference <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This is similar to the activation of NF-ÎºB induced by overexpression of wild-type TNFR2, CD40, or other chimeric receptors in 293 cells, which will trigger the clustering of signal transducers without additional crosslinking by cognate ligands or antibodies (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). When TRIP was coexpressed, the receptor-mediated NF-ÎºB activation was significantly inhibited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). Because NF-ÎºB activation by TNFR2 and CD30 is mediated by TRAF2 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), the results are consistent with the fact that TRIP works as a proximal negative regulator of TRAF2mediated NF-ÎºB activation by members of the TNFR superfamily.</p>

        <title>TRIP Inhibits NF-ÎºB Activation Induced by TNF, but Not by IL-1.</title>
        <p>Since TRAF2 also mediates NF-ÎºB activation triggered by the TNFR1âTRADD complex (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), we tested the effect of TRIP overexpression on TNF-induced NF-ÎºB activation in 293 cells, which is mediated by TNFR1 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Overexpression of TRIP in 293 cells inhibited TNF- induced NF-ÎºB activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>

While TRAF2 is required for TNF- or TRADD-induced NF-ÎºB activation, it is not required for NF-ÎºB activation induced by IL-1 in 293 cells (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). To test whether TRIP affects TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation specifically, the effect of TRIP overexpression on NF-ÎºB activation by IL-1 was also tested. In contrast to TNF-induced NF-ÎºB activation, IL-1âinduced NF-ÎºB activation was not inhibited by TRIP overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>C</italic>). Recent experiments have shown that IL-1âinduced NF-ÎºB activation is mediated by another member of the TRAF family, TRAF6 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These results suggest that TRIP is a specific inhibitor of TRAF2mediated NF-ÎºB activation, rather than a general inhibitor of NF-ÎºB activation.</p>

      <p>Stimulation of members of the TNFR superfamily activates signaling cascades leading to the regulation of cell activation/growth or death (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The recent identification of distinct families of receptor-associated signal transducers have provided insight into how members of the TNFR superfamily may induce pleiotropic effects on cells (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Many of these signal transducers contain either TRAF or death domains, which mediate proteinâprotein interactions. The TRAF family proteins interact directly with some members of the TNFR family (TNFR2, CD40, LT-Î²R, or CD30) and play pivotal roles in the activation of signaling pathways induced by these receptors (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). For example, the activation of NF-ÎºB triggered by these receptors is mediated by TRAF2 or TRAF5 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Proteins containing death domains like FADD/MORT1, RIP, or TRADD interact with Fas(CD95) or TNFR1 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Once associated with the receptors, these proteins recruit downstream signal molecules that act to initiate cascades leading to cell death or activation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For example, TRADD recruits FADD/ MORT1 or TRAF2 to the TNFR1 complex to initiate the signal transduction required for cell death or NF-ÎºB activation, respectively (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this study we have carried out experiments to study how TRAF proteins contribute to the signal transduction pathway triggered by the TNFR superfamily because TRAFs do not contain any domains of known signaling function despite their importance as signal transducers. It has been previously suggested that TRAFs might work as adapters to recruit different types of effector proteins to the receptor complex, which will induce specific signals (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). For example, TRAF2 may interact with downstream signal transducers which phosphorylate IkB to activate NF-ÎºB. Other classes of signal transducers are also likely to be recruited to the receptor complex to regulate various biological effects exerted by the TNFR superfamily. For example, members of the c-IAP family (c-IAP1 and c-IAP2) are recruited to the TNFR2 signaling complex by their interaction with TRAFs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The role of c-IAPs in the signal transduction pathway of the TNFR superfamily is not clear, but some members of the c-IAP family are involved in the protection of cells from apoptosis (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>â<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Since members of the TNFR superfamily can interact with different sets of TRAF proteins, a diverse collection of downstream signal transducing molecules are likely to be recruited to the receptor complex.</p>
      <p>We now report the identification and characterization of a novel signal transducer of the TNFR superfamily. TRIP interacts with the receptorâTRAF signaling complex and inhibits the TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation. The structural features of TRIP include an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal RING finger motif followed by a long putative coiled-coil structure. The putative coiled-coil domain of TRIP is divided into two subdomains. Amino acid sequences of the NH<sub>2</sub>terminal half of the coiled-coil domain of TRIP shows â¼50% similarity to the rod-like coiled-coil structure of myosin heavy chain (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), while those of the COOH-terminal half of the coiled-coil domain of TRIP are characteristic of a leucine zipper (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The putative coiled-coil domain of TRIP was shown to be required not only for TRIPâTRAF interactions, but also for the inhibition of TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation by TRIP. Although the RING finger domain of TRIP has not been implicated in the regulation of NF-ÎºB activation in this study, it may play some other regulatory role based on analogy to other RING-finger proteins (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The COOH-terminal half of TRIP distal to the coiled-coil domain does not show any significant homology to other proteins but contains several potential phosphorylation sites, suggesting that TRIP may be regulated by kinases.</p>
      <p>TRIP is recruited to the receptors TNFR2 or CD30 via its interaction with TRAF proteins. The recruitment of TRIP to these receptors was efficient in the presence of TRAF2 oligomer. Although only TNFR2 and CD30 have been tested in this study, TRIP may affect the signaling pathway mediated by many other members of the TNFR superfamily because TRAF2 is expressed ubiquitously and interacts with most of the TRAF-binding members of the TNFR superfamily. This suggestion is supported by the fact that TRIP also inhibits the induction of NF-ÎºB activation mediated by TNFR1, which indirectly interacts with TRAF2 via TRADD (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). When the role of TRIP was examined by a transient transfection assay in 293 cells, TRIP inhibited NF-ÎºB activation induced by TNFR2, CD30, and TNFR1, and also by TRADD, all of which activates NF-ÎºB via TRAF2 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, TRIP did not inhibit the activation of NF-ÎºB by IL-1R which is mediated by TRAF6 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), suggesting that a negative effect of TRIP on NF-ÎºB activation was specific to a TRAF2- mediated pathway.</p>
      <p>This specificity of TRIP makes it unique among other signal transducers (I-TRAF and A20) which inhibit TRAF2mediated NF-ÎºB activation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In contrast to TRIP, both I-TRAF and A20 inhibit the activation of NFÎºB induced by IL-1R as well as by TNFRs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition to its specificity, TRIP differs from I-TRAF or A20 in several additional aspects. First, TRIP is recruited to the cognate receptorâTRAF signaling complex, but I-TRAF is not (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Whereas TRIP can be recruited to the cognate receptors via its interaction with TRAF2 homooligomer, A20 interacts only with TRAF2âTRAF1 heterooligomer (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Second, the inhibitory mechanism acting on NF-ÎºB activation by I-TRAF, A20, and TRIP appears to be different. I-TRAF inhibits TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation by blocking the recruitment of TRAF2 to the receptor complex, which would normally initiate the clustering of TRAF proteins (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In contrast, TRIP is recruited to the receptor complex by its association with TRAF2. Although A20 interacts with TRAFs, its inhibitory effect on TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation does not require direct proteinâprotein interaction in a transfection assay in 293 cells (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). TRIP, however, inhibits TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation only when its coiled-coil domain required for TRIPâTRAF interaction is intact. TRAF3 also inhibits TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation when overexpressed in 293 cells. However, TRAF3 does not interact with TRAF1 or TRAF2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), suggesting that the inhibitory mechanism regulating TRAF2 effector function by TRAF3 is different from that by TRIP. Therefore, a unique property of TRIP that distinguishes it from other inhibitors of TRAF2 function is that TRIP is a component of the receptorâTRAF complex and inhibits proximal events necessary for TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation. However, the mechanism of TRIP's inhibitory effect is difficult to predict. Future identification of signal transducers required for TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation will be required to understand how TRIP might negatively regulate the function of TRAF2.</p>
      <p>Apart from TRIP, c-IAPs are the only other proteins which have been shown to be recruited to the receptorâ TRAF complex (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In contrast to TRIP, however, c-IAPs do not exert a negative effect on the activation of NF-ÎºB induced by these receptors (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), rather, they have been implicated in the inhibition of cell death (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>â<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In addition to their functional differences, TRIP and c-IAPs are recruited differently to their cognate receptors. c-IAPs are recruited to TNFR2 only through the TRAF2âTRAF1 heterooligomer (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but TRIP can be recruited to the cognate receptors (TNFR2 or CD30) in the presence of the TRAF2 homooligomer. Therefore, the level of TRAF1 expression which is controlled differently among various tissues (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) may influence whether the cognate receptor will recruit c-IAPs or TRIP.</p>

        <title>A Balance between Cell Activation/Proliferation and Death.</title>
        <p>The studies in this paper have identified TRIP as a novel signaling component of the TNFR superfamily and also shown that TRIP works as a receptor-proximal negative regulator of NF-ÎºB activation. In addition, the studies of the regulation of TRIP suggested a model of how the signals mediated by the TNFR2â or CD30âTRAF signaling complex can initiate such seemingly opposing effects on cells, namely cell activation/growth or cell death (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). </p>
        <p>In this model, the balance of proactivation/growth or procell death signals mediated by the receptorâTRAF complex may be controlled by the particular set of signal transducers (e.g., c-IAPs or TRIP) which are recruited to the receptor complex. When c-IAPs are recruited to the receptor complex, TRAF2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation proceeds unaffected. The activation of NF-ÎºB induces the expression of various genes and also suppresses cell death (22, 46â 48) which drives the cells towards the proactivation/growth state. In addition, c-IAPs themselves may contribute to antiapoptotic signals (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>â<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). For example, c-IAP1 (also known as MIHB and HIAP-1) was shown to inhibit the apoptosis triggered by IL-1Î² converting enzyme overexpression or serum deprivation (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Manganese superoxide dismutase or A20 induced by NF-ÎºB activation will also contribute to the survival of cells during cell proliferation/growth (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). When TRIP is recruited to the receptor complex, however, TRIP inhibits NF-ÎºB activation which is required for antiapoptotic signals. In addition, the contribution of antiapoptotic proteins like c-IAPs, manganese superoxide dismutase, or A20 will be diminished. Therefore, the signals by the receptorâTRAFâTRIP complex will drive cells toward the antiactivation/procell death state. Consistent with this idea and also with recent findings solidifying the anti-apoptotic role of NF-ÎºB during TNFmediated apoptosis (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>â<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), TRIP overexpression enhanced TNF-mediated cell death in HeLa cells (data not shown).</p>
        <p>The choice of which type of signal transducers (c-IAPs or TRIP) is to be recruited to the cognate receptors may be determined by their availability and also by the presence of different TRAF proteins (e.g., TRAF1). This idea is consistent with several observations. First, the expression of TRAF1 is tissue-specific, whereas that of TRAF2 is not (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Second, when lymphocytes are stimulated to proliferate via their antigen receptors, the expression of c-IAP1 or TRAF1 is upregulated, whereas TRIP expression is decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). In contrast, TRAF2 expression is not significantly affected during lymphocyte proliferation (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). During antigen-stimulation of lymphocytes, therefore, the formation of TRAF2âTRAF1âc-IAP complex will be favored and recruited to the cognate TNFR family members, which may exert costimulatory signals for lymphocyte proliferation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Third, TRAF1 overexpression which may antagonize the formation of TRAF2 homooligomer in cells, impairs the activation-induced cell death of mature CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (data not shown) which is partly mediated by the TNFR2 signaling complex (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Lastly, TRIP expression is most abundant in thymocytes, most of which are destined to die during clonal deletion, which is in part mediated by CD30 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In addition to TRAF1, the repertoire of other TRAF proteins present in a particular cell and the repertoire of downstream signal transducing molecules expressed in a given cell type may control the switch between cell activation/growth and cell death triggered by the receptorâ TRAF signaling complex. Future studies will be directed towards identifying downstream signal transducers which are responsible for cell activation/growth (e.g., a protein which directly activates NF-ÎºB) or those which are responsible for cell death in this signaling pathway.</p>

        <p>Interaction of TRIP with TRAF1 and TRAF2. An expression vector encoding TRAF1 or TRAF2 was co-transfected into 293 cells with an expression vector encoding either GST alone or GSTâTRIP fusion proteins. After 36 h, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to purification with glutathioneâSepharose beads. Proteins coprecipitated with GST fusion proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis with antiTRAF1 or anti-TRAF2 polyclonal antibodies. (<italic>Pre</italic>) Cell lysates before precipitation with glutathione beads were analyzed by Western blot analysis to show that similar amounts of TRAF1 or TRAF2 are present in each sample. (<italic>GST beads</italic>) Proteins coprecipitated with GST-fusion proteins were analyzed. TRAF1 or TRAF2 are indicated with arrows.</p>

        <p>Mapping of TRIPâTRAF interaction domains. (<italic>A</italic>) Interaction of TRAF1 or TRAF2 with the NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal domains of TRIP. Expression vectors encoding wild-type TRIP or the indicated deletion mutants of TRIP fused to the transcription activation domain were cotransformed into yeast with plasmids expressing LexA DNA binding domainâTRAF1 or âTRAF2 fusion proteins. Interactions between fusion proteins were scored by measuring Î²-gal activity of yeast transformants. (+) Average Î²-gal activity of three independent yeast transformants was higher than 1,000 Miller units; (â) average Î²-gal activity of three independent yeast transformants was about 100 Miller units, which was similar to that of negative controls (bait plasmid alone).

        <p>A model of interrelationship of TRAFs, c-IAP, and TRIP, and the switch of the TRAF-mediated signals between cell activation and cell death. The upper part of the diagram (<italic>shaded</italic>) describes how the receptorâTRAF signaling complex will inhibit cell death and promote cell activation/growth (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), in which A20 can work as a negative feedback regulator for TRAF2 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In this model, the members of the TNFR family which do not contain the death domains (e.g., TNFR2 or CD30) are postulated to trigger the induction of cell death by yet to be identified mechanism which is indicated by question mark. The lower part of the diagram explains how TRIP inhibits the TRAF-mediated cell activation/growth and contributes to the promotion of signals for cell death. For simplicity, the model does not include the receptorâTRAF2â TRAF1âTRIP complex, the presence of which cannot be excluded. However, the signals from this complex may be similar to those from the receptorâTRAF2âTRIP complex. All indicated protein association may represent dimers or higher oligomers. Three types of proximal signal transducers (TRAFs, c-IAP, or TRIP) are described. TRAFs are kept inactive in the cytoplasm due to their association with I-TRAF (also known as TANK) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For simplicity, a costimulatory role of I-TRAF/TANK is not included (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>
