          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>Although BehÃ§et's disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of uncertain aetiology, the existence of familial BD with autosomal-dominant traits suggests that a responsibility gene (or genes) exists. We investigated a Japanese family with a history of BD to search for pathogenic mutations underlying the biological mechanisms of BD.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>6 patients over 4 generations who had suffered from frequent oral ulcers, genital ulcers and erythaema nodosum-like lesions in the skin were assessed. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA, and cytokine production was determined from stimulated mononuclear cells. Inflammatory cytokine secretion and Nod2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation were analysed using the transfected cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>By whole-exome sequencing, we identified a common heterozygous missense mutation in <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic>, a gene known to regulate NF-ÎºB signalling, for which all affected family members carried a heterozygous C243Y mutation in the ovarian tumour domain. Mononuclear cells obtained from the proband and his mother produced large amounts of interleukin 1Î², IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor Î± (TNF-a) on stimulation as compared with those from normal controls. Although inflammatory cytokine secretion was suppressed by wild-type transfected cells, it was suppressed to a much lesser extent by mutated C243Y <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic>-transfected cells. In addition, impaired suppression of Nod2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation by C243Y <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> was observed.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>A C243Y mutation in <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> was likely responsible for increased production of human inflammatory cytokines by reduced suppression of NF-ÎºB activation, and may have accounted for the autosomal-dominant Mendelian mode of BD transmission in this family.</p>

        <title>Patients and family history</title>
        <p>The proband (patient 1) was a 17-year-old Japanese boy who was referred to our hospital with a 5-month history of recurrent painful oral ulcers accompanied by fever, in November 2014. Oral ulcer with fever occurred once every 1â2âweeks, each time lasting for 1â2âweeks. The patient had suffered from frequent oral ulcers from the age of 9âyears. He also had a 1-month history of unknown fever when 13âyears of age and nephrotic syndrome 2âyears later. Since the nephrotic syndrome had relapsed five times after discontinuation of steroid treatment, he was being treated with cyclosporine (175âmg/day) and mizoribine (250âmg/day) as maintenance therapy. Physical examination revealed painful oral ulcers, EN-like lesions on lower extremities, pseudofolliculitis on the trunk and a large painful ulcerative lesion in the perianal area. Laboratory examination revealed white cell counts 9470/Î¼L, neutrophil rate 90.7%, haemoglobin 13.3âg/dL and C reactive protein 0.27âmg/dL (normal &lt;0.1âmg/dL). Serum concentrations of IgG, IgA, IgM and IgD were 1623âmg/dL, 574âmg/dL, 104âmg/dL and 1.3âmg/dL, respectively. Although tests for autoantibodies and HLA-B51 were negative, a skin pathergy examination was positive. A clinical diagnosis of BD was made based on the International Study Group Criteria for BD (criteria for the diagnosis of BD).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The oral ulcers were refractory to colchicine (1.5âmg/day), but responded promptly to the addition of low doses of prednisolone (15âmg/day).</p>
        <p>Including this patient, six patients with BD have existed over four generations in the proband's family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000223F1">figure 1</xref>). Patient 2, the 43-year-old mother of the proband, had also suffered from recurrent oral ulcers from the age of 8âyears. She had been diagnosed as having BD due to recurrent oral and genital ulcers, EN-like lesions and pseudofolliculitis when she was 20âyears of age. Colchicine treatment was unsuccessful. At 28âyears of age, entero-BD was diagnosed based on gastrointestinal symptoms and endoscopic findings of intestinal ulcers, and responded to prednisolone (45 mg/day) and was thereafter controlled by low-dose steroids. Patient 3, the 71-year-old grandmother of the proband, had suffered from recurrent oral ulcers from the age of 8âyears. Oral and genital ulcers, EN-like lesions and pseudofolliculitis with fever manifested frequently, but were resolved by low-dose glucocorticoids. Patient 4, a 42-year-old maternal aunt of the proband, had experienced oral ulcer from the age of 10âyears. She had been diagnosed as having BD based on recurrent oral and genital ulcers, EN-like lesions and pseudofolliculitis, which responded poorly to a single dose of colchicine. Patient 5, an 18-year-old maternal female cousin of the proband, had experienced recurrent episodes of self-resolving oral and genital ulcers, EN-like lesions and pseudofolliculitis, since the age of 12âyears. Patient 6, the proband's maternal great-grandmother, had died at 88âyears of age. She had also suffered from recurrent oral and genital ulcers, and indurated erythaema accompanied by fever, from elementary school age, in spite of colchicine treatment. A history of genital ulcers could not be ascertained. None of the patients had exhibited ocular lesions of BD.</p>

        <title>Whole-exome sequencing</title>
        <p>Whole-exome sequencing was conducted on genomic DNA extracted from mononuclear cells from the proband (patient 1) and his mother (patient 2) (Takara Bio Inc, Mie, Japan). We prepared DNA libraries from 2.0âÎ¼g of genomic DNA, using a Paired-End DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). DNA was fragmented using Covaris technology, and libraries were prepared. We performed target enrichment, using a SureSelect Human All Exon V5 Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). Captured DNA libraries were amplified using supplied paired-end PCR primers. Sequencing was performed with an Illumina HiSeq 2500. We mapped the provided read sequences using BWA-MEN (0.7.10-r789). Alignment with the Genome Reference Consortium human reference 37 was performed with GeneData Expressionist software.</p>

First-strand cDNA copies were synthesised using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) with oligo (dT) (Invitrogen, San Diego, California, USA) as the primer in a total volume of 20âÎ¼L. The following oligonucleotide primers were used: for Î²2-microglobulin (Î²2-MG), 5â²-ACCCCCACTGAAAAAGA-3â² and 5â²-CTCCTAGAGCTACCTGTGGAGCA-3â², and for NLRP3, 5â²-GCCACGCTAATGATCGAC-3â² and 5â²-TGCACAGGCTCAGAATGCTC-3â² sense and antisense, respectively. A quantity of 2âÎ¼L cDNA was amplified using each primer and Taq DNA polymerase by 35 cycles of the following steps: denaturation (94Â°C, 30âs), annealing (57Â°C, 30âs) and elongation (72Â°C, 60âs). The final polymerisation step was extended for another 5âmin. The amplified products were analysed on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualised by ultraviolet light illumination. The relative integrated optical density of the messenger RNA (mRNA) bands was estimated with image processing and analysis in Java.</p>

        <title>Heterozygous C243Y mutation of <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> in patients with autosomal-dominant BD</title>
        <p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed on a Japanese boy (patient 1) born to non-consanguineous parents, and on his mother (patient 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000223F1">figure 1</xref>). The analysed variants were then filtered. Given the family history, we sought for defects with autosomal-dominant inheritance. The first filter, therefore, selected mutations present in a common heterozygous state between patients 1 and 2 in non-synonymous coding, identifying an initial pool of 1311 variants. The second filter selected a frequency of mutated nucleic acid between 0.4 and 0.6. Since we considered that the gene variants had an extremely high penetration rate, we assumed that the frequency of normal individuals carrying the pathogenic mutation was extremely low levels. Thus, we then focused on variants with &lt;0.1% frequency in the Japanese allele frequency data (HGVD Release V.1.42: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/SnpDB/">http://www.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/SnpDB/</ext-link>) and East Asia allele frequency data (ExAC release V.0.3: <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/ExAC_release0.3/ExAC.r0.3.sites.vep.vcf.gz">ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/ExAC_release0.3/ExAC.r0.3.sites.vep.vcf.gz</ext-link>). This resulted in a final set of 43 variants of 32 different genes. <italic>TNFAIP3</italic>, CASP8-associated protein (<italic>CASP8AP2</italic>) and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 precursor (<italic>WIF1</italic>) were the only genes from this set known to be related to inflammation. We focused on the mutation of <italic>TNFAIP3</italic>, also known as <italic>A20</italic>, on chromosome 6, because <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> gene analysis data in multiple genetic studies, functional analyses and the results of knockout mice, have been extremely similar to those in BD pathogenesis.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21â23</xref> Sequence analysis of the coding and non-coding exons of <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> revealed the presence of a heterozygous C243Y mutation (728 G&gt;A) in exon 5 in addition to three nucleotide deletions in an intron of upper exon 3 in the proband. The deletion was not found in the mother (patient 2), suggesting that they were paternally derived (not investigated). Meanwhile, the heterozygous C243Y mutation was present in all familial patients with BD examined, but absent in the healthy sibling and 64 unrelated normal controls of the same Japanese ethnicity. The identified C243Y mutation has been documented in neither the 1000 Genomes project data set (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1000">http://www.1000</ext-link> genomes.org) nor in the Exome Variant Server data base (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>). Thus, the (chr6_138197226_G&gt;A, C243Y) mutation of <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> was suspected to be the gene responsible for autosomal-dominant BD.</p>

        <title>Diminished suppression of Nod2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation by C243Y A20, and the effect on NLRP3 expression</title>
        <p>A20 is a negative regulator of the inflammatory response,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and downregulates Nod signalling by deubiquitination of RIP2.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> To assess if mutated A20 affects Nod2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation through RIP2, WT or C243Y A20 was coexpressed in HEK293T cells with pBxVI-luc, pGL4.74 [hRluc/TK], pcDNA3-Nod2-Flag and pcDNA3-RIP2-myc, and NF-ÎºB luciferase reporter activity was measured and the values were normalised to those of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity. Notably, A20 completely abolishes NF-ÎºB signalling via Nod2 with only a small amount (33âng), while the suppression of NF-ÎºB activation by C243Y A20 was approximately two-thirds that of intact A20 and, therefore, a small amount. Interestingly, transfection with a large amount of C243Y A20 (333âng) completely attenuated NF-ÎºB signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000223F3">figure 3</xref>B). This finding indicates that the A20 variant possessing the C243Y mutation should be regarded as a variant that does not cause complete loss of function, but, rather, causes weak function.</p>
        <p>Recent studies in mouse macrophages lacking A20 suggest that A20 negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome signalling by suppressing production of NLRP3,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and most recently demonstrated the same results in human.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We therefore investigated NLRP3 transcripts in patient or THP-1 cells transfected with the C243Y A20 mutant. NLRP3 transcripts were recognised in the patient's mononuclear cells and THP-1 cells without stimulation. On stimulation, the patient's mononuclear cells did not display a remarkable increased expression of NLRP3 mRNA, but THP-1 cells transfected with the C243Y A20 displayed increase of the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000223F3">figure 3</xref>C).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study revealed that affected individualsâover four generationsâof Japanese familial BD inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner carried a heterozygous C243Y mutation in the OTU domain of <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic>, which has been shown to regulate NF-ÎºB signalling. Patient 1's mononuclear cells produced large amounts of inflammatory cytokines on stimulation, and the C243Y mutant of <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> attenuated the suppression of inflammatory cytokine syntheses by reduced suppression of NF-ÎºB activation.</p>
      <p>Patients 1 and 2 exhibited a very good response to glucocorticoid treatment in comparison with other cases of BD without dominantly inherited traits, although this may have been reflective of their poor response to colchicine. The elevated serum inflammatory cytokines in the proband at presentation became persistently normal soon after the administration of low-dose prednisolone. Since glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of NF-ÎºB activation via induction of the ÎºB Î± inhibitory protein,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> it appears that gene alteration in this autosomal-dominant form of BD is associated with a NF-ÎºB pathway. BD closely resembles Blau syndrome/early-onset sarcoidosis, which are Nod2 gene-associated chronic autoinflammatory diseases characterised by skin rash, arthritis and/or eye involvement, with non-caseating granulomata as their pathological hallmark.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The granulomatous formation present in BD and Blau syndrome may be associated with increased Nod1-mediated/Nod2-mediated NF-ÎºB signalling.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
      <p>We focused on the <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> gene in this autosomal-dominantly transmitted BD family, on the basis of whole-exome sequencing data, <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> mutation analysis of the family members, functional analyses with transfectants and similarities with knockout mice data.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A20 is an ubiquitin-editing enzyme containing aminoterminal deubiquitinating activity mediated by its OTU domain that removes Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains from RIP1/RIP2.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> As the C243Y mutation was within the OTU domain, A20-mediated inhibition by removal of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains from TRAF6 or RIP1/RIP2 may have been causative in this family's BD. These observations were comparable to those of knockout mice with an A20 deficiency that displayed highly secretion of IL-1Î² after stimulation with LPS or poly (I:C).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Most recently, Zhou <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported that heterozygous mutations of <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> were involved in early-onset autoinflammatory disease. Similar to our report, the disease resembled BD manifestations and all dominant mutations were located in OTU domains (one case possessed de novo mutation in zinc finger domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000223F4">figure 4</xref>). The families with BD-like manifestations, described by Zhou <italic>et al</italic>, were of European or Turkish origin. Our family's is the first report of an <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> gene mutation in BD-like symptoms in patients of Asian ancestry. They also clearly demonstrated increased NF-ÎºB activation, increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and defective removal of Lys63-linked ubiquitin from TRAF6, NEMO and RIP1 in <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> mutated cells. We also found attenuation of the suppression of RIP2-mediated NF-ÎºB signalling.</p>

      <p>We observed elevated levels of inflammatory cytokine synthesis in stimulated cells expressing A20 C243Y as compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000223F3">figure 3</xref>A). In this experiment, it is important to assess the amount of exogenous A20 provided compared with that of endogenous A20, which presents normally in THP-1 cells. In our transfection system, transfection efficiency was normalised using Renilla luciferase activity. Therefore, we think that the exogenous amount of WT A20 and C243Y A20 is equal after transfection. We guess that the limited difference seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000223F3">figure 3</xref>A probably arises by the effect of additional WT A20. Since the polyubiquitination of RIP2 was essential for Nod1-mediated/Nod2-mediated NF-ÎºB activation,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> we assessed the ability of mutant A20 C243Y proteins to suppress NF-ÎºB, and found that the variant influenced Nod2-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Considering the results of the luciferase reporter assay, it was interesting that A20 C243Y did not suppress Nod2-induced NF-ÎºB activation completely, as did the WT, but, rather, acted in an apparently dose-dependent manner, indicating that this variant did not cause a complete loss of suppressive function. In contrast to Zhou <italic>et al</italic>'s<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> mutations (nonsense or frameshift), C243Y might cause weaker loss-of-function. Myeloid-specific A20-deficient mice results show spontaneous development of severe destructive rheumatoid arthritis,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> which crucially relies on NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated caspase and IL-1Î² secretion.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In our experiment, we could not confirm the enhanced NLRP3 mRNA, but could confirm elevated NLRP3 mRNA levels in C243Y A20 THP-1 cells on stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2015000223F3">figure 3</xref>C), in patient 1. The discrepancy in NLRP3 inflammasome activity in patients may depend on the individual variation. Given that NF-ÎºB signalling cascades are strictly controlled by several proteins with ubiquitination, and that A20 modulates these processes, the slightly diminished impairment in suppressive function by C243Y may be responsible for persistent inflammation, and could lead to the development of BD.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, genetic and functional analysis of familial BD disclosed that a heterozygous C243Y mutation in the OTU domain of <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> was responsible for the autosomal-dominant inheritance of BD in this Japanese family. The possibility to develop dominantly inherited BD by mutated <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic>, which controls NF-ÎºB, supports the view that, at least, dominantly inherited BD can be regarded as an autoinflammatory syndrome.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The accumulation of more family sets of BD cases and further molecular biological analysis of participation of polyubiquitination may shed light on the pathogenesis of autosomal-dominant BD and provide new clues on the mutation responsible for general BD.</p>
