      <abstract>
        <p>Meiotic recombination is a mandatory process for sexual reproduction. We identified a protein specifically implicated in meiotic homologous recombination that we named: meiosis specific with OB domain (MEIOB). This protein is conserved among metazoan species and contains single-strand DNA binding sites similar to those of RPA1. Our studies <italic>in vitro</italic> revealed that both recombinant and endogenous MEIOB can be retained on single-strand DNA. Those <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrated the specific expression of <italic>Meiob</italic> in early meiotic germ cells and the co-localization of MEIOB protein with RPA on chromosome axes. MEIOB localization in <italic>Dmc1</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> spermatocytes indicated that it accumulates on resected DNA. Homologous <italic>Meiob</italic> deletion in mice caused infertility in both sexes, due to a meiotic arrest at a zygotene/pachytene-like stage. DNA double strand break repair and homologous chromosome synapsis were impaired in <italic>Meiob</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> meiocytes. Interestingly MEIOB appeared to be dispensable for the initial loading of recombinases but was required to maintain a proper number of RAD51 and DMC1 foci beyond the zygotene stage. In light of these findings, we propose that RPA and this new single-strand DNA binding protein MEIOB, are essential to ensure the proper stabilization of recombinases which is required for successful homology search and meiotic recombination.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Homologous recombination allows faithful repair of damaged DNA; in mitotic cells, it necessitates the formation of single strand DNA (ssDNA), which is first protected by RPA and then coated by the RAD51 recombinase to mediate homology search. Specific modifications are made to this mechanism during meiosis, a specialized division that allows halving the ploidy of the genome and the production of haploid gametes. Among others a specialized recombinase DMC1 is added to its somatic paralog RAD51 to perform homology search. We identified a new meiotic protein that we named meiosis specific with OB domains (MEIOB). Our findings indicate that MEIOB binds ssDNA, and we propose that MEIOB is a meiotic paralog of RPA, another OB-domain containing protein. <italic>Meiob</italic> mutant mice were infertile and unable to complete meiotic recombination, most likely due to destabilization of DMC1 and RAD51 in the absence of MEIOB. Meiosis appears thus to be a âgame of two pairsâ using both the canonical players in homologous recombination (RPA and RAD51) and a second set of paralogs (MEIOB and DMC1). Identifying such new players should help clarify some genetic causes of infertility and shed new light on the interplay between the molecular actors involved in maintaining genome stability.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Meiosis is a central process of sexual reproduction. This specialized cell division program allows halving the genome of diploid germ cells to produce haploid gametes. In order to ensure proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division, these must become connected through chiasmata <xref rid="pgen.1003784-BascomSlack1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Crucially, formation of chiasmata depends on the occurrence of inter-homolog crossovers (CO) during the first meiotic prophase. COs originate from the recombination mediated-repair of programmed double strand breaks (DSBs) during meiotic prophase I. Meiotic recombination differs from mitotic recombination in that it uses a chromatid from the homolog instead of the sister chromatid as a template for repair <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Schwacha1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It also favors CO formation and involves specific proteins <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In mice, about 250â300 DSBs are generated during the leptotene stage by the catalytic activity of the conserved topoisomerase-like transesterase SPO11 <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Keeney1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003784-Romanienko1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. DNA ends at DSBs are resected to produce single stranded DNA for homology search <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Only a subset of DSBs form COs, the remaining DSBs being repaired without chromosome arm exchanges. The decision to form or not a CO is thought to be made before or during strand invasion of the homologous chromosome <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This being the case, the nature and the regulation of proteins loaded at broken ends is likely to be important for the outcome of the DSBs. Single-strand DNA (ssDNA) formed during DNA metabolism is coated by the trimeric replication protein A (RPA) complex (composed of RPA1 70 kDa, RPA2 32 kDa, RPA3 14 kDa) serving to protect from degradation and to prevent secondary structure formation. RPA binds ssDNA with high affinity through oligonucleotide binding (OB) domains <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Wold1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Bochkareva1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. During homologous recombination, RPA has to be removed from the 3â²ssDNA of broken ends to allow the formation of a presynaptic nucleofilament. This is essential for homology search and the formation of a physical connection between the invading ssDNA and a homologous duplex DNA template. Whereas mitotic recombination only needs RAD51 to search and invade a homologous sequence, meiotic recombination requires an additional recombinase, the meiosis-specific DMC1 protein <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Neale1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In plants and mammals, the presence of BRCA2, which directly interacts with RAD51 and DMC1, is necessary for their localization, however, the exact mechanisms involved in RAD51 and DMC1 loading during meiosis remain to be determined <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Sharan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003784-Siaud1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Working models based on data mainly obtained in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> proposed that Rad51 is essential for proper Dmc1 loading and that Rad51 recombinase activity has to be inhibited to favor the homolog search bias <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Cloud1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003784-Tsubouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>An event tightly associated with meiotic recombination is the pairing of homologous chromosomes through the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC). SC is a tripartite structure comprising two lateral or axial elements (AE) and a central element. Early during the leptotene stage an AE is formed along each chromosome. However, it is only after successful homology search, that complete synapsis between homologs is observed connecting the AEs of homologous chromosomes with transverse filaments at the pachytene stage <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Zickler1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Fraune1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Subsequently, proper SC formation is required to the integrity of CO formation <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Page1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Kouznetsova1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In order to better understand the complex events that occur during meiosis, it is crucial to identify the specific proteins required for meiotic recombination. Hereby, we characterized a conserved and meiosis-specific protein containing ssDNA binding domains homologous to those of RPA1. We named this protein meiosis-specific with OB domains (MEIOB) in vertebrates. In fly, mutation of the likely <italic>Meiob</italic> gene homolog <italic>hold'em</italic> (<italic>hdm</italic>) reduces meiotic crossover formation and sensitizes somatic cells to DNA-damaging agents <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Joyce1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Unlike MEIOB, hdm activity is not specific to meiosis. In the present work, we demonstrate that murine <italic>Meiob</italic> is specifically required after DSB formation during early steps of meiosis to ensure proper DSB repair by homologous recombination, a prerequisite for efficient crossover formation and male and female fertility.</p>

        <p>To identify candidate genes possibly contributing to meiosis, we performed a transcriptome analysis of magnetic-activated cell sorted (SSEA1+) male and female embryonic germ cells at 13.5 days post-coÃ¯tum (dpc). At this stage, female but no male germ cells enter meiosis. We identified <italic>Meiob</italic> (referred to as <italic>RIKEN cDNA 4930528F23 gene</italic> at the time) among the most differentially expressed genes in female germ cells (complete data set will be published elsewhere). The <italic>Meiob</italic> murine gene is located on chromosome 17 and is composed of 14 exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003784.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) coding for a predicted protein of 470 amino acids.

        <p>RT-qPCR analysis of <italic>Meiob</italic> transcription pattern in adult and fetal tissues detected <italic>Meiob</italic> transcripts exclusively in fetal ovary, postnatal testis and liver (Figures S2A and S2B). In the mouse ovary, <italic>Meiob</italic> expression started at 12.5 dpc, reached a maximum at 15.5 dpc and decreased to become undetectable in post natal life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In testes, <italic>Meiob</italic> expression started at 10 days post partum (dpp), reached a maximum at 20 dpp and was maintained throughout adult life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This expression profile was in accordance with previously published data screening genes expressed in spermatogenic cells <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Kogo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

        <p>We next investigated which cell type expressed <italic>Meiob</italic> in the gonads using fluorescence activated cell sorted (FACS) germ and somatic cells from 13.5 dpc <italic>Oct4-GFP</italic> ovaries. <italic>Meiob</italic> expression levels were 112 fold higher in germ cells compared to somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).

During the pachytene stage, Î³H2AX labels the sex body containing the X and Y chromosomes that can only pair on a limited portion called the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR).

        <p>The MEIOB being related to RPA1, a conserved ssDNA binding protein, we hypothesize that MEIOB too may bind ssDNA. To investigate whether MEIOB OB-domains confer any ssDNA binding activity, we performed ssDNA and double-strand DNA (dsDNA) oligonucleotide pull-down assays using recombinant tagged-MEIOB protein produced in a cell-free system. Pull-down assays performed with biotin 60-mer revealed a significantly greater retention of tagged-MEIOB protein on ssDNA than on dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). A similar experiment carried out with whole testis protein extract indicated that the endogenous protein also preferentially binds ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Of note, MEIOB binding efficiency on ssDNA increased with oligonucleotide length as 30 mer ssDNA retained two fold less MEIOB than did 60 mer ssDNA.

However, some foci appeared solely stained for MEIOB. Respectively, 71, 76 and 86% of RPA2 foci were stained for MEIOB and 26, 49 and 61% of MEIOB foci were stained for RPA2 at leptotene, zygotene and early pachytene stages. MEIOB staining was retrieved in most RAD51 or DMC1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), particularly in the early pachytene stage when over 80% of RAD51 or DMC1 foci were stained for MEIOB (Figures S6B and S6A). On the other hand, only about half of the MEIOB foci were stained for RAD51 or DMC1.

        <p>As defects in <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> occur during meiosis prophase I, we first investigated bivalent chromosome formation in wild type and <italic>Meiob</italic> null meiocytes. Homologous chromosomes pair and become connected along their lengths by synaptonemal complexes (SCs). AE formation is stained by SYCP3 initiated along the shared cores of sister chromatid pairs during leptotene. During zygotene a zipper like connection (stained by SYCP1) between the two AEs is initiated and completed by pachytene to fully connect homologous chromosomes. As illustrated on chromosome spreads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g006">figure 6</xref>, the linear co-staining of SYCP3 and SYCP1 reflects fully synapsed bivalents in pachytene wild type spermatocytes. In <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> spermatocytes, as shown with SYCP3 staining, formation of AE appear to be unaffected as cells progress from leptotene to zygotene stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However, no cell with complete synapsis could be observed in adult testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g006">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>).

        <title>DNA DSB repair is impaired during meiosis in <italic>Meiob</italic> mutants</title>
        <p>DSB formation and repair is essential during prophase I of meiosis. We monitored these events using Î³H2AX staining, Î³H2AX being a marker of DNA DSB <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Rogakou1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Celeste1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

Analysis of chromosome spreads of spermatocytes from wild type and <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice confirmed the presence of Î³H2AX in leptotene and zygotene cells suggesting that DNA DSBs are normally formed. In all observed chromosome spreads of pachytene-like spermatocytes from <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice, the Î³H2AX signal was maintained whereas it had disappeared as expected in pachytene spermatocytes from wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Additionally, in the <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> pachytene-like spermatocytes, no structure resembling the sex body was formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). In 1 dpp ovaries, wild type oocytes are mostly in late pachynema and diplonema and none are stained for Î³H2AX whereas <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> oocytes retained a robust Î³H2AX-staining at this age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003784.s010">Figure S10</xref>).

<italic>Meiob</italic> mutants are defective for meiotic homologous recombination</title>
        <p>Taking into account MEIOB spatial and temporal localization and its requirement for proper DSB repair, we investigated homologous recombination in <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> spermatocytes through immunolocalization of RPA2, RAD51, DMC1 and MLH1. In <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> leptotene and zygotene/pachytene-like cells, RPA foci were formed on chromosome axes and in normal abundance when compared to wild type equivalent stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g008">Figures 8A and 8B</xref>). This equally confirms that DNA DSBs were produced with no overt defect in the absence of MEIOB. Immunolocalizations of RAD51 and DMC1 were performed with antibodies recognizing specifically RAD51 or DMC1. In <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> leptotene stage spermatocytes, RAD51 and DMC1 foci were localized on chromosome axes with no overt differences in comparison to wild type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g009">Figure 9</xref>). In wild type zygotene stage these foci were maintained and their numbers decreased over the course of the pachytene stage. However in <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic>, we observed a massive decrease in both RAD51 and DMC1 stainings at zygotene and pachytene-like stages. By comparison with wild type, the number of RAD51 and DMC1 foci respectively decreased by 70% and 69% at mid-zygotene in <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Measurement of RAD51 and DMC1 foci intensities indicated no significant change in the mean intensity during leptotene and zygotene stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003784.s011">Figure S11A</xref>). Intense (high and medium) foci tended to decrease first in mid-zygotene and all foci intensely and mildly (low) stained considerably decreased in late zygotene/pachytene like stage in Meiob<sup>â/â</sup> spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003784.s011">Figure S11B</xref>). These data indicate that while the formation of RAD51 and DMC1 foci is unaltered in <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mutants, their stabilization is impaired. The absence of synapsis, the persistence of Î³H2AX and the reduction of RAD51 and DMC1 foci observed in the absence of MEIOB suggest a strong defect in recombination with consequential impairment of CO formation. To test this hypothesis we investigated CO formation using MLH1 immunostaining. MLH1 is believed to mark future CO sites in mid-to-late pachytene, and is essential at the late stages of recombination in the formation of CO <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Guillon1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. As expected at least one MLH1 focus was observed per bivalent chromosome in wild type pachytene spermatocytes. In contrast, no MLH1 foc1 were observed in <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). This likely reflects a blockade prior to mid-pachytene preventing thus CO formation. <italic>Meiob</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> oocytes are eliminated at a developmental time-point where most wild type oocytes reached a stage beyond pachytene. This allowed us to address whether MEIOB is required or not for the formation of MLH1 foci in cells that likely correspond to pachytene stage based on the developmental time-course of wild type cells. Many oocytes are in pachytene stage, and have MLH1 foci in wild type 17.5 dpc embryos. Interestingly we were unable to observe bright MLH1 foci along the AEs in the oocytes of 17.5 dpc <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). Altogether these data suggest that MEIOB may be involved in both early/homology search ârelated and possibly also in later/post-homology search steps of meiotic recombination and CO formation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have identified a new major player in mammalian meiosis and in particular have demonstrated for the first time an absolute requirement of MEIOB for meiosis prophase I completion in the mouse. The expression profile and deletion of <italic>Meiob</italic> indicated a specific role for this protein during meiosis prophase I. Furthermore, our data indicate that MEIOB is mandatory for DSB repair and crossover formation. MEIOB also appears to favor faithful and complete synapsis. As observed with other mutant mice in which these steps are impaired, these defects caused meiotic arrest, meiocyte death by apoptosis and infertility. The complete infertility of both male and female mice indicates that <italic>Meiob</italic> is one of the core genes required for meiosis, as the deletion of other meiotic genes in mice sometimes only induces male infertility <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Sharan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Hakem1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003784-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In summary, this mammalian meiotic mutant impairs meiotic recombination in both male and female and impairs RAD51 and DMC1 stabilization.</p>
      <p>Our data support the idea that MEIOB binds ssDNA. First, protein domain prediction proposed that MEIOB contains three ssDNA binding domains, denoted OB domains, similar to those of RPA1 known to have a high affinity for ssDNA <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Fanning1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Second, <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding assays demonstrated that MEIOB is particularly retained by ssDNA. Moreover, MEIOB foci formed along AE and colocalized to a large extent with RPA which marks ssDNA filament <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Alani1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Moens1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The number of foci corresponded to the expected number of DNA DSBs generated by SPO11 and no MEIOB foci were observed in the absence of SPO11-mediated DSBs. Lastly, when 3â²ssDNA accumulated (i.e. in <italic>Dmc1</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup>, in the absence of strand invasion) MEIOB colocalized almost perfectly with both RPA and ATR, known to sense ssDNA <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Cimprich1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Ichijima1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Altogether these results lead us to propose that the MEIOB protein binds ssDNAs generated during the 5â² to 3â² resection of DNA ends at meiotic DSB sites. We thus propose that MEIOB may be an RPA paralog specifically required for meiotic recombination. Although the data in the present study do not formally prove that the ssDNA binding activity of MEIOB is required for meiosis, this is an appealing hypothesis that needs pursuing in future studies.</p>

In <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> meiocytes the number of DSBs appears unaffected as we observed the expected number of RPA foci <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Moens1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and the RAD51 and DMC1 foci were formed but did not persist. These observations point towards the lack of MEIOB primarily causing a defect in the process of recombination. Unfortunately, due to their embryonic lethality, most mutations that impair homologous recombination have not been characterized during mammalian meiosis. Notably, the lethality of <italic>Rad51</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> disallows the comparison of <italic>Meiob</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> to these murine meiocytes. Of note, we would like to point out that <italic>Meiob</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> phenotype is similar to that of <italic>Dmc1</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Pittman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However in the <italic>Dmc1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> spermatocytes, RAD51 persists in the pachytene-like stage in contrast to that observed in <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1003784-Pittman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003784.s012">Figure S12</xref>). Interestingly, in <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> pachytene-like cells, despite the absence of RAD51 and DMC1 foci, we observed abundant and brighter RPA foci and strong Î³H2AX staining indicating the presence of unrepaired DSBs and of ssDNA. We thus conclude that the transitory loading of RAD51 and DMC1 observed in <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> is insufficient to allow the completion of homology search, homolog alignment and SC formation. As RAD51 recombinase activity is believed to be inactivated during meiotic recombination, DMC1 is proposed to catalyze homology search and strand exchange of most meiotic recombination events <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Bishop3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Thus, in the <italic>Meiob</italic> mutant, DMC1 would appear to have been prevented from performing its role due to its precocious destabilization. To our knowledge, no murine meiotic mutant has yet presented such a phenotype with a premature disappearance of RAD51 and DMC1 before pachynema.</p>
      <p>The formation of RAD51-DNA presynaptic filament is promoted by BRCA2 in mammals to overcome the inhibitory effect on the heterotrimeric RPA <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Siaud2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. BRCA2 is known to bind both RAD51 and DMC1; <italic>Brca2</italic>
<sup>â/â;Tg</sup> have an impaired number of RAD51 and DMC1 foci in leptotene and zygotene mouse spermatocytes <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Sharan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Thus the <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> defect does not seem to involve BRCA2 in a general manner as one would then have also expected an earlier defect in the loading of RAD51 and DMC1. Moreover, the growing percentage of RAD51 and DMC1 foci that are stained for MEIOB at late zygotene and early pachytene stages support a later role of MEIOB on the activity of recombinases. In this line, biochemical findings raise the possibility that the maintenance of RAD51 presynaptic filament <italic>in vivo</italic> might involve some RAD51 accessory factors such as RAD54, HOP2-MND1 and recently the SWI5-SFR1 complex <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003784-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The spermatocyte defects observed in <italic>Rad54<sup>â/â</sup></italic> and <italic>Hop2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice differ from those observed in the <italic>Meiob</italic> mutant. Indeed meiotic recombination is only slightly affected in <italic>Rad54<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice which in turn show no major fertility defect <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Wesoly1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In <italic>Hop2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice, despite a failure of meiotic recombination, RAD51 and DMC1 foci accumulate and persist through the pachytene-like stage <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Petukhova1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The role of SWI5-SFR1 has to date only been investigated in mouse embryonic stem cells <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Akamatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, however genetic studies in yeast have found evidence for the SWI5-SFR1 yeast orthologs Mei5 and Sae3, being involved in meiotic recombination <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Hayase1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, thereby suggesting that the mammalian SWI5-SFR1 may also play a role in meiotic recombination. Interestingly, this complex is devoid of DNA-binding activity in mice <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> whereas their respective orthologs Mei5 and Sae3 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> possess DNA-binding activity <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Say1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Furthermore, the expression of Mei5 and Sae3 is restricted to meiosis and mediates Dmc1 activity by enhancing its ability to form nucleofilaments on ssDNA <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Ferrari1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. One may reasonably speculate therefore that MEIOB may influence the stability of the RAD51-DMC1 filament in cooperation with SWI5-SFR1 or a meiotic counterpart. Such a hypothesis will of course require further investigation. Of note, SWI5-SFR1 and Mei5-Sae3 complexes directly interact with RAD51 <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Say1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. We were unable to detect a direct interaction between MEIOB and RAD51 (data not shown). However our experiments were performed in a heterologous system and with an overexpressed protein, thus we cannot formally allow us to exclude a direct interaction between MEIOB and RAD51. Finally, we propose that the presence of two ssDNA binding proteins, namely RPA and MEIOB, confers special properties to resected DNA allowing the proper stabilization of two proteins on the meiotic presynaptic filament: DMC1 and RAD51. Along this line, one may consider MEIOB as a new meiotic-specific mediator for RAD51/DMC1.</p>
      <p>While meiosis recombination is a conserved process in eukaryotes, there are clear differences among organisms <xref rid="pgen.1003784-LaVolpe1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Interestingly, yeast, plants and <italic>C. elegans</italic> do not have a <italic>Meiob</italic> homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). One may therefore consider that in these organisms, either meiosis is achieved via slightly different mechanisms or the function of MEIOB is performed by other proteins. For instance, in plants, there are multiple copies of RPA1 (RPA1-like proteins) <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Ishibashi1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Shultz1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> some of which may assume the role of MEIOB. In plants, RPA1-like proteins have been proposed to form part of trimeric RPA complexes alongside RPA2 and 3 sub-units <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>; to our knowledge no such additional sub-units are conserved among vertebrates and the analysis of transcriptomic data did not allow us to pin point any meiosis-specific additional RPA2-like protein in mice. We therefore propose that either MEIOB acts with the canonical RPA2 and 3 (thus replacing RPA1) or by its own and possibly with different partners. The only <italic>Meiob</italic> homolog that has been described previously is <italic>hold'em</italic> (<italic>hdm</italic>) in Drosophila <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Joyce1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> that is implicated in crossover formation. However <italic>hdm<sup>â/â</sup></italic> fly and <italic>Meiob</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice present drastic divergence during meiosis suggesting that their function may have diverged during evolution. Indeed in <italic>hdm</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> flies, some crossovers still occur though with lower frequencies compared to wild-type fly and the DSBs are repaired though with a delay. Furthermore, hdm is also involved in DNA repair in somatic cells <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Joyce1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> while <italic>Meiob</italic> is almost exclusively expressed in meiotic germ cells. Joyce <italic>et al.</italic> also provided evidence that hdm physically interacts with Ercc1, a member of the exchange class of gene products, and proposed that the Ercc1/Mei9/Mus81/hdm complex functions in the meiotic recombination pathway to resolve DSB-repair intermediates into crossovers <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Joyce1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This function appears to be required later by comparison to the here-described recruitment of MEIOB to DSB sites. Furthermore, such an interaction is unlikely to explain the entirety of <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> phenotype described here. Indeed, in mice, <italic>Ercc1</italic> deletion does not prevent synapsis or sex body formation and males are able to produce few spermatozoa albeit with DNA damage <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Hsia1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. We thus conclude that, in mice, the function of MEIOB is not through an interaction with ERCC1 in late recombination nodules and that additional partners need to be identified. On the other hand, one could also argue that this may be due to the meiotic process itself having slightly different requirements in-between mammals and drosophila. Therefore, we cannot exclude an additional role of MEIOB in CO resolution. Such a role could be responsible of the late staining observed for MEIOB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003784-g002">Figures 2B and 2C</xref>). In this line we could speculate that MEIOB might target additional ssDNA sites such as the D-loop intermediate, as it is thought for RPA <xref rid="pgen.1003784-Burgoyne1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, or the second end of the DSB (i.e. the one not involved in the initial homology search), that are formed during the process of CO. The second end is released to be captured on the recombination intermediate to form a double holiday junction (dHJ). This would fit with our reports of rare cells displaying some amount of pairing, thus having performed the initial homology search (first end), and with the complete lack of MLH1 foci observed in <italic>Meiob<sup>â/â</sup></italic> cells. Such a speculative proposition might also be fueled by the persistent colocalizsation of MEIOB with recombinases and will require additional studies. Putative MEIOB partners are under investigation and their identification should help define the precise function of MEIOB during meiotic recombination and the mechanisms allowing recombinase stabilization in this process.</p>
