      <abstract>
        <p>Glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant protein (GARP) associates with latent transforming growth factor-Î² (proTGFÎ²) on the surface of T regulatory cells and platelets; however, whether GARP functions in latent TGFÎ² activation and the structural basis of coassociation remain unknown. We find that Cys-192 and Cys-331 of GARP disulfide link to the TGFÎ²1 prodomain and that GARP with C192A and C331A mutations can also noncovalently associate with proTGFÎ²1. Noncovalent association is sufficiently strong for GARP to outcompete latent TGFÎ²-binding protein for binding to proTGFÎ²1. Association between GARP and proTGFÎ²1 prevents the secretion of TGFÎ²1. Integrin Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> and to a lesser extent Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>8</sub> are able to activate TGFÎ² from the GARPâproTGFÎ²1 complex. Activation requires the RGD motif of latent TGFÎ², disulfide linkage between GARP and latent TGFÎ², and membrane association of GARP. Our results show that GARP is a latent TGFÎ²-binding protein that functions in regulating the bioavailability and activation of TGFÎ².</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transforming growth factor-Î² (TGFÎ²) is a pleiotropic cytokine with potent immunoregulatory properties, which manifests in TGFÎ²1-knockout mice as multifocal inflammatory disorders and death within 4 wk of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Shull <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Kulkarni <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). TGFÎ²1 is produced by every leukocyte lineage and controls the differentiation, proliferation, and other functions of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Yoshimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). For example, TGFÎ² is involved in the generation and function of T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper 17 cells (Th17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Veldhoen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). TGFÎ² also induces the expression of Î±<sub>E</sub>Î²<sub>7</sub> integrin in intraepithelial lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kilshaw and Murant, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cepek <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). In addition, TGFÎ² regulates immunoglobulin A isotype expression in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Coffman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>).</p><p>TGFÎ²1, 2, and 3 are synthesized as precursor polypeptides (pro+TGFÎ²), which dimerize and are proteolytically cleaved by furin prior to secretion to yield pro-TGFÎ². (Here we use pro-TGFÎ² for furin-cleaved latent TGFÎ², pro+TGFÎ² for uncleaved latent TGFÎ², and proTGFÎ² to refer to the cDNA or a mixture of pro-TGFÎ² and pro+TGFÎ² protein products.) Pro-TGFÎ² contains a â¼250-residue prodomain known as latency-associated peptide (LAP) and a â¼110-residue mature TGFÎ² growth factor domain. The prodomain remains noncovalently associated with TGFÎ² after secretion, thereby conferring latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Gentry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Wakefield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Khalil, 1999</xref>). Latent TGFÎ² does not have biological activity, and the release of TGFÎ² from LAP therefore is a critical regulatory step for TGFÎ² function and signaling. The LAPs of TGFÎ²1, 2, and 3 are denoted LAP1, 2, and 3, respectively.</p><p>LAP1 and LAP3 contain an RGD motif, which is recognized by some Î±<sub>V</sub> integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rifkin, 2005</xref>). Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> and Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>8</sub> activate TGFÎ² through binding to the RGD motif; mice lacking both Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> and Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>8</sub> integrins recapitulate all major phenotypes of TGFÎ²1 and Î²3 double-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aluwihare <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), demonstrating the critical roles of Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> and Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>8</sub> in TGFÎ²1 and Î²3 activation. Furthermore, knock-in mice with the RGD motif of TGFÎ²1 mutated to RGE phenotypically resemble mice with complete deficiency of TGFÎ²1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Therefore, although multiple mechanisms that include thrombospondin and metalloproteases have been implicated in activation of TGFÎ²1 and TGFÎ²3, recognition by Î±<sub>V</sub> integrins of the RGD motif has a central role in activation in vivo.</p><p>The latent TGFÎ²-binding proteins (LTBPs) are important in the biosynthesis, storage, and activation of TGFÎ² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rifkin, 2005</xref>). Association with and disulfide linkage to LTBP targets proTGFÎ² to the extracellular matrix (ECM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Miyazono <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>). There are four different LTBPs, and at least three of them bind to proTGFÎ². LTBPs are large proteins related to fibrillins, which have a large number of calcium-binding epidermal growth factorâlike domains and a smaller number of TGFÎ²-binding (TB) domains. One of these TB domains specifically associates with proTGFÎ², and two cysteines in the TB domain disulfide link to Cys-4 in each of the prodomains, yielding an unusual 1:2 LTBP:proTGFÎ²-monomer stoichiometry. Other domains in LTBPs cause them to coassemble with fibrillins in elastic fibrils in the ECM, where latent TGFÎ² is stored until activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rifkin, 2005</xref>). Association with the ECM and the Î²<sub>6</sub> cytoplasmic domain is required for latent TGFÎ² activation by Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub>, and it has been suggested that tensile force exerted across the complex by the actin cytoskeleton is also required for activation by Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Annes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Wipff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Wipff and Hinz, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The structure of latent TGFÎ² is ring-like. The two prodomains form two arms, which are disulfide linked in a bowtie at a neck and have RGD motifs in their shoulders. The growth factor monomers locate to the forearms. They are surrounded by a prodomain straightjacket element that includes an Î±1-helix, a latency lasso, and a clasp between the arm domain and the Î±1-helix. The Cys-4 residues in the Î±1-helix that link to LTBP, and RGD motifs that bind to integrins, locate to opposite sides of the ring, so that tensile force exerted across them would elongate the Î±1-helix and latency lasso and release TGFÎ². The structure is incompatible with binding of either type I or type II receptor to TGFÎ² in its latent form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recently glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant protein (GARP, also known as LRRC32) was shown to associate with LAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Stockis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, whether GARP functions analogously to LTBP in TGFÎ² activation is unknown, and there are numerous distinctions between these proteins. First, the four LTBP isoforms are broadly expressed in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rifkin, 2005</xref>), whereas GARP expression has only been detected in activated (FoxP3<sup>+</sup>) Tregs and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Macaulay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Second, LTBP targets proTGFÎ² into the ECM, whereas GARP has a transmembrane domain and associates with LAP on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Stockis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Finally, the LAP-binding motif in LTBP is a TB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rifkin, 2005</xref>), whereas the extracellular domain of GARP is composed of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and it has no TB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Ollendorff <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). The role of LTBP in TGFÎ² assembly and activation is well established; association of proTGFÎ² with LTBP and incorporation of LTBP into the ECM are required for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rifkin, 2005</xref>). Association between GARP and LAP has been shown by immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by Western blotting, and binding of GARP-Fc to proTGFÎ² was shown by fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>); however, whether they are covalently linked by disulfide bonds is unknown. Small interfering RNA to GARP has been shown to decrease surface expression of LAP and to moderately decrease Treg-mediated suppression in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, whether a proTGFÎ² complex with GARP can provide a cell-surface reservoir of latent TGFÎ² for Î±<sub>V</sub> integrinâdependent activation and how GARP coexpression affects secretion and bioavailability of TGFÎ² remain unknown. Here we address gaps in understanding of the role of GARP in TGFÎ² function. Our findings support the idea that GARP is a new latent TGFÎ²-binding protein that regulates the bioavailability of TGFÎ² and provides a cell surface platform for Î±<sub>V</sub> integrinâdependent TGFÎ² activation.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>GARP associates with proTGFÎ²</title><p>To study their interaction, we transiently expressed GARP and proTGFÎ²1 in 293T cells. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Stockis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), the expression level of LAP on the cell surface was greatly elevated in the presence of GARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom). In addition, GARP and LAP coimmunoprecipitated in cotransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). An â¼250-kDa species representing the GARPâproTGFÎ²1 complex was detected in the cotransfected cells on a 7.5% nonreduced SDSâPAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that GARP forms a disulfide linkage with proTGFÎ²1. ProTGFÎ²1 and LAP secretion was detected in the supernatant of cells transfected with proTGFÎ²1 alone but not in the supernatant of cells cotransfected with GARP and proTGFÎ²1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that GARP blocks direct secretion of pro+TGFÎ²1 and pro-TGFÎ²1.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>GARP regulates the secretion of TGFÎ²1 by forming a complex with proTGFÎ²1 on the cell surface.

Cys-4 in each proTGFÎ²1 disulfide links to LTBP, and the proTGFÎ²1 C4S mutant is unable to bind to LTBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Saharinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). In contrast, we found that GARP was able to noncovalently associate with the proTGFÎ²1 C4S mutant. The C4S mutant increased LAP expression in cotransfectants similar to wild-type (WT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, both WT and C4S pro+TGFÎ²1 associated with GARP, as shown by coIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, WT proTGFÎ²1 formed an â¼250-kDa complex with GARP in nonreducing SDSâPAGE, whereas C4S proTGFÎ²1 failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). GARP greatly attenuated the amount of secreted proTGFÎ²1 and LAP both for WT and the C4S mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, GARP essentially completely prevented secretion of WT proTGFÎ²1, whereas there was some leakage of C4S mutant proTGFÎ²1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus covalent linkage is important for complete association. Formation of disulfide bonds is aberrant in proTGFÎ²1 when Cys-4 is present in the absence of LTBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Brunner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>), and this may account for the difference in size of products in the 100- to 75-kDa range between WT and C4S proTGFÎ²1 in nonreducing SDSâPAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggested that GARP disulfide links to the Cys-4 of proTGFÎ²1 and that GARP also associates relatively stably with proTGFÎ²1 through noncovalent interactions.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Cys-4 of TGFÎ²1 disulfide links to GARP.

In choosing candidates for linkage to proTGFÎ²1, we excluded cysteines that are not conserved across species from fish to mammals or that aligned with cysteines in the N-cap or C-cap regions of structurally characterized LRR proteins that are known to form intra- chain disulfide bonds. This left three candidate cysteinesâCys-192, Cys-331, and Cys-417âwhich were tested by mutation to alanine. The C417A mutation abolished surface expression of GARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, C417A GARP associated with proTGFÎ²1 inside the cell, as shown by IP of cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The C417A mutant diminished amounts of free proTGFÎ²1 and LAP in cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) and completely prevented secretion of proTGFÎ²1 and LAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).

The GARP C192A, C331A, and C192A/C331A double mutants were expressed at similar levels on the cell surface, and the mutants were able to support surface LAP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, all the GARP mutants were able to noncovalently associate with proTGFÎ²1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, the C192A/C331A double mutant was unable to form the disulfide-linked complex with proTGFÎ²1 seen in nonreducing SDSâPAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The complex formed by proTGFÎ²1 and C192A or C331A single mutants migrated slightly differently than the complex formed by WT GARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). These differences in migration are expected based on the difference in topology between LAP dimers linked through two disulfides to GARP or through one disulfide at different positions on the GARP polypeptide. Either one of the two GARP cysteines, Cys-192 or Cys-331, was sufficient to prevent secretion of proTGFÎ²1 and LAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Lack of both GARP cysteines resulted in proTGFÎ²1 and LAP secretion; however, secretion was less than in absence of GARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), consistent with noncovalent association between C192A/C331A GARP and proTGFÎ²1. These results were similar to those seen with GARP and the proTGFÎ²1 C4S mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).

In the present study, we characterized the structural basis and functional significance of the interaction between GARP and TGFÎ² and defined a critical role for GARP in regulating bioavailability of TGFÎ².</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated coassociation of GARP and proTGFÎ² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Stockis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and yet the structural basis for this interaction was not clear. Here we present the first demonstration that GARP disulfide links with proTGFÎ²1 and that noncovalent bonds are also sufficient for association. The disulfide interaction was mediated by Cys-192 and Cys-331 of GARP and Cys-4 of proTGFÎ²1, suggesting that one GARP protein associates with one proTGFÎ²1 dimer. Such a complex has an estimated polypeptide molecular mass of 153,200 Da; with 11 N-linked sites at 2500 Da each, the estimated mass is 180,700 Da, close to the mass measured by multiangle light scattering of 176,000 Â± 3500 Da. Although the disulfide linkage is not required for GARPâproTGFÎ² association, the noncovalent interaction between GARP and proTGFÎ²1 alone could not stably present proTGFÎ²1 on the cell surface because in the absence of the disulfide linkage, GARP was unable to prevent proTGFÎ²1 from leaking into the supernatant.</p><p>We defined by EM and confirmed with a homology model the structure of the complex between GARP and proTGFÎ². Cys-192 and Cy-s331 are located in the 7th and 12th LRR of GARP, respectively. The distance between the two CÎ± atoms of Cys-192 and Cys-331 in our GARP homology model is â¼35 Ã, whereas the distance between the two CÎ± atoms of the two C4S mutant residues of our proTGFÎ²1 homodimer crystal structure is â¼40 Ã (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; Protein Data Bank [PDB] code, 3RJR). Thus disulfide linkage of Cys-192 and Cys-331 in GARP with the two Cys-4 residues in proTGFÎ²1 is structurally feasible. Negative-stain class averages showed overall similarity between noncovalent sGARPâproTGFÎ²1 C4S and covalent sGARPâproTGFÎ²1 complexes, although the appearance of the sGARP moiety was variable. The class averages and the positions of disulfide-linked cysteines in GARP are consistent with the disulfide linkage of the ring of proTGFÎ²1 to the side of GARP, with the planes of the proTGFÎ²1 ring and the GARP horseshoe more normal to one another than coplanar. Thus, with the proTGFÎ²1 ring lying flat on the EM carbon substrate, the large horseshoe of GARP may collapse at variable orientations onto the substrate. Although GARP may have some flexibility, flexibility was not evident in previous EM studies of GARP alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Probst-Kepper <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Two integrin Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> molecules could bind simultaneously to the proTGFÎ²1âGARP complex. The orientations around the proTGFÎ²1 ring were as predicted based on locations of RGD motifs and Cys-4 residues in the crystal structure of latent TGFÎ². As previously described for latent TGFÎ², Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> bound in the extended-open, high-affinity conformation, and the affinity for the proTGFÎ²1âGARP complex is unusually high for an integrin, allowing isolation by gel filtration under nonactivating conditions, that is, in buffer with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, there was no evidence for disruption of the ring-like structure of proTGFÎ² upon Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> integrin binding, and TGFÎ² remained present in the complex, as shown by SDSâPAGE. This suggests that binding of Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> is not sufficient to release TGFÎ² from the GARPâproTGFÎ² complex, as previously reported for proTGFÎ² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Both GARP and LTBP disulfide link to the same cysteine, Cys-4, in proTGFÎ²1. We found that GARP strongly outcompetes LTBP1 for associating with proTGFÎ²1. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, in cells transfected with equal cDNA amounts of GARP, proTGFÎ²1, and LTBP1, GARP but not LTBP1 became associated with proTGFÎ²1. Second, whereas GARP presents proTGFÎ²1 on the cell surface and LTBP localizes proTGFÎ²1 to the ECM, LAP was present on the cell surface in GARP-, proTGFÎ²1-, and LTBP1-cotransfected cells; furthermore, GARP abolished coassociation of LTBP and LAP in cell supernatants. Third, ECR3E, the LAP-binding motif in LTBP1 that was previously shown to interfere with the interaction between LTBP and proTGFÎ²1 and block activation by Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Annes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), failed to block Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub>-mediated TGFÎ² activation from the GARPâpro-TGFÎ²1 complex.</p><p>TGFÎ² regulates immune responses primarily by inducing tolerance and controlling inflammatory responses. For instance, TGFÎ² induces Treg generation and mediates Treg infectious tolerance through cellâcell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Andersson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). On the other hand, integrins are important in TGFÎ² activation and immune regulation. Notably, loss of Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>8</sub> in dendritic cells (DCs) causes severe inflammatory bowel disease and age-related autoimmunity in mice, due to their inability to induce and maintain tissue Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Travis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Yet it was unclear how the integrin mediates Treg generation. Recently GARP was found to be substantially and specifically upregulated in Tregs among lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Oida and Weiner, 2010</xref>). GARP expression was shown to correlate with Treg suppressive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>); silencing GARP in Tregs significantly impaired the suppressive activity of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Probst-Kepper <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Of importance, a GARP-Fc fusion protein rescued the suppressive function of TGFÎ²-induced Tregs in NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">D'Alise <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), suggesting that proTGFÎ² presentation by GARP plays a pivotal role in Treg function.</p><p>In the present study, we found that Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> and Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>8</sub> integrins could activate TGFÎ² from the GARPâproTGFÎ²1 complex. This activation was highly specific because it was not given by integrins Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>1</sub>, Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>3</sub>, and Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>5</sub> expressed at comparable levels on the cell surface. Specificity was further demonstrated by ability of RGD peptide, but not RGE peptide, to completely abolish Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub>-mediated TGFÎ² activation. We further showed that a secreted form of GARP was unable to support Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub>- and Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>8</sub>-mediated TGFÎ² activation, demonstrating that cell-surface GARP contributes to this activation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a molecularly defined form of TGFÎ² has been shown to be activated on cell surfaces and the first time that a molecularly defined mechanism, through Î±<sub>V</sub> integrins, has been demonstrated for activation of cell-surface TGFÎ². TGFÎ² activated from the GARPâproTGFÎ² complex in Tregs may convert nearby naive cells to Tregs. Our study therefore supports a possibility that Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>8</sub> expressed by DCs releases TGFÎ² from the GARPâproTGFÎ² complex in Tregs via cellâcell contact, which in turn induces a larger Treg pool through the infectious tolerance mechanism. TGFÎ² also contributes to Th17 generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Veldhoen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Recently Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>8</sub> expressed by DCs was implicated to regulate Th17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Melton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our results may also suggest a role of GARP in Th17 generation.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that tensile force exerted by integrin is required for activation of the proTGFÎ²âLTBP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Annes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Wipff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The crystal structure of the proTGFÎ²1 homodimer shows that the TGFÎ² growth factor dimer is sequestered by LAP straightjacket elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The Î±1-helix, latency lasso, and clasp of the straightjacket lock the TGFÎ² against the prodomain arm domain. These prodomain elements shield TGFÎ² from recognition by both its type I and type II receptors and also change its conformation. Tensile forces exerted across the proTGFÎ² ring on the straightjacket would break the noncovalent structural restraints and release mature TGFÎ² dimer into the extracellular milieu. The conditions required for this activation include the binding of Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> to the RGD motif of LAP; the incorporation of proTGFÎ² into the ECM by LTBP; the C-terminal portion of the Î²<sub>6</sub> cytoplasmic domain; an intact cytoskeleton to generate cell traction forces and/or to provide mechanical resistance; and a mechanically resistant ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Wipff and Hinz, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that TGFÎ² can also be activated from the GARPâproTGFÎ²1 complex by Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> and Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>8</sub> integrins. The Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub>-mediated activation also requires the interaction of integrin to the RGD motif of LAP, suggesting that TGFÎ² is activated via similar mechanisms, whether presented by LTBP in the ECM or GARP on cell surface. Membrane anchoring of GARP is required, as a soluble form of GARP is unable to support Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub>-mediated TGFÎ² activation despite forming an sGARPâproTGFÎ²1 complex. Furthermore, the disulfide linkage between GARP and proTGFÎ²1 is required, as TGFÎ² could not be activated in the absence of disulfide linkage and presence only of noncovalent association between proTGFÎ² and GARP. In addition, complex formation between purified Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> and GARPâproTGFÎ²1 did not release TGFÎ². These results suggest that Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub>-dependent activation of TGFÎ² from the GARPâproTGFÎ²1 complex also requires tensile force. Negative-stain EM class averages showed that in the sGARPâproTGFÎ²1âÎ±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> ternary complex, GARP and Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> bind to opposite sides of the proTGFÎ²1 ring. This arrangement is important for exerting tensile force through this ternary complex for releasing mature TGFÎ² to bind its receptors.</p><p>Although most of our experiments were conducted using cells cotransfected with GARP, proTGFÎ²1, and Î±<sub>V</sub> integrins, we have no evidence that Î±<sub>V</sub> integrins can activate the GARPâproTGFÎ² complexes in-<italic>cis</italic> on the same cell, since activation could have occurred in-<italic>trans</italic> in cell culture. We only have evidence for activation in-<italic>trans</italic>, from experiments in which the proTGFÎ²/GARP and Î±<sub>V</sub> integrins were expressed on different cells. It is known that some integrinâligand pairs cannot interact with one another when expressed on the same cell, such as LFA-1 and ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Wang and Springer, 1998</xref>).</p><p>We propose three mechanisms by which GARP regulates TGFÎ² bioavailability at cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). First, GARP prevents release of free and possibly misassembled proTGFÎ² into the extracellular environment and thereby helps maintain its latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>). Second, GARP inhibits secretion of proTGFÎ² in association with LTBP and hence its assembly into fibrils in the ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>). Third, GARP provides a cell-surface platform for presentation of latent TGFÎ² to Î±<sub>V</sub> integrins, including Î±<sub>V</sub> integrins on the surface of other cells, for activation of TGFÎ² in the context of cellâcell adhesive interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9:</label><caption><p>Models of how GARP helps regulate TGFÎ² activation. (A) GARP prevents secretion of proTGFÎ² and displays it on the cell surface. (B) GARP outcompetes LTBP for assembly into complexes with proTGFÎ² during biosynthesis. (C) Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>6</sub> integrin on the surface of one cell binds to the RGD motif in LAP and collaborates with GARP on another cell to generate tensile force across the complex and thereby induce the conformational changes in LAP, which lead to the release and hence activation of TGFÎ².</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1129fig9"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subcloning</title><p>Transfection-ready, untagged human GARP cDNA was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). Human LTBP1 cDNA was provided by Vesna Todorovic (New York University, New York, NY). TGFÎ²1 cDNA was provided by Katri Koli (University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland). GARP was subcloned into a modified pLEXm vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Aricescu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) with a FLAG tag at the N-terminus. LTBP1S, LTBP1L, and the ECR3E domain of LTBP1 were subcloned into a modified pIRES2-EGFP vector (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), which contains a streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) tag at the C-terminus. sGARP was constructed by fusing the extracellular domain of GARP to a histidine (His)âSBP tag, followed by a 3C protease site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) at the N-terminus. GARP and TGFÎ²1 point mutations were generated using the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions.

After affinity purification of sGARP, the His-SBP tag was removed from sGARP by 3C protease digestion. sGARP was then further purified and used for immunizing mice. Several in-house anti-GARP antibodies (mouse IgG1; GARP2, GARP5 and GARP6) were confirmed to bind GARP in assays, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, IP, and Western blot analysis (unpublished data). The RGE (GRGESP) and RGD (GRGDSP) peptides were purchased from Bachem Americas (Torrance, CA).

All cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. For transient transfection, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To make stable cell lines expressing Î±<sub>V</sub> integrins, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with constructs encoding Î±<sub>V</sub> and Î² subunit. At 40 h posttransfection, cells were selected for the ability to proliferate in medium containing puromycin (1 Î¼g/ml) and G418 (400 Î¼g/ml).
