      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy is an eye disease characterized by lesions in the macula that can resemble the wings of a butterfly. Here, we report the identification of heterozygous missense mutations in the Î±-catenin 1 (<italic>CTNNA1</italic>) gene in three families with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy. In addition, we identified a <italic>Ctnna1</italic> missense mutation in a chemically induced mouse mutant, <italic>tvrm5</italic>. Parallel clinical phenotypes were observed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of individuals with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy and in <italic>tvrm5</italic> mice, including pigmentary abnormalities, focal thickening and elevated lesions, and decreased light-activated responses. Morphological studies in <italic>tvrm5</italic> mice revealed increased cell shedding and large multinucleated RPE cells, suggesting defects in intercellular adhesion and cytokinesis. This study identifies <italic>CTNNA1</italic> gene variants as a cause of macular dystrophy, suggests that CTNNA1 is involved in maintaining RPE integrity, and suggests that other components that participate in intercellular adhesion may be implicated in macular disease.</p>

    <p id="P2">Butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy (MIM 608970) belongs to a group of autosomal dominant pattern dystrophies of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), first described in a large Dutch family (Family A, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The disease is characterized by accumulation of pigmented material in the macula that can resemble the wings of a butterfly<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Affected individuals present from middle age with either normal or slightly diminished best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and color vision, and the activity of the RPE measured by electrooculogram (EOG) recordings may be abnormal<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Responses of the retina, recorded by full-field electroretinography (ERG), and dark adaptation are generally normal<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The disease is relatively benign, but can progress to atrophy of the retina and underlying choroid in the macula<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and to subretinal neovascularization<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, both resulting in severe vision loss.</p>
    <p id="P3">Mutations in the <italic>PRPH2</italic> gene (MIM 179605) have been identified in individuals with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, but in most individuals the genetic cause is unknown. Genetic heterogeneity for butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy has been demonstrated in a large Dutch family with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy (Family A, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), in which the involvement of the <italic>PRPH2</italic> gene was excluded<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Subsequently, a novel disease locus on chromosome 5q21.2-q33.2 was identified in this family<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">Here we report the identification of mutations in the <italic>CTNNA1</italic> gene (MIM 116805) in the large Dutch family (Family A, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and in additional families with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy. In addition, we describe a <italic>Ctnna1</italic> mutation in a chemically induced mouse mutant, <italic>tvrm5</italic>, and characterize the pathologic events leading to RPE dysmorphology in this model.</p>

        <p id="P5">Whole exome sequencing identified 23,783 variants that were shared by individuals A-III:7 and A-III:11 of family A (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Shared variants located within the linkage interval on 5q21.2-q33.2 (between markers D5S433 and D5S487)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> were filtered for heterozygous (present on â¥20% and â¤80% variant reads), non-synonymous variants, with a frequency of less than 0.5% in the Exome Variant Server database (EVS website), and a high nucleotide conservation (PhyloP score &gt; 2.7). Only one potential causative variant was identified, residing in the <italic>CTNNA1</italic> gene [NM_001903]: c.953T&gt;C; p.(Leu318Ser) (PhyloP score 5.1). All affected relatives carried the variant in heterozygous state, while the variant was absent in all unaffected family members. The variant was predicted to be disease-causing by SIFT, affects a residue that is completely conserved among vertebrate species (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), and was not found in 162 ethnically matched controls nor in the EVS database.</p>
        <p id="P6">Sequencing of all 17 coding exons of the <italic>CTNNA1</italic> gene in 93 unrelated probands with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy and other pattern dystrophies identified three additional rare missense variants in the <italic>CTNNA1</italic> gene (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Heterozygous variants c.1293T&gt;G; p.(Ile431Met) and c.919G&gt;A; p.(Glu307Lys) were identified in two probands of Dutch and Belgian ancestry, respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), and segregate with the disease in families B and C (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).

Notably, the B-scan profiles of lesions in homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice and individuals with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy were similar, both for small and large lesions (compare <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>, and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>, respectively).

        <p id="P10">To test whether the morphological RPE defects were accompanied by a decrease in RPE function, we examined <italic>Ctnna1</italic> mutant mice by direct current electroretinography (DC-ERG). In comparison to wild-type B6J mice, DC-ERG responses were reduced in amplitude at one year of age in both heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). When the main components of the response were quantified, significant differences from B6J were noted for the c-wave, fast oscillation (FO), and off-response in both heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>); the amplitude reduction of the light peak (LP) component, which tends to be variable in amplitude in mice, was not interpretable. Differences were not noted in responses between heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice.</p>
        <p id="P11">As the DC-ERG signal is generated in response to rod photoreceptor activity<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, it was essential to determine whether the reduced DC-ERGs of <italic>Ctnna1</italic> mutant mice resulted from a decrease in RPE function alone or were accompanied by a decline in rod photoreceptor function. Therefore, we also recorded strobe flash ERGs from B6J and <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mutant mice. While the overall waveform did not differ across genotypes, the dark-adapted a-wave and b-wave amplitudes were both significantly reduced in homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> compared to B6J or heterozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Thus, the reduction in the DC-ERG responses in homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice may reflect dysfunction of photoreceptors, RPE cells, or both. By contrast, dark-adapted responses did not differ in heterozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> and B6J mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), indicating that the reduced DC-ERG response in heterozygous mice occurs without a loss of photoreceptor function.

        <title>Ectopic cells and inclusions in RPE of <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice</title>
        <p id="P12">To assess cellular changes that might provide clues to the underlying cause of RPE lesions and functional defects in <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice, we examined fixed retinal tissues by histology. Compared to the B6J retina at one month of age (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), the retina in homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) was grossly normal apart from slight ONL thinning. However, in the homozygous mutants, outer retinal distortion was occasionally noted in areas where unusual features were found in the underlying RPE. First, ectopic pigmented cells were present on the RPE apical surface in focal lesions appearing as a slightly thickened RPE layer contiguous with the epithelium (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>) or as a double layer (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Single pigmented cells were also observed (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>), which may be shed RPE cells. The observation of nuclei with no evidence of surrounding pigment (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>) suggested the presence of additional cell types in the subretinal space. Second, eosinophilic inclusions were found frequently within the RPE cell layer (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>), often with an internal laminar appearance. Serial sections revealed nuclei on the edges of these inclusions and sparse melanin pigment enclosed within a well-defined boundary, compatible with an intracellular location. Finally, pigmented cells on the RPE apical surface and eosinophilic inclusions were both present in larger lesions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>âk), suggesting a common pathogenic basis of these features. In agreement with live imaging results, these unusual features were observed at one month and at 12â14 months in homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice but were not detected in heterozygous and B6J animals.</p>
        <p id="P13">These findings provide a histological correlate of the live imaging results. The pigmented cells accumulating on the apical surface of the RPE (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> and d) corresponded to the bright spots observed by fundus imaging and <italic>en face</italic> OCT (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and b), and to the localized thickening of the hyperreflective RPE layer in OCT B-scans (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>âh). Accumulation of eosinophilic material in the epithelial layer (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>) may also contribute to localized thickening observed by OCT.

        <p id="P14">As an additional test for RPE structural defects, we stained RPE/choroid/sclera flatmounts at one month of age to detect nuclei and the F-actin cytoskeleton at RPE cell boundaries. Flatmounts from B6J mice revealed mono- and binucleate polygonal RPE cells with vertices shared by three cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). In contrast, homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice exhibited unusual RPE morphology comprising four or more cells surrounding an F-actin circle of variable size (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>âd) or a shared vertex (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). Orthogonal views of B6J image stacks indicated that RPE nuclei are normally located below F-actin structures at the RPE apical surface (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), presumably microvilli<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, and below the circumferential F-actin band that defines the polygonal cell boundary (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). In homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice, nuclei were occasionally observed directly above the circular F-actin motif (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>), consistent with apical shedding of an RPE cell. However, in most of these structures, nuclei were not apparent or were positioned basally to the circular F-actin motif, possibly indicating that basal shedding also occurs.</p>
        <p id="P15">RPE dysmorphology was also evident at 12â14 months of age. Compared to normal polygonal cells in B6J mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref>), the RPE cells in heterozygous (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>) and homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6j</xref>) were highly variable in size and included extremely large, irregularly-shaped multinucleate cells. In addition to the absence of apical F-actin boundaries in the interior of these abnormal RPE cells, the disordered clustering of nuclei suggested a lack of intercellular barriers. Bright F-actin structures, including tangles and intense staining at the boundaries of rounded cells, were more pronounced in homozygous than in heterozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice. In summary, a primary consequence of the <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mutation appears to be significant dysmorphology in the form of RPE cell shedding and the accumulation of large multinucleate RPE cells.</p>

CTNNA1 responds to increased intercellular tension by unfurling binding sites for actin-associated proteins, such as VCL (vinculin), afadin, Î±-actinin, and formin<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Given the importance of adherens junctions for RPE integrity<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, we explored possible structural and functional consequences of the CTNNA1 variants. The <italic>CTNNA1</italic> variants detected in the three families with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy (p.[Glu307Lys], p.[Leu318Ser], and p.[Ile431Met]) and the mouse <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> variant (p.[Leu436Pro]) are predicted to alter residues in CTNNA1 that are completely conserved among vertebrate species (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). As shown in an x-ray crystallographic structural model of the human protein<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), four of the five variants affect amino acid residues (p.Glu307, p.Leu318, p.Ile431, p.Leu436) clustered in the middle of protein. The variants map to the proposed force-sensing module (domains D3âD4, amino acid residues 260â630) and to protein binding domains within this module that may be sensitive to tension (D3a, residues 260â400; D3b, residues 400â507)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.

The fifth variant, which is of uncertain pathogenic significance, affects Arg54 within the N-terminal domain that binds Î²-catenin, a direct binding partner of cadherin. To test for an effect of the variants on VCL binding, the wild-type and mutant CTNNA1 proteins were heterologously co-expressed with VCL. Although co-immunoprecipitations confirmed interaction of CTNNA1 with VCL, the mutations did not affect the interaction of these proteins (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P17">This work implicates mutations in the <italic>CTNNA1</italic> gene as a cause of butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy. Previously, this condition has been associated with mutations in peripherin 2, a protein involved in outer segment disc biogenesis of retinal photoreceptor cells<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The finding that the disease is also caused by variants in CTNNA1, a central component of adherens junctions, broadens our perspective on its cellular and molecular basis. Intriguingly, a juvenile form of macular dystrophy (MIM 601553) that results in RPE atrophy and pigmentary changes has been linked to variants in <italic>CDH3</italic>, which encodes P-cadherin<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Together, these findings support the idea that other components of the cadherin-based intercellular adhesion machinery may be implicated in macular degenerative disease.</p>
      <p id="P18">The parallel ocular phenotypes in affected individuals carrying a <italic>CTNNA1</italic> variant allele and in homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice suggest that similar mechanisms underlie pathogenesis in both species and that <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice accurately model the human disease. Importantly, the dysmorphology of RPE cells in <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice raises the possibility that RPE defects are a precipitating event in the disease. Although disease phenotypes were stronger in homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>trmv5</sup></italic> mice, RPE defects were also observed in heterozygous mutants, implying a gene-dosage effect. This likely arises from an altered function of the variant protein, as we found similar <italic>Ctnna1</italic> mRNA and CTNNA1 expression levels in the posterior eye of wild-type and heterozygous or homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mutant mice. Although our work and previous studies<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> (BioGPS.org) indicated that the mRNA and protein are expressed in both the RPE and the retina, the disease phenotypes may be due to perturbation of CTNNA1 function specifically in the RPE. The human disease mainly affects the RPE<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, while the mouse <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mutation has only slight effects on retinal integrity and is less disruptive than an embryonic lethal gene-trap allele<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, or a conditional knockout of <italic>Ctnna1</italic> in retinal progenitor cells, which causes retinal developmental defects<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Thus, our results support a causative role of RPE defects in butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy due to <italic>CTNNA1</italic> variants.</p>
      <p id="P19">Eosinophilic inclusions observed in homozygous <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> RPE appear similar to hard drusen, small dome-shaped eosinophilic masses between the RPE and Bruch's membrane that are associated with macular degeneration when abundant<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.

As these inclusions correspond to elevated lesions in OCT B-scans , we suggest that similar lesions detected by OCT in patients with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy derive from eosinophilic inclusions in the RPE.</p>
      <p id="P20">Pigmented cells on the RPE apical surface and aberrant F-actin structures in <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice were similar to shedding structures in chick embryonic RPE<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> and in mouse models of RPE injury<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Shed RPE cells may survive to accumulate and/or proliferate locally at lesions, creating a double layer of pigmented cells as observed in our study, in mouse models that target damage to the RPE<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and in geographic atrophy<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> .

We propose that RPE shedding is an initial event leading to focal RPE thickening and changes in melanin pigment distribution in <italic>CTNNA1-</italic>associated butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy. RPE shedding may prove to be a common attribute of macular dystrophic disease, as subretinal pigmented cells and RPE cytoskeletal derangements similar to those observed in <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mice have also been associated with human age-related macular degeneration.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p>
      <p id="P21">Abnormally large multinucleate RPE cells in <italic>Ctnna1<sup>tvrm5</sup></italic> mutant mice may arise from RPE hyperproliferation and a cytokinesis defect due to the mutation, through repeated nuclear divisions without cell division.

As the affinity of CTNNA1 variants for VCL was normal, the mutations may disrupt binding to other actin-associated proteins or alter the conformational response to mechanical stress. Recent studies demonstrate that CTNNA1 participates in molecular networks independent of cell adhesion, such as the NF-KB, Ras-MAPK, Hedgehog and Hippo signaling pathways.

        <p id="P27">All procedures used in animal experiments for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Cleveland Clinic and The Jackson Laboratory and were in accordance with the âGuide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animalsâ established by the National Institutes of Health (1996, Revised 2011) and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Mice were bred and maintained on a 12 hour light-dark cycle in the Research Animal Facility vivarium of The Jackson Laboratory (JAX). Pasteurized JL Mouse and Rat Auto 4F/No Hysil 5K54 diet (fat content, 4%, PMI Nutrition International) and HCl-acidified water (pH 2.8-3.2) were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>
        <p id="P28">The <italic>tvrm5</italic> mutant (JAX stock numberÂ 021610) was identified among G3 mice from an ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis screen of C57BL/6J (B6J; JAX stock number 000664) mice generated by the Center for New Mouse Models of Heart, Lung, Blood and Sleep Disorders at JAX.<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Phenotypic screening by indirect ophthalmoscopy at â¼21 weeks of age was performed by the Translational Vision Research Models (TVRM) program.<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Once heritability was established, <italic>tvrm5</italic> mice were backcrossed to B6J for seven generations and maintained in homozygous state by intercrossing.

        <title>tvrm5 Mapping and Sequence Analysis</title>
        <p id="P29">To identify the causative locus, a mutant <italic>tvrm5</italic> male was outcrossed with a DBA/2J (+/+) female, the resulting F1 progeny were intercrossed, and 31 F2 generation mice were analyzed for linkage using a pool scan with genome-wide simple sequence length polymorphic (SSLP) markers. Map location was confirmed in individual F2 mice from the pool and additional SSLP markers were used to refine the map position. For whole exome sequencing, genomic DNA (1 Î¼g) was fragmented to a peak size of 300 bp by sonicating on low power (30 s power on-off cycle) for 10 min using a Diagenode Bioruptor UCD-200TM-EX (Denville). The pre-capture paired end library was constructed using the TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit (FC-121-100, Illumina) without size selection step and 18 cycles of PCR. The pre-capture library was hybridized to the NimbleGen Mouse Exome capture probe set (#9999042611, Roche Nimblegen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequencing library was quantified by qPCR, pooled with two similar libraries, and sequenced on a single lane of a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) using a 2Ã100 bases (paired end) sequencing protocol. Genotypes were confirmed by sequencing the PCR product amplified with primers Ctnna1F and Ctnna1R (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) at 97Â°C, 3 min; 45 cycles of 95Â°C, 10 s and 50Â°C, 30 s; 72Â°C, 30 s; 72Â°C, 3 min.</p>

To recover RNA, the RPE/choroid/sclera complex was treated with RNAprotect (Qiagen) immediately following dissection and processed to yield a pigmented pellet enriched for RPE RNA<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. Alternatively, enucleated eyes in RNA<italic>later</italic> were dissected to recover the combined retina and RPE, which adhered tightly as evidenced by RPE nuclei and a polygonal melanin pattern on the retinal surface. Excess RNA<italic>later</italic> was removed bymicropipetting. The RPE-enriched pellet (two eyes per animal) or the combined retina and RPE (one eye per animal) were processed with the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer, including on-column DNase I treatment. Purified RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA was reverse-transcribed with the RETROscript Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions using random priming. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with the iTaq Universal SYBR Green SuperMix (Bio-Rad) and Ctnna1rtF2 and Ctnna1rtR2 primers (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), using the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The comparative CT method (ÎÎC<sub>T</sub>) was applied with <italic>Actb</italic> as an internal calibrator and the relative fold change in <italic>Ctnna1</italic> transcript was calculated as 2<sup>-ÎÎ</sup><italic><sup>C</sup></italic><sub>T</sub>. Melting curve analyses were performed to validate target gene amplification. Error bars represent the additive propagation of error calculated as described previously<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P31">For protein analysis, combined retina and RPE samples were resuspended and sonicated for 10 s in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III, EDTA-free (EMD Millipore) and 50 mM D,L-dithiothreitol. An equal volume of each lysate and a volume of a BJ6 lysate greater than and less than this volume were heated at 95Â°C for 5 min and electrophoresed on Any kD Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad). Precision Plus Dual Color Proteins were included to estimate protein molecular weights. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose with a Trans-Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad) using the High MW standard protocol. Blots were stained with Ponceau S for 1 h, washed twice with distilled water and imaged with visible light on a G:Box Chemi XRQ gel imaging system (Syngene). After blocking for 2-12 h at 4Â°C in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% w/v Tween-20 (TBST), blots were incubated overnight with a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit monoclonal anti-CTNNA1 antibody (EP1793Y, Abcam) in blocking buffer. Following three 15-min washes with TBST, blots were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with a 1:1,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (7074; Cell Signaling Technology), washed three times for 15 min with TBST, developed with ECL Prime Western Blotting reagent (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and imaged forchemiluminescence with the G:Box Chemi XRQ system. To determine relative expression levels, TIF-format images were quantified in Fiji<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. Total protein was determined from Ponceau S images by first adjusting background intensity, subtracting a constant value over the entire image. The line tool was then adjusted to the width and full length of each lane and the integrated density of the selected region was measured. A linear fit of total integrated density to load volume was determined in Excel (Microsoft) from the integrated intensities of B6J samples loaded at varying volumes, and used to calculate the volume equivalent of each sample. A similar approach yielded volume equivalents for CTNNA1 staining from chemiluminiscence images without background subtraction. The volume equivalent of CTNNA1 was divided by that of total protein and the resulting values were tested statistically. Values from heterozygous and homozygous samples were averaged and divided by the corresponding B6J value to yield the relative expression level, which was graphed with the relative propagating error calculated from the square root of the sum of the squares of the relative error for each group.</p>

        <title>Live Imaging</title>
        <p id="P32">Live fundus images were obtained with a Micron III Retinal Imaging System (Phoenix Research Laboratories) and an R2200 ultrahigh resolution spectral domain OCT system (Bioptigen). Image acquisition and processing were performed as described previously.<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> ONL thickness in one eye of each mouse was determined from OCT volume datasets imported into Fiji at four positions, each â¼250 Î¼m from the optic nerve head in the superior, nasal, temporal and temporal fundus. Thickness was determined from 50-pixel wide lines drawn vertically across the ONL at each position. To identify the ONL boundaries reproducibly, the Plot Profile tool was used to plot image intensity by distance, and the length (in pixels) of a horizontal line between the midpoints of the intensity peaks on either side of the ONL was determined. Values from each eye were averaged and converted to ONL thickness by an axial factor of 1.53 Î¼m/pixel determined from the OCT acquisition program.</p>

        <title>Histology of Mouse Eyes</title>
        <p id="P33">For conventional histology, eyes of mice asphyxiated with carbon dioxide were removed and treated with a 3:1:4 mixture of methanol:acetic acid:PBS with subsequent paraffin embedding and staining with hematoxylin and eosin as described.<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> Brightfield images were acquired using a Leica DMLB light microscope with 5Ã (HC PL FLUOTAR, 40Ã (HCX PL APO), and 100Ã (N PLAN) objectives. Images were collected using a QImaging Retiga 2000R camera and RGB Slider in color mode with QCapture software. Processing of exported image files in Fiji included gamma adjustment for color balance, brightness and contrast adjustment, and unsharp mask.. For immunohistochemistry, enucleated eyes were placed in Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek) and snap frozen in N<sub>2(l)</sub>-chilled 2-methylbutane. Cryosections (10 Î¼m) were air-dried on ColorFrost Plus glass microscope slides (Thermo Scientific), fixed for 10 min on ice with 4% w/v paraformaldehyde in PBS and rinsed in PBS. Sections were blocked in PBS containing 0.3% v/v Triton X-100 and 2% w/v normal horse serum for 30 min at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4Â°C with rabbit monoclonal anti-CTNNA1 antibody (EP1793Y; Abcam) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution. Following three washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in Cy3-conjugated F(abâ²) donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (711-166-152; Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution. Samples were washed three times in PBS and mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Stained slides were imaged with an LD Plan-Neofluar 20Ã/0.4 Korr Ph2 M27 or a Plan-Apochromat 100Ã/1.40 Oil M27 objective on a ZeissAxio Observer Z.1 microscope with filter sets 43 or 49 using Zen 2012 software and a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER-1394 camera.. Illumination intensity and exposure times were constant for all samples, and control sections that were treated identically except for the omission of primary antibody showed little to no fluorescence under the imaging conditions selected. At both magnifications, image brightness and contrast adjustments were applied uniformly across all samples in Fiji.</p>
        <p id="P34">For flatmounts, enucleated eyes were fixed, dissected, and stained with DAPI and rhodamine phalloidin as described for retina,<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> except that the RPE/choroid/sclera complex was retained and examined. Confocal image stacks were obtained using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope, HCX PL APO CS 63.0Ã 1.30 GLYC objective, and Leica Acquisition Suite software. Conventional fluorescence images were obtained at 10Ã (Plan-Apochromat 10Ã/0.45 M27) using the Zeiss filter sets and microscope system described above. Confocal images were processed in Fiji by dividing the blue by the green channel after denoising to reduce the contribution of autofluorescence to the DAPI signal, and images were oriented with the Interactive Stack Rotation plugin. An image stack subset was maximally projected to visualize the F-actin circumferential boundary with minimal overlap from apical F-actin. Conventional fluorescence image stacks were oriented with the Interactive Stack Rotation plugin to optimize the display of F-actin at RPE cell boundaries, and brightness and contrast were adjusted in Fiji.</p>

        <title>Mouse Visual Electroretinography</title>
        <p id="P35">Mice were studied using ERG stimulation and recording protocols to evaluate outer retinal and RPE function. Mice were dark-adapted overnight, anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (16 mg/kg), and placed on a temperature-regulated heating pad throughout the testing sessions. Pupils were dilated with eye drops (2.5% phenylephrine HCl, 1% cyclopentolate, 1% tropicamide). The corneal surface was anesthetized with 1% proparacaine HCl.</p>
        <p id="P36">Outer retina function was examined using a conventional strobe-flash ERG protocol.<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> ERGs were recorded using a stainless-steel wire active electrode referenced to a needle electrode placed in the cheek. A second needle electrode placed in the tail served as ground lead. Responses were differentially amplified (0.3â1,500 Hz), averaged, and stored using a UTAS E-3000 signal averaging system (LKC Technologies). White light strobe flashes were initially presented in darkness within a Ganzfeld bowl with increasing luminance, from -3.6â2.1 log cd s/m<sup>2</sup>. Cone ERGs were isolated by superimposing stimuli (-0.8â1.9 log cd s/m<sup>2</sup>) upon a steady adapting field (20 cd/m<sup>2</sup>). The a-wave amplitude was measured 8 ms after flash onset from the prestimulus baseline. The b-wave amplitude was measured from the a-wave trough to the peak of the b-wave or, if no a-wave was present, from the prestimulus baseline.</p>
        <p id="P37">RPE ERG components were examined using a dc-ERG protocol.<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> Responses were obtained from the corneal surface of the left eye using a capillary tube with filament (BF100-50-10; Sutter Instrument), filled with Hank's buffered salt solution to contact an Ag/AgCl wire electrode. A similar electrode contacting the right eye served as the reference. Responses were differentially amplified (dc-100 Hz), digitized at 20 Hz, and stored using LabScribe Data Recording Software (iWorx). White light stimuli were derived from an optical channel using a Leica microscope illuminator as the light source and delivered to the test eye with a 1-cm-diameter fiber-optic bundle. Stimulus luminance was 2.4 log cd/m<sup>2</sup>. Stimulus timing and duration was controlled at 7 min by a shutter system (Uniblitz). The c-wave amplitude was measured from the prestimulus baseline to the c-wave peak. The fast oscillation (FO) amplitude was measured from the c-wave peak to the trough of the FO. The light peak (LP) amplitude was measured from the FO trough to the asymptotic value. The off-response amplitude was measured from the LP value just prior to stimulus light offset to the peak of the initial component.</p>

Response functions obtained for ERG a- and b-wave amplitudes were compared across genotypes using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, with multiple comparisons by Tukey post hoc analysis at each flash intensity. Assumptions for ANOVA modeling were met, as a quantile-quantile plot of ANOVA residuals against a normal distribution approximated the diagonal, and variances in each analysis except for the dc-ERG LP response were found to be equal (Levene test).
