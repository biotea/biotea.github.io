      <abstract>
        <p>CMT4J is a severe form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy caused by mutation of the phosphoinositide phosphatase <italic>FIG4/SAC3</italic>. Affected individuals are compound heterozygotes carrying the missense allele <italic>FIG4</italic>-I41T in combination with a null allele. Analysis using the yeast two-hybrid system demonstrated that the I41T mutation impairs interaction of FIG4 with the scaffold protein VAC14. The critical role of this interaction was confirmed by the demonstration of loss of FIG4 protein in VAC14 null mice. We developed a mouse model of CMT4J by expressing a <italic>Fig4</italic>-I41T cDNA transgene on the <italic>Fig4</italic> null background. Expression of the mutant transcript at a level 5Ã higher than endogenous <italic>Fig4</italic> completely rescued lethality, whereas 2Ã expression gave only partial rescue, providing a model of the human disease. The level of FIG4-I41T protein in transgenic tissues is only 2% of that predicted by the transcript level, as a consequence of the protein instability caused by impaired interaction of the mutant protein with VAC14. Analysis of patient fibroblasts demonstrated a comparably low level of mutant I41T protein. The abundance of FIG4-I41T protein in cultured cells is increased by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. The data demonstrate that FIG4-I41T is a hypomorphic allele encoding a protein that is unstable <italic>in vivo</italic>. Expression of FIG4-I41T protein at 10% of normal level is sufficient for long-term survival, suggesting that patients with CMT4J could be treated by increased production or stabilization of the mutant protein. The transgenic model will be useful for testing <italic>in vivo</italic> interventions to increase the abundance of the mutant protein.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J is a severe neurological disorder with childhood or adult onset and progression to loss of mobility and death. Patients inherit a mutation that changes amino acid residue 41 of the FIG4 protein from isoleucine to threonine. We report that this mutation destabilizes the FIG4 protein by blocking its interaction with a stabilizing protein partner. We developed a mouse model of CMT4J and found that a low level of expression of the mutant protein, 10% of wildtype level, is sufficient to prevent lethality. This work provides the scientific basis for development of a directed treatment for this rare, lethal disorder.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The lipid phosphatase FIG4/SAC3 is broadly expressed in eukaryotic cells from yeast to mammals. Mutations of <italic>FIG4</italic> are responsible for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease type 4J (OMIM 611228), an atypical, autosomal recessive form of CMT with severe motor dysfunction and rapid progression <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. <italic>FIG4</italic> phosphatase activity specifically removes the 5-phosphate from the inositol ring of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, a membrane-bound phospholipid that acts as a molecular signal for trafficking and fusion of intracellular vesicles. In yeast, Fig4p is localized to the vacuole membrane in a protein complex that regulates the synthesis and turnover of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="pgen.1002104-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1002104-Sbrissa1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In mammalian cells, the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosynthetic complex is localized in the endosomal/lysosomal vesicle system <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Dove1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Deficiency of mammalian FIG4 or VAC14 leads to accumulation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in tissues and in cultured fibroblasts and neurons <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1002104-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1002104-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1002104-Sbrissa2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We previously identified a spontaneous null mutant of mouse <italic>Fig4</italic> caused by a transposon insertion <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The most striking phenotypes of the <italic>Fig4</italic> null mice are spongiform degeneration of the brain and loss of neurons from the dorsal root ganglia, resulting in a severe movement disorder and lethality between 1 and 2 months of age (see video supplement to <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). At the cellular level, <italic>Fig4</italic> null fibroblasts exhibit reduced levels of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Rudge1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Duex1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the CNS, astrocytes and neurons exhibit accumulation of p62, ubiquinated protein and other autophagic components in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These abnormalities demonstrate that PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is required for completion of basal autophagy, and indicate that there is a defect in resolution of autolysosomes in deficient cells <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Ferguson2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The biosynthetic complex that regulates PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> contains two major proteins in addition to FIG4, the 5-kinase FAB1/PIKfyve, which phosphorylates position 5 of the inositol ring in PI3P, and the scaffold protein VAC14, composed of multiple heat-repeat structural domains <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Stable localization on the yeast vacuolar membrane requires interaction between Fig4p, Fab1p and Vac14p, and loss of one protein results in mislocalization of the other two <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Rudge1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the mouse, the phenotype of the spontaneous <italic>Vac14</italic> mutation L156R mimics the <italic>Fig4</italic> null phenotype, with neurodegeneration, cellular vacuolization and defective autophagy <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. <italic>Vac14</italic>-L156R is located in a heat repeat domain and the mutation reduces binding affinity for FAB1, thereby disrupting the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosynthetic complex <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These mutants in yeast and mouse demonstrate the importance of the stable complex between FIG4, FAB1 and VAC14.</p>
      <p>Patients with CMT4J are compound heterozygotes at the <italic>FIG4</italic> locus, carrying the shared missense mutation I41T, on a common haplotype, in combination with a unique or âprivateâ null allele <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The frequency of the I41T allele is less than 1/500 in the Northern European population <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The corresponding yeast mutant, I59T, retains partial function in a yeast assay for correction of the vacuole phenotype <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Disease onset in CMT4J patients with the genotype <italic>FIG4<sup>I41T/â</sup></italic> may occur in childhood or adult life. The rapid decline of motor function in adult onset patients resembles the course of ALS, and deleterious mutations of <italic>FIG4</italic> have also been identified in patients with ALS <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In order to generate a mouse model of human CMT4J, we have expressed a <italic>Fig4</italic> cDNA construct containing the I41T mutation in transgenic mice. Here we report the dose-dependent rescue of the <italic>Fig4</italic> null phenotype by the <italic>Fig4</italic>-I41T transgene. We also demonstrate that the pathogenic mechanism of the I41T allele is based on defective interaction with the scaffold protein VAC14, resulting in destabilization of the FIG4 protein <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>While this work was in progress, Shisheva and colleagues reported related work indicating that the short half-life of a GFP-FIG4 fusion protein in cultured cells is increased by over-expression of myc-VAC14, and that the I41T mutation prevents this increase <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Ikonomov1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The authors proposed that VAC14 has a novel regulatory role in the turnover of FIG4 protein <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Ikonomov1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Using the yeast two hybrid system, we demonstrate here that the direct interaction between VAC14 and FIG4 is impaired by the I41T mutation. The reduced interaction results in greatly reduced abundance of FIG4-I41T protein in patient fibroblasts. We further demonstrate that wildtype FIG4 requires VAC14 for stability <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we find that overexpression of mutant I41T protein can compensate for its reduced binding affinity and rescue the mouse model of CMT4J. This work extends the previous observations and advances our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of the <italic>FIG4</italic>-I41T mutation.</p>

        <title>Impaired interaction of FIG4-I41T with the scaffold protein VAC14</title>
        <p>The corresponding yeast mutation, Fig4-I59T, results in impaired vacuole morphology and defective regulation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Chow2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We tested the interaction of Fig4p-I59T with the Fig4p binding partners Vac14p and Fab1p using a directed yeast two hybrid assay. Fig4p was fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and Vac14p was fused to the transcription activation domain. The I59T mutant did not support growth under stringent selection in the presence of 3AT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002104-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This result demonstrates reduced binding of the Fig4p-I59T mutant to Vac14p. This result was confirmed in a co-immunoprecipitaton assay using myc-tagged Fig4p and GFP-tagged Vac14p <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Nagai1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Wildtype and mutant yeast proteins were expressed at similar levels, but co-precipitation of Vac14p was reduced by approximately 75% for Fig4p-I59T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002104-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation of GFP-labeled Fab1p was reduced to a similar extent by the Fig4p-I59T mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002104-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The latter could be an indirect effect of impaired interaction with Vac14p.</p>

        <p>To confirm the effect of the I41T mutation in the context of the mammalian proteins, we tested the interactions of human FIG4 and human VAC14 in the yeast two hybrid system. The I41T mutation significantly impaired the interaction between the two human proteins, preventing growth on both of the selective media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002104-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

To determine whether the mutant FIG4-I41T protein could be stabilized, we cultured primary fibroblasts for 8 hrs with 10 uM MG-132.

In control fibroblasts the level of wildtype FIG4 was also increased by culture with MG-132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002104-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). The MW of protein produced in the presence of MG-132 was higher than in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002104-g008">Figure 8E, 8F</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have demonstrated that the FIG4-I41T protein is unstable <italic>in vivo</italic> in cultured cells and in transgenic mice, and that the amount of protein in cells from CMT4J patients is extremely low. FIG4 protein expression equivalent to 10% of wildtype levels is sufficient to prevent neurodegeneration and completely rescue lethality in transgenic line Tg721. In contrast, transgenic line Tg705, with lower expression of FIG4-I41T, provides an animal model of the human disorder with neurodegeneration. These key observations suggest that increasing the expression of the FIG4-I41T allele in CMT4J patients, or stabilizing the protein, would be therapeutic.</p>
      <p>The low level of FIG4 protein in rescued mice and in patient fibroblasts appears to be a consequence of the direct effect of the I41T mutation on interaction with the scaffold protein VAC14. In yeast the co-localization of Fig4p, Fab1p and Vac14p on the vacuolar membrane requires the presence of all three proteins, and loss of one protein prevents localization of the other two <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1002104-Sbrissa1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Similarly, in mammalian cells expressing an shRNA to downregulate <italic>Vac14</italic> expression, a small reduction in endogenous FIG4 protein was reported <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Ikonomov1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We confirmed the importance of the FIG4-VAC14 interaction for stability of wildtype FIG4 with the demonstration that FIG4 protein is drastically reduced in mice homozygous for a null allele of VAC14. This experiment clearly demonstrates the dependence of wildtype FIG4 protein on VAC14 for <italic>in vivo</italic> stability. Because of its reduced affinity for VAC14, FIG4-I41T is a hypomorphic allele encoding an unstable protein, resulting in a very low steady-state level of protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. The VAC14 protein is composed of heat-repeat domains <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and is thought to function as a scaffold for the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosynthetic complex. In another example of the importance of interactions between proteins in this complex, the missense mutation of <italic>Vac14</italic> in the <italic>ingls</italic> mouse which reduces the affinity of VAC14 for FAB1 and results in a neurodegenerative disease that closely resembles the <italic>Fig4</italic> null mice <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In the reciprocal experiment, VAC14 protein was <italic>not</italic> reduced in <italic>Fig4</italic> null mice, demonstrating the greater intrinsic stability of the mammalian scaffold protein, and/or its stabilization by interaction with other components of the complex.</p>
      <p>This model of pathogenesis is consistent with the structure of the FIG4 protein, which was predicted by superimposition with the crystal structure of Sac1p, a closely related lipid phosphatase <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Manford1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The I41T mutation is located near the surface of the non-catalytic domain, in a hydrophobic pocket between two Î²-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002104-g009">Figure 9</xref>). The mutation was predicted to affect protein-protein interaction by destabilizing the SacN domain <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Manford1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, consistent with our observations. The I41T mutation is located at a distance from the catalytic domain, and appears not to affect the enzymatic activity <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Ikonomov1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Based on our observations, increased expression or stabilization of the FIG4-I41T protein in patients with CMT4J should be therapeutic and could achieve complete rescue of this progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Inhibition of proteasome degradation with MG132 resulted in increased levels of FIG4-I41T protein in cultured fibroblasts. This non-specific agent increased the abundance of approximately 200 proteins in cultured fibroblasts <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Mu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The proteasome inhibitor Velcade (bortezemib) has been approved for treatment of multiple myeloma, and the widely used drug disulfiram (Antabuse) was recently shown to have activity as a proteasome inhibitor <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Cvek1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Pharmacological interventions like these might increase FIG4 concentration to a level sufficient to protect against loss of motor function in CMT4J patients with genotype <italic>FIG4<sup>I41T/â</sup></italic>.

<xref rid="pgen.1002104-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

        <title>FIG4 antibodies</title>
        <p>A rabbit polyclonal antiserum and a mouse monoclonal antibody were generated to a C-terminal fragment of FIG4 containing the final 220 amino acids, residues 688 to 907, which is encoded by exons 18 to 23. A 660 bp cDNA fragment was amplified from a full length <italic>Fig4</italic> cDNA derived from strain C57BL/6J and cloned into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of the expression vector pRSETA (Invitrogen Corporation, Calrsbad, CA, USA), adding a polyhistidine tag (6Ã His) to the N-terminus. Recombinant protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified from inclusion bodies using Novagen BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ, USA). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the purified protein was generated and affinity-purified by Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory, Inc. (Canadensis, PA). The purified polyclonal antiserum was used at 1â¶50 dilution for western blots. The monoclonal antibody was generated using the same protein fragment at the UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility (Clone N202/7). The monoclonal was purified from cell culture and used at 1â¶200 for western blots. A broad crossreacting band of 50 to 55 kDa is ocassionally observed on Western blots of control and mutant tissues but there is no consistent association with genotype.</p>

        <p>Brain and spinal cord were fixed for 24 hours at 4Â°C in phosphate buffered 10% formalin and then in 70% ethanol for an additional 24 hours at 4Â°C. Paraffin embedding, decalcification of spine, and H&amp;E staining were carried out at Histoserv Inc (Maryland). Images were obtained with an Olympus BX51 microscope and DP50 camera. Image capture settings were identical for sections from â/â and â/â,Tg705 mice that exhibited immunostaining for autophagy markers.

        <p>Five ug aliquots of total RNA from whole brain was treated with DNAse I (Invtrogen) and cDNA was prepared using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The Fig4 transcript was quantitated using TaqMan gene expression probe Mm00506074_m1 (ABI) which spans the junction between exon 3 and exon 4. As an internal control, the TATA binding protein (Tbp) transcript was quantitated using TaqMan probe Mm00446971_m1. Fluorescence was measured on a Step One Real Time PCR System (ABI) at the Microarray Core at the University of Michigan. A linear relationship between copy number and C<sub>T</sub>, the threshold cycle for detection of fluorescence, was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002104.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The mean C<sub>T</sub> value was determined from quadruplicate assays of each sample.

        <p>Transgene copy number was determined using the TaqMan probe described above. A standard curve was generated using pCAG3Z-Fig4 diluted into wildtype mouse DNA for copy-number standards of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 copies per haploid genome using 2.83 pg/ug for one haploid copy equivalent for this 3 kb transgene. Genomic DNA (50 ng) from Tg705/+ mice, Tg721/+ mice, and standards were assayed in quadruplicate. The Taqman probe includes the junction between exon 3 and exon 4, which are separated by 4 kb in genomic DNA. No fluorescent signal was obtained from 8 replicates of wildtype genomic DNA.

        <p>Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was measured as previously described <xref rid="pgen.1002104-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Mice were anesthetized and maintained at a 34Â°C core temperature with a heating lamp. Sural sensory NCV was determined by recording at the dorsum of the foot and antidromically stimulating with supramaximal stimulation at the ankle. NCV was calculated by dividing the distance by the take-off latency of the sensory nerve action potential. Sciatic-tibial motor NCV was determined by recording at the dorsum of the foot and orthodromically stimulating with supramaximal stimulation first at the ankle, then at the sciatic notch. Latencies were measured in each case from the initial onset of the compound muscle action potential. The sciatic-tibial motor NCV was calculated by subtracting the measured ankle distance from the measured notch distance. The resultant distance was then divided by the difference in the ankle and notch latencies for a final nerve conduction velocity.</p>

        <p>Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and perfused transcardially with 3% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella, Inc.). Sciatic nerves were dissected and post-fixed for several hours in perfusion solution at 4Â°C. Tissues were incubated in a 1% solution of OsO<sub>4</sub> and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin (75 nm) sections were cut and visualized with a Philips CM-100 TEM. Images were analyzed at 2600-fold magnification using Image-J software for quantification of g-ratio (defined as the diameter of an axon within its myelin sheath divided by the diameter of the axon outside of its myelin sheath). Two measurements were made per axon in order to account for elongated or irregular shape, and the mean was used. Only myelinated axons were used in for the calculation of g-ratio.
