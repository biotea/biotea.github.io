        <p>The GTPase Rab13 regulates the assembly of functional epithelial tight junctions (TJs) through a yet unknown mechanism. Here, we show that expression of the GTP-bound form of Rab13 inhibits PKA-dependent phosphorylation and TJ recruitment of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, an actin remodelling protein. We demonstrate that Rab13GTP directly binds to PKA and inhibits its activity. Interestingly, activation of PKA abrogates the inhibitory effect of Rab13 on the recruitment of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, ZO-1, and claudin1 to cellâcell junctions. Rab13 is, therefore, the first GTPase that controls PKA activity and provides an unexpected link between PKA signaling and the dynamics of TJ assembly.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During epithelial morphogenesis, the development and organization of cell asymmetry require the assembly of functional tight junctions (TJs). TJs serve as a barrier to the paracellular diffusion and prevent the movement of lipids and membrane proteins between apical and basolateral membranes (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Tsukita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Matter and Balda, 2003</xref>). They form a network of transmembrane, scaffolding, and signaling molecules that control cellâcell adhesion, cell polarity, proliferation, and differentiation (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Zahraoui et al., 2000</xref>). The TJ transmembrane proteins, claudins, are required for the establishment of TJ gate function (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Tsukita and Furuse, 1999</xref>). Scaffolding proteins such as ZO-1, a PDZ-containing protein, connect transmembrane proteins to the underlying actin cytoskeleton and recruit cytosolic proteins, such as kinases, GTPases, and transcription factors to TJs (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Itoh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Wittchen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balda and Matter, 2000</xref>). The actin cytoskeleton contributes substantially to maintain TJ integrity (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Madara et al., 1992</xref>). In CaCo-2 cells, disruption of actin filaments with cytochalasin D decreases, and stabilization of F-actin increases barrier function (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Madara et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Balda et al., 1993</xref>). Recently, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a key actin remodelling protein, has been implicated in epithelial TJ biogenesis (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2002</xref>). VASP was shown to be a substrate for both PKA and PKG (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Butt et al., 1994</xref>), and phosphorylation of VASP abolishes its interaction with actin and inhibits actin polymerization, assigning VASP a key role in controlling actin dynamics (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Harbeck et al., 2000</xref>). However, the regulatory pathways that link actin cytoskeleton organization to the assembly of TJ still need to be elucidated. Interestingly, activation of the small GTPases, Rho/Rac, induces the reorganization of the perijunctional actin ring and leads to increased paracellular permeability (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Takaishi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Benais-Pont et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Another family of small GTPases, Rab proteins, is also involved in regulating TJ dynamics. Rab GTPases seem to regulate specific membrane transport events including vesicle formation, motility via kinesins or myosins, tethering, and fusion (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Pfeffer, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>). We have shown previously that Rab13 is recruited from a cytoplasmic pool to cellâcell contacts at an early stage during TJ assembly (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Zahraoui et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Sheth et al., 2000</xref>). Expression of the active (Rab13Q67L), but not the inactive (Rab13T22N) mutant of Rab13 in epithelial MDCK cells delays the recruitment of TJ proteins, claudin1 and ZO-1, and alters TJ integrity. Interestingly, it does not impair the recruitment of E-cadherin to the lateral membrane (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Marzesco et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, how Rab13 interferes with TJ structure and function is still unclear. In the present work, we show that the active mutant Rab13Q67L inhibits PKA-mediated phosphorylation of VASP and its recruitment to cellâcell junctions. Moreover, Rab13GTP binds to PKA and inhibits its activity. Our data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which Rab13 regulates TJ assembly in epithelial cells.</p>

        <title>Rab13Q67L prevents the recruitment of VASP to TJs</title>
        <p>The effect of GFP-Rab13Q67L on TJ protein recruitment (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Marzesco et al., 2002</xref>) suggests that Rab13 regulates some aspects of actin cytoskeletonâTJ interactions. Because VASP is involved in the establishment of TJ barrier (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2002</xref>), we tested whether Rab13 mutants could affect VASP localization during TJ assembly. We used the Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch protocol, a model system to study TJ assembly. Cells were plated in medium without Ca<sup>2+</sup> for 16 h to dissociate cellâcell junctions, followed by the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to trigger synchronous junction assembly. The localization of VASP was analyzed by immunofluorescence at 0, 2, and 4 h after induction of cellâcell contacts. In control cells, as well as in cells expressing GFP-Rab13T22N and Q67L mutants, removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> resulted in the dissociation of cellâcell junctions and redistribution of VASP into the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Restoration of physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations induced an increased plasma membrane labeling of VASP at sites of cellâcell contacts in cells expressing GFP or GFP-Rab13T22N. In contrast, in GFP-Rab13Q67L cells, within 4 h after the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, VASP was not detected at cellâcell contacts and was still cytoplasmic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This indicated that Rab13Q67L inhibits the recruitment of VASP to sites of cellâcell contacts during junction assembly.</p>

        <title>Rab13 controls PKA-dependent phosphorylation of VASP and its subsequent recruitment to cellâcell junctions</title>
        <p>Because phosphorylated VASP (P-VASP) accumulates at cellâcell junctions under conditions that enhance barrier recovery, it was proposed that P-VASP is a component of TJs (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2002</xref>). VASP phosphorylation on residue Ser157 results in a conformational change concomitant with a shift in SDS-PAGE mobility from 46 to 50 kD (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Butt et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, we tested whether Rab13Q67L could interfere with VASP phosphorylation. Using a monoclonal anti-VASP antibody that recognizes nonphosphorylated as well as P-VASP, we found that in MDCK cells and cells expressing GFP or GFP-Rab13T22N, both forms of VASP were detected. In contrast, in cells expressing GFP-Rab13Q67L, only the 46-kD band corresponding to the nonphosphorylated form of VASP was detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). This indicates that GFP-Rab13Q67L inhibited phosphorylation of VASP at Ser157. To confirm these results, the same cell lysates used in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A were blotted with an anti-VASP antibody that specifically recognizes VASP phosphorylated at Ser157 (P-VASP). This antibody detected the 50-kD band corresponding to P-VASP in cells expressing GFP-Rab13T22N and in control cells, whereas no P-VASP specific band was observed in GFP-Rab13Q67L cell lysate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). Thus, the expression of Rab13Q67L specifically inhibits the phosphorylation of VASP at Ser157 in MDCK cells.</p>

In GFP-Rab13Q67L cells, the 50-kD band was not detected. (B) The same lysates as in A were blotted with a specific antibody recognizing VASP phosphorylated at Ser157 (P-VASP).

        <p>VASP phosphorylation at Ser157 was observed upon stimulation of PKA or PKG (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Burkhardt et al., 2000</xref>). To determine which kinase is responsible for the Rab13-dependent phosphorylation of VASP, we examined the effect of specific kinase inhibitors and activators on VASP phosphorylation. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A, incubation with both PKG and PKC inhibitors did not significantly reduce the phosphorylation of VASP in control cells or cells expressing GFP-Rab13T22N. In contrast, incubation with the PKA inhibitor H89 decreased the amount of P-VASP in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the effect on VASP-phosphorylation is specific. Moreover, treatment of cells expressing Rab13Q67L with 8-Br-cGMP, an activator of PKG, did not induce phosphorylation of VASP in those cells. Conversely, activation of PKA by either 8-Br-cAMP or Forskolin restored VASP phosphorylation in GFP-Rab13Q67L cells as monitored by the presence of the 50-kD band of VASP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). These data indicate that Rab13-dependent phosphorylation of VASP in MDCK cells is mediated by PKA, but not PKC or PKG.</p>

<bold>Rab13 regulates PKA-mediated VASP phosphorylation, thereby controlling VASP recruitment to cellâcell junctions.</bold> (A) PKA inhibition decreases VASP phosphorylation. MDCK or cells expressing GFP or GFP-Rab13T22N were treated with inhibitors of PKG (KT5823), PKC (RÃ¶-32-0432), or PKA (H89) and the lysates blotted for VASP. (B) Activation of PKA by Forskolin or cAMP, but not that of PKG by cGMP restores VASP phosphorylation in Rab13Q67L cells. Cells expressing GFP-Rab13Q67L were incubated with Forskolin (Fsk), 8-Br-cAMP or 8-Br-cGMP and VASP was detected by immunoblot. Nontreated cells were blotted as a control. (C) Cells expressing GFP-Rab13Q67L or GFP-Rab13T22N were treated with Forskolin (Fsk) or the PKA inhibitor (H89), respectively, and analyzed by immunofluorescence with the antiâP-VASP antibody. P-VASP was not detected at cellâcell junctions in Rab13Q67L cells, but relocated to TJ upon PKA activation. Inhibition of PKA removed P-VASP from cellâcell contacts in cells expressing Rab13T22N. P-VASP was found in cellâcell contacts where junctional complexes developed with neighboring cells (arrows), and absent from the edges of cells devoid of junctional complexes (arrowheads).

        <p>To investigate whether VASP phosphorylation is required for its recruitment to cellâcell junctions, MDCK cells expressing GFP-Rab13Q67L or GFP-Rab13T22N were incubated with Forskolin and H89, respectively, and P-VASP localization was examined by immunofluorescence using the antibody recognizing P-VASP. In the absence of Forskolin, no P-VASP could be detected at cellâcell junctions in cells expressing GFP-Rab13Q67L (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). However, activation of PKA by Forskolin restored the recruitment of P-VASP to cellâcell junctions in those cells. In contrast, in cells expressing GFP-Rab13T22N, P-VASP was detected at cellâcell junctions. Treatment of those cells with the specific PKA inhibitor H89 removed P-VASP from cellâcell junctions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). Overall, our results demonstrate that activation of Rab13 inhibits PKA-mediated phosphorylation of VASP and prevents its association with intercellular junctions.</p>

        <title>Activation of PKA abolishes the inhibitory effect of Rab13Q67L on the recruitment of TJ proteins, ZO-1 and claudin1</title>
        <p>To determine whether the effect of Rab13 on claudin1 and ZO-1 recruitment could be mediated by PKA, we examined the consequences of PKA activation on the recruitment of ZO-1 and claudin1 in cells expressing GFP-Rab13Q67L using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch assay. In control cells as well as in cells expressing GFP-Rab13T22N or GFP-Rab13Q67L, removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> resulted in the dissociation of cellâcell junctions and redistribution of ZO-1 and claudin1 into the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). By 2 h after addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ZO-1 immunoreactivity was already detected at cellâcell junctions in cells expressing GFP and GFP-Rab13T22N. In contrast, expression of GFP-Rab13Q67L delayed slightly the recruitment of ZO-1; ZO-1 labeling was discontinuous along the lateral membrane. By 4 h after readdition of calcium, ZO-1 staining was detected at the plasma membrane, but some ZO-1 immunoreactivity was still observed in the cytoplasm in cells expressing GFP-Rab13Q67L (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). Similarly, plasma membrane recruitment of claudin1 was delayed in cells expressing GFP-Rab13Q67L. Within 6â12 h after readdition of calcium, most of the claudin1 staining was still cytoplasmic in GFP-Rab13Q67L cells, whereas claudin1 was detected at the plasma membrane in cells expressing GFP or GFP-Rab13T22N (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Significantly, activation of PKA with Forskolin restored the kinetics of both ZO-1 and claudin1 recruitment to the lateral membrane in GFP-Rab13Q67L cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This indicates that PKA activation abolished the inhibitory effect of Rab13GTP on the recruitment of TJ proteins, leading to their accumulation at cellâcell junctions. Our data establish that the Rab13âPKA signaling complex plays a key role in TJ biogenesis. They further confirm that PKA-dependent phosphorylation is implicated in the dynamics of epithelial TJ.</p>

        <title>Rab13GTP binds to the PKA catalytic subunit and inhibits its activity in vitro</title>
        <p>Given that Rab13 interferes with PKA signaling in the regulation of TJ assembly, we wondered whether and how Rab13 interacts with PKA. Thus, we performed a GST pull-down assay from MDCK cell lysates using GST-Rab13 fusion proteins. GST alone or GST-Rab13 were immobilized on glutathione beads, preloaded either with GDP or GTPÎ³S (a poorly hydrolysable GTP analogue), and incubated with MDCK cell lysates. The proteins retained on the beads were separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted with an antibody against the Î± catalytic subunit of PKA. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, the Î± catalytic subunit of PKA, but not atypical PKCÎ¶ (aPKCÎ¶), was preferentially recovered with GST-Rab13 loaded with GTPÎ³S, whereas GST alone did not interact with PKA or aPKCÎ¶. To verify whether the Rab13âPKA interaction is direct, GST-Rab13 loaded with GDP, GTPÎ³S, or GST alone were incubated with a purified preparation of PKA catalytic subunit. Blotting with the anti-PKA antibody revealed that PKA preferentially bound to GST-Rab13-GTPÎ³S, but neither to GST alone, nor to GST-Rab6GTPÎ³S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B), indicating that Rab13 interacts directly and specifically with the PKA catalytic subunit.</p>

<bold>Rab13GTP interacts in vitro directly with PKA and inhibits its activity.</bold> (A) MDCK cell lysates were incubated with GST or GST-Rab13 fusion proteins preloaded with GDP or GTPÎ³S. The retained proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against the Î± catalytic subunit of PKA or aPKCÎ¶. Equal loading was confirmed by ponceau staining. (B) GST-Rab13 or GST-Rab6 preloaded with GDP, GTPÎ³S, or GST was incubated with the purified catalytic subunit of PKA. Proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with the anti-PKA antibody. 48% of the PKA was recovered with GST-Rab13-GTPÎ³S. (C) VASP immunoprecipitate from cells expressing GFP-Rab13Q67L was incubated in an in vitro kinase assay with the purified catalytic subunit of PKA in the presence of PKI (a peptide inhibitor of PKA), GST-Rab13-GTPÎ³S, or GST. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the anti-VASP antibody recognizing both phosphorylated and nonâP-VASP.</p>

        <p>Because the GTP bound form of Rab13 inhibits PKA-dependent VASP phosphorylation in vivo, we next determined whether Rab13GTP interferes with PKA activity in vitro. VASP was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing GFP-Rab13Q67L and used as a physiologically relevant substrate for PKA in a kinase assay. PKI, a potent peptide inhibitor of PKA, was used as a positive control in these experiments. Incubation of VASP with the catalytic subunit of PKA induced VASP phosphorylation in vitro, resulting in a shift in SDS-PAGE mobility from 46 to 50 kD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C). Similarly to PKI, GST-Rab13-GTPÎ³S caused a strong inhibition of PKA activity, whereas GST alone had no effect. The results in vitro are concordant with those in vivo and demonstrate that Rab13 is able to inhibit PKA activity.</p>
        <p>In this paper, we identified PKA as a new effector for the small GTPase Rab13. Our data demonstrate that the GTP bound form of Rab13 directly binds and negatively controls PKA activity both in vitro and in vivo. This is the first demonstration of a biochemical and functional link between a small Rab GTPase and the PKA catalytic subunit.</p>
        <p>Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events are required for the regulation of TJ dynamics (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Sakakibara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Matter and Balda, 2003</xref>). In these processes, VASP may play a key role due to its differential actin binding capacities depending on its state of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of VASP by PKA reduces VASPâactin interactions and promotes the association of P-VASP with cellâcell junctions. Interestingly, VASP is required for the establishment of cellâcell contacts (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Vasioukhin et al., 2000</xref>). Although Rab13 does not affect the recruitment of E-cadherin (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Marzesco et al., 2002</xref>) and Î²-catenin to cellâcell junctions (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312118/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312118/DC1</ext-link>), we cannot rule out the possibility that Rab13 alters TJ assembly through regulating the recruitment of other adherens junction components. We suggest that Rab13GTP could locally influence actin rearrangement by controlling PKA-dependent VASP phosphorylation and hence inhibit TJ integrity. Our previous data suggested that Rab13, in its GTP-bound form, interacts with an effector that inhibits the recruitment of claudin1 and, to a lesser extent, that of ZO-1 to TJ. Conversely, the inactive form Rab13T22N, unable to bind the effector, favors the establishment of TJ gate and fence functions (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Marzesco et al., 2002</xref>). The inhibitory effect of the Rab13Q67L mutant on TJ assembly and function could thus be explained by the inhibition of PKA activity. The Rab13âPKA signaling complex may as well regulate vesicle docking near cellâcell junctions. Indeed, PKA activity has been shown to be required for membrane trafficking (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Pimplikar and Simons, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Rodionov et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, our observations allow us to postulate the existence of a new signaling cascade at the TJ implicating Rab13âPKA in the dynamics of TJ assembly. They also highlight novel insights into the role of Rab proteins in membraneâcytoskeleton interactions.</p>
