          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Septins are conserved GTPases that form filaments and are required in many organisms for several processes including cytokinesis. We previously identified SEPT9 associated with phagosomes containing latex beads coated with the <italic>Listeria</italic> surface protein InlB.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Here, we investigated septin function during entry of invasive bacteria in non-phagocytic mammalian cells. We found that SEPT9, and its interacting partners SEPT2 and SEPT11, are recruited as collars next to actin at the site of entry of <italic>Listeria</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic>. SEPT2-depletion by siRNA decreased bacterial invasion, suggesting that septins have roles during particle entry. Incubating cells with InlB-coated beads confirmed an essential role for SEPT2. Moreover, SEPT2-depletion impaired InlB-mediated stimulation of Met-dependent signaling as shown by FRET.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Together these findings highlight novel roles for SEPT2, and distinguish the roles of septin and actin in bacterial entry.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Septins were originally identified in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as required for septum formation and cell division <xref rid="pone.0004196-Hartwell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Septins are small GTPases of 30â65 kDa found in fungi and animals sharing at least a conserved role in cytokinesis <xref rid="pone.0004196-Kinoshita1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Kinoshita2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Mammalian septins are increasingly recognized for other cellular functions including roles in cell membrane dynamics <xref rid="pone.0004196-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Joo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, vesicle fusion events <xref rid="pone.0004196-Beites1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and the assembly of signaling complexes beneath the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0004196-Kinoshita3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Septin dysfunction has been associated with several human pathological conditions such as cancer <xref rid="pone.0004196-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy <xref rid="pone.0004196-Kuhlenbaumer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and Parkinson disease <xref rid="pone.0004196-Ihara1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Despite these important implications, the molecular functions of septins are poorly understood.</p>
      <p>Fourteen human septin genes have been identified, and septins are classified on the basis of sequence identity into 4 groups consisting of the SEPT2 group (also called group 2B: SEPT1, SEPT2, SEPT4, SEPT5), the SEPT3 group (also called group 1A: SEPT3, SEPT9, SEPT12), the SEPT6 group (also called group 1B: SEPT6, SEPT8, SEPT10, SEPT11, SEPT14), and the SEPT7 group (a subclassification of group 2B: SEPT7, SEPT13) <xref rid="pone.0004196-Kinoshita1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Weirich1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Septins polymerize into hetero-oligomeric protein complexes that form filaments, and associate with cellular membranes, actin filaments, and microtubules <xref rid="pone.0004196-Kinoshita3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Spiliotis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, septins are increasingly regarded as a novel cytoskeletal component. In vitro, bundles of septin filaments can form rings of approximately 0.6 Âµm in diameter <xref rid="pone.0004196-Kinoshita4" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The crystal structure of a septin complex (SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7) was recently solved <xref rid="pone.0004196-Sirajuddin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The structure demonstrated a central role for SEPT2 in filament formation, and definitively established that septins, as opposed to actin and microtubules, form non-polar filaments. Despite these and other structural insights <xref rid="pone.0004196-Weirich1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Barral1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, to what degree septins represent a distinct component of the cytoskeleton remains to be determined. Furthermore, the extent to which other septin complexes, such as SEPT7-SEPT9-SEPT11 <xref rid="pone.0004196-Nagata1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> or SEPT5-SEPT7-SEPT11 <xref rid="pone.0004196-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, share properties and/or functionally compete with the crystallized SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex is not yet known.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> is an intracellular pathogen able to induce its own internalization into non-phagocytic cells <xref rid="pone.0004196-PizarroCerda1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Of the several bacterial surface proteins that participate in <italic>Listeria</italic> entry into non-phagocytic cells <xref rid="pone.0004196-Bierne1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, the two best characterized are InlA and InlB, either of which is independently sufficient to promote bacterial internalization into mammalian epithelial cells that express its respective receptor. InlA interacts with the surface protein E-cadherin <xref rid="pone.0004196-Mengaud1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, while InlB recognizes the receptor tyrosine kinase Met <xref rid="pone.0004196-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These different interactions both have well-described cell signaling consequences, including actin polymerization and membrane extension, which ultimately lead to bacterial uptake <xref rid="pone.0004196-Hamon1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Cossart1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In order to identify other cellular effectors involved in the early steps of <italic>Listeria</italic> infection, we previously performed a proteomic analysis of phagosomes containing latex beads coated with InlA or InlB <xref rid="pone.0004196-PizarroCerda2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This approach allowed us to detect SEPT9 associated with InlB-bead phagosomes, implicating septins for the first time in bacterial infection.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the well-established roles of actin <xref rid="pone.0004196-Gouin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Cossart2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and microtubules <xref rid="pone.0004196-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Greber1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> during the infection process, septin function during microbial invasion has not yet been investigated. We thus decided to address this issue. We first show that SEPT9 interacts with several septins, including the core SEPT2. By infecting human cell lines we show septin recruitment at the site of bacterial entry. We then use siRNA and demonstrate a role for SEPT2 in the bacterial entry process.</p>

        <title>SEPT9 interacts with septins from other groups</title>
        <p>A hallmark of septins is their ability to form protein complexes and filaments. Characterized complexes isolated from mammalian cells include SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 <xref rid="pone.0004196-Kinoshita4" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Sirajuddin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and SEPT7-SEPT9-SEPT11 <xref rid="pone.0004196-Nagata1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We previously found SEPT9 in association with phagosomes containing InlB-coated beads <xref rid="pone.0004196-PizarroCerda2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To identify unknown molecules interacting with SEPT9, we performed yeast-two hybrid screens using SEPT9 as bait against human placental and colon cDNA libraries, and identified SEPT2, SEPT6, SEPT7, and SEPT11 as binding partners of SEPT9.</p>
        <p>We also used immunoprecipitation in HeLa cells, a cell line that expresses the InlB receptor but not the InlA receptor. Using antibodies for SEPT9, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments on cells stimulated or not with purified InlB, and identified by mass spectrometry, in both cases, SEPT2, SEPT7, and SEPT11 coimmunoprecipitating with SEPT9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004196-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

            <title>Binding partners of SEPT9.</title>
            <p>To search for binding partners of SEPT9, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies for SEPT9 and lysates from untreated HeLa cells (âInlB), or HeLa cells stimulated for 2 minutes with 5 nM (total) of purified InlB (+InlB). Mass spectrometry was subsequently performed on samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE, where in both cases SEPT2, SEPT7, and SEPT11 were identified to coimmunoprecipitate with SEPT9.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Together these data indicate that SEPT9 forms higher order structures with other septins in vivo. SEPT2, SEPT7, and SEPT6/SEPT11 each represent a different septin group, suggesting that SEPT9 interacts with members of other groups to form a complex, and/or participates in the formation of previously unidentified septin complexes.</p>

        <title>Expression, localization, and recruitment during bacterial invasion of SEPT2, SEPT9, and SEPT11 in human non-phagocytic cells</title>
        <p>Before starting to analyze if septin proteins play a role in <italic>Listeria</italic> invasion of non-phagocytic cells, we first compared by Western blotting septin expression in two different human epithelial cell lines: the well-studied HeLa cells, and JEG-3 cells, a trophoblast cell line that expresses both the InlA and InlB receptors. As our antibodies against SEPT2, SEPT9, and SEPT11 could be used in both Western blotting and immunofluorescence labeling, we focused our analysis on these septins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004196-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows that SEPT2, SEPT9, and SEPT11 were more expressed in JEG-3 cells as compared to HeLa cells. We then confirmed using immunofluorescence labeling that SEPT2, SEPT9, and SEPT11 form filaments that partially colocalize with actin filaments and microtubules in non-dividing, non-infected HeLa and JEG-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004196-g002">Figure 2B and C</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0004196-Kinoshita3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Spiliotis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>

            <p>(A) Western blots (WB) of septins in non-phagocytic cell lines. HeLa and JEG-3 cells were harvested, and cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE before immunoblotting. Blots were probed with antibodies specific to GAPDH, SEPT2, SEPT9, SEPT11, and actin. Blots for GAPDH are shown as a loading control. (B) Septin filaments partially colocalize with actin filaments in HeLa cells. Endogenous Î±-tubulin, F-actin, and SEPT2, SEPT9, or SEPT11 were visualized by immunostaining with anti-Î±-tubulin (grey and in Merge blue), anti-F-actin (green), and anti-SEPT2, anti-SEPT9, or anti-SEPT11 antibodies (red). Representative confocal images for Î±-tubulin, F-actin, and SEPT11 distribution in HeLa cells are here displayed, and similar images were obtained labeling for SEPT2 or SEPT9. Scale bars indicate 10 Âµm. (C) Septin filaments partially colocalize with microtubules in JEG-3 cells. Endogenous Î±âtubulin, F-actin, and SEPT2, SEPT9, or SEPT11 were visualized for immunostaining with anti-Î±-tubulin (grey and in Merge blue), anti-F-actin (green), and anti-SEPT2, anti-SEPT9, or anti-SEPT11 antibodies (red). Representative confocal images for Î±-tubulin, F-actin, and SEPT11 distribution in JEG-3 cells are here displayed, and similar images were obtained labeling for SEPT2 or SEPT9. Scale bars indicate 10 Âµm. (D) Septin recruitment at the site of <italic>Listeria</italic> entry in JEG-3 cells. Cells were infected with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> BUG 1641 for 5, 10, or 15 minutes and then fixed for microscopy. Endogenous septin was stained with anti-SEPT2, anti-SEPT9, or anti-SEPT11 antibodies (red). Actin was stained with anti-F-actin (green), and <italic>Listeria</italic> was marked using DAPI (blue). Representative photos are here displayed, where inset images highlight the septin collar-like recruitment around <italic>Listeria</italic> to which the white arrows are pointing.

To visualize recruitment in real-time, we co-transfected JEG-3 cells with actin-YFP and SEPT9-CFP, and observed cells by videomicroscopy during the early steps of <italic>Listeria</italic> invasion. Videomicroscopy confirmed septin collar-like recruitment at the site of <italic>Listeria</italic> entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004196.s001">Movie S1</xref>).

        <p>We then analyzed septin recruitment during bacterial invasion in HeLa cells.

We thus quantified the percentage of actin-positive <italic>Listeria</italic> that also recruit septin during entry.

<italic>Listeria</italic> enter HeLa cells via interactions between the cell surface receptor Met and the bacterial ligand InlB. Given the impact of SEPT2 depletion on particle entry, we hypothesized that signaling events induced upon InlB/Met interaction should be affected. We focused our study on one signaling pathway induced upon InlB/Met interaction, that of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase activation, and used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach previously developed in our lab <xref rid="pone.0004196-Seveau1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The assay is based on the fact that 3â²-phosphoinositides produced by PI 3-kinase upon InlB-induced Met activation recruit the serine/threonine kinase Akt from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. SEPT2-depleted cells and control cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding YFP-AktPH and CFP-AktPH. Morphological alterations were used as a gauge of which cells were efficiently silenced for SEPT2. The FRET stoichiometry measurement between YFP-AktPH and CFP-AktPH was then performed to determine FRET efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004196-g005">Figure 5A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004196.s002">Movie S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004196.s003">S3</xref>).

      <p>Septins are small GTPases that can form filaments, and are increasingly recognized as new cytoskeleton components different from actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments <xref rid="pone.0004196-Weirich1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Spiliotis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. SEPT9 was previously identified by our laboratory to associate with InlB-bead phagosomes in non-phagocytic cells <xref rid="pone.0004196-PizarroCerda2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We demonstrate here that during infection septins and actin can be detected at the bacterial entry site, though septins form striking collar shape structures around entering bacteria similar to those found at the yeast mother-bud neck. Using siRNA to specifically establish a role for septins, we reveal that SEPT2 is critical for the bacterial entry process. This strongly introduces septins as new regulators of bacterial entry and phagocytosis, and highlights that septins have previously unrecognized cellular functions.</p>

Taken together, our data reveal an effect of SEPT2-depletion on the interaction of InlB with its host receptor Met, and consequently on bacterial entry.</p>
        <p>Recent structural data has demonstrated that septins are ordered in the isolated complex as SEPT7-SEPT6-SEPT2-SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 <xref rid="pone.0004196-Sirajuddin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

These results have been observed in several mammalian non-phagocytic cell lines (our unpublished results), and are in agreement with recent work showing that septin recruitment is required for phagosome formation during FcÎ³R-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages <xref rid="pone.0004196-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, we show here characteristic differences in the architecture of actin and septin enrichment at the site of bacterial entry, strongly suggesting distinct and probably complementary roles for actin and septin in the process of entry. Whether or not septin filaments assemble directly at the site of entry is currently unknown, and future study of bacterial invasion will address the kinetics and function of septin ring formation.</p>
        <p>The mechanisms underlying septin recruitment at the site of particle entry, and more generally how septins interact with membranes, is not yet clear. To begin to investigate the signals responsible for septin accumulation at the site of bacterial entry, JEG-3 cells were treated with cytochalasin D which inhibits actin polymerization. This treatment resulted in an inhibition of both actin and septin accumulation at the site of <italic>Listeria</italic> entry (data not shown). Accumulation of septins at the phagocytic cup is thus intimately linked to the accumulation of actin, albeit in an unknown fashion. In contrast, inhibition of microtubule polymerization by pretreatment of JEG-3 cells with nocodazole did not prevent actin and septin accumulation at the site of <italic>Listeria</italic> or <italic>Shigella</italic> entry (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Septins are capable of binding to phosphatidylinositol lipids <xref rid="pone.0004196-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, and thus could be targeted to the <italic>Listeria</italic> entry site by these secondary messengers.

In agreement with this proposal, during FcÎ³R-mediated phagocytosis of latex beads, septin accumulation was colocalized with the phosphatidylinositol lipid PIP<sub>2</sub>

There is evidence that septin filament organization depends on Rho-family GTPase signaling pathways <xref rid="pone.0004196-Nagata2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and the organization of septin and actin filaments has been associated to Rhotekin, a downstream effector of Rho signaling <xref rid="pone.0004196-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

How the Rho/Rhotekin, Cdc42/Borgs, and likely other signaling pathways could influence septin assembly to regulate the efficiency of bacterial entry is not yet understood. This could occur potentially by recruiting multi-protein complexes to forming phagosomes on the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0004196-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and/or by contributing towards the spatial organization of actin and/or surface receptors during this actin-based process.</p>

        <title>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)</title>
        <p>As previously described by our laboratory <xref rid="pone.0004196-Seveau1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, PI 3-kinase activation can be measured by the production of its lipid products PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> which recruit the serine/threonine kinase Akt from the cytosol to the membrane, with the Akt pleckstrin homology (PH) domain specifically interacting with PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0004196-Haugh1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Osaki1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. The quantification of FRET between two coexpressed fluorescent chimeras of the Akt PH domain, YFP-AktPH and CFP-AktPH, can be used as readout of PI 3-kinase activity. Without stimulation, the fluorescent chimeras are too dispersed in the cytosol to undergo FRET. Upon PI 3-kinase activation, the fluorescent AktPH chimeras concentrate at the plasma membrane, consequently leading to an increase in the FRET signal.</p>
        <p>FRET occurs when an excited donor fluorophore (i.e. CFP) is located in close proximity to a lower-energy acceptor fluorophore (i.e. YFP). The proximity of fluorophores within the YFP-AktPH/CFP-AktPH complex allowed FRET stoichiometry measurements to quantify FRET inside cells. Image acquisition and processing for FRET stoichiometry were performed as originally described <xref rid="pone.0004196-Hoppe1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and previously used in our laboratory <xref rid="pone.0004196-Seveau1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In brief, siRNA-treated HeLa cells were co-transfected using jetPEI (PolyPlus Transfection) according to the manufacturer's instructions with plasmids encoding YFP-AktPH and CFP-AktPH. FRET stoichiometry measurement between YFP-AktPH and CFP-AktPH was applied as a readout of PI 3-kinase activation. Fluorescence images, corresponding to CFP, YFP, and FRET, and a fourth phase-contrast image were acquired every 15 seconds for 15 minutes with a consistent exposure time. A final concentration of 5 nM soluble InlB was supplemented after the 15<sup>th</sup> frame. Application of the FRET stoichiometry equations, pixel by pixel, to the CFP, YFP, and FRET images was used to create a new image in which each pixel corresponds to (<italic>E<sub>A</sub></italic>+<italic>E<sub>D</sub></italic>)/2, a correction for variability in fluorescent chimera expression within and among cells <xref rid="pone.0004196-Hoppe1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004196-Hoppe2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. This term, referred to as FRET efficiency, is calculated by averaging the acceptor FRET efficiency (<italic>E<sub>A</sub></italic>) with the donor FRET efficiency (<italic>E<sub>D</sub></italic>), and allows comparison of FRET signals from cells expressing different molar ratios of fluorescent proteins. For kinetic studies we calculated, for each cell and time point, the mean (<italic>E<sub>A</sub></italic>+<italic>E<sub>D</sub></italic>)/2 over the entire cell. Final kinetics were obtained for 19 and 18 experiments, representing at least 3 biological replicates for each siRNA treatment, for control and SEPT2 siRNA-treated cells respectively.</p>
        <p>To automatically detect whether a cell could be classified as having responded or not to InlB stimulation, we designed our own analysis software carried out using an Excel Macro. Our analysis software is based on these following criteria. From the original kinetic signals [i.e. the mean (<italic>E<sub>A</sub></italic>+<italic>E<sub>D</sub></italic>)/2 over the entire cell], a first median linear filter [formula: y<sub>i</sub>â=â(â<sub>iân/2,i+n/2</sub> y<sub>i</sub>)/n, nâ=â3] was applied to smooth artifact arising from the acquisition of original signal. The slope of each filtered curve was subsequently calculated for each time point, and was plotted as the processed âFRET responseâ (i.e. as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004196-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Starting from T<sub>0</sub> (here defined as the time frame immediately following InlB stimulation, frame 16), T<sub>max</sub> was detected when the slope again reached a minimum, where minimum slope is based on a null second derivative function. T<sub>max</sub>âT<sub>0</sub> was used to define the duration of FRET response (where units are frames per 15 seconds). Between these 2 time points, the amplitude of the original signal [i.e. the mean (<italic>E<sub>A</sub></italic>+<italic>E<sub>D</sub></italic>)/2 over the entire cell] was calculated as a characteristic to qualify the response. As a final characteristic, the maximum slope was calculated between T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>max</sub>. This value also served to determine if the FRET response of that cell was positive. In the case where T<sub>max</sub> could not be detected based on these criteria (i.e. the SEPT2-depleted cell from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004196-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), such cells were then classified as not responding to InlB stimulation.</p>
