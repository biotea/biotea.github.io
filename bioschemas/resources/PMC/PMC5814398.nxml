Here we report men with primary infertility due to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella with severe disorganization of the sperm axoneme, a microtubule-based structure highly conserved throughout evolution.

CRISPR/Cas9 created homozygous <italic>CFAP43</italic>/<italic>44</italic> male mice that were infertile and presented severe flagellar defects confirming the human genetic results. Immunoelectron and stimulated-emission-depletion microscopy performed on CFAP43 and CFAP44 orthologs in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> evidenced that both proteins are located between the doublet microtubules 5 and 6 and the paraflagellar rod. Overall, we demonstrate that CFAP43 and CFAP44 have a similar structure with a unique axonemal localization and are necessary to produce functional flagella in species ranging from <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> to human.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">Medical treatment of infertility has rapidly evolved over the past four decades, but much remains to be accomplished<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Despite recent success in identifying infertility genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, most genetic causes of male infertility are currently uncharacterized and additional efforts should be pursued to better characterize male infertility. We demonstrated previously that mutations in the <italic>DNAH1</italic> gene are responsible for multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), an infertility phenotype characterized by severe asthenozoospermia due to a combination of flagellar defects including short, curled, abnormal width, rolled, or absent flagella<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>DNAH1</italic> encodes an axonemal inner dynein arm heavy chain, the lack of which leads to a strong disorganization of the axoneme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. <italic>DNAH1</italic> mutations were identified in approximately one-third of the studied patients, indicating that MMAF is genetically heterogeneous and that other genes are likely to be involved in this syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">In the present study, we analyzed 78 MMAF patients using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and showed that in addition to mutations in <italic>DNAH1</italic>, mutations in <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic>, two genes encoding for WD repeat domains (WDR) containing proteins, are responsible for MMAF syndrome and account for 20.5% of this cohort. Most importantly, we investigated the role of these novel genes by performing gene invalidation and silencing in two evolutionary distant models, <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and mouse, yet sharing an extremely conserved flagellar structure. Using this original approach, we demonstrate the importance of WDR proteins for axonemal structure of flagella and male fertility in humans.</p>

        <title>Identification of <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic> mutations in MMAF patients</title>
        <p id="Par5">In the present study, we analyzed a cohort of 78 individuals presenting with a MMAF phenotype defined by the presence in the ejaculate of immotile spermatozoa with several abnormalities of the sperm flagellum including short, coiled, absent, and flagella of irregular caliber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). A majority of patients originated from North Africa, 46 were recruited in Tunisia, 10 in Iran, and 22 in France. The average semen parameters of all 78 MMAF patients included in the cohort are described in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Nearly no spermatozoa with normal morphology could be observed in the ejaculate of MMAF individuals (1.6%); an average of 20.7 and 43.7% of spermatozoa had no flagella and short flagella, respectively, and 31.7% of the spermatozoa had flagella with an irregular caliber. As a result, total sperm motility was dramatically reduced to 3.9% (normal value &gt;40%), which prevented natural conception for all individuals. Given the notion of consanguinity for most individuals from the cohort, we postulated that infertility was likely transmitted through recessive inheritance and probably often resulted from homozygous mutations. After exclusion of frequent variants and applying stringent filters, a limited list of homozygous variants was identified for each proband. First, we identified six patients (7.7%) with mutations in the <italic>DNAH1</italic> gene (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), previously identified as the main cause of MMAF phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. We subsequently identified 10 subjects with variants in <italic>CFAP43</italic> (12.8%), eight of which had a homozygous loss-of-function variant and two with two likely deleterious variants (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition, six subjects (7.7%) had a homozygous loss-of-function variant in <italic>CFAP44</italic> (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These two <italic>CFAP</italic> genes (for cilia and flagella associated protein) were reported in public expression databases to be strongly expressed in the testis and to be connected with cilia and flagella structure and/or functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments performed in human and mouse tissue panels confirmed that <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic> mRNA in testis was predominant and very significantly higher than in the other tested tissues (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Taking into account the high number of mutated patients and the specific expression pattern of the two genes, we focused on these two genes, which appeared as the best candidates to explain the primary infertility observed for these individuals. All individuals with <italic>CFAP43</italic> or <italic>CFAP44</italic> mutations were unrelated; to our knowledge, none carried rare variants in genes previously reported to be associated with male infertility. <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic> encoded proteins thatÂ belong to the WDR protein family and are both composed of nine WD repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Morphology of spermatozoa from the patients P<sub>43</sub>-8 and P<sub>44</sub>-3 and position of <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic> mutations in the intronâexon structure and in the protein. <bold>a</bold> All spermatozoa have a much shorter flagellum than those of controls.

        <p id="Par6"><italic>CFAP43</italic> (also known as <italic>WDR96</italic>, NM_025145) is localized on chromosome 10 and contains 38 exons encoding a predicted 1,665-amino-acid protein (Q8NDM7). We identified 9 different pathogenic variants in <italic>CFAP43</italic> in 10 unrelated individuals from the cohort. The splicing variant c.3541â2A&gt;C was identified in two unrelated individuals and affects a consensus splice acceptor site of <italic>CFAP43</italic> intron 27 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This variant was absent from the 60,706 unrelated individuals aggregated in the ExAC database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://exac.broadinstitute.org">http://exac.broadinstitute.org</ext-link>), consistent with a deleterious effect on protein function. Three other variants correspond to stop-gain mutations identified in three subjects: c.2658G&gt;A and c.2680C&gt;T are located in exon 21 and c.3352C&gt;T in the exon 26 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). These three variants were found in the ExAC database with very low allele frequency ranging from 8.24e<sup>â06</sup> to 9.89e<sup>â05</sup>. Two others mutations were small frameshift indels not listed in ExAC: c.1240_1241delGT (found in two unrelated patients) and c.3882delA (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). All these mutations generate premature stop codons and are predicted to produce no protein or truncated non-functional proteins. Apart from these obvious harmful mutations found in eight patients, we also identified two patients harboring likely deleterious mutations in <italic>CFAP43</italic>. The first patient harbors a homozygous splicing mutation c.2141+5G&gt;A, not listed in ExAC which, according to the splice site prediction algorithm Human Splicing Finder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.umd.be/HSF3">http://www.umd.be/HSF3</ext-link>), likely alters the consensus splice donor site of <italic>CFAP43</italic> exon 16. Unfortunately, we could not obtain any additional biological material from this patient and could not verify the effect of this variant on mRNA expression. The second patient is a compound heterozygous carrying one single-nucleotide duplication, c.1320dupT, located in the exon 11 and an additional missense mutation, Val347Ala, located in exon 8 of the <italic>CFAP43</italic> gene. Although prediction software classified this last variant as likely âbenign,â this mutation affects a conserved residue located in the N-terminal part of the protein within a WDR known to be important for protein/protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, this missense variant is found at a very low prevalence in the general population estimated to 7.45eâ5 (9/12078). Altogether the above-identified mutations clearly indicate that in humans, loss of function of <italic>CFAP43</italic> is associated with asthenozoospermia and sperm flagellum defects.</p>
        <p id="Par7"><italic>CFAP44</italic> (also known as WDR52, NM_001164496) is localized on chromosome 3 and contains 35 exons encoding a predicted 1,854-amino-acid protein (Q96MT7). Five different homozygous variants were identified in six unrelated patients (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Stop-gain mutations c.1387G&gt;T and c.3175C&gt;T are located in exons 12 and 23, respectively. The frameshift mutations, c.4767delT, with a single-nucleotide deletion, are located in exon 31, and the variant c.2818dupG, with a single-nucleotide duplication, is located in exon 21. The last mutation, c.1890+1C&gt;T, affects exon 15 consensus splice donor site. All these mutations are predicted to generate a premature stop codon. None of these variants were listed in the ExAC database.</p>
        <p id="Par8">The presence of all variants was verified by bidirectional Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The detailed sperm parameters of the patients carrying <italic>DNAH1</italic>, <italic>CFAP43</italic>, or <italic>CFAP44</italic> mutations were compared with each other. There was no significant difference between the three groups (Table <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>) as illustrated by the similar morphologies of sperm from patient P<sub>43</sub>-8 and P<sub>44</sub>-3, mutated for <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic>, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Data from all these groups were therefore pooled and compared with data from the patients with no identified mutation. Patients with a mutation had a significantly higher rate of spermatozoa with short or absent flagella and presented a significantly lower motility rate compared to patients with no identified mutations. There was no difference in the other sperm parameters (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>

        <title><italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic> mutations induce severe axonemal disorganization</title>
        <p id="Par9">The internal skeleton of motile cilia and flagella, named the axoneme, is a highly evolutionary conserved structure, which consists of nine doublets of microtubules (DMTs) circularly arranged around a central pair complex (CPC) of microtubules (â²9+2â² structure). All DMTs are not identical and are organized in a highly reproducible fashion with substructures specific to certain doublets. The convention adopted in the numbering of the DMTs was based on the relative position of each DMT with regard to the plane of the CPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The beating of cilia and flagella is orchestrated by multiprotein-ATPase complexes, located on the peripheral doublets, which provide the sliding force for sperm motility. In addition, the sperm flagellum harbors specific peri-axonemal structures, which are not found in other motile cilia, a helical mitochondrial sheath (MS) in the midpiece, the fibrous sheath (FS) in the principal piece (PP), and outer dense fibers (ODFs) in the midpiece and the proximal part of the PP.</p>
        <p id="Par10">We studied the ultrastructure of sperm cells from mutated patients in <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic> by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Due to insufficient amount of sperm cells collected from most <italic>CFAP44</italic> and <italic>CFAP43</italic> patients, only one patient for each gene was studied by TEM. For each patient, we could observe longitudinal sections and &gt;20 cross-sections presenting a sufficient quality to observe the ultrastructure of the axonemal components. Longitudinal sections showed severe axonemal and peri-axonemal defects affecting the ODF, the FS, and the MS, which appeared completely disorganized resulting in aborted flagella or their replacement by a cytoplasmic mass englobing unassembled axonemal components (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In <italic>CFAP43</italic>-mutated and <italic>CFAP44</italic>-mutated patients, approximately 95% of the cross-sections were abnormal and the main defect observed was the absence of the CPC (9+0 conformation) observed in 81.8, and 66.7% of the cases, respectively, compared to 0% in control fertile subject (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In the residual fraction (~5%) of axoneme with normal (9+2) conformation, peri-axonemal structures abnormalities were constantly observed (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The lack of central pair defects was associated with peripheral doublets disorganization in 13.6 and 19% for <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFA44</italic>, respectively (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Cross-sections with a single central microtubule (9+1 conformation) were observed in about 10% of cases, only for the CFAP44 patient. Interestingly, in CFAP43 patients, the CPC, when present, was misoriented compared to control sections in which the CPC is normally parallel to the axis of the two longitudinal columns of the FS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Transmission electron microscopy analysis of sperm cells from <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic> patients shows a severe axonemal disorganization.

        <p id="Par11">To define the ultrastructural defects evidenced by TEM, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) experiments using antibodies targeting different axonemal proteins. In <italic>CFAP43</italic>-mutated and <italic>CFAP44</italic>-mutated patients, staining of SPAG6, a protein located in the CPC, was abnormal and atypical compared to control staining (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3aâc</xref>). SPAG6 staining was absent in CFAP43 patient sperm cells, whereas in <italic>CFAP44</italic> patientsâ sperm cells, SPAG6 immunostaining was present but displayed an abnormal and diffuse pattern concentrated in the midpiece of the spermatozoa, quickly diminishing along the flagellum (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3dâi</xref>). Additionally, staining of the radial spoke head protein RSPH1 presented significantly different patterns compared to controls. In <italic>CFAP43</italic>-mutated patients, the RSPH1 staining was completely abnormal with a marked diffuse staining, concentrated in the midpiece, whereas the tubulin staining remained restricted to the axoneme (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3mâo</xref>). In <italic>CFAP44</italic>-mutated patientsâ sperm cells, RSPH1 staining was significantly reduced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3pâr</xref>). For <italic>CFAP43</italic>-mutated and <italic>CFAP44</italic>-mutated patients, immunostaining for AKAP4, DNALI1, DNAI2, and GAS8 were all comparable with controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3jâl</xref>), suggesting that FS, outer dynein arms, inner dynein arms, and the nexin-dynein regulatory complex, respectively, were not directly affected by mutations in <italic>CFAP43</italic> or <italic>CFAP44</italic> (Supplementary TableÂ <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec24">2</xref>âHuman).

        <title>Analysis of <italic>Cfap43</italic> and <italic>Cfap44</italic> knockout mice</title>
        <p id="Par12">We assessed the impact of <italic>Cfap43</italic> and <italic>Cfap44</italic> absence on mouse spermatogenesis by generating knockout (KO) animals using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We obtained four independent mutational events for <italic>Cfap43</italic> and three for <italic>Cfap44</italic>; all were insertions/deletions of a few nucleotides inducing a translational frameshift expected to lead to the complete absence of the protein or the production of a truncated protein. Because all KO strains for <italic>Cfap43</italic> presented the same reproductive phenotype (identical sperm morphology associated with complete infertility), we randomly chose one and restricted our study to a strain with a 4âbp deletion in exon 21 (delAAGG). Similarly, the <italic>Cfap44</italic> lines presented the same reproductive phenotype, and we focused on a strain with a 7âbp insertion in exon 3 (InsTCAGATA). RT-PCR was performed on testis RNA from <italic>Cfap43</italic><sup>â<italic>/</italic>â</sup> and <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup>â<italic>/</italic>â</sup> mice, which confirmed the production of abnormal transcripts in both mutants leading to a premature stop codon (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par13">The reproductive phenotype was studied for both KO mice models. Homozygous KO females were fully fertile and gave litters of normal size (7.8âÂ±â1.8 and 7.3âÂ±â3.5 versus 6.7âÂ±â0.5 pups/litter (meanâÂ±âSD, <italic>n</italic>â=â7) for <italic>Cfap43</italic><sup>â/â</sup>, <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup>â/â</sup>, and wild-type (WT), respectively), contrary to homozygous KO males, which exhibited complete infertility when mated with WT females (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Epididymal sperm concentrations were 11.4âÂ±â0.9, 11.2âÂ±â0.4, and 14.4âÂ±â3.1Ã10<sup>6</sup> sperm/ml (meanâÂ±âSD, <italic>n</italic>â=â3), for <italic>Cfap43</italic><sup>â/â</sup>, <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup>â/â</sup>, and WT, respectively, and fall within the normal values for the mouse. We next studied sperm morphology and observed that for <italic>Cfap43</italic><sup>â/â</sup> males, 100% of sperm displayed a typical human MMAF phenotype with short, thick, and coiled flagella (Fig. 4b); although slightly deformed, sperm head exhibited an overall normal hooked form (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). In contrast, sperm from <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup>â/â</sup> males had normal flagellum length, but most of them showed abnormal forms and irregular caliber of the midpiece (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4câf</xref>). In sperm from <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, staining of Mpc1l, a sperm mitochondrial protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, was discontinuous or punctiform, strongly suggesting that the distribution of the mitochondria surrounding the axoneme was irregular, consistent with the observed midpiece abnormalities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4hâm</xref>).

        <p id="Par15">The impact of the absence of these proteins on the flagellum ultrastructure was analyzed on sperms from <italic>Cfap43</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup>â/â</sup> by TEM. In the midpiece of WT mouse flagellum, the 9+2 axoneme is surrounded by nine ODFs and the mitochondria sheath<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The ODFs 1, 5, 6, and 9 are parallel and aligned with the central pair (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5m</xref>, see also Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref> for the DMT annotation). In addition, a transversal complex is composed of the central pair and DMTs 3 and 8. This complex includes ODFs 3 and 8 in the midpiece and is closely associated with the FS in the PP through two stalks emerging from the longitudinal column and linking DMTs 3 and 8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In the PP, the axoneme is surrounded by seven ODFs (3 and 8 are missing) and by an FS containing two longitudinal columns. Contrary to what is usually observed in human sperm, this organization is highly reproducible and &lt;5% of WT sections from mouse sperm flagellum present structural defects (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). Analyses of longitudinal sections from <italic>Cfap43</italic><sup>â/â</sup> sperm showed that the observed short tail actually corresponds to a large cytoplasmic mass containing unorganized structural components of the flagellum (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). When the axoneme was present, all transversal sections observed revealed a substantial structural disorganization with uneven distribution of the nine DMTs and the absence of the CPC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5n</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup>â/â</sup> sperm, the 9+2 organization of the axoneme was preserved in 70% of cases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b, d, e, gâi</xref>). The observed defects included the absence of peripheral doublets, external shift, or mislocalization of the central pair and distorted circular distribution of the DMTs with CPC misorientation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6dâf</xref>). <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup>â/â</sup> sperm also exhibited important defects of the ODFs and of the FS (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>). In the midpiece, the number of dense fibers was significantly higher and their localization and orientation were defective (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b, c</xref>). In the PP, ODFs 3 and 8 were abnormally retained, preventing normal anchoring of the FSâs stalks of on DMTs 3 and 8 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6gâi</xref>). The longitudinal columns also presented several defects: they were misaligned and not facing the 3-central-8 complex, leading to notable asymmetry of the structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6kân</xref>), which was reinforced in numerous sperm by the presence of a third longitudinal column (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6m, n</xref>).

        <title>TbCFAP43 and TbCFAP44 are necessary axonemal proteins</title>
        <p id="Par16">To better characterize CFAP43 and CFAP44 localization and function and to overcome the absence of reliable antibodies in human and murine cells, we decided to use <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<italic>T. brucei</italic>) as an additional model organism because this flagellated protozoan has largely contributed to elucidating the molecular pathogeny of human ciliopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. TheÂ <italic>T. brucei</italic> axoneme is similar to that of mammalian flagella, but its peri-axonemal structure, although comparable in function, is different. Instead of the FS and the ODFs found in mammalsâ flagella, it contains the paraflagellar rod (PFR), a complex structure connecting with the axonemal doublets 4â7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> which plays a role in flagellum motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and serves as a platform for metabolic and signaling enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In <italic>T. brucei</italic> the DMTs are numbered from the doublet opposite the PFR (no. 1), which is normally parallel to the central singlets. The doublets are then numbered clockwise, doublets 5 and 6 facing the PFR and doublets 4 and 7 being positioned on each side of the PFR (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>b for DMT annotation and relative PFR localization).</p>
        <p id="Par17">BLASTp analysis on <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> using human CFAP43 and CFAP44 sequences identified <italic>T. brucei</italic> orthologs Tb927.7.3560 (named TbCFAP44 in this study) and Tb927.4.5380 (named TbCFAP43 in this study), respectively. The sequence identity, calculated with clustal omega<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, between the four proteins shows that CFAP44 is closest to TbCFAP44 with 25.6% sequence identity and CFAP43 closest to TbCFAP43 with 20.8% sequence identity. Previous functional genomics and proteomic studies identified TbCFAP44 and TbCFAP43 as flagellar proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, TbCFAP44 is the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> FAP44 ortholog, and is involved in flagellar motility (also referred to as <italic>T. brucei</italic> components of motile flagella 7 (TbCMF7 in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>). However, the function of TbCFAP44 and TbCFAP43 are currently unknown. To confirm that both <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> proteins are the orthologs of the mouse and human proteins, we compared their secondary structure. The secondary structure predicted by Porter 4.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> shows that the four proteins share a common general motif with Î²-strand domains in the first half of the protein and Î±-helical domains in the second half (C-Ter) (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). We note that in CFAP43 and TbCFAP43, all residues between amino acids 719 and 1,657 and 631 and 1,446, respectively, are predicted to form Î±-helices. Interestingly, analyses using Superfamily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> indicated that long Î±-helices stretches such as those identified in CFAP43 (amino acids 719â1,657) have not yet been reported in any known fold. According to SCOP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, the N-terminal part of all four proteins (almost half of the proteins) belongs to the class of âAll Î²-proteinsâ and â7-bladed Î²-propeller fold.â These N-terminal domains also belong to the WD40 repeat-like superfamily (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). This structural comparative analysis indicates that TbCFAP44 and TbCFAP43 and their human orthologs share unique structural similarities and therefore demonstrates that these proteins belong to the same family.</p>
        <p id="Par18">We localized TbCFAP44 and TbCFAP43 in bloodstream from <italic>T. brucei</italic> (BSF,Â present in the mammalian host), using 10TY1-tagged and 3myc-tagged proteins by generating <italic>T. brucei</italic> cell lines expressing endogenous levels of N-terminal 10TY1-tagged proteins (<sub>10TY1</sub>TbCFAP44 and <sub>10TY1</sub>TbCFAP43) and C-terminal 3myc-tagged proteins (TbCFAP44<sub>myc</sub> and TbCFAP43<sub>myc</sub>). TY1 tag (EVHTNQDPLDGS, 1.8âkDa) is used as an epitope for immunolabeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> used for numerous immunolocalizations in trypanosomes, either as 1xTY1, 3xTY1, or, more recently, 10xTY1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Both proteins, whatever the tag used, were found in the axoneme as substantiated by co-labeling with an antibody against the PFR structure (Supplementary Figs.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>a, b). We acknowledge that the tag might interfere with protein function and localization; however, this result suggests that the 10TY1 tag did not interfere with the trafficking of either proteins which extended throughout the whole flagellum length, as demonstrated by the 3myc and 10TY1 labeling preceding the PFR at the posterior end of the flagellum (next to the kinetoplast) and along the flagellum up to its anterior end. To further investigate this localization we used the 10TY1 tag which produces a strong IF staining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> necessary for stimulated-emission-depletion (STED) confocal microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and created two double-labeled cell lines <sub>10TY1</sub><italic>TbCFAP44/TbCFAP43</italic><sub><italic>myc</italic></sub> and <sub>10TY1</sub><italic>TbCFAP43/TbCFAP44</italic><sub><italic>myc</italic></sub>. Triple labeling STED confocal microscopy of 10TY1-tagged proteins, tubulin, and PFR2 on permeabilized whole cells demonstrated that <sub>10TY1</sub>TbCFAP44 and <sub>10TY1</sub>TbCFAP43 are closely associated to the axoneme along the PFR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7aâf</xref>, respectively); similar results were obtained on detergent-extracted cytoskeletons. To confirm this remarkable localization, TEM immunogoldÂ labeling was performed using differently tagged proteins. We used the myc tag, a small tag of 10 amino acids which is known to have minimum effect on localization. Concordant with the STED microscopy results, all immunogold beads were located only along the axoneme and facing the PFR, therefore indicating that TbCFAP44 and TbCFAP43 are in direct contact only with the doublets facing the PFR, which correspond to DMTs 5 and 6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7gâj</xref>). The intervals between two adjacent gold particles were measured and the minimal distance between two particles was around 25ânm for both proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g, h</xref>, inset).

        <p id="Par20">To assess if the observed cellular phenotypes are caused by each protein independently or if the absence of one induces the absence of the other, we took advantage of the double-labeled cell lines <sub>10TY1</sub><italic>TbCFAP44/TbCFAP43</italic><sub><italic>myc</italic></sub> and <sub>10TY1</sub><italic>TbCFAP43/TbCFAP44</italic><sub><italic>myc</italic></sub>. Inactivation of TbCFAP43 by RNAi did not alter the amount and localization of TbCFAP44; conversely, inactivation of TbCFAP44 had no impact on TbCFAP43 protein (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par21">The impact of <italic>TbCFAP44</italic> and <italic>TbCFAP43</italic> knockdown was also investigated by TEM. In control longitudinal sections of parental cells, the flagellum exits the cell through the flagellar pocket (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8o</xref>), and, in cross-section, the canonical ultrastructure of the axoneme, composed of nine DMTs and the CPC, is observed (Fig. 8r). In control cell line only a small proportion (0.6%) of axonemes (<italic>n</italic>â=â172) were abnormal. In contrast, <italic>TbCFAP44</italic><sup>RNAi</sup>-induced and <italic>TbCFAP43</italic><sup>RNAi</sup>-induced cells were abnormal and displayed more than two flagella in one abnormally enlarged flagellar pocket (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8p, q</xref>). In cross-section, flagella exhibited numerous abnormal axonemes with 90Â° rotated CPC, a defect never observed in control trypanosome cell lines (Fig. 8p) and mainly displaced CPC and DMTs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8s, t</xref>). Overall 27.3% of <italic>TbCFAP44</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (<italic>n</italic>â=â139) and 27.7% of the <italic>TbCFAP43</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (<italic>n</italic>â=â150) showed axonemal defects. We could not exclude some minor modifications in PFR; however, the disruption of the axoneme was so extreme after TbCFA44 or TbCFA43 RNAi knockdown that it was difficult to assess them. Altogether, these results confirm the essential role of TbCFAP43 and TbCFAP44 in the organization of the axoneme ultrastructure.</p>

      <p id="Par22">Our work illustrates the efficiency of the combination of WES with an original workflow for the validation of the candidate genes. We identified two new genes responsible for MMAF syndrome and several new <italic>DNAH1</italic> mutations, reinforcing the importance of this gene in MMAF syndrome. The prevalence of <italic>DNAH1</italic> mutations was lower than what was reported previously, maybe due to a wider geographic recruitment of patients in the current study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Altogether, <italic>DNAH1</italic>, <italic>CFAP43</italic>, and <italic>CFAP44</italic> mutations were identified in 28.2% of the analyzed subjects (<italic>n</italic>â=â78) originating from North Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. These results underline the importance of these three genes in MMAF syndrome and will permit to improve the diagnosis efficiency of infertile MMAF patients. To investigate the possibility of a potential genotypeâphenotype correlation, we examined the semen parameters of patients carrying mutations in <italic>DNAH1</italic>, <italic>CFAP43</italic>, and <italic>CFAP44</italic> and MMAF patients with yet unidentified mutations. There were not differences between the first three groups except for a higher rate of spermatozoa with short and absent flagella and a lower motility rate evidenced in the mutated subjects compared to patients with no identified mutation, highlighting the severity of mutations in these three genes. The identified mutations are distributed throughout the whole CFAP43 and 44 genes indicating that the entirety of both proteins is necessary for preserving their functionality. Interestingly among <italic>CFAP43</italic>-mutated patients, only one (P43-9) carried a missense variant, with potentially a milder effect (Val347Ala). This patient has the lowest percentage of sperm with short flagella (22%) with 10% of morphologically normal spermatozoa (versus 0% for the other <italic>CFAP43</italic>-mutated subjects) and therefore presents a milder phenotype compared to the others with homozygous truncating mutations. These data support the existence of a genotypeâphenotype correlation as had been demonstrated for <italic>DNAH1</italic>-mutated subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. We have previously demonstrated that MMAF patients with <italic>DNAH1</italic> mutations had a good prognosis using ICSI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, but it remains difficult to predict the success rate for the other MMAF genotypes. Additional correlation studies should now be performed to take into account the individual genotypes in the counseling of MMAF patients. Exome sequencing of MMAF patients permitted a diagnosis efficiency of 27% for the three validated genes. Subsequent analysis of exome data from the remaining 56 subjects permitted to identify 7 additional candidate genes with bi-allelic mutations found in at least two individuals in a total of 23 subjects. The identified mutations and these additional genes are currently being investigated. If all these variants are confirmed to be deleterious, a diagnosis will be obtained for 45/78 patients (58%), confirming the interest of WES as a diagnostic tool for MMAF syndrome.</p>
      <p id="Par23">Identification of disease-causing genes has recently been catalyzed by high-throughput genome-wide sequencing technologies. New challenges are now arising, in particular, the validation of candidate genes in the investigated phenotypes. CRISPR/Cas9 is a very efficient and fast technique to create KO models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, compatible with the increased number of mutations/genes found by high-throughput sequencing. To confirm the pathogenicity of the identified mutations, we produced two knockout mice lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. <italic>Cfap43</italic><sup>â/â</sup> males were infertile and 100% of their spermatozoa were immotile and morphologically abnormal with short and coiled tail, a phenotype very similar to human MMAF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup>â/â</sup> male mice were also infertile due to flagellar immotility, yet presenting subtler flagellar defects than those observed in patients with <italic>CFAP44</italic> mutations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Such a phenotypic discrepancy between mouse and human is not uncommon. For example, <italic>Dnah1</italic> KO mice display asthenozoospermia without morphological defects of the flagellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, whereas in humans <italic>DNAH1</italic> truncating mutations induce a MMAF phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, TEM analysis of <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup>â/â</sup> sperm evidenced ultrastructural defects similar to those found in <italic>CFAP44</italic> patients, confirming that CFAP44 is necessary for axonemal organization and function both in mouse and human. The reason why this axonemal disorganization does not impact the overall flagellum morphology and length in mice is not known. It is however highly unlikely that a functional truncated protein could persist and have a rescue effect in KO mice since they are predicted at best to produce a truncated peptide of 49 out of the 1,854 amino acids of the full-length protein (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Overall, the tandem use of WES and CRISPR/Cas9 technology in mouse was a very efficient strategy to identify and validate the mutations responsible for infertility phenotypes.</p>
      <p id="Par24">The structure and organization of motile cilia or flagellum was mainly deciphered from models including the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, the protozoa <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, sea urchins, zebrafish, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Such a wide selection of distant models is possible because motile cilia or flagella are built on a canonical 9+2 axoneme which forms a highly organized protein network remarkably conserved during evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Here we chose to use <italic>T. brucei</italic> as this model has two advantages, first, in contrast to <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and other models, it shares some specific structural axonemal characteristics with mammalian flagellum such as a full RS3 and a fixed orientation of the central pair during flagellum beating, and second, it allows forward and reverse genetics for an easier characterization of gene function. BlastP enabled us to identify CFAP43 and CFAP44 likely orthologs in <italic>T. brucei</italic> with good sequence identity. Interestingly, in-depth structural analyses showed that these proteins share some unique structural similarity, in particular, a common general motif with Î²-strand domains in the N-terminal region followed by Î±-helical domains in the C-terminal region. These results confirm the relatedness of the identified orthologs and suggest that CFAP43 and CFAP44 proteins may have a similar function as reported for others proteins with similar structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, we showed that in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, inactivation of one protein by RNAi did not alter the amount and localization of the other protein, indicating that (i) the phenotype observed when invalidating each protein is independent of the other protein, (ii) the presence of one cannot compensate for the absence of the other, and (iii) if the two proteins interact with one another, they do not depend on each other for adequate positioning and docking.</p>
      <p id="Par25">In all studied models (i.e. humans, mouse, and <italic>T. brucei</italic>), the invalidation of each protein induced important axonemal disorganization. It is important to underline that the destabilization of the axoneme can be triggered by the absence of proteins located either in axonemal or peri-axonemal structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, making it difficult to assess the function from the observed defects. Only the localization at the ultrastructural level wouldprovideÂ  a clue on protein function. For this purpose, we generated several <italic>T. brucei</italic> cell lines expressing endogenously tagged proteins, and studied their localization by STED and immuno-EM. Using two different tags, we showed that both proteins have a restricted location within the flagellum, closely associated with the part of the axoneme facing the PFR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and most probablyÂ corresponding to DMTs 5 and 6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This localization rules out a potential role of both proteins in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) since IFT in <italic>T. brucei</italic> flagella was never described between the PFR and the axoneme and is circumscribed to two sets of doublet microtubules 3â4 and 7â8, located on each side of the PFR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Moreover, the absence of cytoplasmic material accumulated at the basis of the flagellum and in the flagellar pocket and the normal length of the flagellum in both RNAi mutants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) do not support the IFT hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par26">Interestingly, it has been reported that two specific structures are present around DMTs 5 and 6: the first one is proposed to consolidate the interaction between the axoneme and the para-axonemal components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> and the second one to specifically strengthen DMTs 5â6 interaction, known as the 5â6 bridge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, made of inner and outer subunits. Both structures, the 5â6 bridge and the connecting proteins linking the axoneme to the PFR, are known to present an intervallic pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. This subcellular distribution is in agreement with our super-resolution and immuno-EM results which showed a minimum interval between two immunogold particles of around 25ânm for both TbCFAP44 and TbCFAP43, a distance similar to the interval between two outer 5â6 bridge subunits observed in the flagellum of sea urchin sperm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. All these connecting structures, located in the same area, could share physical interactions and the absence of one of the CFAP proteins could destabilize the whole complex, leading to both para-axonemal and axonemal defects. This echoes the anomalies evidenced in IF and TEM experiments in both mouse models and in man. This was particularly noticeable in <italic>Cfap44</italic><sup><italic>â/â</italic></sup> sperm, where DMTs 5â6 were preferentially missing and para-axonemal structures such as dense fibers and FSs were defective (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that TbCFAP44 and TbCFAP43 may be the first two proteins specifically located next to DMTs 5â6, and therefore opening the way for a fine characterization of the protein complexes located in this area.</p>
      <p id="Par27">Apart from infertility, the studied patients did not present any obvious PCD-associated symptoms, such as cough, rhinitis, sinusitis, and rhinorrhea and chronic bronchitis. It is not very surprising because flagellar and cilia defects are not always associated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. We already have shown that it is also true for <italic>DNAH1</italic>-mutated patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that mutations in MMAF genes are only responsible for primary infertility without other PCD features and reinforce the presumption that the sperm flagellum is assembled and organized through a specific way, different from other cilia. These differences are notably illustrated by a different beating pattern and the presence of specific peri-axonemal structures, mainly the FS and the ODFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Importantly, we demonstrated here that in the trypanosome, CFAP43 and CFAP44 are associated to a subset of microtubule doublets facing the PFR. The PFR does not exist in mammalian sperm but its function is likely covered by the FS and the ODF. The fact that the absence of CFAP43/44 has no visible impact on motile cilia could therefore be explained by the functionalÂ specificity of the proteins: to interact/link the axoneme with flagella specific extra-axonemal structures, not present in motile cilia in respiratory tissues, brain, or in the oviduct. Further work should now be performed to elucidate the differential composition and organization of motile cilia and flagella. Last, analysis of KO heterozygous mice showed a small deterioration of sperm motility and morphology, suggesting that heterozygous mutations in key spermatogenesis genes might, alone or more likely through cumulative genetic and/or environmental factors, contribute to the less severe but much more frequent phenotype of mild to intermediate oligoasthenozoospermia.</p>

        <p id="Par42">All animal procedures were run according to the Swiss and French guidelines on the use of animals in scientific investigations with the approval of the French local Ethical Committee (ComEth Grenoble No. 318, ministry agreement number #7128 UHTA-U1209-CA) and the Direction GÃ©nÃ©rale de la SantÃ© (DGS) for the State of Geneva. All the procedures were done in Geneva until the birth of the modified litters. For each gene, three plasmids were injected directly into the nucleus of the zygotes. One plasmid expressed the Cas9 protein and the other two expressed two distinct RNA guides (single guide RNA, or sgRNA) targeting exons 2 and 21 of the <italic>Cfap43</italic> gene and exons 3 and 15 of the <italic>Cfap44</italic> gene. All plasmids (pGS-U6-sgRNA expression vector) were ordered from GeneScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA) with the different cDNA sequences already inserted. sgRNA sequences are indicated in the Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>. The Cas9 nuclease and sgRNAs were introduced into fertilized oocytes. Microinjected oocytes were introduced into pseudopregnant host females and carried to term. Edited founders were identified by Sanger sequencing from tail biopsies. Tail biopsies (2âmm in length) were digested in 200âÎ¼l lysis Direct PCR Lysis Reagent (Tail) (Viagen Biotech Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA) and 0.2âmg of proteinase K for 12â15âh at 55âÂ°C and 1âh at 85âÂ°C. The DNA was directly used for PCRs. The two targeted exons were amplified using the following PCR protocol: 59âÂ°Câxâ1 cycle, 58âÂ°Câxâ1 cycle, and 57âÂ°Câxâ35 cycles with 1âmin elongation. Sanger sequencing was then performed to identify CRISP/Cas9-induced mutations and genotypes were determined according to the sequence electrophoregrams. Mice carrying desired modification events are bred with C57BL6/J to ensure germline transmission and eliminate any possible mosaicism. From the second generation of mice, genotyping was performed by high-resolution melting (HRM) using MeltDoctorâ¢ HRM Master Mix with the following parameters: 10âmin at 95âÂ°C for enzyme activation, 15âs at 95âÂ°C for denaturation, 1âmin at 60âÂ°C for annealing and extension, then for the melting curve, 1âmin at 95âÂ°C for denaturation, 1âmin at 60âÂ°C for annealing, 15âs at 95âÂ°C for HRM and 15âs at 60âÂ°C for annealing.

Mice were housed with unlimited access to food and water and were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after 8 weeks old, which means that they were pubescent and that their reproductive organs were fully established.</p>
        <p id="Par44">The edited gene expression in mutant mice was validated by RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing of testicular transcripts. RT-PCR experiments were performed using testis RNA from WT, heterozygous, and homozygous animals. Reverse transcription was carried out with 5âÂµl of extracted RNA (â¼500âng) using Macherey Nagel columns (Macherey Nagel, Hoerdt, France) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Hybridization of the oligo(dT) was performed by incubating for 5âmin at 65âÂ°C and quenching on ice with the following mix: 5âÂµl RNA, 3âÂµl of poly T oligo primers (dT) 12â18 (10âmM, Pharmacia), 3âÂµl of the four dNTPs (0.5âmM, Roche Diagnostics), and 2.2âÂµl of H<sub>2</sub>O.
