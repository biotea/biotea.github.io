      <abstract>
        <p id="P4">At steady state, most Rho GTPases are bound in the cytosol to Rho Guanine nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors (RhoGDI) <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. RhoGDIs have generally been considered to passively hold Rho proteins in an inactive state within the cytoplasm. Here we describe an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which RhoGDI1 controls the homeostasis of Rho proteins in eukaryotic cells. We found that depletion of RhoGDI1 promotes misfolding and degradation of the cytosolic geranylgeranylated pool of Rho GTPases while unexpectedly activating the remaining membrane-bound fraction. Since RhoGDI1 levels are limiting, and Rho proteins compete for binding to RhoGDI1, overexpression of an exogenous Rho GTPase displaces endogenous Rho proteins bound to RhoGDI1, inducing their degradation and inactivation. These results raise important questions about the conclusions drawn from studies that manipulate Rho protein levels. In many cases the response observed may arise not simply from the overexpression <italic>per se</italic>, but from additional effects on the levels and activity of other Rho GTPases due to competition for binding to RhoGDI1, and may require a re-evaluation of previously published studies that rely exclusively on these techniques.</p>

    <p id="P5">The RhoGDI family has been generally relegated to a secondary role in the regulation of Rho GTPases<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. To explore the function of RhoGDI1, we analyzed the effect of depleting RhoGDI1 in mammalian cells. Upon RhoGDI1 depletion by siRNA, the protein levels of the major Rho GTPases, including RhoA, RhoC, Rac1 and Cdc42 were dramatically decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>). This occurred for multiple cell types, including HeLa, fibroblasts, breast epithelial, melanoma and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.S1aâd</xref>). RhoB, which does not bind RhoGDI1, was unaffected by RhoGDI1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig.S2a,b</xref>). The mRNA levels of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 remained constant suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms account for the decrease in Rho proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>). Indeed, proteasomal inhibitors such as LLnL, but not calpain or cathepsin inhibitors, partially rescued Rho proteins from degradation suggesting without RhoGDI1, the GTPases are being cleared by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref> and data not shown). Rescue from degradation was achieved by expressing a siRNA-resistant RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S2d</xref>). A second independent RhoGDI1 siRNA generated similar effects (data not shown). Interaction between the Rho-GTPases and RhoGDI is essential to prevent GTPase degradation since siRNA-resistant mutants that cannot bind Rho GTPases<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> failed to rescue the effects of RhoGDI1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1d</xref>). Overexpression of wildtype RhoGDI1 but not the GTPase binding-deficient mutant increased the total level of RhoA and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1e</xref>). These results indicate that RhoGDI1 stabilizes Rho proteins, protecting them from degradation.</p>
    <p id="P6">Even though RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 levels were drastically reduced after RhoGDI1 depletion, the amount of active Rho proteins was either significantly increased (Rac1 and Cdc42) or unchanged (RhoA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1f</xref>), which indicates that a much larger fraction of the remaining pool of GTPase is in the active GTP-bound state. While the activity increases by up to 2 fold, the ratio between active and total GTPase increases by up to 10 fold due to the decrease in GTPase protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1g</xref>). At steady state, the active GTPase represented 1% of total RhoA while in the absence of RhoGDI1, it peaked at 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1f and g</xref>). After RhoGDI1 depletion most RhoA is in the membrane fraction, suggesting that most of the degraded protein derives from the cytosolic pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1h</xref>) and that the active fraction is associated with membranes. In contrast when an individual GTPase is silenced, both the protein levels and the activity are proportionally reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1i</xref>). These results highlight the importance of GDI proteins in regulating both the protein level and activation state of Rho GTPases. RhoGDI depletion in other cell types (WM2664 and HUVECs) caused similar decreases in Rho protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1aâd</xref>), while the activity of the remaining fraction was either elevated or unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1d</xref>). Studying HUVECs, Gorovoy et al. also found that RhoGDI knockdown promoted RhoA activation, although Rho protein expression was not decreased as much as observed here, probably because the knockdown was only allowed to proceed for 30 hours<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. More complete RhoGDI1 knockdown and Rho GTPase degradation is achieved at longer time intervals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1e</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">To determine whether this aspect of RhoGDI function is evolutionarily conserved, we analyzed the effect of deleting the single RhoGDI gene in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (RDI1). Strikingly, the loss of Rdi1 protein also resulted in degradation of Cdc42 and Rho1 (RhoA ortholog) while maintaining high levels of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1j</xref>). When analyzed by immunofluorescence, both Cdc42 and Rho1 had an increase in protein polarized in the bud, which has previously been correlated with localization of the activated forms of these proteins<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1k and l</xref>). The increase in polarized bud staining is striking given the overall reduction in Rho1 and Cdc42 protein levels in <italic>rdi1</italic>Î strains.</p>
    <p id="P8">RhoGDI1 knockout mice are viable but display progressive kidney defects leading ultimately to death<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Interestingly, those defects have been attributed to increased Rac1 activation and the kidneys display reduced levels of Rho GTPases<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Renal mesangial cells from RhoGDI knockout mice display altered growth and survival<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. However, RhoGDI1 null mouse fibroblasts showed no defects in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton upon stimulation with growth factors, or in cell migration measured in a wound healing assay<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Yeast cells lacking <italic>rdi1</italic>, have a very minor phenotype<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Surprised by the relatively mild phenotype in spite of the marked change in Rho protein levels and activity, we have explored this further. Consistent with previous work, the rate of wound closure was unaffected when RhoGDI1 was knocked down in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>). However, the migration velocity of highly motile melanoma cells was significantly decreased upon RhoGDI knockdown, both in a wound healing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref>) and when single cell migration was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2c, f, g</xref> and Supplementary information movie 1). This decrease in migration speed was unanticipated, given that Rac1 activity was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>). However, RhoA activity also increased proportionally and may counteract the effects of high Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">Although RhoGDI1 knockdown affected cell migration, we were surprised by the unexpectedly mild phenotype given the striking level of Rho protein activation following RhoGDI1 depletion. Examining whether RhoGDI2 might compensate for the loss of RhoGDI1 we found that, in cells expressing RhoGDI2 (HeLa and HUVEC), RhoGDI2 levels did not vary after RhoGDI1 KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.S1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3c</xref>). In WM2664 and gingival fibroblasts the expression of RhoGDI2 was undetectable and unaffected by RhoGDI1 silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig.S3c</xref>). In HeLa cells, silencing GDI-1 and GDI-2 showed no effect on wound closure speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>), suggesting the lack of phenotype is not due to a GDI-2 compensation effect.</p>
    <p id="P10">We hypothesized that upon RhoGDI1 depletion, Rho proteins may fail to properly localize to the plasma membrane (PM) and may remain in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), where the final steps in Rho GTPase maturation occur on the cytoplasmic face of the ER. Here they are postranslationally processed after being prenylated in the cytosol <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Subcellular fractionation experiments showed that, in control cells RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 display a biphasic distribution occurring in both the PM and ER fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2h,i</xref>). However, following RhoGDI1 depletion the amount of Rho GTPases found associated with the PM was greatly reduced with the majority of the remaining GTPases cofractionating with the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2h,i</xref>). These results reveal that, without RhoGDI1, Rho proteins that are not degraded are not properly delivered to the PM. Instead, they accumulate at the ER suggesting that one function of RhoGDI1 is to shuttle Rho GTPases from the ER to their site of action at the PM. Supporting these results, we did not detect an increase in effector activation following GDI-1 KD, despite the high levels of active GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2e</xref>). These results may explain the mild phenotype resulting from RhoGDI1 depletion in spite of high Rho protein activity.</p>
    <p id="P11">Rho proteins undergo ubiquitylation and degradation by the proteasome upon irreversible activation by the bacterial toxin CNF1<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Since RhoGDI1 knockdown promoted a substantial activation of Rho proteins, we explored if degradation occured similarly, following activation. To inhibit activation of RhoA we either overexpressed the RhoA-specific GAP, p190-RhoGAP, or incubated cells with C3-transferase, which inactivates RhoA, and then monitored its degradation following GDI1 silencing. Both treatments reduced RhoA activity to negligible amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a,b</xref>). However, degradation of RhoA after GDI1 depletion still occurred, indicating that this is independent of RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a,b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">Our results suggest that binding to RhoGDI1 stabilizes and protects Rho GTPases from degradation, and that a GTPase that is not bound to a GDI protein or associated with the membrane is rapidly degraded. Most Rho proteins (RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42) are posttranslationally modified at the C-terminus with a geranylgeranyl group<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. General prenylation inhibitors from the statin family, such as lovastatin, or geranylgeranyl transferase specific inhibitors like GGTI2417 rescued the degradation of GTPases in the absence of GDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3c</xref>, and data not shown). Similarly, cleavage of the geranylgeranylated C-terminal tail using the bacterial protease YopT<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>also restored RhoA levels, indicating that newly synthesized Rho proteins are prenylated and fully mature before being degraded and that removing the prenylation is sufficient to stabilize Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3d</xref>). GGTI2417 treatment restores the cytosolic pool of RhoA in the absence of RhoGDI1, suggesting that a Rho GTPase can only exist in the cytosol if it is either bound to RhoGDI1 or not prenylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P13">We speculated that, without the RhoGDI1 to protect the prenyl group, this exposed hydrophobic modification might disturb the correct folding of Rho proteins, targeting them to degradation. In cells, proper protein folding is ensured by molecular chaperones<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Proteins that cannot fold properly usually cluster in insoluble aggregates that are targeted for degradation<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. We found that under physiological conditions, RhoA associates with the molecular chaperone Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3e</xref>). In the absence of RhoGDI1, the levels of Hsp70 increased in the cells indicative of a cellular stress but virtually no Hsp70 was bound to RhoA, suggesting that the remaining membrane-bound RhoA is properly folded and stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3e</xref>). Indeed, Hsp70 bound mostly to cytosolic RhoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3f</xref>). When we inhibited the proteasome in RhoGDI1-depleted cells, RhoA and Rac1 accumulated in a triton-insoluble fraction (data not shown). The amount of Hsp70 bound to cytosolic RhoA also increased, suggesting that the pool of free prenylated RhoA was misfolded or partially unfolded and recruited the protein quality control machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3f</xref>). These results suggest that prenylation contributes to the misfolding or unfolding of Rho proteins, resulting in their degradation if RhoGDI1 cannot accommodate the lipid moiety and if the molecular chaperones cannot fold them properly. Interestingly, although RhoA co-precipitates with both Hsp70 and RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3e</xref>), immunoprecipitation of RhoGDI1 indicates that there are two mutually exclusive pools of RhoA associated with either Hsp70 or RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>). Finally, inhibiting molecular chaperones with geldanamycin decreased RhoA levels in the presence or absence of RhoGDI1, arguing that molecular chaperones are required to help stabilize prenylated RhoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3g</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P14">In mammalian cells, the level of RhoGDI1 is roughly equivalent to the total levels of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 combined<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Therefore, a competitive balance exists between Rho proteins for binding to RhoGDI1 and any condition that alters the level of one GTPase should disrupt this balance and affect Rho protein homeostasis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref> shows that silencing RhoA results in decreased levels of RhoA and proportionally increased levels of Rac1 and Cdc42, indicating that reducing one GTPase generates free GDI that can be shared by the others. In contrast, overexpression of myc-tagged RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42 displaced endogenous RhoA from RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>). Overexpression of a myctagged Cdc42 mutant (R66E) incapable of binding RhoGDI did not affect the level of endogenous RhoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4c</xref>). The displacement of endogenous Rho proteins resulted in their degradation in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4d,g,j</xref>). Strikingly, expression of constitutively active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4e,h,k</xref>) or dominant negative Rho proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4f,i,l</xref>) also displaced endogenous Rho proteins from RhoGDI1 and caused their degradation. The degradation of RhoA by overexpression of Cdc42 could be prevented by co-expression of RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4m</xref>). Displacement of Rho proteins from RhoGDI1 by other Rho family members, including RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, resulted in their degradation and <italic>inactivation</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4n,o,p</xref>). This degradation and inactivation did not occur if the overexpressed Rho protein was a mutant (RhoAR68E, Rac1R66E or Cdc42R66E) unable to bind RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4n,o,p</xref>). The decrease in activity of Rho GTPases displaced from RhoGDI1 is similar to that observed when GTPases are silenced by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1i</xref>), and contrasts with the activation of Rho GTPases caused by RhoGDI1 depletion.</p>
    <p id="P15">One might expect that depletion of RhoGDI1 and competitive displacement of Rho GTPases from RhoGDI1 would have the same effect on Rho protein activity, given that both result in degradation of Rho GTPases. However, in the case of overexpression of an exogenous Rho GTPase, RhoGDI1 is still present and over time will extract and inactivate the remaining endogenous GTPases from the membranes. Competitive displacement of endogenous Rho proteins from RhoGDI1 by overexpressed Rho GTPases will release the endogenous Rho proteins into the cytosol, followed by their degradation without the opportunity for activation. In contrast, during RhoGDI1 depletion, Rho proteins associated with membranes cannot be actively extracted by RhoGDI. These membrane-bound Rho GTPases are likely to become activated by membrane-bound GEFs. Since, RhoGDI1 can inhibit both the activation of the Rho GTPases, as well as GTP hydrolysis<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, depletion of RhoGDI1 should relieve this inhibition, thereby promoting activation of the GTPases. In contrast, displacement of Rho proteins from GDI does not alter the cellular content of RhoGDI1, maintaining this inhibitory mechanism on endogenous GTPases. Indeed, we show that after RhoGDI1 depletion, the remaining RhoA that is not targeted for degradation is not bound to GDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3e</xref>). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that depletion of RhoA by either direct silencing or by overexpressing an exogenous GTPase result in a decrease of both total and active RhoA, whereas RhoGDI silencing decreases RhoA levels but leaves RhoA activity high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4o,p</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P16">We have shown that RhoGDI1 regulates the stability of Rho GTPases within the cytosol, protecting them from degradation. Our results also reveal an unexpected crosstalk between Rho GTPases through competitive binding to RhoGDI1, illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. Rather little is known about changes in expression levels of RhoGDI1 or Rho GTPases during development and disease, although situations have been described in which the expression of a Rho family member occurs, such as the increase of RhoC in metastasis<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. In preliminary work, we have found that with different breast cancer cell lines the expression of RhoGDI1 correlates with their invasiveness, as well as with the level and activity of RhoA and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). However, in situations where the level of RhoGDI stays constant, our results predict that not only overexpressing one GTPase will displace the others from RhoGDI and target them for degradation but it will also affect their activity. One situation where extreme changes occur is in the experimental expression of wildtype or mutant Rho GTPases, which have been the standard tools to study Rho protein functions in different pathways. In many cases, the conclusions drawn from these studies may arise not only from the activity of the overexpressed Rho protein but also from the unanticipated effect of displacing other family members from RhoGDI leading to their degradation and inactivation.</p>

        <title>RhoGDI regulates Rho protein homeostasis</title>
        <p id="P38">Newly synthesized RhoGTPases are geranylgeranylated and posttranslationally modified in the ER. After geranylgeranylation, Rho proteins associate directly with RhoGDI which sequesters them as a soluble prenylated forming the cytosol and protects them from degradation. Upon depletion of RhoGDI1 or overexpression of Rho proteins, endogenous RhoGTPases are released to the cytosol where they exist as short-lived unstable intermediates that are partially folded or misfolded (red arrows). These can bind to the chaperone complex or be targeted for degradation if they are unable to fold properly. In the absence of GDI, newly synthesized Rho proteins cannot be delivered to the plasma membrane and accumulate in the ER. At steady state, this unstable intermediate is not detected and RhoGTPases are for the most part either associated with cell membranes or bound to GDI, with only a small fraction associated with the chaperone system.</p>
