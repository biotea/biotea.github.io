      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">We report the clinical description and molecular dissection of a new fatal human inherited disorder characterized by chronic auto-inflammation, invasive bacterial infections and muscular amylopectinosis. Patients from two kindreds carried biallelic loss-of-expression and loss-of-function mutations in <italic>HOIL1</italic>, a component the linear ubiquitination chain assembly complex (LUBAC). These mutations resulted in impairment of LUBAC stability. NF-ÎºB activation in response to interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) was compromised in the patientsâ fibroblasts. By contrast, the patientsâ mononuclear leukocytes, particularly monocytes, were hyperresponsive to IL-1Î². The consequences of human HOIL-1 and LUBAC deficiencies for IL-1Î² responses thus differed between cell types, consistent with the unique association of auto-inflammation and immunodeficiency in these patients. These data suggest that LUBAC regulates NF-ÎºB-dependent IL-1Î² responses differently in different cell types.</p>

The genetic dissection of several auto-inflammatory disorders has implicated two pro-inflammatory cytokines in these conditions: interleukin (IL)-1Î² and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Autosomal dominant TNF receptor-associated periodic fever (TRAPS) was the first genetic etiology of auto-inflammatory disorders to be identified. It is caused by mutations in <italic>TNFRSF1A</italic>, resulting in the enhanced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Inflammasomopathies include autosomal dominant cryopyrin-associated periodic fever (CAPS, also known as chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA)/neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), Muckle Wells syndrome (MWS), familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS)), caused by mutation of <italic>NLRP3</italic> (also known as <italic>CIAS1</italic>), autosomal recessive familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), caused by mutation of <italic>MEFV</italic>, autosomal recessive mevalonate kinase (MVK) deficiency, caused by mutation of <italic>MVK</italic>, autosomal recessive deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), caused by mutation of <italic>IL1RN,</italic> and autosomal dominant pyogenic arthritis pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome, caused by mutation of <italic>CD2BP1</italic>. The clinical phenotypes of these diseases result largely from enhanced IL-1Î² activity <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. All these auto-inflammatory disorders are associated with recurrent episodes of fever, skin rash and aseptic organ inflammation and may be complicated by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. 30% of TRAPS patients develop amyloidosis) <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Patients with these diseases are not generally prone to unusual infectious diseases.</p>
    <p id="P3">In sharp contrast, inborn errors decreasing TNF- and IL-1Î²-mediated immunity are associated with severe infectious diseases in the context of impaired inflammation. Inborn errors of NF-ÎºB-mediated immunity are associated with impaired cellular responses to various stimuli, including TNF and IL-1Î²; these diseases include X-linked recessive and autosomal dominant anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID), due to hypomorphic mutations of the NF-ÎºB essential modulator (<italic>NEMO</italic>) gene and hypermorphic mutations of the <italic>IKBA</italic> gene, respectively <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Defects restricted to the Toll-like receptor and IL-1R (TIRs) pathway, affecting the NF-ÎºB, IRF3 and MAPK signaling molecules, include autosomal recessive IRAK-4 and autosomal recessive MyD88 deficiencies <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Patients with these two deficiencies are prone to the development of life-threatening pyogenic bacterial diseases <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The range of infections is much broader in patients with NEMO and IÎºBÎ± deficiencies <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. A characteristic of these four inborn errors of immunity is that clinical and biological signs of inflammation are absent or delayed during infectious episodes, although they may reach normal levels during prolonged infection <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. For example, the induction of IL-6-dependent C-reactive protein (CRP) is impaired in these patients <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. We report here the description and investigation of three patients from two unrelated families displaying a paradoxical clinical phenotype combining auto-inflammatory syndrome and pyogenic bacterial diseases <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. These patients also developed muscular amylopectinosis, consisting of intracellular glycogen inclusions, complicated by myopathy and cardiomyopathy, which have never previously been associated with any inborn error of immunity. These patients carry loss-of-function mutations in <italic>HOIL1</italic> (<italic>RBCK1</italic>), a component of the linear ubiquitination chain assembly complex (LUBAC). This E3 ligase complex, which adds head-to-tail linear polyubiquitin chains to substrate proteins, has been implicated in NF-ÎºB signaling <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>

        <title><italic>HOIL1</italic> germline mutations in patients from two kindreds</title>
        <p id="P4">The first kindred investigated (kindred A, French) was not consanguineous, but we nonetheless hypothesized that the two sisters (P1 and P2) suffered from an autosomal recessive disorder (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, case reports in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary note</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We set out to decipher the underlying genetic defect by two genome-wide (GW) approaches: use of a GW human high-density SNP array (genome-wide investigations; GWI) to search for large genetic lesions, including, copy number variations (CNV) in particular; and a whole-exome sequencing (WES) approach to search for small genetic lesions, including coding gene variations in particular <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. No homozygous candidate lesion was identified by either approach, suggesting that the two patients might be compound heterozygous. We therefore searched for heterozygous lesions in the same gene by GWI and WES. In both patients, we found a single-copy loss of 31.799 kb on chromosome 20p.13, encompassing the three last exons of <italic>TRIB3</italic> and the first four exons of <italic>HOIL1</italic> (also known as <italic>RBCK1</italic>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This deletion resulted from a genomic rearrangement due to non allelic homologous recombination between intron 1 of <italic>TRIB3</italic> and intron 4 of <italic>HOIL1</italic> (named <italic>TRIB3</italic>:g.-1272_<italic>HOIL1</italic>:g.9780del) (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The lesion was inherited from the mother and was not transmitted to the healthy siblings. No other mutation in <italic>TRIB3</italic> was identified by WES or Sanger sequencing. By contrast, WES and Sanger sequencing both showed that the two patients were heterozygous for the paternally derived nonsense p.Q185X (c.553C&gt;T) mutation in exon 5 of <italic>HOIL1</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P5">The second kindred investigated (kindred B, Italian) is consanguineous. The search for large genetic lesions by GWI was not informative (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, case report in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary note</xref>). By contrast, a homozygous deletion of CT at positions 121 and 122 (c.121_122delCT) in exon 2 of <italic>HOIL1</italic> was identified in P3 by WES and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This deletion resulted in a frameshift (fs) and a premature stop codon (p.L41fsX7) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). GW linkage (GWL) and homozygosity mapping showed that the <italic>HOIL1</italic> gene was located in a chromosomal region linked to the disease (data not shown). Both parents and one healthy sibling were heterozygous for the mutation. The three <italic>HOIL1</italic> variants found in the two kindreds were not found in public databases (NCBI, UCSC, 1000 genomes) or in our own GWI and WES databases of 124 and 621 individuals, respectively. They were also absent from the 392 individuals of the CEPH-HGD panel tested, suggesting that they are not irrelevant polymorphisms. <italic>HOIL1</italic> encodes hemoxidized iron-regulatory protein 2 ubiquitin ligase-1 (HOIL-1). HOIL-1 is one of the components of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), an E3 ligase complex that adds head-to-tail linear polyubiquitin chains to substrate proteins <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The large deletion in HOIL-1 in P1 and P2 was predicted, at the very least, to result in the deletion of the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain (assuming that translation is reinitiated; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). The small nucleotide deletion in the gene in P3 was predicted to result in the deletion of all functional domains of HOIL-1. The nonsense mutation in P1 and P2 was predicted to result in premature truncation within the novel zinc finger (NZF) domain of HOIL-1. The Ubl domain is required for LUBAC formation and linear ubiquitination <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Collectively, these genetic data suggest that P1 and P2 from kindred A are compound heterozygous, and P3 from kindred B is homozygous, for rare deleterious alleles of <italic>HOIL1</italic>.</p>

        <title>Impaired HOIL-1 expression in the patientsâ cells</title>
        <p id="P6">We assayed <italic>TRIB3</italic> and <italic>HOIL1</italic> mRNA by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in SV40-transformed fibroblasts from patients and controls. The amounts of <italic>TRIB3</italic> mRNA were normal in the patientsâ cells (data not shown), whereas the amounts of <italic>HOIL1</italic> mRNA were one third to a quarter those in the controls (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Similarly, TRIB3 protein was present in the patientsâ cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), whereas HOIL-1 was undetectable by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against the N-terminal (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) or C-terminal part of the protein (data not shown). HOIL-1 was also not detectable in EBV-transformed B cell lines (EBV-B cells) derived from P2 (data not shown). LUBAC is thought to consist of three protein subunits: HOIL-1, SHANK-associated RH domain-interacting protein (SHARPIN,), and HOIL-1 interaction protein (HOIP, also known as RNF31) <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We thus assessed the abundance of these three components of LUBAC in fibroblasts. In cells from the three patients, SHARPIN protein levels were about 50 % lower than those in control cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) and HOIP was almost undetectable (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). It was therefore not possible to co-immunoprecipitate SHARPIN with HOIP in cells from P1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). No lesion in <italic>HOIP</italic> or <italic>SHARPIN</italic> was detected by GWI and WES in the three patients. We then used the patientsâ fibroblasts (P1, P2) to investigate whether the expression of a wild-type (wt) <italic>HOIL1</italic> allele rescued LUBAC expression: HOIL-1 production was restored in the patientsâ cells by stable transfection with wt <italic>HOIL1</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). This re-expression of HOIL-1 also restored expression of the other two LUBAC components, HOIP and SHARPIN, to control levels (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). These findings formally demonstrate that HOIL-1 is required for the overall stability of LUBAC. Cells from the two compound heterozygous patients (P1 and P2) and from the patient homozygous (P3) for <italic>HOIL1</italic> mutations therefore displayed HOIL-1 deficiency, resulting in a large decrease in the levels of the other two molecules normally present in LUBAC.</p>

        <title>Impaired NF-ÎºB activation in the patientsâ fibroblasts and B cells</title>
        <p id="P7">It has been suggested that, at least on some cell types, LUBAC regulates activation of the canonical NF-ÎºB pathway, which plays a key role in inflammatory and immune responses. We therefore assessed the functionality of the canonical NF-ÎºB pathway in SV40-transformed fibroblasts from the patients. The lack of HOIL-1 in the patientsâ cells led to lower levels of IKK kinase phosphorylation, slower IÎºBÎ± degradation and a decrease in NEMO ubiquitination in response to stimulation with either TNF or IL-1Î² (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). By contrast, JNK phosphorylation in response to both stimuli was normal in the patientsâ fibroblasts (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). The lower levels of NF-ÎºB activation in the patientsâ cells were associated with lower NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity, as assessed by NF-ÎºB-reporter assays (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). This impairment of the canonical NF-ÎºB pathway led to weak induction of the NF-ÎºB target genes <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>A20</italic>, which are normally induced by TNF or IL-1Î² (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Consistent with these RT-qPCR data, IL-6 production, as assessed by ELISA, in response to TNF or IL-1Î² treatment was weak in cells from the patients (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>), and the response to IL-1Î² was more severely impaired than that to TNF. The induction of the NF-ÎºB target gene products cIAPs (cellular inhibitors of apoptosis) was weaker in cells from P2 than controls, and higher levels of caspase-3 cleavage were observed in response to stimulation with TNF (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). These observations indicated that <italic>HOIL1</italic>-deficient cells were more susceptible than controls to TNF-induced apoptosis. The re-introduction of wt HOIL-1 into P1 fibroblasts restored IKK kinase phosphorylation, IÎºBÎ± degradation and IL-6 secretion in response to both TNF and IL-1Î² (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-f</xref>). This confirmed that the <italic>HOIL1</italic> mutant alleles in the patientsâ fibroblasts were responsible for the impairment of the NF-ÎºB response to both TNF and IL-1Î². Analysis of IL-6 production by the patientsâ fibroblasts following stimulation with TLR2, TLR6 or TLR4 agonists indicated that these TLR pathways were also partially affected (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). IFN-Î² production following stimulation with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) was abolished in fibroblasts from the patients, whereas stimulation of the RNA helicase RIG-I with 7SK-AS or poly(I:C) plus Lipofectamine was normal (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>). Likewise, stimulation with R-848 (a TLR7 and a TLR8 agonist) completely failed to induce TNF production by the patientsâ EBV-B cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Finally, IKK phosphorylation and IÎºBÎ± degradation in response to both IL-1Î² and CD40L were abolished in EBV-B cell lines from P2 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b,c</xref>). Overall, NF-ÎºB responses to all tested agonists of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), IL-1R and TLR family members were impaired in fibroblasts and EBV-B cells from patients with HOIL-1 deficiency.</p>

        <title>Impaired NEMO recruitment to cytokine receptors</title>
        <p id="P8">We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the defects in NF-ÎºB activation in HOIL-1-deficient fibroblasts. It has been suggested that LUBAC regulates NF-ÎºB activation by stabilizing the recruitment of the NEMO-IKK complex to the cytokine-activated receptor <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated the consequences of HOIL-1 deficiency for NEMO recruitment to the TNF- and IL-1-R signaling complexes (RSCs). In control cells, NEMO was rapidly and transiently recruited to the RSCs, and a clear enrichment in ubiquitinated NEMO species was observed (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). However, in cells from the HOIL-1-deficient patients, less NEMO was recruited to the TNF-RSC (particularly for the ubiquitinated NEMO species) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) and NEMO recruitment to the IL-1-RSC was almost entirely abolished (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). SHARPIN recruitment to the RSCs was also reduced, especially in response to IL-1Î² (data not shown). We then investigated the association between NEMO and the polyubiquitinated adapter RIP1 in response to TNF and between NEMO and the polyubiquitinated adapter IRAK-1 in response to IL-1Î². Less NEMO was associated with ubiquitinated forms of RIP1 in patient-derived than control fibroblasts, whereas the amount of polyubiquitinated RIP1 present in the TNF-RSC was normal (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Similarly, the interaction between NEMO and ubiquitinated IRAK-1 in response to IL-1Î² was strongly impaired in the patientsâ cells, although the ubiquitination of IRAK-1 was unaffected (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, the absence of HOIL-1 affects the recruitment or stability of NEMO-IKK complexes in response to both TNF and IL-1Î², with the most severe defect being observed for the IL-1-RSC.</p>

        <title>Genome-wide impact of HOIL-1 deficiency in fibroblasts</title>
        <p id="P9">These findings are generally consistent with the high incidence of opportunistic infections in the <italic>HOIL1</italic>-deficient patients, which was similar to that of patients with impaired IL-1R- and/or TNFR-dependent NF-ÎºB immunity <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. However, unlike patients with these other immunodeficiencies, HOIL-1-deficient patients also presented with auto-inflammation and amylopectinosis. We therefore investigated the effects of HOIL-1-deficiency on TNF and IL-1Î² responses, by analyzing the GW transcriptional profiles (47,231 probes) of primary fibroblasts from four healthy controls, three HOIL-1-deficient patients (P1, P2 and P3), one <italic>MyD88</italic>-deficient patient and one <italic>NEMO</italic>-deficient fetus. In control fibroblasts, 544 and 2,208 transcripts were regulated by IL-1Î² after 2 hours and 6 hours of stimulation, respectively, and 456 and 1,614 transcripts were regulated by TNF at the same time points (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). NEMO-deficient cells did not respond to either stimulus, whereas, as expected, MyD88-deficient cells responded to TNF but not to IL-1Î². By contrast, HOIL-1-deficient cells were poorly responsive to IL-1Î², as assessed after 2 h and 6 h; the response to TNF was almost identical to that of control cells after 2 h, but was weaker than that of control cells after 6 h. A more detailed analysis showed that control fibroblasts responded to IL-1Î² and TNF by the rapid induction of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors (e.g. the <italic>CCL5, CCL8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, CXCR7, IL1Î²,</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> (also known as <italic>A20</italic>) genes). The upregulation of these transcripts after 6 h of IL-1Î² stimulation was generally blunted in patients with HOIL-1 deficiency, although there were a few notable exceptions (e.g. <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>IL8</italic> and <italic>IL32</italic>). Thus, HOIL-1 deficiency in human fibroblast cells results in the impaired expression of NF-ÎºB-target genes in response to IL-1Î² and, to a lesser extent, TNF. The GW transcriptome analysis data for fibroblasts were therefore consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations described above and, in particular, with the receptor recruitment data (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>): HOIL-1 deficiency and NEMO deficiency shared many similarities, with only a few differences in terms of the fibroblast response to IL-1Î², whereas the responses to TNF were more discordant.</p>

        <title>Genome-wide impact of HOIL-1 deficiency in leukocytes</title>
        <p id="P10">We studied the basis of auto-inflammation in the patients further, by investigating their leukocytes <italic>ex vivo</italic>. We first investigated the consequences of HOIL-1-deficiency, by analyzing the GW transcriptional profiles of whole blood cells from P1 (without acute phase and free of infection) in the absence of stimulation. We compared the transcriptional profile of P1 with those of 41 healthy age-matched children and other patients with various genetically determined auto-inflammatory disorders, including CAPS disorders (CINCA (2 patients) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS, 5 patients)) and MVK deficiency (2 patients). Blood cells from P1 had a unique gene expression profile (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>), with 2,900 transcripts up- or downregulated by a factor of at least two with respect to healthy controls. Transcripts encoding HOIL-1, IFN-Î³ and several members of the TNF family including CD30L (also known as TNFSF8) and APRIL (also known as TNFSF13) were downregulated by a factor of at least two. Transcripts encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-6R and IL-6ST were upregulated in the patientâs blood <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). Genes belonging to networks involved in cell death, the cell cycle and cell signaling, the inflammatory response, immune cell trafficking and carbohydrate metabolism were identified as being dysregulated in the patient. Using a pre-established framework of transcriptionally coregulated transcripts, we demonstrated a distinct upregulation of erythroid lineage- and ubiquitination-related transcripts that differentiated the pattern of gene expression in the blood cells from this patient from those of patients with <italic>NLRP3</italic> and <italic>MVK</italic> mutations (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). We also retrospectively studied the concentrations of inflammatory markers and cytokines in plasma samples collected from P1 and P2 at various ages. Consistent with the clinical phenotype, background concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 were high, increasing further during each inflammatory episode (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). The concentrations of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-8, TNF and IL-1Î², and of some anti-inflammatory cytokines, notably the IL-1R antagonist, were also high (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref> and data not shown). We then used ELISA to study the production of cytokines by whole blood cells from P1 and P2 in response to stimulation (IL-1Î², TLR agonists, two heat-killed pneumococcus strains and TNF). IL-1Î² and agonists of TLR1 and TLR2 induced IL-6 production in both patients more strongly than in healthy controls, whereas IL-10 production in response to treatment with TNF was abolished (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c,d</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). Therefore, by contrast to the phenotype seen with fibroblasts, leukocytes from these two HOIL-1-deficient patients appeared to be both constitutively hyperinflammatory and hyperresponsive to IL-1Î² (but probably not TNF) <italic>ex vivo</italic>; this may explain, in part, the patientsâ auto-inflammatory syndrome <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>Hyperactivation of HOIL-1-deficient mononuclear leukocytes</title>
        <p id="P11">We further investigated the inflammatory phenotype observed in whole blood cells from HOIL-1-deficient patients. We analyzed the GW transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the three patients (P1, P2, P3), three healthy controls (including two age-matched controls (C2 and C3)) and two MyD88-deficient patients stimulated with TNF or IL-1Î². The transcriptional profiles of PBMCs from HOIL-1-deficient patients, healthy controls and MyD88-deficient patients were similar following TNF stimulation (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>-left panel). However, in response to IL-1Î², <italic>HOIL1</italic>-deficient PBMCs displayed an overinduction, with respect to healthy controls, of the transcription of 19 and 12 genes at 2 h and 6 h, respectively (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>-right panel). As expected, leukocytes from <italic>MyD88</italic>-deficient patients were unresponsive to IL-1Î². The genes hyperinduced by IL-1Î² in <italic>HOIL1</italic>-deficient cells included genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines: <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>MIP1A</italic>, <italic>MIP1B</italic>, <italic>IL8</italic> and <italic>IL1B</italic> (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). We then investigated which PBMC subsets were responsible for this hyperresponse to IL-1Î² in HOIL-1-deficient patients. PBMCs from P2, seven healthy controls and one IRAK-4-deficient patient were stimulated with TNF, IL-1Î², LPS or PMA+ionomycin+CpG-B. The various PBMC subsets were identified according to the cell surface expression of the following markers: CD3 (T cells), CD19 (B cells), CD56 (NK cells) and CD14 (monocytes). The production of IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1Î±, MIP-1Î², IL-1Î² and IFN-Î³ was assessed by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. In the CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD19<sup>+</sup> and CD56<sup>+</sup> cells from the controls, HOIL-1- and IRAK-4-deficient patients, no response to TNF or IL-1Î² stimulation was observed (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref> and data not shown). Upon stimulation with PMA+ionomycin+CpG-B, CD3<sup>+</sup> cells from P2 produced large amounts of IL-8 (11% CD3<sup>+</sup>IL-8<sup>+</sup> vs. 4% Â± 3.8% in controls) whereas IFN-Î³ was produced in smaller amounts (1% CD3<sup>+</sup>IFN-Î³<sup>+</sup> vs. 15%Â±7.3, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Monocytes from P2 produced four times more IL-6 than those from healthy controls upon IL-1Î² stimulation, whereas IRAK-4-deficient monocytes were unresponsive (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, upper panels and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). Monocytes from P2 also produced large amounts of MIP-1Î± (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, middle panels), but the levels of IL-8, IL-1Î² and MIP-1Î² production were similar to control values (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, lower panel and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>). Finally, healthy controls and P2 monocytes responded similarly to LPS in terms of IL-6, IL-1Î², and MIP-1Î± production (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, upper panel and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). In conclusion, the hyperresponse of whole blood and PBMCs from HOIL-1-deficient patients to IL-1Î² appears to be a consequence of the hyperresponsiveness of monocytes, probably accounting for the clinical auto-inflammation in these patients.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P12">We have identified autosomal recessive HOIL-1 deficiency as the cause of a new clinical entity combining invasive pyogenic bacterial infections, systemic auto-inflammation and amylopectin-like deposits in muscle. HOIL-1, SHARPIN and HOIP are the three components of LUBAC <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. SHARPIN and HOIP protein levels are low in the absence of HOIL-1 and their restoration following HOIL-1 re-expression suggests that LUBAC is a ternary complex. HOIP, the catalytic center of LUBAC <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, was almost undetectable in fibroblasts and B cells from HOIL-1-deficient patients, suggesting that these patients are LUBAC-deficient. LUBAC is involved in the NF-ÎºB pathway and conjugates linear polyubiquitin chains onto specific Lys residues of NEMO <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. HOIL-1-deficient human fibroblasts displayed impaired NF-ÎºB activation, resulting in impaired NF-ÎºB-driven gene transcription and cytokine production in response to TNF and IL-1Î², consistent with data in mouse <italic>Hoil1</italic> knockdown or knockout cells <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. However, TNF- and IL-1Î²-induced JNK activity was normal in <italic>HOIL1</italic>-deficient human fibroblasts, whereas TNF-induced JNK activity was enhanced in <italic>Hoil1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Overall, our results demonstrate that human HOIL-1 and LUBAC are required for TNF- and IL-1Î²-induced NF-ÎºB responses, at least in fibroblasts.</p>
      <p id="P13">LUBAC facilitates the recruitment of the NEMO-IKK complex to cytokine receptors, in at least some cell types <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. We showed that the recruitment of human NEMO to TNF- and IL-1-RSCs was compromised in HOIL-1-deficient fibroblasts. LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitination may facilitate the activation of IKK kinases; presumably, the attachment of linear ubiquitin chains to NEMO <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and, possibly, other components of the RSC <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> favors or stabilizes the incorporation of NEMO into the RSCs. The recognition of these linear ubiquitin chains by NEMO itself and, probably, by other components of the NF-ÎºB cascade may then lead to a local accumulation of IKK kinases, favoring their trans-phosphorylation and activation. Alternatively, NEMO ubiquitination may induce a conformational change required for activation of the associated kinases. However, the levels of NEMO ubiquitination in response to TNF or IL-1Î² in the patientsâ cells were only slightly lower than those in control cells, whereas the amount of ubiquitinated NEMO recruited to the TNFR or IL-1R correlated strongly with the signaling defect, as demonstrated by transcriptome analysis. Our findings also suggest that human LUBAC is required for optimal responses to other members of the TIR family, such as TLR3, and of the TNFR family, such as CD40.</p>
      <p id="P14">The susceptibility of these patients to invasive pyogenic bacterial disease is probably due to impaired NF-ÎºB-dependent responses to at least some key members of the TIR and TNFR families in fibroblasts and, possibly, other cell types. Indeed, patients with inborn errors of NF-ÎºB-mediated or TIR-mediated immunity, carrying IÎºBÎ±, NEMO, IRAK-4 or MyD88 mutations, are also prone to pyogenic bacterial infections <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The infectious phenotype of MyD88- and IRAK4-deficient patients is narrower than that of most patients with NEMO or IÎºBÎ± mutations <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. It may not be coincidental that IRAK-4-, MyD88- and HOIL-1-deficient patients share a profound lack of response to TIRs and predisposition to pyogenic bacterial diseases. One of the HOIL-1-deficient patients (P3) had a persistent cytomegalovirus infection, but it is unclear whether this was a consequence of HOIL-1 deficiency. Unlike most IRAK-4- and MyD88-deficient patients, patients bearing mutations in <italic>NEMO</italic> and <italic>HOIL1</italic> are deficient in memory B cells and their antibody response to pneumococcal glycans is impaired . Two patients died before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and the third died too soon after HSCT for any firm conclusions to be drawn about a possible hematopoietic origin of the predisposition to infection, as in patients with NEMO and IÎºBÎ± deficiencies <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Similarly, <italic>Hoil1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Sharpin</italic>-deficient (Sharpin<italic><sup>cpdm</sup></italic>) mice are uninformative on this issue, as neither has been challenged with pathogens <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P15">Bacterial infections in patients with mutations in IÎºBÎ±, NEMO, IRAK-4 or MyD88 are associated with impaired inflammation <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, at odds with HOIL-1-deficient patients, who even displayed inflammation in the absence of overt infection. The auto-inflammatory phenotype of our patients is consistent with that of their mononuclear leukocytes, monocytes in particular, which display constitutive over-transcription of numerous inflammatory genes and are hyperresponsive to IL-1Î²<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The hematopoietic origin of the auto-inflammation in HOIL-1-deficient patients is further supported by the fact that inflammation was controlled following HSCT in one HOIL-1-deficient patient. In the mouse, LUBAC seems to modulate inflammatory responses by regulating NF-ÎºB activation directly <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and <italic>Hoil1</italic>- deficient mice display no apparent excessive inflammation <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. However, Sharpin<italic><sup>cpdm</sup></italic> mice <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>- <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> display severe eosinophilic inflammation and defective lymphoid organogenesis <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, the inflammatory disease in Sharpin<italic><sup>cpdm</sup></italic> mice is partially rescued by inactivation of the <italic>IL1RAP</italic> gene<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, implicating IL-1Î². The inflammatory phenotype of HOIL-1-deficient patients therefore resembles that of Sharpin<italic><sup>cpdm</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, inactivation of the <italic>TNF</italic> gene improves skin lesions in Sharpin<italic><sup>cpdm</sup></italic> mice <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and anti-TNF antibody treatment in one HOIL-1-deficient patient reduced the clinical inflammation. This improvement might have resulted from a decrease in TNF-mediated IL-1Î² activity. Our study reveals that human HOIL-1 is anti-inflammatory: patients lacking HOIL-1 display a strong auto-inflammatory phenotype.</p>
      <p id="P16">Auto-inflammatory disorders may be complicated by metabolic disorders, with TRAPS patients often developing amyloidosis, for example <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The HOIL-1-deficient patients displayed no amyloidosis, but had amylopectinosis, in the form of intracellular glycogen inclusions in their muscles. Amylopectinosis has not been reported in <italic>Sharpin<sup>cpdm</sup></italic> and <italic>Hoil1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>mice <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Several genetic etiologies of human amylopectinosis have been reported <sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>â<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. HOIL-1 deficiency is a novel cause of amylopectinosis involving unknown mechanisms probably independent of IL-1, TNF and NF-ÎºB, as amylopectinosis is not seen in other disorders associated with enhanced or impaired NF-ÎºB immunity <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. In conclusion, the patients described here display a unique combination of clinical phenotypes, highlighting the important and complex role of LUBAC in inflammation, immunity and metabolism in humans. The paradoxical association of auto-inflammation and immunodeficiency probably results from an imbalance between cellular responses, to NF-ÎºB-dependent pro-inflammatory stimuli at least, mediated by TIRs and TNFRs in particular. The molecular basis of the immunodeficiency may be impaired responses to inflammatory stimuli in fibroblasts, and possibly other non-hematopoietic cell types, whereas the auto-inflammation may result from enhanced responses to IL-1Î² in leukocytes, including monocytes in particular.</p>

        <p>Primary fibroblasts from four healthy donors, P1, P2, P3, MyD88- and NEMO-deficient cells were stimulated with TNF or IL-1Î² for 2 and 6 hours. Stimulated samples were normalized with respect to the corresponding non stimulated reference sample. The heat maps represent hierarchically clustered transcripts displaying up- or downregulation by a factor of at least two in stimulated healthy control samples (averaged).</p>

Comparison of the transcriptional profile of P1 with those of 41 healthy age-matched children (not shown) and other patients with CAPS (2 CINCA, 5 MWS and 2 MVK patients). P1 presented a distinct pattern of gene expression in the blood, with 2,900 transcripts up- or downregulated by a factor of more than two with respect to healthy controls. Red, blue and yellow indicate a relative increase, decrease and no change in expression levels respectively. Samples are ordered by donor: HOIL-1-deficient patient (P1, lane 1), CINCA patients (lanes 2â3), MWS patients (lanes 4â8) and MVK-deficient patients (lanes 9â10). <bold>b)</bold> Quantification of various cytokines in plasma samples. The amounts of IL-1RA (an IL-1 antagonist), TNF, IL-6 and CRP were determined in plasma samples from healthy donors, P1 and P2 taken at various ages. Individuals with CRP concentrations above 3 mg/ml were considered to have an inflammatory condition. <bold>c)</bold> IL-6 secretion by whole-blood cells from 30 healthy donors and HOIL-1-deficient patients (P1, P2), treated with IL-1Î² for 48 hours.

PBMCs from P2, 7 healthy controls and 1 IRAK-4-deficient patient were stimulated with TNF, IL-1Î² or LPS. The secretory pathways were concomitantly blocked with monensin and brefeldin A. Twelve hours after stimulation, the cells were immunolabeled with antibodies against CD14 and then permeabilized to assess the production of IL-6, MIP-1Î± and IL-8. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. (<italic>n</italic>=1).</p>
