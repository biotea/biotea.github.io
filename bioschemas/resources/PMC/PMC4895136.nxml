      <abstract>
        <p>Following the migration of the axonal growth cone to its target area, the initial axo-dendritic contact needs to be transformed into a functional synapse. This multi-step process relies on overlapping but distinct combinations of molecules that confer synaptic identity. Slitrk molecules are transmembrane proteins that are highly expressed in the central nervous system. We found that two members of the Slitrk family, Slitrk1 and Slitrk2, can regulate synapse formation between hippocampal neurons. Slitrk1 is enriched in postsynaptic fractions and is localized to excitatory synapses. Overexpression of Slitrk1 and Slitrk2 in hippocampal neurons increased the number of synaptic contacts on these neurons. Furthermore, decreased expression of Slitrk1 in hippocampal neurons led to a reduction in the number of excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed in hippocampal neuron cultures. In addition, we demonstrate that different leucine rich repeat domains of the extracellular region of Slitrk1 are necessary to mediate interactions with Slitrk binding partners of the LAR receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase family, and to promote dimerization of Slitrk1. Altogether, our results demonstrate that Slitrk family proteins regulate synapse formation.</p>

    <p>One of the key steps in the development of the nervous system is the formation of new connections between different neurons. This process, referred to as synaptogenesis, also plays a critical role in the mature brain where the dynamic modification of circuitry has a profound effect on functions such as learning and memory. Multiple families of cell adhesion molecules have been implicated in various aspects of synapse formation, such as the formation of initial contacts and synapse maturation. Members of the neuroligin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, neurexin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, LRRTM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, SynCAM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, netrin G-ligand (NGL)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, SALM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and EphB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> families of cell surface proteins are examples of such molecules involved in these processes.</p>
    <p>It has been suggested that defects in neural connectivity or synaptic patterning underlie many neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. For example, familial forms of autism-spectrum disorders have been linked to mutations in neuroligin and neurexin (reviewed by Bourgeron<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) as well as in SynCAM and cadherin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Another family of transmembrane proteins that has been implicated in the etiology of brain disorders is the Slitrks. <italic>SLITRK1</italic> was proposed as a susceptibility gene for Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and for the OCD spectrum disorder trichotillomania<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, while variants of the <italic>SLITRK2</italic> gene have been found in patients with schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Mutations in Slitrk6 have been associated with myopia and deafness, and Slitrk family members may also associate with bipolar disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
    <p>The Slitrks form a family of six structurally similar proteins that contain two leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains in their extracellular portion and a cytoplasmic region that varies in size between members of the family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. LRR domains are protein-protein interaction regions commonly found in synaptogenic proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Despite some overlap in their expression, the Slitrks display mostly distinct patterns of expression in the developing murine nervous system suggesting they may play specific roles in different regions of the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In keeping with this possibility, gene ablation studies in mice for different Slitrk family members have yielded distinct phenotypes. While ablation of <italic>Slitrk1</italic> leads to increased anxiety-like behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, <italic>Slitrk5</italic> mutant mice display obsessive compulsive-like behaviors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, and <italic>Slitrk3</italic> mutant mice exhibit increased susceptibility to seizures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In contrast, <italic>Slitrk6</italic>-knockout mice display specific defects in development of the inner ear, including disorganized innervation and neuronal loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Based on the structure of Slitrks and the nature of phenotypes observed in some <italic>Slitrk</italic> mutant mice, Slitrks were proposed to regulate synapse formation in the central nervous system. Recent evidence has shown that Slitrk3 is specifically required for the formation of inhibitory synapses both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that other members of the Slitrk family can promote excitatory synapse formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p>
    <p>Here we have examined the function of two members of the Slitrk family, Slitrk1 and Slitrk2, in synapse formation. We show that Slitrk1 is preferentially localized to excitatory synapses. Overexpression of Slitrk1 or Slitrk2 can promote the formation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in cultures of hippocampal neurons. However, inhibition of Slitrk1 expression reduces the number of excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed between hippocampal neurons in culture. We also demonstrate that the first LRR domain of Slitrk1 mediates interactions with the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP-Î´, while the second LRR domain is necessary for dimerization of Slitrk1 at the cell surface. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Slitrk1 and Slitrk2 contribute to synapse formation and suggest that dimerization of Slitrk family members could be implicated in this process.</p>

        <title>Slitrk1 is preferentially localized at excitatory synapses</title>
        <p>The Slitrks are predominantly expressed in neural tissues at embryonic ages and postnatally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. More specifically, their localization at the synapse has been recently suggested based on the presence of tagged recombinant versions of these proteins at synaptic sites in cultured neurons. While Slitrk3 was localized to inhibitory synapses, other members of the Slitrk family appear localized to excitatory synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. To examine whether endogenous Slitrk1 is found at excitatory or inhibitory synapses, dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures were immunostained with an antibody against the Slitrk1 extracellular N-terminal region (Slitrk1-N) that does not recognize other Slitrk family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b,e</xref>). In confocal images of these neurons, Slitrk1 signal was detected in a punctate pattern on hippocampal processes with a majority of these puncta colocalizing with VGLUT1- and PSD-95-positive excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). A large proportion of VGLUT1- and PSD-95-positive clusters (57.23âÂ±â4.76%) were apposed to Slitrk1-positive puncta, while only 16.74âÂ±â4.09% of VGAT- and Gephyrin-positive clusters overlappedwith Slitrk1 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.1aâc</xref>). To further characterize the localization of Slitrk1 at the synapse, we examined its distribution in subcellular fractions generated from 3â4 week old mouse hippocampi using a specific antibody against the intracellular domain of Slitrk1 (Slitrk1-C). These analyses revealed that a portion of Slitrk1 protein is found in synaptic membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). As previously described, expression of Slitrk1 in an heterologous cell system leads to the detection of two closely migrating bands that likely represent differentially glycosylated forms of Slitrk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The Slitrk1-C and Slitrk1-N antibodies we have generated detect both forms of Slitrk1 proteins, but not other members of the Slitrk family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that Slitrk1 is localized to synapses and may thus play a role in synaptogenesis.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of Slitrk1 and Slitrk2 in neurons increases synapse density</title>
        <p>To determine whether Slitrk1 and another Slitrk family member, Slitrk2, can promote synaptic differentiation in neurons, we overexpressed Slitrk1 or Slitrk2 in hippocampal neurons. Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected at 13 DIV with two different amounts of vector DNA (1âÎ¼g or 2âÎ¼g) expressing either EGFP, or EGFP-tagged Slitrk1 or Slitrk2. Cultures were immunostained two days later with antibodies against markers of glutamatergic excitatory synapses, VGLUT1 and PSD-95, or against markers of inhibitory GABAergic synapses, VGAT and Gephyrin, and the number of synapses was quantified. In agreement with previously published observations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, overexpression of either Slitrk1 or Slitrk2 induced a robust increase in excitatory synaptic differentiation in contacting axons, as measured by the number of VGLUT1-PSD-95 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). In contrast to previous observations where overexpression of Slitrk1 and Slitrk2 did not have an effect on inhibitory presynaptic differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, we observed a significant increase in the number of inhibitory synaptic contacts as measured by the number of VGAT-Gephyrin-positive clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,d</xref>, grey bars) on hippocampal dendrites. However, this effect appeared to be dependent on high levels of overexpression of Slitrk1 or Slitrk2 as transfecting these neurons with smaller amounts EGFP-tagged Slitrk1- or Slitrk2-expressing vectors led to increased numbers of excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,d</xref>, white bars). Hence, overexpression of either Slitrk1 or Slitrk2 can promote the formation of excitatory synapses in dissociated hippocampal cultures. Furthermore, they are capable of promoting inhibitory synapse formation when expressed at high enough levels.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of Slitrk1 reduces synapse number in hippocampal neuron cultures</title>
        <p>To test whether endogenous Slitrk1 is required for excitatory or inhibitory synapse formation, we used RNA interference to knock down expression of Slitrk1 in hippocampal neurons. We generated two lentiviral vectors expressing individual shRNAs targeting Slitrk1 and infected dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures. These two independent shRNA constructs reduced the expression of endogenous Slitrk1 by 82.7% and 70.5% in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Knockdown of Slitrk1 significantly reduced the number of VGLUT1- and PSD-95-positive excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,e</xref>) but did not affect the number of VGAT- and Gephyrin-positive inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,f</xref>), indicating that Slitrk1 specifically contributes to excitatory synapse differentiation.</p>

        <title>The second leucine-rich repeat of Slitrk1 is necessary for its homophilic interaction at the cell surface</title>
        <p>The extracellular region of Slitrk1 contains two leucine-rich repeats, which are domains that can mediate protein-protein interactions and dimerization of cell surface receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. To examine whether Slitrk1 molecules can interact in <italic>cis</italic> at the cell surface, we used a chemical cross-linking approach to promote the maintenance of <italic>cis</italic>-interacting complexes at the plasma membrane. V5-tagged Slitrk1 was expressed in HEK293T cells and native plasma membrane complexes were preserved through covalent cross-linking. The SDS-PAGE migration of Slitrk1 corresponded to two bands at molecular weights of approximately 85 and 120âkDa. While the band migrating at 120âkDa represents the mature form of Slitrk1 expressed at the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), the lower molecular weight band likely represents an immature form of Slitrk1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. After cross-linking, the majority of Slitrk1 immunoreactivity appeared as a single band corresponding to an approximate molecular weight of 260âkDa, suggesting that it may be composed of Slitrk1 homodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, arrowhead). Furthermore, V5- and Myc-tagged Slitrk1 molecules can be co-immunoprecipitated from lysates of HEK293T cells expressing these two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Taken together, these two results indicate that Slitrk1 molecules have the ability to interact with each other at the cell surface, possibly forming homodimers.</p>
        <p>Since leucine-rich repeats have been implicated in the dimerization of cell surface receptors, we examined the requirement of the two LRR domains of Slitrk1 for this interaction. V5-tagged Slitrk1 molecules containing deletions of either the first (Slitrk1ÎLRR1) or second (Slitrk1ÎLRR2) LRR domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) were expressed in HEK293T cells with a Myc-tagged full-length Slitrk1 to perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Both Slitrk1 deletion proteins were expressed at the cell surface at similar levels to the wild-type Slitrk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). While deletion of the first LRR domain did not affect the co-immunoprecipitation of this mutant with Slitrk1, we observed a robust decrease in the interaction of Slitrk1ÎLRR2 with Slitrk1, indicating that the second LRR contributes to Slitrk1-Slitrk1 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Interestingly, removal of the second LRR did not affect the binding of Slitrk1 to PTPÎ´ in a cell binding assay, indicating that improper folding of this deletion mutant is unlikely to account for the lack of interaction with full length Slitrk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). In contrast, removal of the first LRR prevented Slitrk1 binding to PTPÎ´, confirming this previously published observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Slitrk1 can form homodimers at the cell surface and that the LRR2 domain is necessary for this interaction to take place.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Members of the Slitrk family of proteins have been implicated in the etiology of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Here, we show that Slitrk1 is present in postsynaptic density fractions isolated from mouse hippocampi and that Slitrk1 is preferentially localized to excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons, supporting a role for these proteins in regulating synapse formation. We also demonstrate that overexpression of Slitrk1 or Slitrk2 in hippocampal neurons promotes the formation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, which is consistent with the previously reported observation that Slitrk1 can promote presynaptic clustering of both VGLUT1 and VGAT in a mixed-culture assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, considering that Slitrk1 is preferentially localized at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1aâc</xref>) and that its overexpression has been shown to specifically enhance the formation of excitatory synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, it is somewhat surprising that we also observe an increase in inhibitory synapse formation in our experiments. It is therefore likely that the enhanced number of inhibitory synapses we observe in these neuronal cultures results from high overexpression of Slitrk1 in our system leading to its ectopic localization to inhibitory synapses. In keeping with this possibility, transfecting hippocampal neurons with lower amounts of EGFP-tagged Slitrk1 vector promotes formation of excitatory synapses but not inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Decreased expression of Slitrk1 in hippocampal neurons reduced the number of excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed, demonstrating that endogenous Slitrk1 specifically contributes to excitatory synapse formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Taken together, our observations and previously published results indicate that Slitrk1 has the potential to promote presynaptic differentiation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, but that its localization restricts its effect to excitatory synapses.</p>
      <p>Slitrk3 has been identified as a specific inducer of inhibitory presynaptic differentiation by binding to the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPÎ´, on the presynaptic side of the cleft<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Ablation of <italic>Slitrk3</italic> in mice leads to specific reductions in both inhibitory synapse density and synaptic transmission in the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In contrast to the specific role that Slitrk3 plays in regulating inhibitory synapse formation, other Slitrk family members have been shown to modulate excitatory synapse formation by interacting with PTPÏ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Our results demonstrate for the first time that endogenous Slitrk1 proteins are localized to excitatory synapses and confirm that Slitrk1 contributes to the formation of these synapses <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
      <p>The presence of two LRR domains in the extracellular region of Slitrk molecules suggests that protein-protein interactions play a critical role in their functions. Indeed, the most N-terminal LRR domain (LRR1) of Slitrk1 is essential to mediate its interaction in <italic>trans</italic> with LAR-RPTPs and for its ability to promote synapse formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Interestingly, this domain is also necessary for the interaction of another Slitrk family member, Slitrk5, with a cell surface receptor in <italic>cis</italic> to regulate its cell surface expression. The LRR1 domain of Slitrk5 was recently shown to mediate interactions with the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB and to regulate its trafficking inside the cell. The binding of BDNF to TrkB promotes an interaction between Slitrk5 and TrkB, outcompeting PTPÎ´ binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In contrast to the LRR1 domain, binding partners for the second LRR2 domain of Slitrks remain to be identified. Our observation that Slitrk1 molecules can form complexes at the cell surface through interactions between their LRR2 domains when expressed in HEK293T cells suggests that other Slitrk family members may also be capable of forming homodimers at the surface. While it remains unclear whether dimerization of Slitrk1 is required for its function at the synapse, dimerization and lateral interactions of other synaptogenic proteins have been implicated in their ability to promote synapse formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. For example, the dimerization of neuroligin is necessary for its synaptogenic activity, and has been proposed to regulate the transsynaptic clustering of neurexin in the presynaptic terminal during synapse assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. While dimerization of Slitrk1 does not appear to be necessary for its binding to PTPÎ´ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), it may serve to promote the lateral assembly of LAR-RPTPs-Slitrk complexes that has been proposed to take place at the synapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Future studies should shed light on the role of Slitrk1 dimerization through LRR2 for its function at the synapse.</p>

Neurons at DIV15 were fixed and stained for Slitrk1-N (N-terminal antibody, green) with pre- (red) and post-synaptic (blue) excitatory (<bold>a</bold>) or inhibitory (<bold>b</bold>) markers. Slitrk1 staining is punctate and colocalizes mostly with excitatory synaptic puncta, as well as some inhibitory synaptic puncta. (<bold>c</bold>) Quantification of average number of Slitrk1-positive synapses per neuron. MeanâÂ±âs.e.m.: Excitatory, 57.23âÂ±â4.76, <italic>n</italic>â=â6 neurons; Inhibitory, 16.74âÂ±â4.09, <italic>n</italic>â=â5 neurons. Endogenous Slitrk1 localizes mainly to excitatory synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons. (<bold>d</bold>) Distribution of Slitrk1 in subcellular fractions of hippocampi isolated from 3â4 week old mouse brain. Note that Slitrk1 is detected in synaptic fractions including P2, P2* and the postsynaptic densities (PSD). PSD-95 and synaptophysin were probed for comparison. H, homogenate; P1, crude nuclear fraction; S2, supernatant after P2 precipitation; P2, crude synaptosomes; P2*, purified synaptosomes; PSD1, pellet after the first Triton X-100 extraction; PSD2, pellet after the second Triton X-100 extraction. (<bold>e</bold>) Characterization of Slitrk1 antibodies. Lysates of HEK293T cells expressing HA-tagged Slitrk family proteins were immunoblotted with Slitrk1-C (C-terminal antibody), Slitrk1-N, and HA antibodies. Slitrk1 antibodies specifically recognize Slitrk1.</p>

        <title>Slitrk1 molecules have the ability to interact at the cell surface.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Slitrk1 exists in a complex at the cell surface. Western blot of cross-linked (+) or mock-treated (â) HEK293T cells transfected with Slitrk1-V5. Cross-linked sample reveals a protein complex containing Slitrk1-V5 that migrates above 245âkDa (arrowhead). (<bold>b</bold>) Slitrk1 forms homophilic complexes. HEK293T cells were transfected with either Slitrk1-V5 alone, Slitrk1-myc alone, or co-transfected with both tagged vectors. Protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with V5 antibodies and western blots were performed using myc and V5 antibodies. These results indicate that Slitrk1 can form homophlic complexes when expressed in HEK293T cells. IP, Immunoprecipitation; WB, Western Blot.</p>

        <title>Determination of the LRR domain required for homophilic binding and binding to PTPÎ´.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Diagram of Slitrk1 mutant constructs. Mutants, Slitrk1ÎLRR1 and SlitrkÎLRR2, are missing the coding region for leucine-rich repeat domain 1 and 2, respectively. Full length and mutant constructs are C-terminally V5-tagged. NTS, n-terminal sequence; LRR, Leucine-rich repeat domain; TM, Transmembrane domain; ICD, intracellular domain. (<bold>b</bold>) Expression of full length and mutant V5-tagged Slitrk1 protein at the cell surface. COS cells were transfected with Slitrk1-V5 or mutant variants. Cell-surface proteins were isolated by incubating cells with biotin, followed by immunoprecipitation with avidin-conjugated beads. Biotinylated cell surface Slitrk1-V5 was detected by blotting with a V5 antibody. The intracellular protein Akt was not detected in these immunoprecipitates. Expression of the Slitrk1 mutants at the cell surface is similar to that of full length Slitrk1. I, Input; S, Surface protein. (<bold>c</bold>) Analysis of interaction between Slitrk1 full length and mutant constructs by co-immunoprecipitation. HEK293T cells were either transfected with Slitrk1-myc or Slitrk1-V5 alone, or co-transfected with Slitrk1-myc and one of the Slitrk1-V5 full length or mutant constructs. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with V5 antibodies and blotted with myc and V5 antibodies. These results indicate that the LRR2 domain of Slitrk1 is required for homophilic Slitrk1 interactions. (<bold>d</bold>) Cell surface binding assay performed on COS cells transfected with V5-tagged Slitrk1 variants. Cells were treated with purified PTPÎ´-Fc protein and analyzed by immunofluorescence for PTPÎ´-Fc binding (red) and V5 (green). These results demonstrate that the LRR1 is required for the binding of PTPÎ´ to Slitrk1.</p>
