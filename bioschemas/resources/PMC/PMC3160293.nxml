      <abstract>
        <p>Fluid flow through large interstitial spaces is sensed at the cellular level, and mechanistic responses to flow changes enables expansion or contraction of the cells modulating the surrounding area and brings about changes in fluid flow. In the anterior eye chamber, aqueous humor, a clear fluid, flows through trabecular meshwork (TM), a filter like region. Cochlin, a secreted protein in the extracellular matrix, was identified in the TM of glaucomatous patients but not controls by mass spectrometry. Cochlin undergoes shear induced multimerization and plays a role in mechanosensing of fluid shear. Cytoskeletal changes in response to mechanosensing in the ECM by cochlin will necessitate transduction of mechanosensing. TREK-1, a stretch activated outward rectifying potassium channel protein known to act as mechanotransducer was found to be expressed in TM. Cochlin expression results in co-expression of TREK-1 and filopodia formation. Prolonged cochlin expression results in expression and subsequent secretion of annexin A2, a protein known to play a role in cytoskeletal remodeling. Cochlin interacts with TREK-1 and annexin A2. Cochlin-TREK-1 interaction has functional consequences and results in changes in cell shape and motility. Annexin A2 expression and secretion follows cochlin-TREK-1 syn-expression and correlates with cell elongation. Thus cytoskeleton changes in response to fluid shear sensed by cochlin are further mediated by TREK-1 and annexin A2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A number of late onset and progressive diseases for example, glaucoma and idiopathic intracranial hypertension are associated with fluid flow abnormalities. Cells dynamically responds to fluid shear, however, such mechanosensing and their responses are yet to be well understood at the molecular level. Altered properties of the cells of a filter like structure termed trabecular meshwork (TM) in the anterior eye chamber are thought to cause fluid shear abnormalities leading to aqueous outflow dysregulation, intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuations and glaucoma <xref rid="pone.0023070-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023070-Asrani1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Physiologically how the cells of the TM region sense and respond to different fluid flow regimes controlling geometry and area of the filter remains to be elucidated. Two distinct components are envisaged for regulation of fluid flow: a mechanosensor residing at the extracellular matrix (ECM) and transmembrane mechanotransducers residing at the cell surface.</p>
      <p>Cochlin, a secreted protein identified in the glaucomatous, but not normal TM, by mass spectrometry was found to undergo multimerization in response to fluid shear <xref rid="pone.0023070-Bhattacharya1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Cochlin bears two von Willebrand factor A-like (vWFA) domains that are found in fluid shear responsive ECM proteins <xref rid="pone.0023070-Shankaran1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Fluid shear induces cochlin multimerization suggesting cochlin to possess mechanosensing capability <xref rid="pone.0023070-Bhattacharya1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Experiments performed in DBA/2J mice, monkey, and porcine cultured anterior segments <xref rid="pone.0023070-Bhattacharya2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023070-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and normotensive rabbits <xref rid="pone.0023070-Jimenez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> are consistent with a key role for cochlin in IOP regulation. The fluid flow changes must be sensed by cells in order to regulate the structure of the TM that allows passage of aqueous humor and to regulate its flow. Fluid shear responsive property of cochlin in consonance with transmembrane shear transducing proteins stretch activated channels (SACs) such as TREK-1 <xref rid="pone.0023070-Kung1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023070-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> is likely to play a role in mechanotransduction and tissue modeling. Stretch-activated channels have been proposed to be ocular barometers <xref rid="pone.0023070-Kalapesi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. TREK-1 is a mechanosensitive stretch activated potassium channel <xref rid="pone.0023070-Chemin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. TREK-1 is expressed at mRNA level in the TM [accession number GDS 359; gene expression omnibus (GEO) database]. The TREK-1 channel undergoes mechano-, pH- and voltage-dependent gating and also possesses a domain to interact with membrane phospholipids. TREK-1 activation alters the cytoskeletal network, induces actin cytoskeleton remodeling and is involved in formation of actin- rich membrane protrusions <xref rid="pone.0023070-Chemin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023070-Lauritzen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The transduction of mechanosensing by cochlin with TREK-1 is thus plausible, which may lead to remodeling of TM cell cytoskeleton rendering increased passage for aqueous humor. Cell motility and adhesion require a dynamic remodelling of the membrane-associated actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular stimuli (such as changing fluid shear). Rho-mediated actin rearrangement of TM cells has implicated in regulation of aqueous outflow <xref rid="pone.0023070-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A tyrosine phosphorylation switch in annexin A2 has been shown to be an important event in triggering Rho/ROCK-dependent and actin-mediated changes in cell morphology associated with cell adhesion <xref rid="pone.0023070-Rescher1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023070-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We have previously determined interaction of cochlin with annexin A2 using mass spectrometry <xref rid="pone.0023070-Picciani1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Annexins are involved in many membrane remodeling events that involve actin cytoskeleton serving as linkers of membrane-cytoskeleton, organization <xref rid="pone.0023070-Gerke1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Annexins are a family of calcium ion dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. Annexin family is comprised of more than 50 members. Each annexin possesses a short variable N-terminal and a conserved C-terminal core domain <xref rid="pone.0023070-Rescher1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023070-Gerke1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We present evidence that cochlin-TREK-1 and cochlin-annexin A2 interaction is commensurate with changes in TM cell shape and motility which ultimately changes the filter like structure of TM affecting aqueous outflow.</p>

        <p>The work was conducted adhering to the guidelines of the Institute Review board of the University of Miami. All human samples were handled in keeping with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All experiments with the human samples were conducted at the SKB (ocular proteomic laboratory) lab and the protocol was approved by the Institute Review board of the University of Miami. A written informed consent was obtained from all patients undergoing trabeculectomy for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and donating the tissue so obtained for research. Cadaver human eyes were obtained from National Disease Research Interchange, Philadelphia with the approval (exempt under category 4 of NIH guidelines) of the Institute Review board of the University of Miami.

Eyes were enucleated within 12 h of death and stored at â80Â°C until TM tissue was isolated by dissection. Normal control eyes were from donors with no visual field defects, no evidence of glaucoma, and without central nervous system abnormalities. Fixed human TM tissues used for immunohistochemistry were obtained from the Eye Donor Program of the Foundation Fighting Blindness (Owings Mills, MD). Glaucomatous eyes and tissues were from clinically documented POAG donors. Glaucomatous TM tissues (â¼1â2 mm<sup>3</sup>) were obtained by trabeculectomy from POAG patients in the BPEI and Mundorf Eye Center (Charlotte, NC) with institutional review board approval. Human tissue obtained by trabeculectomy consisted predominantly of TM; however, possible contamination with small amounts of surrounding tissue (e.g. sclera) cannot be excluded. TM cells for cell culture were isolated from the rim tissue associated with corneas used for transplantation at the BPEI and were obtained from healthy human eyes within 3 h of death and stored until use in Optisol-GS medium (Chiron Vision, Claremont, CA).</p>

        <p>Analyses were carried out for known and predicted protein interactions for cochlin that include physical (direct) as well as functional (indirect) associations in different databases (MIPS, DIP, MINT and String) which encompass and track protein-protein interaction or co-expression. Additionally, a short list of proteins encompassing basement membrane, stretch activated channels and endoplasmic reticulum was prepared for further investigation. Potential cochlin-interacting proteins or protein co-expression for cochlin was considered from information derived from genomic context, high throughput experiments, conserved co-expression and previous knowledge through data mining these databases. The shortlist consisted of proteins which appeared in more than one database. They were initially selected and retained for further investigation using Western and ELISA analysis if they were expressed in the trabecular meshwork, ear, kidney and/or have been shown to be linked to benign intracranial hypertension.</p>

A sterile microscopy slide (cat# 56700-194, VMR) was placed on top of the tissue fragment to ensure bottom contact and immobility inside the media well. The sections were cultured at 37Â°C, in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> cell culture incubator. Cultures were washed with 1Ã PBS 7 days later to remove tissue debris; media change occurred every 3â4 days. Thus obtained cells were trypsin treated (cat# 25-050-Cl, Mediatech Inc.) and accordingly distributed the day before the transfection Transfection complexes were created using a ratio of 0.4 Âµg/Âµl of respective vector DNA to the transfection agent (Lipofectamine 2000, cat# 11668-019, Invitrogen), prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following the addition of the complexes to the selected culture wells, the transfection reactions were allowed to take place over a 2.5 h span, after which they were terminated through the addition of cell culture media. Cell assays and immunohistochemical analysis were performed at or within 24 h in order to observe and track the effects of vector expression on morphological changes. Time-lapse microscopy was performed using cells grown on glass bottom chamber slides (cat# 154534, Lab-Tek, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rochester, NY) using the Zeiss AxioVert 200 M microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc) for the duration of 20 h, with 15 minutes snapshot frequency, initiated at 24 h post-transfection.

      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>Mechanotransduction may induce alterations in cell shape and motility within the TM. Cultured primary human TM cells were used to demonstrate the effects of cochlin, TREK-1 and annexin A2 on cellular morphology. Control untransfected TM cells show straight smooth edges. In contrast, cochlin, annexin A2 and their co-transfection result in sharp, thin and elongated filopodia, stretched cells with multiple hair-like projections and thicker spread out filopodia like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These data suggest that cell shape changes concomitant with cochlin or annexin A2 overexpression. Secreted cochlin from transfected cells modulates the morphology of adjacent untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023070.s004">Movie S1</xref>). Cochlin secreting cells show a transparent leading edge (round filopodia), while untransfected cells show filopodia moving away from regions of high cochlin concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023070.s004">Movie S1</xref>). We next used time-lapse microscopy, exogenous purified recombinant cochlin and TM cells to demonstrate how cochlin concentration gradients promote filopodia formation.

      <p>Cochlin transfected cells also show localization of cochlin and annexin A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023070.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). At early stages of cochlin expression (â¼24 hours), annexin A2 localized close to the nucleus; the protein expression shifted toward filopodia at later (29 hours) stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that cochlin and TREK-1 follow similar expression kinetics with respect to initial filopodia formation. Annexin A2 follows the course of cochlin expression and likely plays a role in filopodia extension and enlargement. The co-expression of cochlin and TREK-1 is consistent with their role in mechanosensing and mechanotransduction.</p>
      <p>We next probed functional interaction between cochlin and TREK-1 using the voltage sensitive dye, bis-(1, 3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC). Activation of TREK-1, an inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel <xref rid="pone.0023070-Lesage1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> prevents inward DiBAC transport resulting in lower fluorescence. TM cells transfected with TREK-1+cochlin showed lower fluorescence intensity compared to control TREK-1+ Retinoid isomerohydrolase (<italic>RPE65</italic>) transfected cells incubated in presence of DiBAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023070.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Retinoid isomerohydrolase, an ocular protein with a molecular size similar to cochlin was chosen as a control. TM cells transfected with cochlin and cultured in the presence or absence of 5 Âµm oleylamine, a cationic lipid inhibitor of TREK-1 channel activity <xref rid="pone.0023070-Lauritzen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, showed an unchanged ratio of cells developing filopodia compared to the total number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g002">Figure 2D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023070.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) suggesting TREK-1 mediated morphological changes in TM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) are independent of the channel activity.

      <p>Overall, changes in cell shape and motility should create open spaces for fluid outflow. We reasoned that such expansion of the TM slit-like filter should be reflected in cochlin overexpressing TM cells on a matrix. The contribution of cochlin and TREK-1 to space expansion for fluid flow probed using collagen gel assays <xref rid="pone.0023070-Ilagan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> suggest gel expansion requires the presence of both TREK-1 and cochlin (data not shown).</p>

Significant modulation in cochlin secretion is likely to be associated with changes in expression of select basement membrane and endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Extensive bioinformatic analyses for known and predicted protein interactions for cochlin in various databases enabled us to short-list select proteins for further investigation, namely: diaphanous related formin-1 (<italic>DRF1</italic>), alpha-tectorin (<italic>TECTA</italic>), gasdermin (<italic>GSDMB</italic>) and wolframin (<italic>WFS1</italic>), which were found to be elevated in human glaucomatous TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Diaphanous related formin-1 is usually present in the tip of the membrane ruffles in motile cells, nucleates actins and acts in a Rho-dependent manner. It is required for the assembly of F-actin structures, such as actin cables and stress fibers <xref rid="pone.0023070-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Rho-mediated actin rearrangement has been noted in TM cells which have been implicated in regulation of aqueous outflow <xref rid="pone.0023070-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Diaphanous related formin-1 is known to regulate actin polymerization in hair cells <xref rid="pone.0023070-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Gasdermin, a cytosolic protein have been implicated in playing a role in general in cellular protein secretion, hence it may play a role for secretion of cochlin and annexin. The expression of gasdermin is associated with cell motility as well <xref rid="pone.0023070-Katoh1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Alpha-tectorin is one of the major non-collagenous components of the tectorial membrane. The tectorial-membrane is an extracellular matrix of the inner ear. Alpha-tectorin is implicated in transduction of sound signals in the inner ear. All tectorins are likely synthesized as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked, membrane-bound precursors and proteolytically released into the extracellular compartment. Gene expression omnibus database search shows presence of alpha-tectorin at mRNA level in the TM (accession number GDS 359).Like annexin A2, alpha-tectorin is anchored to the membrane with a lipid anchor and released into ECM under certain conditions<xref rid="pone.0023070-Naz1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Wolframin (WFS1) is a transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that participates in the regulation of cellular calcium ion homeostasis. Elevated levels of wolframin can cause ER stress and elevated intracellular calcium.

      <p>Annexin A2 is a multifunctional protein, associated with morphological changes and elongation in a variety of cell types. If cochlin induces alteration in cell shape and motility, expression of proteins associated with cell elongation, for example, annexin A2 would be anticipated to increase, concomitant with elevated cochlin secretion. Normal TM cells have low secreted cochlin and annexin A2 levels. However, TM cells transfected with <italic>COCH</italic> secrete cochlin, as well as annexin A2. In contrast TM cells transfected with annexin A2 plasmid do not secrete any more annexin A2 than untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). HEK-293T and Cos-7 lack basal annexin A2 or cochlin secretion, but when transfected with cochlin constructs, these cells secrete both cochlin and annexin A2 into the media. Recombinant annexin A2 expression in these cells results in elevated annexin A2 in cell lysates but not its secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g004">Figures 4B and 4C</xref>). Thus, the transfection of cochlin results in secretion of annexin A2, yet annexin A2 overexpression by itself does not lead to its secretion. Previous mass spectrometric analysis indicated the interaction of cochlin with annexin A2 <xref rid="pone.0023070-Picciani1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Cochlin-annexin A2 interactions were demonstrated by reciprocal IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition to reciprocal IP, we also performed overlay assay which is an independent method to demonstrate protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions <xref rid="pone.0023070-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023070-Nawrot1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Briefly, the proteins in a tissue or cell lysate, fractionated by electrophoresis and transferred on a membrane are subjected to interaction with target protein which is subsequently immunodetected. Overlay assays further corroborated cochlin-annexin A2 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). These results suggest basement membrane proteins are elevated concomitant with secretion of cochlin in glaucomatous tissue and interaction of cochlin with TREK-1, stretch-activated channel (SAC) proteins and annexin A2 may mediate effects of cochlin.</p>

Cochlin interacts with annexin A2 and augments secretion of the latter by the non-classical pathway. <bold>(F)</bold> ELISA analysis of the media collected from primary TM cells transfected with cochlin shows increased secretion of cochlin and annexin A2 by cochlin transfected cells as compared to mock transfection. Golgi disruptor Brefeldin has a greater effect on cochlin secretion, and caspase-1 inhibitor and pan-caspase inhibitor have greater effect on annexin secretion.</p>

      <p>Using caspase inhibitors as tools for probing non-classical protein secretion <xref rid="pone.0023070-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, we further determined that cochlin is secreted by the classical pathway, in contrast, cochlin induced annexin A2 secretion is likely mediated by the non-classical pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Annexin A2 secretion (but not cochlin) was significantly reduced in HEK-293T cells when incubated with caspase-1 or pan-caspase inhibitor but not with brefeldin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Brefeldin is an inhibitor of classical protein secretion which inhibits transport of proteins from endoplasmic reticulum <xref rid="pone.0023070-Klausner1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. These results suggest that secretion (annexin A2) or levels (diaphanous related formin-1, alpha-tectorin) of select proteins that contribute to cytoskeletal remodeling are modulated by cochlin. Diaphanous related formin-1 expression was found at the leading edges of filopodia, consistent with actin reorganization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023070.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) in cochlin transfected TM cells. Similarly diaphanous related formin-1 and alpha-tectorin were also found in the leading edges of TM cells transfected with cochlin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0023070.s001">Figures S1C and S1D</xref>). These results suggest association of annexin A2 and diaphanous related formin-1 with cell elongation.</p>
      <p>Both mono- and multimeric cochlin have been found to interact with SACs such as TREK-1, TASK-1 and choline transporter-like protein 2 (<italic>SLC44A2</italic>). Multimeric cochlin is proteolysis resistant and reside for longer periods in the TM (data not shown). TM cells function in an environment of continuous varying mechanical and fluid shear forces <xref rid="pone.0023070-WuDunn1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Our understanding of molecular mechanosensors and their role in transduction of stimuli into cellular biochemical signals that ultimately regulate cellular function <xref rid="pone.0023070-Vogel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> is very limited. Reversible multimerization of cochlin caused by shear stress can act as potential mechanosensing mechanisms. The data presented here suggests that mechanical forces are possibly transmitted through cochlin-TREK-1 protein-protein interactions. Our findings link ECM mechanosensing by cochlin with transmembrane mechanotransduction mediated by TREK-1 resulting in modulation of cytoskeletal proteins <xref rid="pone.0023070-Geiger1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023070-Janmey1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The modulation of cell shape and motility and overall space expansion mediated by cochlin should induce overall TM filter changes and result in increased fluid flow. Taken together, these data suggest interaction of cochlin with TREK-1 is involved in formation of filopodia-like protrusions. These processes are likely to contribute to expansion of cells in the gel, consistent with opening spaces between cells and increased transport of sodium fluorescein across cell layer matrix, suggesting a regulatory role for cochlin and TREK-1 in fluid flow across TM tissue. Indeed TM cells overexpressing cochlin but not a control protein Retinoid isomerohydrolase of identical size has been found to contribute to gel expansion and to augment transport of fluorescein across cell layer (data not shown). Our results suggest mechanotransduction by cochlin and TREK-1 of fluid flowing through the ECM can modulate the expression of several cytosolic proteins, for example, diaphanous related formin-1, alpha-tectorin and Profilin I and induce actin cytoskeletal remodeling <xref rid="pone.0023070-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> concomitant with increased outflow facility <xref rid="pone.0023070-Syriani1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and reduction of IOP <xref rid="pone.0023070-Morales1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023070-GomezCabrero1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our observation of cochlin-TREK-1 co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) is consistent with their initiation of changes in the space between cells within TM filter. The kinetics of annexin A2 appearance is consistent with cytoskeletal remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023070-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and late cellular changes associated with TM remodeling and expansion resulting in enhanced fluid flow across cell layers (data not shown). Maximum resistance to aqueous outflow is localized to the juxtacanalicular tissue of the TM <xref rid="pone.0023070-Maepea1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Studies suggest TM cells dynamically regulate outflow facility by rearranging their cytoskeleton, thus enhancing aqueous outflow <xref rid="pone.0023070-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Our results provide insight into the physiology of TM outflow regulation and suggest a role for fluid shear mechanosensing in the aqueous humor outflow process.</p>
