      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Individuals with nonsyndromic congenital retinal nonattachment (NCRNA) are totally blind from birth. The disease afflicts ~1% of Kurdish people living in a group of neighboring villages in North Khorasan, Iran. We show NCRNA is caused by a 6523bp deletion that spans a remote <italic>cis</italic> regulatory element 20 kb upstream from <italic>ATOH7</italic> (<italic>Math5</italic>), a bHLH transcription factor gene required for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) and optic nerve development. In humans, the absence of RGCs stimulates massive neovascular growth of fetal blood vessels within the vitreous, and early retinal detachment. The remote <italic>ATOH7</italic> element appears to act as a secondary or âshadowâ transcriptional enhancer. It has minimal sequence similarity to the primary enhancer, which is close to the <italic>Atoh7</italic> promoter, but drives transgene expression with an identical spatiotemporal pattern in the mouse retina. The human transgene also functions in zebrafish, reflecting deep evolutionary conservation. These dual enhancers may reinforce <italic>Atoh7</italic> expression during early critical stages of eye development when retinal neurogenesis is initiated.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p id="P2">The vertebrate neural retina develops during embryogenesis from multipotent progenitors in the optic cup. These cells exit mitosis and differentiate to form photoreceptors, interneurons, MÃ¼ller glia, and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) through the actions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Seven major cell types emerge from the progenitor pool in a relatively fixed order, with overlapping birthdates, and differentiate to form a highly laminar structure that detects and processes visual information. Histogenesis starts in the central retina and spreads to the periphery over several days to weeks, depending on the species. Ganglion cells are the first-born retinal neurons in all vertebrates and occupy the innermost nuclear layer. Their axons comprise the optic nerves, which convey all visual information from the eyes to the brain. In mice, RGC genesis begins on embryonic day E11 and peaks around E13. In humans, RGCs are born between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> weeks of gestation. In addition to neurons, the retina contains astrocytes, which originate from a separate progenitor pool in the optic stalk. These enter the eye during late gestation, migrate across the inner retinal surface, and retain mitotic potential<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P3">Intrinsic factors controlling retinal histogenesis have been defined in large part through analysis of mouse genetic models. An archetypal example is the proneural bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factor Atoh7 (Math5), a homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Atonal<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The <italic>Atoh7</italic> gene is transiently expressed in newly post-mitotic precursors, beginning with the onset of neurogenesis<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. <italic>Atoh7</italic> mutant mice lack optic nerves and have a &gt;95% reduction in ganglion cell abundance<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. No other cell type is missing. Their eyes detect light and process visual information within the retina but transmit few, if any, signals to the brain<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. An orthologous <italic>ath5</italic> mutation was identified in the <italic>lakritz</italic> zebrafish<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In mouse <italic>Cre-lox</italic> lineage experiments, <italic>Atoh7</italic>+ precursors give rise to 5% of cells in the normal adult retina, but only a fraction of these precursors develop as RGCs<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. <italic>Atoh7</italic> thus acts as a competence factor for RGC fate. Differentially expressed mRNAs have been identified in mutant retinas<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, but the exact mechanism of Atoh7 action is incompletely understood.</p>
      <p id="P4">The mammalian retina is nourished by two vascular systems. The inner two-thirds is supplied by the central artery, which enters the eye through the optic nerve and branches to form surface and deep capillary beds. The outer retina is oxygenated by diffusion from the surrounding choriocapillaris. Both systems derive from the fetal circulation<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. In the embryo, inner hyaloid and outer ciliary vessels envelop the optic cup, anastomose across the rim, and fill the vitreous space. Starting at P0 in mice, vessels surrounding the lens regress through a branch-wise process of apoptosis, and the hyaloid trunk is remodeled to form the central retinal artery. In humans, these events occur during late gestation and early postnatal life<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P5">Many forms of hereditary blindness are caused by mutations in genes required for retinal cell maintenance or physiology, leading to slow or rapidly progressing degeneration<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. A smaller number of diseases involve genes such as <italic>CRX</italic> or <italic>NR2E3</italic>, which are required for photoreceptor differentiation<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. As yet, no human retinal disorder has been specifically associated with defects in fate determination of non-photoreceptor cell types. Congenital retinal vascular disorders are also major causes of blindness worldwide. In retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) and persistent hyperplasia of the primary vitreous (PHPV), ischemia and angiogenic signaling defects are the primary stimulus for pathological retinal neovascularization<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P6">Congenital retinal nonattachment is a severe form of blindness, with no detection of light from birth<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. The retina is partially or completely separated from the posterior globe, and there is typically a fibrovascular mass behind the lens. The disease is heterogeneous, with a variety of clinical and histological anomalies involving the retina and blood vessels in one or both eyes. In some patients, the disease occurs with systemic malformations, but there is no consistent association. Sporadic and familial cases have been reported<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. A nonsyndromic hereditary form (NCRNA) is common in North Khorasan, Iran, among descendants of a Kurdish founder population, and it is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with complete penetrance<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The locus was mapped by SSLP linkage and haplotype analysis to a 0.6â1.5 cM region on chromosome 10q21, but the causative mutation and pathogenic mechanism are unknown<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. In principle, the disease could arise from an intrinsic flaw in neuronal or vascular development.</p>
      <p id="P7">In this report, we show that blind NCRNA patients lack optic nerves, which prevents light perception and profoundly affects the development of retinal vasculature. Our data suggest that NCRNA is caused by deletion of conserved DNA sequences that appear to control <italic>ATOH7</italic> expression in early neuroretinal precursors. Finally, we show that the deleted sequences have properties consistent with a duplicate or âshadowâ enhancer<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, including: [1] an identical pattern of transcriptional activation as the primary <italic>Atoh7</italic> enhancer, [2] a remote genomic location, [3] a comparatively recent evolutionary origin and [4] conserved biological activity among vertebrates. NCRNA is thus a Mendelian is order that disrupts the intrinsic mechanism of retinal cell fate determination.</p>

        <title>Nonsyndromic congenital retinal nonattachment (NCRNA)</title>
        <p id="P8">This autosomal recessive disorder (MIM221900) was first described in a large consanguineous Kurdish family that traces its ancestry for nine generations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). The founders were dislocated centuries ago from Kurdistan to North Khorasan province in eastern Iran, during the Safavid Dynasty<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, and their descendants remained relatively isolated, linguistically, culturally and genetically, from the main Persian population until recent years. The disease afflicts 1.1% of the population in four neighboring villages, with an estimated carrier frequency of 18% for the NCRNA allele<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P9">The affected individuals are totally blind, with no perception of light. Their eyes exhibit leukocoria (white pupils), esotropia (misalignment with inward deviation), and a continuous pendular nystagmus (jerky eye movements) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1aâf</xref>). The pupils have no direct or consensual light reaction. In three-quarters of eyes examined, the anterior chambers were relatively shallow, but there was no consistent elevation of intraocular pressure. During a previous study<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, B-scan ultrasonography and serial fundoscopic examinations revealed formation of a dense mass behind the lens in each eye, with complete opacification of the vitreous by four months (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). There is also a slowly progressive corneal clouding, consistent with endothelial blood staining<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, which was evident to some extent in all adults examined. This develops over several years, is more severe in the inferior part of the cornea (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), and may occur with iridocorneal adhesions. No other sensory or neurological defects have been detected in the blind individuals. Their auditory, olfactory, endocrine and intellectual functions are intact, and they have normal developmental milestones. They have no systemic or other vascular abnormalities. Together, these clinical findings suggest bilateral persistence of the fetal blood vessels, with complete congenital detachment of the neural retina, and intravitreal vascular proliferation during infancy. The obligate heterozygotes are clinically normal. They have good vision, with no structural or functional eye pathology.</p>

      <sec id="S4">
        <title>Optic nerve aplasia in NCRNA</title>
        <p id="P10">Given the complete blindness, congenital nystagmus, and absent pupillary light reflexes, we investigated optic nerve defects as the primary anatomical basis for NCRNA pathology. Nystagmus is common in children with severe optic nerve malformations<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, and it is thought to arise from unbalanced sensory input to central autonomic centers controlling gaze, and a failure to calibrate oculomotor systems. The pupillary light reflex is triggered by rare photosensitive RGCs, which relay signals to the cortex of the olivary pretectal nuclei via the optic nerves. Proximity of the NCRNA region to <italic>ATOH7</italic> also raised the possibility of optic nerve involvement. <italic>Atoh7</italic> mutant mice have essentially no pupillary reflex<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, and significant retinovascular abnormalities<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, although retinal detachments are rare.</p>
        <p id="P11">In the original fundoscopic exams of one affected infant prior to vitreal opacification, the status of the optic discs could not be determined<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. To characterize the optic nerves anatomically, we performed orbital MRI exams on one adult NCRNA patient (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2aâc,f</xref>). As expected, this study showed heterogeneous consolidation of the vitreous compartments, consistent with complete retinal detachment and a retrolental fibrovascular mass in each eye. The sclerae (white fibrous outer layer of the eye globes), lens, extraocular muscles, retrobulbar fat and adnexa (lacrimal glands and other accessory visual structures) appeared relatively normal, and there were no anatomical defects in the anterior brain. In contrast, the optic nerves and chiasm were absent or greatly attenuated in multiple views. However, because the oculomotor and ciliary nerves and ophthalmic blood vessels were difficult to resolve within the orbital cones, we cannot exclude the presence of small atrophic optic nerves in these patients, similar to residual RGCs reported in some <italic>Atoh7</italic> mutant mice<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S5">
        <title>Identification of the NCRNA mutation</title>
        <p id="P12">The critical region spans 1639kb, from <italic>D10S1670</italic> to <italic>D10S1418</italic>, and overlaps 14 positional candidate genes, including <italic>ATOH7</italic> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We therefore tested blind (rr) and heterozygous (Rr) family members for mutations in the <italic>ATOH7</italic> transcription unit<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and known regulatory elements within 5.5kb of the initiation site, by sequencing multiple PCR amplicons (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The proximal 1.8kb upstream segment has been conserved during vertebrate evolution<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and is sufficient to drive reporter transgene expression in embryonic mouse retinas with a pattern similar to the <italic>Math5-lacZ</italic> knock-in allele<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P13">No sequence changes were found in the <italic>ATOH7</italic> gene or proximal upstream region compared to the NCBI reference genome or known variants. Likewise, no mutation was found in any of the 13 other genes in the nonrecombinant interval, including <italic>SIRT1</italic>, which has a major retinal dysgenesis phenotype in mutant mice (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P14">To screen for remote structural changes in the <italic>ATOH7</italic> region, we amplified single-copy DNA products from the 74 kb intergenic segment delimited by flanking genes <italic>PBLD</italic> (phenazine biosynthesis-like domain) and <italic>MYPN</italic> (myopalladin). This analysis revealed a deletion of six adjacent amplicons out of 17 distributed across the region, in samples from blind individuals (rr) compared to non-carrier relatives (RR) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). To verify this result and define endpoints, we performed multiple PCRs with primers flanking the deletion, and amplified a nested set of junctional products from NCRNA samples (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The deletion spans 6523bp, with 5bp microhomology at the endpoints (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). It is located 21.7 to 15.2kb upstream of the <italic>ATOH7</italic> transcription start site and 28.8 to 35.3kb downstream from the 3â² end of <italic>PBLD</italic> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). We then genotyped all available samples from the pedigree (<italic>n</italic> =150), including individuals who were not part of the original linkage studies, using a triplex strategy to amplify wild-type (+) and NCRNA (Î) alleles simultaneously (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). The results were completely concordant with phenotype data. All 31 blind individuals were homozygous for the deletion (ÎÎ), and all 119 sighted relatives were homozygous for the wild-type allele (++, <italic>n</italic> = 39) or heterozygous for the deletion (Î+, <italic>n</italic> = 80, including known obligate carriers).

        <p id="P15">To evaluate the small possibility of a second, coincidental deletion or duplication in the nonrecombinant region, we performed high-resolution SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis on six DNA samples from the NCRNA pedigree, including two blind patients and two obligate carriers (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This analysis detected the deletion 20kb upstream from <italic>ATOH7</italic> (spanning rs385145) but no further abnormalities. Unexpectedly, DNA from one blind individual (10877) was heterozygous for SNP markers centromeric to <italic>MYPN</italic>, revealing a novel recombinant disease haplotype. The underlying crossover narrows the critical region to 713kb and formally excludes four of the original candidate genes. Although an occult point mutation is theoretically possible, the combined genetic, clinical and functional data strongly support a causal relationship between the 6.5 kb deletion and NCRNA disease.</p>

        <p id="P19">The mammalian <italic>ATOH7</italic> region contains two broad regulatory unitsâa primary enhancer located within 2kb of the promoter, which has been characterized in mouse genomic DNA<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, and the remote cluster of CNEs that is deleted in the NCRNA pedigree (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P21">In this paper, we identify an <italic>ATOH7</italic> regulatory deletion as the probable cause of nonsyndromic congenital retinal nonattachment, a Mendelian disorder of cell fate determination. Although circumstantial, this conclusion is based on the most parsimonious interpretation of concordant phenotypic, genetic, transgene expression and evolutionary data. Since <italic>Atoh7</italic> controls development of the first-born retinal neurons (RGCs), the deleted enhancer, and the proximal regulatory region, appear to be the principal sites in the mammalian genome responsible for initiating retinal neurogenesis.</p>

Clinically related malformations, such as retinal dysplasia, congenital falciform folds and PHPV, have been described histologically, and may coexist with retinal nonattachment in the same pedigree or contralateral eye.

Our findings provide a basis for molecular genetic analysis of these disorders and carrier detection in the Khorasani pedigree.</p>

        <title>Coupled neurovascular development in the retina</title>
        <p id="P23">The ocular pathology in NCRNA patients resembles the phenotype of <italic>Atoh7</italic> mutant mice beyond the absence of optic nerves. In normal mice, retinal vascular development occurs between birth and P14, with spreading of surface vessels from the central artery to the ora serrata, elaboration of two deep vascular plexi, and coordinated regression of the fetal hyaloid network<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. In <italic>Atoh7</italic> mutants, there is complete agenesis of the intrinsic retinal vasculature<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Instead, the fetal vessels persist after birth and collapse upon the retinal surface, where they penetrate and ramify in an irregular pattern. These abnormal vessels are perfused by cilioretinal arteries and the remnant hyaloid trunk, and are prone to hemorrhage. A comparable but less severe neovascularization has been noted in <italic>Bst</italic>/+ mice and some human sporadic optic nerve aplasia cases<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, and may reflect a general deficiency of RGC paracrine factors that control retinal angiogenesis.</p>
        <p id="P24">In NCRNA patients, the pathogenic sequence of events is likely to be similar to that in <italic>Atoh7</italic> mutant mice, except that the persistent fetal blood vessels appear to proliferate more dramatically during infancy, causing complete perinatal detachment of the retina. This may occur during or shortly after neurogenesis, since the pathology is apparent at birth, and it may have a tractional basis, involving fibrovascular strands between the retina, posterior lens and hyaloid vessels. Indeed, vascular traction is thought to underlie the prevalence of juvenile detachments in patients with ROP, PHPV and FEVR. RGC axons comprising the nerve fiber layer may also stabilize the retina mechanically. The difference between mouse <italic>Atoh7</italic> and human NCRNA phenotypes may reflect the large disparity in scale between species for several parameters: [1] the size of the eye globe compared to the fixed distance for O<sub>2</sub> diffusion and thickness of the neuroretinal shell; [2] the relative volume of the lens and vitreous chamber; [3] the exposure of the retina to mechanical forces; and [4] the surface area requiring perfusion. Consequently, the hypoxia experienced by cells in the newborn retina, and the extent of the proliferative neovascular response, may be significantly greater in NCRNA patients compared to <italic>Atoh7</italic> mutant mice, and this may promote retinal detachment. There are also important differences in retinal structure and timing of vascular development between humans and mice, which may affect NCRNA pathogenesis<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P25">Regardless of these differences, the vascular phenotype in both species is a secondary consequence of the absence of RGCs, since <italic>Atoh7</italic> expression is limited to neurons. Although the molecular pathways are not fully defined, ganglion cells are known to stimulate migration of retinal astrocytes from the optic stalk, which promotes the normal program of vascularization<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. These events are mediated by signaling factors such as Shh, Pdgfa, Vegf and Ndp<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. In this way, the pathogenesis of NCRNA further highlights the interdependence between neural and vascular development.</p>
        <p id="P26">The profusion of vitreal blood vessels in NCRNA resembles the vascular events in retinopathy of prematurity, a major form of childhood blindness<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Although multiple risk factors have been identified, ROP is primarily stimulated by retinal ischemia during postnatal development, with an excessive angiogenic response. The new vessels create a fibrovascular ridge, near the equator of the globe, with a risk of folding and tractional detachment. The time course for retrolental fibroplasia in NCRNA and ROP progression are similar<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P27">In children and adults with NCRNA, recurrent intravitreal hemorrhages may communicate with the anterior chamber, causing chronic corneal blood staining, a local hemosiderin reaction.

        <p id="P29">The signals that initiate retinal neurogenesis converge upon <italic>Atoh7</italic> transcriptional enhancers. Several extrinsic factors have been implicated, which may stimulate (FGF), suppress (GDF11) or modulate (SHH) <italic>Atoh7</italic> expression (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Notes</xref>).

        <title>The shadow enhancer and optic nerve development</title>
        <p id="P30">On the basis of our findings, we speculate that the remote CNEs may function as a âshadowâ or <italic>secondary</italic> enhancer for <italic>ATOH7</italic>. This class of regulatory elements are thought to reinforce, refine or stabilize the effects of <italic>primary</italic> enhancers and may serve as vehicles for evolutionary change<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. First, the NCRNA element is located ~20kb from the primary <italic>ATOH7</italic> enhancer, which is close to the mRNA initiation site, and therefore presumably interacts with the promoter during retinogenesis via chromatin looping (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Second, the remote and primary enhancers drive nearly identical patterns of expression, and are thus at least partly redundant (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The two enhancers have no obvious sequence similarity, suggesting an independent evolutionary origin, and may have different selective constraints. They appear to have evolved as separate entities in the tetrapod lineage, by progressive displacement of 5â² regulatory modules from a single ancestral cluster (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>) with refinement by accumulation of point mutations. Third, the remote enhancer may be important for evolutionary fitness.</p>
        <p id="P31">Why does <italic>ATOH7</italic> have duplicate enhancers? Each is sufficient for appropriate reporter expression in transgenic mice and, although not formally tested, both are likely to be necessary for full development of RGCs <italic>in vivo</italic>. The remote enhancer may greatly boost the level of gene expression, acting via a cooperative mechanism, or stabilize the onset of transcription at a critical early stage of retinal histogenesis. In principle, delayed development of RGCs, due to a disruption in <italic>Atoh7</italic> expression or cellular metabolism, could prevent ganglion cell axons from exiting the optic cup before closure of the choroid fissure, leading to optic nerve hypoplasia and/or coloboma. These effects may be compounded because retinal neurogenesis in some vertebrates appears to propagate as a wave, suggesting a feed-forward mechanism. This may involve direct binding of Atoh7 protein to E-box sites in the proximal enhancer<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, although there is no evidence for <italic>Atoh7</italic> autoregulation in mammals<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Alternatively, an internal neurogenic timer may be cued by a gradient of signaling molecules<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. In either model, dual enhancers would assure robust firing of <italic>Atoh7</italic> transcripts.</p>
        <p id="P32">Congenital optic nerve malformations are relatively common causes of severe visual impairment in humans and have environmental and genetic risk factors. Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) affects 12% of blind children and often occurs with hypothalamic, pituitary or other CNS abnormalities (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Notes</xref>). Mutations in several genes are known to cause ONH in humans or mice, including <italic>Pax6</italic>, <italic>Pou4f2</italic>, <italic>Rx</italic>, <italic>Hesx1</italic>, <italic>Otx2</italic>, <italic>Six6, Chx10</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Dcc</italic>, <italic>Ntn1</italic> and <italic>Rpl24</italic>. Bilateral optic nerve aplasia is the most extreme ocular manifestation of this disease spectrum. There is also considerable variation in optic disc size among healthy people<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and RGC number among inbred strains of mice<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. In humans, two recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicate the <italic>ATOH7</italic> region as the most important determinant of variation in optic disc area, which is directly related to RGC number<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. Remarkably, the highest statistical significance for this papillometric trait is centered over the NCRNA deletion, including one genotyped SNP (rs3858145) in the shadow enhancer (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P33">The earliest stages of retinal neurogenesis may be relatively precarious, particularly the brief but essential burst of <italic>Atoh7</italic> transcription, which is required for vision and thus evolutionary survival. In this way, the remote enhancer may buffer this critical process against environmental and genetic stresses, as recently demonstrated for the <italic>svb</italic> and <italic>snail</italic> loci in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. The dual enhancers appear to function equivalently but have no obvious sequence similarity, apart from short motifs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). In future studies, it will be important to identify the molecular factors that activate these enhancers <italic>in vivo</italic>, triggering the onset of retinal histogenesis, and to determine the transcriptional and phenotypic effects of deleting the orthologous remote enhancer in mice.</p>
        <p id="P34">The NCRNA deletion may silence <italic>ATOH7</italic> expression entirely, as a null allele, or prevent high-level transcription, similar to deletions of the <italic>HBB</italic> locus control region or 3â² <italic>PAX6</italic> enhancer.

Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4Â°C in PBTx with 3% NDS 1% BSA. After washing in PBS 0.5% BSA, minimally cross-reactive donkey anti-rabbit IgG sera conjugated with biotin (1:500), or donkey anti-chicken IgY or anti-rat IgG sera conjugated with Dylight-488 (1:1000, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA), was applied for 2 hr at room temperature. After secondary antibody staining and washing in PBS 0.5% BSA, tertiary streptavidin-conjugated Texas Red (1:400) or Dylight-594 (1:1000) reagents were applied for 1 hr in PBTx with 1 Î¼g/ml 4â²,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole (DAPI). Slides were then washed in PBS and visualized by epifluorescence (Olympus BX-51) or laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM-510). Primary antibodies were anti-DsRed (Clontech rabbit polyclonal, 1:500) for <italic>Discoma sp.</italic> nuCherry; anti-GFP (Abcam chicken polyclonal, 1:2000); anti-Î²-galactosidase (rat polyclonal, 1:1000); and anti-BrdU (Harlan BU/175 rat monoclonal, 1:100). Genetic and serologic controls showed no cross-detection of nuCherry and GFP antigens. BrdU immunostaining was performed as a terminal procedure, following application of other 1Â° and 2Â° antibodies and an antigen retrieval step (2.4 N HCl in PBS 0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 hr). PH3 (phosphohistone H3) was detected using polyclonal rabbit antibody directly conjugated to Alexa-448 (Cell Signaling 9708, 1:50), after nuCherry immunostaining and 10% normal rabbit serum blocking steps, or a mouse monoclonal (6G3, Cell Signaling, 1:100) with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and Alexa-647 streptavidin.</p>

        <title>Flow cytometry</title>
        <p id="P43">Double-positive E14.5 littermates carrying nuCherry and GFP reporters were generated, along with single-positive and double-negative controls, by crossing Math5-GFP and 3034-BGnCherry transgenic mice. Genotypes were provisionally assigned by retinal fluorescence and verified by PCR of amniotic membrane DNA. Neural retinas from each embryo were dissected in cold PBS and dissociated by digestion with 1 Î¼g/ml trypsin (Gibco) for 15 min at 37Â°C, with intermittant trituration, in a 400 Î¼l volume. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1 Î¼g/ml SBTI (soybean trypsin inhibitor, igma), 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 100 Î¼g/ml DNase I (Sigma). Freshly dissociated cells were kept on ice, protected from light, and sieved immediately prior to flow cytometric analysis by centrifugation at 100Ã<italic>g</italic> for 5 min into 70 Î¼m mesh strainer collection tubes (BD Biosciences).</p>
        <p id="P44">Two-dimensional flow cytometry was performed using a BD FACS Diva instrument equipped with 488 nm argon and 561 nm solid-state excitation lasers (Spectraphysics) and 510/21 nm and 610/20 nm bandpass emission filters (Omega optics) to detect GFP and nuCherry fluorescence, respectively. No spectral compensation was required. Two embryos of each genotype (<italic>n</italic> = 8) were analyzed. For each cell suspension, the primary population was gated using FSC-A (forward scatter) and SSC-A (side scatter), and multiparticle events were excluded using the FSC-W parameter. Living cells (â¥95%) were further gated by DAPI (1 Î¼g/ml) exclusion, which was detected using a 351 nm UV laser (Coherent 300) and 424/44 nm bandpass filter. Flow data from â¥10,000 events were analyzed for each embryo using BD FACS Diva software.</p>
        <p id="P45">To visualize dissociated retinal cells, 20 Î¼l aliquots from each suspension were plated on 8-well chamber glass slides coated with poly-D-lysine, and the adherent cells were fixed with 4% PFA. Immunocytochemistry was performed as noted above, with rabbit anti-DsRed (1:2000) and chicken anti-GFP (1:5000). Cells were viewed using an Olympus BX-51 microscope with widefield fluorescence optics and a 100X oil immersion objective.</p>

        <p id="P46">Zebrafish in our breeding colony originated from a local pet store and are maintained at 28Â°C with a 10/14 hour light/dark cycle. Transgenic fish were produced by <italic>Tol2</italic> transposase-mediated integration (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Notes</xref>). Expression cassettes (<italic>3034-BGnCherry</italic> and <italic>BGnCherry</italic> control) were subcloned between the <italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Bsr</italic>GI sites of pT2AL200R150G, a plasmid vector that harbors <italic>Tol2</italic> transposable elements flanking the cloning site. Capped <italic>Tol2</italic> transposase mRNA was synthesized from <italic>Not</italic>I-linearized pCS-TP template using the Mmessage Mmachine SP6 kit (Ambion), purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, precipitated with isopropanol, and resuspended in nuclease-free water at 1 Î¼g/ml. Approximately 0.3 Î¼l of a mixture containing 25 ng/Î¼l supercoiled expression plasmid DNA and 25 ng/Î¼l <italic>Tol2</italic> transposase mRNA was injected into fertilized zebrafish eggs at the 1â2 cell stage. Injected embryos were surveyed for nuCherry expression 2â5 days post-fertilization (dpf) using a Leica MZ FLIII stereofluorescence microscope. No expression was detected in embryos injected with the control <italic>BGnCherry</italic> construct, whereas most embryos injected with the <italic>3034-BGnCherry</italic> exhibited bright red fluorescence. Approximately 100 embryos expressing the reporter were grown to adulthood.</p>
        <p id="P47">To identify germline integration of the transgene, injected fish were bred in groups of 6â8, and their offspring were examined for nuCherry expression. Groups containing fluorescent progeny were outcrossed to identify founders (F<sub>0</sub>) with transgenes integrated in the germline. The resulting N<sub>1</sub> progeny were then bred to wild- type fish to perpetuate heterozygous lines harboring solitary transgenes flanked by LTRs. Three <italic>3034-BGnCherry</italic> lines were generated in this way. To visualize retinal nuCherry expression in transparent embryos, 0.003% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) was added to the water at 12 hpf to inhibit pigment formation. <italic>3034-BGnCherry</italic> progeny were also crossed to the <italic>ath5:GFP</italic> line (kindly provided by Ichiro Masai), which carries a GFP transgene regulated by 7 kb genomic DNA from zebrafish <italic>ath5</italic> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Notes</xref>). Mitotic cells were labeled by immersing zebrafish embryos for 20 min in 1 mM EdU (ethynyl deoxyuridine) 15% DMSO prior to fixation in 4% PFA and cryopreservation. EdU-labeled nuclei were detected using CuSO<sub>4</sub> and Alexafluor 647 azide (Click-iT reagents, Invitrogen).</p>
