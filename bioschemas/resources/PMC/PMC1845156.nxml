          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Macrosomia is associated with considerable neonatal and maternal morbidity. Factors that predict macrosomia are poorly understood. The increased rate of macrosomia in the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and in congenital hyperinsulinaemia is mediated by increased foetal insulin secretion. We assessed the in utero and neonatal role of two key regulators of pancreatic insulin secretion by studying birthweight and the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia in patients with heterozygous mutations in the maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes <italic>HNF4A</italic> (encoding HNF-4Î±) and <italic>HNF1A/TCF1</italic> (encoding HNF-1Î±), and the effect of pancreatic deletion of <italic>Hnf4a</italic> on foetal and neonatal insulin secretion in mice.</p>

        <sec id="st2">
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>We examined birthweight and hypoglycaemia in 108 patients from families with diabetes due to <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations, and 134 patients from families with <italic>HNF1A</italic> mutations. Birthweight was increased by a median of 790 g in <italic>HNF4A</italic>-mutation carriers compared to non-mutation family members (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001); 56% (30/54) of <italic>HNF4A</italic>-mutation carriers were macrosomic compared with 13% (7/54) of non-mutation family members (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Transient hypoglycaemia was reported in 8/54 infants with heterozygous <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations, but was reported in none of 54 non-mutation carriers (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003). There was documented hyperinsulinaemia in three cases. Birthweight and prevalence of neonatal hypoglycaemia were not increased in <italic>HNF1A</italic>-mutation carriers. Mice with pancreatic Î²-cell deletion of <italic>Hnf4a</italic> had hyperinsulinaemia in utero and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia at birth.</p>

        <title>Editors' Summary</title>
        <sec id="sb1a">
          <title>Background.</title>
          <p>MODY, or maturity-onset diabetes of the young, is a particular subtype of diabetes; only a few percent of people with diabetes are thought to have this subtype. The condition comes about as a result of a mutation in one of six genes. Generally, people with MODY have high glucose (sugar) levels in the blood, and the typical symptoms of diabetes, such as increased thirst and urination, typically develop when the person is below the age of 25 y. Two of the genes that are known to cause MODY are mutant forms of <italic>HNF4A</italic> and <italic>HNF1A.</italic> The proteins that are encoded by these two genes control insulin levels produced by the pancreas; when these genes are mutated, not enough insulin is produced. Without enough insulin to control blood sugar, levels rise, leading to the symptoms of diabetes. However, MODY can be managed by many of the same interventions as other types of diabetes, such as diet, exercise, drug treatments, and insulin injections.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1b">
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>Although the evidence shows that individuals who carry mutations in <italic>HNF4A</italic> and <italic>HNF1A</italic> do not produce enough insulin and therefore have higher glucose levels in their blood, there were some tantalizing suggestions from mouse experiments that this might not be the whole story. Specifically, the researchers suspected that during embryonic development, mutations in <italic>HNF4A</italic> or <italic>HNF1A</italic> might actually cause higher insulin levels. Too much insulin during development of a fetus is known to cause it to gain weight, resulting in a baby that is larger than the average size for its age. Larger babies are risky for both the baby and the mother. The researchers doing this study wanted to understand more precisely what the links were between the forms of MODY caused by <italic>HNF4A</italic> and <italic>HNF1A</italic> mutations, and birth-weight and blood-sugar levels.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1c">
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>In this study, the researchers examined 15 families in which some family members had MODY caused by a mutation in <italic>HNF4A.</italic> They compared the birthweight for family members carrying the mutation (54 people) against the birthweight for those who did not (54 people). A similar comparison was done for 38 families in which some members had a different form of MODY, this time caused by a mutation in <italic>HNF1A.</italic> The results showed that the birthweight of family members who carried a mutation in <italic>HNF4A</italic> was, on average, 790 g higher than the birthweight of family members who didn't carry the mutation. Low blood-sugar levels at birth were also more common in people carrying the <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutation as compared to people who did not. However, the <italic>HNF1A</italic> mutation did not seem to be associated with greater birthweight or low blood-sugar levels at birth. Finally, in order to understand these findings further, the researchers created embryonic mice carrying mutations in the mouse equivalent of <italic>HNF4A.</italic> These embryos produced more insulin than normal mouse embryos and, after birth, were more likely to have low blood-sugar levels.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1d">
          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>These findings show that there is a link between mutations in <italic>HNF4A,</italic> but not in <italic>HNF1A,</italic> and increased birthweight. The increase found in this study is quite substantial (a median weight of 4,660 g in the affected babies; a birthweight of more than 4,000 g is generally considered large). The results suggest that in human embryos with a mutated form of <italic>HNF4A,</italic> too much insulin is produced during development, causing faster growth and a higher chance of the baby being born with low blood-sugar levels. This is an unexpected finding, because later in life the <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutation causes lower insulin levels. Therefore, the biochemical pathways causing this type of MODY seem to be quite complicated, and further research will need to be done to fully understand them. Crucially, the research also suggests that pregnant women carrying <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations should be closely followed to check their baby's growth and minimize the chance of complications. Doctors and families should also consider doing a genetic test for <italic>HNF4A</italic> if a baby has low blood-sugar levels and if there is a family history of diabetes; this would increase the chance of diagnosing MODY early.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Macrosomia is associated with considerable foetal and maternal morbidity [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Factors that predict macrosomia are still poorly understood [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In humans, foetal insulin secretion is one of the key determinants of foetal growth, acting mainly in the third trimester when the weight of the foetus increases greatly. This is seen in pregnant women with diabetes when foetal sensing of maternal hyperglycemia drives insulin secretion, insulin-mediated growth, and subsequent macrosomia. In addition to such environmental factors, mutations in the genes involved in insulin secretion are also known to affect birthweight. Mutations that cause hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia of infancy [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] are associated with increased birthweight.

      <p>The transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor-4Î± (encoded by the <italic>HNF4A</italic> gene), and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1Î± (encoded by <italic>HNF1A,</italic> approved gene name <italic>TCF1</italic>) play a key role in the regulation of pancreatic insulin secretion. <italic>HNF4A</italic> and <italic>HNF1A</italic> mutations cause monogenic diabetes (MODY 1 and MODY3, respectively) due to decreased insulin secretion [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and are key parts of an important Î²-cell network [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the pancreas, <italic>HNF1A</italic> and <italic>HNF4A</italic> form part of a common transcriptional network, which has been proposed as an explanation of the shared pancreatic phenotype seen in patients with mutations in these genes [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Variants in the <italic>HNF4A</italic> pancreatic promoter have also been associated with Type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

As a result of this animal study, we hypothesized that mutations in the human gene <italic>HNF4A</italic> might increase foetal insulin secretion and birthweight, and cause neonatal hyperinsulinaemia and hypoglycaemia. We therefore studied birthweight and reported hypoglycaemia in <italic>HNF4A</italic>-mutation carriers and unaffected family members. As a comparison, we also studied the families of patients with mutations in the closely associated pancreatic transcription factor <italic>HNF1A.</italic> To investigate the mechanism of neonatal hypoglycaemia and increased birthweight, we also studied foetal and neonatal mice lacking both copies of <italic>Hnf4a</italic> in the pancreas.</p>

        <p>One hundred and eight members (54 mutation carriers) of 15 families who had been found to have MODY due to an <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutation, were contacted. This group included 13 families where the mutation had previously been identified as well as two families, found after screening for <italic>HNF4A,</italic> where there was both neonatal hypoglycaemia and diabetes in a family member (see below).

        <p>In assessment of neonatal hypoglycaemia, we report here on three patients from two families described above in whom <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations had been identified due to coexistent familial diabetes and neonatal hypoglycaemia. In addition, we contacted 101 unselected members (48 mutation carriers) of the 13 families described above who had been found previously to have MODY due to an <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutation. In babies born to mothers with diabetes during pregnancy, hypoglycaemia that did not require intravenous glucose and lasted for less than 24 h was not considered exceptional. Any other reported incidence of hypoglycaemia at birth was followed up by case-note review. An episode of hypoglycaemia was established only if venous plasma glucose of less than 2.5 mmol/l was documented. All investigations for hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia were done by the referring clinician at the time of diagnosis using their local laboratory.</p>

There was no effect of offspring genotype on gestational age at delivery (<italic>p</italic> = 0.29). The influence of <italic>HNF4A</italic> genotype on birthweight remained significant if the individuals from the two families referred with hyperinsulinaemia were excluded (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Nineteen mothers who were mutation carriers and one mother who was not a mutation carrier had diabetes during pregnancy; 11 of the 20 offspring from these pregnancies were mutation carriers. Finally, to allow for any impact of maternal hyperglycaemia, corrected median birthweight was compared in 18 sibling pairs discordant for the presence of the <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutation. The median birthweight of the mutation-carrying siblings was 4,660 g compared with a median birthweight of the non-mutation-carrying siblings of 3,640 g, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040118-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that increased birthweight and macrosomia are common features of patients with <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations and, in addition, that some individuals with <italic>HNF4A</italic> have neonatal hypoglycaemia. Although in young adults the same genetic defect results in diabetes due to reduced insulin secretion [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we have shown that the mechanism for the phenotype in newborns is likely to be increased insulin secretion in utero and in the neonatal period. This is supported by hyperinsulinaemia in some affected infants with <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations, and studies in mice with Î²-cell deletion of <italic>Hnf4a</italic> clearly show hyperinsulinaemia in utero and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in the early neonatal period.</p>
      <p>
<italic>HNF4A</italic>-mutation carriers are, on average, 790 g heavier than their family members who do not carry the mutation, and 56% are born with macrosomia (&gt;4,000 g). The increase in birthweight is similar to that seen in the offspring of patients with maternal diabetes which is the commonest recognized cause of macrosomia. Forty-six percent of children with an <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutation born to affected fathers had macrosomia. This is a clear example that macrosomia may result from foetal genetics as well as from the maternal intra-uterine environment. Consideration of this should be taken into account when determining macrosomia risk, and we recommend that, in addition to maternal diabetes, a history of young-onset non-insulin-requiring paternal diabetes should prompt assessment of foetal size.</p>
      <p>We have described eight patients with <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations who had one or more episodes of hypoglycaemia in the neonatal period; there was hyperinsulinaemia in all three patients who were tested. Five patients required treatment with intravenous glucose only, with resolution within 1 mo; this finding was consistent with a transient hyperinsulinaemia. Two patients had more persistent hypoglycaemia which responded well to treatment with diazoxide and chlorothiazide and subsequently resolved. Therefore, the loss of <italic>HNF4A</italic> function causes a relatively mild form of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia that is transient and diazoxide-responsive. Transient hypoglycaemia is often not investigated and as a result is understudied. We propose that neonates presenting with hypoglycaemia who have a father with diabetes, or a mother with young-onset non-insulin-requiring diabetes, should be screened for <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations. However, three out of the five unselected <italic>HNF4A</italic>-mutation carriers with neonatal hypoglycaemia presented before their respective parent developed diabetes. Therefore, we also suggest that <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations should be considered in any child with persistent hypoglycaemia (&gt;24 h).</p>
      <p>We encountered two problems resulting from the retrospective nature of this study. Firstly, hospital records were not readily available so birthweight and gestational age were ascertained by parental recall in the majority of cases. However, all this data collection was done blind to genotype and therefore any error should apply to both offspring groups. Secondly, the hypoglycaemia was often not well investigated at the time of presentation, presumably because of its transient nature. Hence, hyperinsulinaemia at birth was looked for only in three out of the eight patients presenting with hypoglycaemia, and other causes of hyperinsulinaemia were not excluded. It also means that we are uncertain whether the 46 patients with <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations in whom hypoglycaemia was not described had undetected hypoglycaemia or were not hypoglycaemic. A prospective study of neonates born to <italic>HNF4A</italic>-mutation carriers is required for a complete assessment of the hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia seen in these patients.</p>
      <p>The increased birthweight and risk of macrosomia in <italic>HNF4A</italic>-mutation carriers is likely to be secondary to foetal hyperinsulinaemia. Although no measures of foetal insulin or cord insulin were available to confirm this mechanism in humans, two lines of evidence support it. Firstly, in humans, we have documented hyperinsulinaemia soon after birth in the three patients in whom it was tested, and hypoglycaemia in eight. Secondly, we have shown that mice lacking pancreatic <italic>Hnf4a</italic> have increased insulin concentrations in utero, and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia as newborns.</p>
      <p>The increased birthweight and neonatal hypoglycaemia in <italic>HNF4A-</italic>mutation carriers seems paradoxical for a gene that is associated with a Î²-cellâdeficient form of young-onset diabetes [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], particularly as the decreased Î²-cell function has been explained by decreased expression of pancreatic Î²-cell genes involved in glucose metabolism [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is in contrast to other monogenic causes of diabetesâfor example, <italic>GCK</italic> [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], <italic>IPF1</italic> [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], <italic>HNF1B</italic> [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], or activating <italic>KCNJ11</italic> [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and <italic>ABCC8</italic> mutations [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] where birthweight is reduced. In these cases, the low insulin secretion that causes diabetes later is associated with decreased insulin-mediated foetal growth. In <italic>HNF4A</italic>-mutation carriers, in contrast, there would need to be a switch from increased insulin secretion in utero and neonatal life to decreased insulin secretion in later life. The closest example of this is patients with hyperinsulinaemia of infancy due to recessive and dominant mutations in K<sub>ATP</sub> channel subunits, who have a high rate of diabetes at long-term follow-up even when they do not receive pancreatic surgery [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It has been postulated that diabetes in SUR1-deficient patients reflects increased apoptosis, in addition to abnormal regulation of secretion due to lack of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Compared to SUR1 deficiency, HNF-4Î± deficiency results in less severe hyperinsulinism, yet gives rise to a more highly penetrant and severe diabetic phenotype. It is interesting, however, that of the eight patients who developed established hypoglycaemia at birth, five developed diabetes by the age of 14 y (mean age 12.4 y), suggesting a possible earlier progression to diabetes in this group.</p>
      <p>Two recent studies surprisingly showed that Î²-cell <italic>Hnf4a</italic> deficiency does not cause diabetes in mice [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. One study paradoxically reported mildly reduced blood glucose and increased insulin levels in adult Î²-cell <italic>Hnf4a</italic>-deficient mice, and ascribed this to diminished expression of <italic>Kcnj11</italic> encoding the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel subunit Kir6.2 [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Another study failed to confirm abnormal blood glucose and insulin levels, and reported normal <italic>Kcnj11</italic> expression [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This discrepancy, together with the unexpected failure to develop hypoinsulinaemic diabetes, led us to question whether hyperinsulinaemia was an important feature of <italic>Hnf4a</italic> deficiency. In the current study, we have shown that, in parallel with the human findings, <italic>Hnf4a</italic>âdeficient mice exhibit hyperinsulinaemia in the foetal and neonatal stage, as well as overt neonatal hypoglycaemia as opposed to only mildly reduced glucose at later ages as recently reported [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Importantly, our studies showed no abnormal expression of <italic>Kcnj11</italic>. While discrepancies in phenotype might be explained by small differences in genetic background, the current data suggest that the hyperinsulinaemic phenotype in <italic>Hnf4a</italic> deficiency is not related to K<sub>ATP</sub> channel expression.</p>
      <p>Further studies will need to address how Hnf-4Î±-dependent transcription in Î²-cells is linked to the dual phenotype reported here. Large-scale profiling shows that Hnf-4Î±-deficient Î²-cells exhibit abnormal expression of more than 10% of all islet genes (unpublished observations), many of which need to be examined as plausible candidates for the <italic>HNF4A</italic>-deficient hypersecretory phenotype. It is tempting to hypothesize that the initial defect that causes Î²-cell hypersecretion might eventually lead to Î²-cell exhaustion and diabetes, in analogy to what is observed in some patients with SUR1 mutations as described above [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, the broad transcriptional phenotype of <italic>Hnf4a-</italic>deficient mice offers an alternative potential explanation, whereby one HNF-4Î±-dependent gene-expression defect causes hypersecretion early in life, while a separate gene-expression defect is responsible for the development of severe Î²-cell failure several years after birth.</p>
      <p>The birthweight and incidence of hypoglycaemia in heterozygous <italic>HNF1A</italic>-mutation carriers were not different from their unaffected family members. This finding suggests that foetal insulin secretion is not increased in <italic>HNF1A</italic>-mutation carriers. Previous data had supported a common phenotype of <italic>HNF1A-</italic> and <italic>HNF4A</italic>-mutation carriers, due to a regulatory transcription factor circuit in the Î²-cell with positive feedback on expression between HNF-1Î± and HNF-4Î± [<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040118-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our findings suggest that, at least in foetal life, there are clearly independent functions of these two transcription factors in the foetal Î²-cell. Our data therefore suggest that, in humans, the proposed transcription-factor network is not critically required in foetal development and early post-natal life.</p>

            <p>Serial antenatal scans should be performed in any pregnancy in which the father or mother is a mutation carrier and early induction of labour is considered. This is true when the mother does not have diabetes, but particularly applies when the mother has diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy.</p>

            <p>In families where there is autosomal dominant inheritance of young-onset diabetes with features consistent with a diagnosis of MODY, details of birthweight and neonatal hypoglycaemia should be specifically asked for.</p>
            <p>When macrosomia or neonatal hypoglycaemia (&gt;24 h) is described, <italic>HNF4A</italic> should be sequenced before other genes when performing diagnostic genetic testing.</p>

<italic>HNF4A</italic> should be sequenced in children with neonatal hypoglycaemia, particularly if the hypoglycaemia is relatively mild or transient, or if a family member (parent or grandparent) has young-onset diabetes (&lt;35 y).</p>
            <p>In patients diagnosed as having <italic>HNF4A,</italic> resolution of symptoms should be expected in the first year, but diabetes should be expected to develop in adolescence or in early adulthood and should be screened for annually after the age of 10 y.</p>

            <p>
<italic>HNF4A</italic> should be sequenced as part of an investigation of unexplained macrosomia, particularly when the macrosomia is extreme, is accompanied by hypoglycaemia, or there is a family history of early-onset diabetes.</p>
          </sec>
        </sec>
      </boxed-text>
      <p>To conclude, we have shown that heterozygous <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutations are associated with a 790 g increase in birthweight, on average, and considerable risk of macrosomia. The increased birthweight is probably mediated by increased foetal insulin secretion and, in some cases, is associated with transient neonatal hyperinsulinaemia. Because <italic>HNF4A</italic> deficiency is also known to cause hypoinsulinaemic diabetes, this study shows for the first time that HNF-4Î± has dual opposing roles in the Î²-cell during different periods of life. This study also has important implications for clinical practice (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pmed-0040118-box001">Box 1</xref>). Firstly, pregnancies where a parent is known to have an <italic>HNF4A</italic> mutation should be monitored closely during pregnancy and the immediate post-natal period to minimize complications of macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycaemia. Secondly, neonates with transient or persistent hypoglycaemia and/or macrosomia and a family history of young-onset diabetes should be considered for <italic>HNF4A</italic> molecular genetic testing. Thirdly, since the foetal genotype has a considerable impact on determining birthweight, in addition to maternal factors, paternal factors (including history of diabetes) should be considered when assessing macrosomia risk.</p>
