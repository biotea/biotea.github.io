      <abstract>
        <p>Recently, one of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) family proteins, IFITM3, has become an important target for the activity against influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. In this protein, a post-translational modification by fatty acids covalently attached to cysteine, termed S-palmitoylation, plays a crucial role for the antiviral activity. IFITM3 possesses three cysteine residues for the S-palmitoylation in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain and in the cytoplasmic (CP) loop. Because these cysteines are well conserved in the mammalian IFITM family proteins, the S-palmitoylation on these cysteines is significant for their functions. IFITM5 is another IFITM family protein and interacts with the FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11) to form a higher-order complex in osteoblast cells, which induces the expression of immunologically relevant genes. In this study, we investigated the role played by S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 in its interaction with FKBP11 in the cells, because this interaction is a key process for the gene expression. Our investigations using an established reporter, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA), and an inhibitor for the S-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP), revealed that IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated in addition to IFITM3. Specifically, we found that cysteine residues in the TM1 domain and in the CP loop were S-palmitoylated in IFITM5. Then, we revealed by immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses that the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was inhibited in the presence of 2BP. The mutant lacking the S-palmitoylation site in the TM1 domain lost the interaction with FKBP11. These results indicate that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 promotes the interaction with FKBP11. Finally, we investigated bone nodule formation in osteoblast cells in the presence of 2BP, because IFITM5 was originally identified as a bone formation factor. The experiment resulted in a morphological aberration of the bone nodule. This also indicated that the S-palmitoylation contributes to bone formation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family (also known as the Fragilis family in mice) is a part of the dispanin family [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is composed of double-transmembrane Î±-helices connected by a cytoplasmic (CP) loop and extracellular (EC) amino- and carboxyl-terminal polypeptide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g001">Figure 1-A</xref>). The IFITM proteins are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recent genomic research has revealed that there are 5 IFITM members in humans (IFITM1, 2, 3, 5 and 10) and 7 members in mice (IFITM1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 10). These proteins play roles in diverse biological processes, such as germ cell maturation during gastrulation (IFITM1-3) [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], cell-to-cell adhesion (IFITM1) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], antiviral activity (IFITM1-3) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and bone formation (IFITM5) [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], although the detailed functions of IFITM6, 7, and 10 are unknown at present. In particular, IFITM3 has been a target of intensive studies on its activity against influenza A (H1N1) virus infection and internalization [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>

          <p>A) Amino-acid sequence alignment of IFITM5, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 derived from mice. The conserved residues are highlighted in black. The three conserved cysteines are highlighted in red and numbered based on the sequence of IFITM5 (top) and IFITM3 (bottom). The residues unique in IFITM5 are highlighted in gray. The first and the second transmembrane domains, the extracellular sequences, and the cytoplasmic loop are indicated by arrows and denoted as TM1 and TM2, EC, and the CP loop, respectively. The TM domains were predicted by SOSUI. The aspartates at the C-terminal region in IFITM5 are shown in blue. B) The schematic illustration of the protein S-palmitoylation. The C<sub>16</sub>-palmitic acid is attached to cysteine via a thioester linkage. The palmitoylation and depalmitoylation are catalyzed by protein acyltransferases and acylprotein thioesterases, respectively. In this study, hydroxylamine, NH <sub>2</sub>OH, was used to reduce the thioester linkage. C) The amino acid sequence identity (similarity) among IFITM5, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 is summarized.</p>

      <p>In 2010, Dr. Yount and co-workers reported that the antiviral activity of IFITM3 is dependent on S-palmitoylation on the protein [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The S-palmitoylation [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] is a post-translational modification on proteins by C<sub>16</sub> saturated-fatty acids (palmitic acids) covalently attached to certain cysteine residues via a thioester linkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g001">Figure 1-B</xref>). The modification is reversibly catalyzed by protein acyltransferases and acylprotein thioesterases, and confers unique properties to the protein, such as membrane binding and targeting, immunoreactivity, and protein-protein interaction. The authors revealed that IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on three membrane proximal cysteines, Cys71 and Cys72 in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain, and Cys105 in the CP loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g001">Figure 1-A</xref>) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, IFITM3 lacking the S-palmitoylation is not clustered in the cell membrane and significantly diminishes the antiviral activity. Moreover, the cysteines in IFITM2, Cys70, Cys71, and Cys104 are also palmitoylated in the same manner, which affects the intracellular localization [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A resent study has revealed that murine IFITM1 has four cysteine residues (Cys49, Cys50, Cys83, and Cys103) for the S-palmitoylation, which is required for the antiviral activity and the protein stability [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The other IFITM family members also possess these cysteines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g001">Figure 1-A</xref>), and thus the role of the S-palmitoylation on the cysteines should be significant for the functions of IFITM proteins.</p>
      <p>Here, we focused on IFITM5, which is also known as bone-restricted IFITM-like (BRIL) protein [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Among the IFITM family proteins, IFITM5 is unique. (i) <italic>Expression of IFITM5</italic>: Unlike the other IFITM family proteins, the expression of IFITM5 is not induced by interferons because the region upstream of the <italic>ifitm5</italic> gene lacks the interferon regulatory elements [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, the expression of IFITM5 is mostly restricted to osteoblast cells [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], while the other IFITM proteins are expressed ubiquitously (<italic>ii</italic>). <italic>Amino-acid sequence similarity</italic>: The amino acid sequence of IFITM5 is relatively dissimilar to IFITM1-3 proteins (~ 65% similarity), while IFITM1-3 proteins share ~ 85% similarity with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g001">Figure 1-C</xref>). In addition, IFITM5 has an aspartate-rich domain in the C-terminal region, which could be involved in calcium binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g001">Figure 1-A</xref>) [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. (iii) <italic>Role of IFITM5 in bone formation</italic>: The expression of IFITM5 is associated with mineralization during the bone formation process in osteoblast cells [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Previous studies have confirmed the expression of IFITM5 in bone tissues in mice, rats, humans and tammar wallabies [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The <italic>ifitm5</italic>-gene knockout mice have smaller bones [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, the knockdown of the <italic>ifitm5</italic> gene by small hairpin RNA induces a decrease in bone nodule formation, whereas overexpression of the gene in UMR106 cells has been shown to increase calcium uptake and bone nodule formation [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. (iv) <italic>Role of IFITM5 for immune activity</italic>: Recent studies have revealed that IFITM5 interacts with the FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11) to form IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-the prostaglandin F2 receptor negative regulator (FPRP) complex [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. When the complex is formed, the expressions of 5 interferon-induced genes are induced, including bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (<italic>Bst2</italic>), interferon inducible protein 1 (<italic>Irgm</italic>), interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (<italic>Ifit3</italic>), b(2)-microglobulin (<italic>B2m</italic>), and MHC class I antigen gene. Consequently, these results indicate that IFITM5 is involved not only in the bone formation but also in the immune system activity.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigated the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 and its role in the interaction with FKBP11 in mouse osteoblast cells. Cells transfected by a plasmid DNA encoding mouse IFITM5 were grown in the presence of an established chemical reporter, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], or an inhibitor for the S-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP) [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The biochemical assays using these compounds revealed that the wild-type IFITM5 is S-palmitoylated. To identify the S-palmitoylation site in IFITM5, we prepared cysteine-substituted mutants, IFITM5-C86A, -C52A/C53A, and -C52A/53A/86A (Cys-less). The chemical reporter assay suggested that at least two out of three cysteines in IFITM5 are S-palmitoylated. The interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was examined by immunoprecipitation assay, resulting in the loss of the interaction in the presence of 2BP. The same result was obtained in the two mutants, C52A/C53A and Cys-less. These results suggested that the S-palmitoylation on Cys52 and/or Cys53 in the TM1 domain of IFITM5 is necessary for the interaction with FKBP11. On the other hand, Cys86 in the CP loop of IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated but not involved in the interaction. Because this interaction is important for the immunologically relevant gene expression, it was indicated that the role of the S-palmitoylation is to promote the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 and to regulate the immune activity in the osteoblast cells. The possible interaction mechanism and the effect of the S-palmitoylation on the bone nodule formation will be discussed.</p>

        <title>1. Recombinant DNA construction</title>
        <p>For mammalian cell expression, plasmid vectors of wild-type IFITM5 (IFITM5-WT) and FLAG-fused FKBP11 (FKBP11-FLAG) were constructed by inserting the cloned genes into a pBApo-CMV Neo expression vector (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The details of the recombinant DNA constructs were the same as described previously [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The genes of IFITM5 mutants (IFITM5-C86A, -C52A/53A, and -C52A/C53A/C86A (Cys-less)) were prepared using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid vectors of FLAG-fused IFITM5-WT, -C52A/53A, and Cys-less were constructed by inserting the cloned genes into the pBApo-CMV Neo expression vector. For <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content></italic> cell expression, the plasmid vector of IFITM5-WT was constructed by inserting the cloned gene into a pET22b (Novagen, Madison, WI) expression vector.

        <title>1. Identification of S-palmitoylation on IFITM5</title>
        <p>To identify the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5, the osteoblast cells harboring the plasmid DNA encoding IFITM5-WT were cultured in the absence and presence of 2BP, which inhibits the S-palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g002">Figure 2-A</xref>) [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Then, the cell lysate containing total protein was extracted for use in the SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses. For purposes of comparison, <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content></italic> cells were also cultured in the absence of 2BP and the cell lysate was extracted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g002">Figure 2-B</xref> shows the results of the western blot assay for IFITM5-WT expressed in the osteoblast and the <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content></italic> cells. In the osteoblast cells, IFITM5-WT exhibited a single band near the 17.4 kDa molecular-mass marker (see lane 1) in the absence of 2BP. However, in the presence of 2BP (see lane 4), the band appeared at a lower position than that in the absence of 2BP (lane 1). These results suggested that IFITM5-WT has high and low molecular-mass forms in the absence and presence of 2BP, respectively. The S-palmitoylation is a reversible reaction, and therefore is depalmitoylated by a strong reductant such as hydroxylamine [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Following hydroxylamine treatment (see lane 2), the band appeared at the same position as in the presence of 2BP (lane 4). In prokaryote <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content></italic> cells, the post-translational modification does not occur. Hence, the band was also observed at the same lower position (see lane 3). In the case of IFITM3, the palmitoylation was also reported to induce a change in mobility on electrophoresis, just as in our present results [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>

        <p>For direct observation of the S-palmitoylation, an established chemical reporter, 17-ODYA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g002">Figure 2-C</xref>), was used. The osteoblast cells harboring the plasmid encoding IFITM5-WT were cultured in the presence of 17-ODYA to label the protein metabolically. Following the extraction and the purification of the cell lysate, the labeled IFITM5-WT was ligated with TAMRA-azide according to the Cu(I)-catalyzed [3+2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition method [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An in-gel fluorescence image of the 17-ODYA-TAMRA-labeled IFITM5-WT (see lane 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g002">Figure 2-D</xref>) showed that IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated in the osteoblast cells. The FLAG-tag attached to IFITM5 has no influence on the modification and chemical labeling (lanes 1 and 5). In addition, after the hydroxylamine treatment (see lane 6), the fluorescence became weak because of the dissociation of 17-ODYA from IFITM5, which was the same mechanism as the dissociation of the palmitic acid from IFITM5 by reduction as described above (lane 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g002">Figure 2-B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Therefore, we concluded that the IFITM5 expressed in the native osteoblast cells is S-palmitoylated. In addition, the bands corresponding to the high and the low molecular-mass forms shown in western blot analysis were tentatively assigned to the S-palmitoylated and the depalmitoylated forms, respectively.</p>

        <title>2. S-palmitoylation site of IFITM5</title>
        <p>As described above in the <italic>Introduction</italic>, cysteine residues are the substrate for S-palmitoylation. IFITM5 possesses three cysteines, Cys52 and Cys53 in the TM1 domain, and Cys86 in the CP loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g001">Figure 1-A</xref>). All of these cysteines are highly conserved among the mammalian IFITM family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g003">Figure 3-A</xref>). To identify the modification site in IFITM5, we prepared cysteine-substituted mutants, IFITM5-C52A/C53A, -C86A, and -C52A/C53A/C86A (Cys-less). The osteoblast cells harboring each plasmid were cultured in the absence of 2BP, and then the cell lysate was extracted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g003">Figure 3-B</xref> shows the results of the western blot detecting the expression of all the mutants in the osteoblast cells. In the C52A/C53A and Cys-less mutants (see lanes 2 and 4), the low molecular-mass form was detected. This result indicates that either Cys52 or Cys53 is involved in the S-palmitoylation. In addition, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g002">Figure 2-D</xref>, strong and weak fluorescence were detected in the C52A/C53A mutant in the absence and presence of hydroxylamine (lanes 3 and 7), respectively, but not in the Cys-less mutant (lanes 4 and 8). These results suggested that the rest of the cysteine in the C52A/C53A mutant, Cys86, is S-palmitoylated and the Cys-less mutant completely lost the S-palmitoylation because all the cysteines were substituted. Therefore, we concluded that Cys86, plus one or two other cysteine residues in IFITM5, i.e., Cys52 and/or Cys53, are S-palmitoylated. In addition, it was found that the S-palmitoylation on the TM1 domain has a major effect on the mobility in the gel (lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g002">Figure 2-D and Figure 3-B</xref>). Therefore, we hereafter refer to the high and low molecular-mass forms as the TM1-palmitoylated and the TM1-depalmitoylated forms, respectively. Finally, we reassigned the bands shown in the western blot analysis as follows: IFITM5-WT is fully palmitoylated, the C86A mutant is partially palmitoylated at Cys52 and/or Cys53, the C52A/C53A mutant is partially palmitoylated at Cys86, and the Cys-less mutant is completely depalmitoylated.</p>

        <title>3. Role of S-palmitoylation for the IFITM5-FKBP11 interaction</title>
        <p>Previous studies have revealed that IFITM5 interacts with FKBP11 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. FKBP11 belongs to the FK506-binding protein family and has a transmembrane domain. The interaction between IFITM5 and FKBP11 is important for the immune activity because formation of the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex induces the expression of interferon-induced genesânamely, the <italic>Bst2</italic>, <italic>Irgm</italic>, <italic>Ifit3</italic>, <italic>B2m</italic>, and MHC class I antigen gene [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To investigate the effect of the S-palmitoylation on the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11, we carried out an immunoprecipitation assay. The osteoblast cells co-transfected by the plasmids encoding IFITM5-WT and FKBP11-FLAG were cultured in the absence and the presence of 2BP. Then, the extracted cell-lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG agarose gel. The gel was washed several times. Finally, the proteins were competitively eluted by the addition of FLAG peptide. If IFITM5 interacted with FKBP11, it was expected that IFITM5 would be obtained during this step and detected by immunoblotting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g004">Figure 4-A</xref> shows the results of the western blot for the co-immunoprecipitation of IFITM5-WT with FKBP-FLAG. The band corresponding to FKBP11 appeared in all the lanes (upper panel). Lanes 1 and 2 are controls to ensure that IFITM5 and FKBP11 are both contained in the cell lysate before the immunoprecipitation. The controls also ensured that IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated in the absence of 2BP (see lane 1), whereas IFITM5 was not S-palmitoylated in the presence of 2BP (see lane 2). After the immunoprecipitation, a single band corresponding to the S-palmitoylated IFITM5 appeared in the absence of 2BP (see lane 3), indicating the interaction of the S-palmitoylated IFITM5 with FKBP11. However, in the presence of 2BP, no band corresponding to IFITM5 appeared (see lane 4), indicating that the two molecules do not interact with each other. These results suggest that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 contributes to the interaction with FKBP11.</p>

        <p>Next, we further investigated the relationship between the S-palmitoylation and the interaction with FKBP11 by using the IFITM5 mutants described above. The osteoblast cells co-transfected by the plasmids encoding IFITM5 mutants (C52A/C53A, C86A, and Cys-less) and FKBP11-FLAG were cultured. The immunoprecipitation assay was carried out in the same way as described above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g004">Figure 4-B</xref> shows the results of the western blot for the co-immunoprecipitation of the wild-type and the IFITM5 mutants with FKBP11. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g004">Figure 4-C</xref> shows the results of the control experiment using the cell lysate before the immunoprecipitation. As described in the previous section <italic>3-3</italic>, the band corresponding to FKBP11 appeared in all the lanes (upper panels) because the immunoprecipitation was carried out using the anti-FLAG agarose gel. In the lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g004">Figure 4-B</xref>, single bands were observed for the IFITM5-WT and -C86A mutant (lanes 1 and 3) but not for the -C52A/C53A and Cys-less mutants (lanes 2 and 4). This result indicates that the wild-type and the C86A mutant interact with FKBP11, whereas the other two mutants do not. Interestingly, this tendency mirrored the trend for the S-palmitoylation profiles, which means that Cys52 and/or Cys53 in the TM1 domain of the IFITM5-WT and -C86A mutants is S-palmitoylated, whereas these residues are not S-palmitoylated in the C52A/C53A and Cys-less mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g002">Figures 2-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g003">3-B</xref> and the lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g004">Figure 4-C</xref>). Because the S-palmitoylation contributes to the IFITM5-FKBP11 interaction, as described in the previous section <italic>3-3</italic> (also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g004">Figure 4-A</xref>), the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g004">Figure 4-B</xref> suggest that the mutants which lost the S-palmitoylation site(s), Cys52 and/or Cys53, are not able to interact with FKBP11. In other words, the S-palmitoylation on these cysteines is necessary for the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11.</p>

Therefore, our observations in this study suggested that the S-palmitoylation affects the bone nodule formation in the osteoblast cells.</p>

        <title>1. Comparison of IFITM5 with IFITM3 and IFITM2</title>
        <p>In this study, we confirmed the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 in the osteoblast cells, which was the same as that previously reported for IFITM3 and IFITM2. As reported previously, in IFITM3 and IFITM2, which share 85% sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g001">Figure 1-C</xref>), two cysteines in the TM1 domain (Cys71 and Cys72 for IFITM3, Cys70 and Cys71 for IFITM2) and one cysteine in the CP loop (Cys105 for IFITM3, Cys104 for IFITM2) are all S-palmitoylated in cells [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. On the other hand, although IFITM5 shares 68% and 66% sequence similarity to IFITM3 and IFITM2, respectively, more than one cysteine in the TM1 domain (Cys52 or Cys53) and one cysteine in the CP loop (Cys86) are S-palmitoylated. Taking into account the high conservation of three cysteines in the IFITM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g001">Figures 1-A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g003">3-A</xref>), all the cysteines in IFITM5 may be involved in the S-palmitoylation just as in the case of IFITM3 and IFITM2 [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
        <p>The roles of the S-palmitoylation on IFITM3 have been studied intensively, and the S-palmitoylation has been shown to be crucial for the correct positioning in the membrane and the resistance to viral infection and internalization [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (the roles are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g006">Figure 6-A</xref> and discussed in detail below). A recent study has revealed that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM2 is also important for the protein clustering in the membrane [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, we do not know the role of the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 for the clustering in the membrane at present because we have not yet succeeded in obtaining a proper antibody for immunohistochemistry, despite our allocating much time to the search and considering a considerable number of antibodies.</p>

            <title>Possible functional mechanisms of IFITM3 and IFITM5 in cells.</title>
            <p>A) The functional mechanism of IFITM3 is summarized from previous studies. (i) IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated at Cys71, Cys72, and Cys105, (ii) which induces clustering and correct positioning in the membrane, (iii) resulting in the antiviral activity against influenza virus. B) The functional mechanism of IFITM5 is summarized by combining the results from the present and the previous studies. (i) Cys86, plus one or two other cysteine residues in IFITM5, i.e., Cys52 and/or Cys53, are S-palmitoylated (ii). The S-palmitoylation allows IFITM5 to interact with FKBP11 in the osteoblast cells (iii). The dissociation of CD9 from the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex is induced by formation of the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex and leads to the immunologically relevant gene expression. IFITM5 also contributes to the bone formation, but it is unknown which states as described in (i)-(iii) are important for the bone formation at present.At present, no interactive protein has been identified in IFITM3 and IFITM2. On the other hand, IFITM5 interacts with the partner protein, FKBP11, and the S-palmitoylation clearly makes a significant contribution to the interaction. Therefore, IFITM5 forms a hetero-oligomer in the cell membrane for its physiological function.</p>

        <title>2. Role of S-palmitoylation in the IFITM5-FKBP11 interaction</title>
        <p>Dr. Hanagata and co-workers previously reported that IFITM5 lacking the TM1 domain and the CP loop, which contain the relevant modification sites, lost the ability to interact with FKBP11 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the present study, we determined that the S-palmitoylation on Cys52 and/or Cys53 in the TM1 domain is necessary for the interaction. From these results, we speculate that Cys52 and Cys53 face toward the interaction surface with FKBP11, and therefore IFITM5 and FKBP11 interact with each other through the palmitic acid(s) attached to the cysteine(s) (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g006">Figure 6-B</xref>, discussed in detail later). Our investigation revealed that Cys86 is involved in the S-palmitoylation but does not contribute to the interaction with FKBP11. We speculate that some other residues in the CP loop located near the TM1 domain make some contribution to the interaction.</p>
        <p>Previous investigations also revealed that IFITM5 expressed in the heterologous fibroblast NIH3T3 cells exhibited direct interactions with CD81, the B cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BCAP31), and the hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 7 (HSD17b7). These three proteins bind to the IFITM5 without the S-palmitoylation (low molecular-mass form; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g003">Figure 3-b</xref> in ref [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g001">Figure 1-B</xref> in ref [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].). In the fibroblast cells, the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 is insufficient [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These interactions are not observed in the native osteoblast cells, and therefore are nonspecific. Taking these facts into consideration, we speculate that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 promotes the specific interaction with FKBP11 in the osteoblast cells.</p>

        <title>3. Role of S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 for the osteoblast cell activity</title>
        <p>The role played by the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 in immune activity of the osteoblast cells will be discussed by combining the results from the present and the previous studies. A specific interaction between IFITM5 and FKBP11 should be necessary to form the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81- FPRP complex. CD81, also known as TAPA-1, is a member of the tetraspanin membrane protein family and a component of the B-cell co-receptor complex which mediates the B-cell signaling for immune responses. When forming this complex, CD9, a partner protein with CD81, dissociates from the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex and consequently induces the osteoblast-specific expression of the interferon-induced genes, <italic>Bst2</italic>, <italic>Irgm</italic>, <italic>Ifit3</italic>, <italic>B2m</italic>, and the MHC class I antigen gene [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. If the S-palmitoylation-mediated specific interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 were lost, the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81- FPRP complex would not be formed, and consequently the interferon-induced gene expression would be inhibited because CD9 would remain associated with the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex. In this respect, we speculate that IFITM5 is involved in the immune system activity in the osteoblast cells and the interaction of the S-palmitoylated IFITM5 with FKBP11 regulates the immune activity.</p>
        <p>In addition, it was suggested that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 contributes to the bone nodule formation, including morphology and time for mineralization, in the osteoblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g005">Figure 5</xref>). It is difficult to conclude at present that the lack of the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 causes the diffusion of the bone nodules (panel b of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g005">Figure 5-E</xref>); we can say, however, that IFITM5 will probably not be S-palmitoylated in the cells in the presence of 2BP. While 2BP is commonly used as an inhibitor of palmitoylation, it also targets many metabolic enzymes [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, it is also difficult to interpret the results of the long-term incubation of the osteoblast cells in the presence of 2BP. In any case, these are interesting and key observations in terms of clarifying the role played by the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 in bone formation, and further studies are required.</p>

        <title>4. Possible mechanism of the IFITM5-FKBP11 interaction and the cellular function</title>
        <p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g006">Figure 6</xref> describes a possible mechanism of the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 and the role of IFITM5 in the osteoblast cell function by means of a comparison with IFITM3. In the case of IFITM3, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g006">Figure 6-A</xref>, the following are observed. (i) The three cysteines are all S-palmitoylated (ii). The S-palmitoylation leads to the clustering and the correct positioning of IFITM3 molecules in the membrane (iii). The S-palmitoylation and the following clustering are crucial for the resistance to the influenza virus. When IFITM3 lacks the S-palmitoylation, the IFITM3 molecules do not cluster, which leads to the significant decrease in the antiviral activity.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g006">Figure 6-B</xref> shows that the following observations are made in the case of IFITM5. (i) Cys86, plus one or two other cysteine residues in IFITM5, i.e., Cys52 and/or Cys53, are S-palmitoylated (ii). The S-palmitoylated IFITM5 is able to interact specifically with FKBP11. The interaction is presumed to be mediated by the palmitic acid(s) attached to the cysteine(s) facing toward the interaction surface on FKBP11. Cys86 is involved in the S-palmitoylation but not in the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11. At present, however, little is known about the role of the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 for the localization in the membrane. When the S-palmitoylation affects the localization of IFITM5 as in the case of IFITM3 [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the S-palmitoylated IFITM5 molecules should be localized in the membrane or the depalmitoylated molecules should be delocalized. The loss of the interaction between IFITM5 and FKBP11 could be due to a relocalization of the depalmitoylated IFITM5 that prevents its association with FKBP11 (iii). The S-palmitoylated IFITM5 interacts with the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex through FKBP11, which induces the dissociation of CD9 from the complex and the expression of 5 immunologically relevant genes. Finally, IFITM5 forms the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex. It is unknown at present which of the three states (i)~(iii) illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075831-g006">Figure 6-B</xref> is important for the bone mineralization of the osteoblast cells. The lack of the S-palmitoylation influences the interaction with FKBP11, which could account for the following complex formation and gene expression. In addition, the bone nodule formation is also affected. Note that the role of the S-palmitoylation has been involved in the bone formation [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is indicated that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 plays roles not only for the regulation of the immune activity but also for the bone formation.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we have revealed the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 and its role in the interaction with FKBP11. Not only the immune activity but also the bone mineralization in the osteoblast cells is affected by the S-palmitoylation. In general, the functional role of the S-palmitoylation is different for each protein [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For many proteins, the palmitoylation and depalmitoylation cycle is constitutive and regulated by enzymes. Based on the present results, it is difficult to address (i) whether the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 is constitutive or regulated, or (ii) when and where IFITM5 is S-palmitoylated in the osteoblast cells. Further studies are required and are currently underway.</p>
