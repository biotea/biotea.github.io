      <abstract>
        <p>Unrepaired DNA damage may arrest ongoing replication forks, potentially resulting in fork
collapse, increased mutagenesis and genomic instability. Replication through DNA lesions
depends on mono- and polyubiquitylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),
which enable translesion synthesis (TLS) and template switching, respectively. A proper
replication fork rescue is ensured by the dynamic ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of
PCNA; however, as yet, little is known about its regulation. Here, we show that human
Spartan/C1orf124 protein provides a higher cellular level of ubiquitylated-PCNA by which
it regulates the choice of DNA damage tolerance pathways. We find that Spartan is
recruited to sites of replication stress, a process that depends on its PCNA- and
ubiquitin-interacting domains and the RAD18 PCNA ubiquitin ligase. Preferential
association of Spartan with ubiquitin-modified PCNA protects against PCNA deubiquitylation
by ubiquitin-specific protease 1 and facilitates the access of a TLS polymerase to the
replication fork. In concert, depletion of Spartan leads to increased sensitivity to DNA
damaging agents and causes elevated levels of sister chromatid exchanges. We propose that
Spartan promotes genomic stability by regulating the choice of rescue of stalled
replication fork, whose mechanism includes its interaction with ubiquitin-conjugated PCNA
and protection against PCNA deubiquitylation.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The genome is constantly under assault from chemical agents and radiation, which is
especially deleterious in S-phase, when replication forks may stall upon encountering
unrepaired DNA lesions leading to double-strand break formation and DNA rearrangements
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B2">2</xref>). The rescue of stalled replication forks is governed by the Rad6âRad18
ubiquitin ligase complex-dependent monoubiquitylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA), the DNA polymerase processivity factor, that facilitates translesion synthesis (TLS)
providing direct nucleotide incorporation opposite DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B3 gks850-B4 gks850-B5 gks850-B6">3â6</xref>). In addition,
monoubiquitylated PCNA can be polyubiquitylated by K63 ubiquitin linkage leading to template
switching, in which copying from the undamaged newly synthesized sister strand can lead to
error-free DNA damage bypass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B7 gks850-B8 gks850-B9 gks850-B10 gks850-B11 gks850-B12 gks850-B13">7â13</xref>). In the absence of PCNA ubiquitylation, recombination using the sister
chromatid can facilitate an alternative means for fork rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B14 gks850-B15 gks850-B16 gks850-B17 gks850-B18">14â18</xref>). However,
it has been suggested that reviving replication forks by recombination is disadvantageous
for cells, probably because it can lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements. To keep
recombination under control, SUMO modification of PCNA plays an important role by recruiting
the Rad51 displacing helicase and channeling fork rescue to the Rad6âRad18-dependent
damage tolerance pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B19 gks850-B20 gks850-B21 gks850-B22">19â22</xref>).</p><p>Although the operation of the Rad6âRad18-dependent damage bypass pathway is
considered sufficient to suppress gross chromosomal rearrangements, untimely DNA synthesis
by low-fidelity TLS polymerases could also lead to genome instability by increasing the rate
of point mutations. Recent studies have indicated that for providing timely and only limited
access of a TLS polymerase to the 3â²-primer-end PCNA ubiquitylation and
deubiquitylation might play equally important role. Although PCNA ubiquitylation promotes
the access of a TLS polymerase to the replication fork, PCNA deubiquitylation can initiate
the displacement of a TLS polymerase and provide the restoration of the normal DNA synthesis
by the high-fidelity polymerase after replication through the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B23 gks850-B24 gks850-B25 gks850-B26 gks850-B27">23â27</xref>).
Moreover, PCNA deubiquitylation can inhibit the untimely access of low-fidelity TLS
polymerases and other players to the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B28">28</xref>).</p><p>One level of the control of the lifetime of ubiquitylated-PCNA is provided by
ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) existing in complex with the USP1-associated factor 1
(UAF1) stimulatory subunit, which can deubiquitylate PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B29 gks850-B30 gks850-B31">29â31</xref>). USP1-dependent PCNA deubiquitylation is regulated, on one hand, by
UV irradiation-dependent inactivation of USP1 through an autocleavage event and, on the
other hand, by the PCNA-interacting ELG1 protein that is essential for recruiting USP1-UAF1
to the stalled fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B32">32</xref>). However, understanding the regulation of the dynamism of PCNA
ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation and its consequences on protein recruitments to the
stalled replication fork and on the choice of DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways are still
in a rudimentary stage.</p><p>Recently, Spartan/C1orf124 has been identified in parallel with our study and shown to be a
reader of PCNA ubiquitylation and a regulator of UV-induced DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B33">33</xref>). However, no experimental insight into how
Spartan affects the cellular level of ubiquitin-PCNA has been provided, and its influence on
alternative DDT pathways remained unclear.</p><p>We now report the further characterization of human Spartan/C1orf124 and provide evidence
for its regulatory role in DDT. Notably, we suggest that by preferential binding to
ubiquitylated PCNA, Spartan protects against PCNA deubiquitylation by USP1 and facilitates
the access of a TLS polymerase to the replication fork. We discuss the possibility that
Spartan promotes genomic stability by preventing recombination and channeling fork rescue to
PCNA ubiquitylation-dependent pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Generating Spartan DNA constructs</title><p><italic>SPARTAN</italic> (C1orf124) clone was purchased from <italic>ImaGenes</italic>
(cat.: DKFZp547N043Q), and we renamed it as pIL1767. Spartan cDNA was sequence verified

belongs to the RAD18 family of zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F1">Figure

reasons. First, all the examined proteins containing its type of UBZ domain such as RAD18,
Mgs1 and FAN1 play a role in DDT. Another hint was the presence of a highly conserved PCNA
interacting protein motif (PIP) in Spartan beside a SprT domain found in the bacterial
SprT, a metallopeptidase-like protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F1">Figure

types harboring undiscovered genes whose copy number variations may be cancer-causing,
that Spartan is significantly deleted across a data set of 3131 different tumors analyzed,
suggesting a possible role of Spartan in cancer suppression. We therefore decided to test
whether Spartan is involved in DNA damage response. <fig id="gks850-F1" position="float"><label>Figure

localized to sites of DNA damage along with Î³-H2AX, a marker of DNA damage sites. We
also tested the UBZ-domain mutant of Spartan and found that it completely failed to
localize to microirradiation tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F1">Figure

association with an ubiquitylated protein at DNA damage sites.</p><p>We next asked whether Spartan localizes to the sites of ongoing DNA synthesis. During DNA
replication, PCNA accumulates in focal structures indicative of sites of DNA synthesis,
which can also be visualized by immunostaining for BrdU after BrdU incorporation into
newly replicated DNA facilitated by pulse labeling. Transient, high level expression of
FLAG-Spartan or GFP-Spartan resulted in nearly complete colocalization of Spartan with
PCNA and BrdU even in non-damaged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F1">Figure

FLAG-Spartan, we found that Spartan was distributed uniformly in the nucleus, and its
redistribution to PCNA-containing foci required treatment with agents that can induce
replication stalling such as UV radiation or MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F1">Figure 1</xref>D and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks850/DC1">Supplementary

localization properties of WT Spartan, the Spartan proteins of the UBZ and PIP domain

The localization of Spartan depends on Rad18. Knock out HCT116 RAD18-/- and

Rad18, an ubiquitin ligase responsible for damage-induced PCNA monoubiquitylation, was
required for foci formation of Spartan. Thus, we compared the localization of GFP-Spartan
in RAD18 proficient and deficient cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F2">Figure
2</xref>B). Supporting the importance of PCNA ubiquitylation, in RAD18-/- knock out
cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B38">38</xref>), Spartan completely failed to
form foci when compared with its proficient foci formation in RAD18+/+ cells;
however, expression of DsRed-Rad18 in RAD18-/- cells restored Spartan foci formation and,
notably, revealed complete colocalization of Spartan with Rad18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Moreover, transient depletion of RAD18 by siRNA in
another human cell line also led to impaired Spartan foci formation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks850/DC1">Supplementary
Figure S2A</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks850/DC1">S2B</ext-link>).
In line with these finding, Spartan can be coimmunoprecipitated with Rad18 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks850/DC1">Supplementary

of Spartan with ubiquitylated PCNA, we found that Spartan can also be coimmunoprecipitated
with ubiquitylated PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F2">Figure 2</xref>C).
Furthermore, when we depleted USP1, which has been shown to increase endogenous
ubiquitin-conjugated PCNA species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B24">24</xref>), an
increased level of ubiquitylated PCNA could be pulled down by Spartan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F2">Figure 2</xref>C). These results together suggested that
Spartan is recruited to stalled forks by ubiquitin-conjugated PCNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Purified Spartan directly and preferentially binds to ubiquitin-conjugated
PCNA</title><p>To explore whether Spartan can directly associate with ubiquitin-conjugated PCNA, we used
purified WT, UBZ-, PIP- and PIP-UBZ double mutant Spartan proteins along with purified
ubiquitin, PCNA and <italic>in vitro</italic> mono- and polyubiquitylated PCNA in
pull-down assays using less stringent salt concentration (85 mM NaCl) to reveal also
weaker interactions and higher, close to physiological salt concentration (150 mM NaCl).
First, Spartan was incubated with GST-tagged ubiquitin bound to glutathione beads. As
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F3">Figure 3</xref>A, WT Spartan strongly
associated with ubiquitin, whereas the UBZ mutant Spartan failed to bind ubiquitin;
however, the PIP mutant Spartan was proficient in ubiquitin binding. Next, PCNA was
incubated with GST-FLAG-tagged Spartan bound to glutathione beads, which revealed that
Spartan can directly bind to PCNA and that mutation in the PIP-box but not in the UBZ
domain of Spartan impaired their association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F3">Figure
3</xref>B). In a similar assay at 85 mM NaCl concentration, we found that Spartan
strongly associated with monoubiquitin-PCNA, and only the PIP-UBZ double mutant Spartan
but not the single UBZ or PIP mutant failed completely in this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F3">Figure 3</xref>C). However, at 150 mM NaCl, neither the
PIP nor the UBZ mutant Spartan could interact with monoubiquitin-PCNA, which is consistent
with our localization studies indicating that both the PIP box and the UBZ domain in
Spartan are essential for Spartan colocalization with PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F3">Figure 3</xref>C, right panel). Essentially the same result was obtained
using polyubiquitin PCNA instead of monoubiquitin-PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Finally, to compare the binding affinity of Spartan
to unmodified and ubiquitin-conjugated PCNA, we mixed equal amounts of unmodified PCNA,
monoubiquitin-PCNA and polyubiquitin-PCNA and incubated this mixture with GST-FLAG-Spartan
bound to gluthatione beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F3">Figure 3</xref>E).
Notably, Spartan preferably pulled down mono- and polyubiquitylated PCNA over unmodified
PCNA, and the PIP-UBZ double mutant Spartan completely failed to pull down
ubiquitin-conjugated PCNA and unmodified PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F3">Figure

cooperatively ensure a strong preferable binding to ubiquitin-modified PCNA. <fig id="gks850-F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Purified Spartan preferentially binds

sensitizes cells to DNA damage, and if so, whether the UBZ and PIP domains of Spartan are
crucial for conferring damage resistance. To this end, we knocked down Spartan with three
different siRNAs targeting different regions of Spartan mRNA and subjected these cells to
treatment with DNA-damaging agents. When compared with the control siRNA-treated cells,
the Spartan-depleted cells were hypersensitive to UV-irradiation and the methylating agent
MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F4">Figure 4</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks850/DC1">Supplementary

sensitivity to UV could be complemented with a shRNA-resistant WT Spartan, which rules out
the off-targeting of shRNA toward an unrelated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F4">Figure 4</xref>B). In contrast, shRNA-resistant UBZ- or PIP-domain
mutant Spartan could not complement the impaired UV resistance of these stable
Spartan-depleted cells, indicating that the ubiquitin and PCNA binding of Spartan is
indispensable for Spartan function in providing protection against genotoxic agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F4">Figure 4</xref>B). <fig id="gks850-F4" position="float"><label>Figure

PCNA into account, we asked whether Spartan could also have a similar channeling function.
Recombination between sister chromatids can result either in crossover events, which can
be visualized on metaphase chromosomes as SCEs, or in non-crossover events. As impairment
in RAD18 can increase even spontaneous SCEs formed presumably at endogenous lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B45">45</xref>), we tested the effect of Spartan depletion
on spontaneous SCE. To this end, control and stable Spartan-depleted cells were tested by

exchanges between sister chromatids on isolated mitotic chromosomes by orange acridine
staining, which distinguishes DNA strands with and without incorporated BrdU. As shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D, stable Spartan depletion
led to a 2.5-fold increase in the number of SCEs. To further verify, we expressed
shRNA-resistant Spartan in stable Spartan-depleted cells and found complementation of SCEs
formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F4">Figure 4</xref>D). We conclude that
Spartan prevents the formation of crossover events between sister chromatids.</p></sec><sec><title>Spartan facilitates the recruitment of PolÎ· to replication foci</title><p>To provide evidence that Spartan can indeed channel fork rescue to damage bypass, we
examined whether the access of a chosen TLS polymerase to replication forks can be
affected by an increased Spartan expression level. PolÎ· has been shown to be
distributed uniformly throughout the nucleus, from which it can be extracted by a mild
washing with a non-ionic detergent; however, upon UV irradiation, PolÎ· colocalizes
with monoubiquitylated PCNA in replication foci and becomes resistant to non-ionic
detergent extraction. First, we examined whether transient expression of GFP-Spartan in
FLAG-PolÎ·-expressing stable HeLa cells affects localization of PolÎ· to replication
foci. Notably, we found that transient expression of Spartan highly increased PolÎ·
foci formation and also eliminated the requirement of UV-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F4">Figure 4</xref>E and F and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks850/DC1">Supplementary

domains of Spartan, emphasizing the importance of its ubiquitin-PCNA binding and ruling
out that this observation is indirect, for example, due to inducing DNA damage by
transient overexpression of Spartan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F4">Figure 4</xref>F

of ubiquitin-conjugated PCNA, which can be carried out by expressing the
PCNA-deubiquitylating enzyme USP1 as described. As expected, transient expression of USP1
resulted in decreased PolÎ· foci formation, but strikingly, this was suppressed by
Spartan expression, because expression of USP1 together with Spartan resulted in an
increased number of PolÎ· foci that was comparable to the foci number observed during
expression of Spartan alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F4">Figure 4</xref>G). Thus,
Spartan and USP1 have opposing functions in providing access of PolÎ· to replication
forks. To explain this finding, one possibility was that Spartan stimulates PCNA
ubiquitylation; however, we considered this unlikely because Spartan recruitment required
preexisting ubiquitin-conjugated PCNA. The other more likely possibility is that Spartan
and USP1 can compete for the access to ubiquitylated-PCNA and that Spartan is an
antagonist of USP1-dependent PCNA deubiquitylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Spartan inhibits the USP1-dependent deubiquitylation of ubiquitin-conjugated
PCNA</title><p>To test whether Spartan inhibits USP1-dependent PCNA deubiquitylation, first we examined
the consequences of Spartan and USP1 knockdown and of their overexpression on the level of
monoubiquitin-PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). USP1
knockdown, as expected, led to a higher monoubiquitin-PCNA level, whereas Spartan
knockdown resulted in a much lower cellular concentration of monoubiquitin-PCNA, which
indicates that Spartan and USP1 have opposite influence on the level of
monoubiquitin-PCNA. Importantly, however, combining Spartan knockdown with USP1 knockdown
reversed the reduction of PCNA monoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Furthermore, although USP1 overexpression decreased the amount of
monoubiquitin-PCNA, its effect was suppressed by simultaneous overexpression of Spartan
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F5">Figure 5</xref>B). These results are consistent

USP1-UAF1 (50 nM) in the absence or presence of WT, UBZ, PIP or PIP-UBZ mutant
Spartan proteins (150 nM). The reaction products were analyzed for deubiquitylation
of monoubiquitin-PCNA by western-blotting using anti-PCNA antibody. (<bold>F</bold>)
The UBZ and PIP domains of Spartan are essential for inhibition of
USP1-UAF1-dependent deubiquitylation of polyubiquitin-PCNA. Analysis was carried out
as in (C) but using purified polyubiquitin-PCNA substrate instead of
monoubiquitin-PCNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gks850f5p"/></fig></p><p>To examine directly whether Spartan can protect ubiquitin-PCNA against deubiquitylation
by USP1, we carried out a series of deubiquitylation assays of mono- and
polyubiquitin-PCNA by USP1-UAF1 in the presence or absence of Spartan <italic>in
vitro</italic> using highly purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F5">Figure 5</xref>CâF). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F5">Figure
5</xref>C and D, <italic>in vitro</italic> USP1-UAF1 could indeed deubiquitylate mono-
and polyubiquitin PCNA in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in unconjugated
PCNA. Importantly, adding Spartan to the PCNA deubiquitylation reaction strongly inhibited
PCNA deubiquitylation by USP1-UAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F5">Figure 5</xref>C
and D). The PIP mutant Spartan prevented PCNA deubiquitylation less efficiently when
compared with the WT Spartan. Moreover, the UBZ mutant Spartan completely failed to
protect mono- and polyubiquitin PCNA against USP1-catalyzed deubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F5">Figure 5</xref>E and F). These observations suggest that
the PCNA-binding and the ubiquitin-binding properties of Spartan contribute to the
protection against PCNA deubiquitylation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this work, we characterized Spartan, a previously unknown protein, and unraveled its
role in the RAD18-dependent pathway of replication of damaged DNA. Upon DNA damage, Spartan
localizes to sites of replication stress in a Rad18-dependent manner and also interacts with
Rad18. Several lines of evidence suggest that the recruitment of Spartan to replication
forks is mediated by the Rad18-dependent ubiquitylation of PCNA. First, purified Spartan
preferentially interacts with ubiquitin conjugated PCNA, which is facilitated by the PIP-
and UBZ domains of Spartan, and Spartan also forms complex with ubiquitin-modified PCNA
<italic>in vivo</italic>. Next, colocalization of Spartan with PCNA requires the UBZ and
the PIP domains of Spartan. Finally, binding of purified Spartan by its PIP- and UBZ domains
to ubiquitin-conjugated PCNA provides protection against PCNA deubiquitylation by USP1.</p><p>In addition to monoubiquitin-PCNA, Spartan can also preferentially bind to
polyubiquitin-PCNA and protect against USP1-dependent removal of its polyubiquitin chain.
This finding provides a strong base for further studies aiming to explore polyubiquitin-PCNA
and its deubiquitylation-dependent regulation of template switch-dependent replication of
damage DNA.</p><p>During the course of the study, Spartan/C1orf124 was also found to be recruited to stalled
replication forks by ubiquitylated PCNA and shown to enhance TLS, with which our study fully
agrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B33">33</xref>). However, it was suggested that
Spartan might stimulate PCNA ubiquitylation by enhancing Rad18 ubiquitin ligase function,
which we consider unlikely for several reasons. First, we found that the reduction of
monoubiquitin-PCNA level caused by Spartan knockdown could be reversed by simultaneous USP1
knockdown. Also, Spartan overexpression can reverse the USP1 overexpression-dependent
reduction of monoubiquitin-PCNA level. Furthermore, in our reconstituted system using
purified proteins, Spartan could directly inhibit USP1-dependent PCNA deubiquitylation.
Finally, we reason that the Rad18-dependent PCNA ubiquitylation should precede the
ubiquitin-PCNA-dependent Spartan recruitment. Instead, our observations are consistent with
a model proposing that after PCNA ubiquitylation induced by replication stress, Spartan is
targeted to ubiquitin-modified PCNA, where it could provide protection against PCNA
deubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks850-F6">Figure 6</xref>). This possibility
suggests that Spartan might channel the reviving of stalled replication from
recombination-dependent mechanisms that do not require PCNA ubiquitylation to a PCNA
ubiquitylation-dependent damage bypass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B46">46</xref>). In addition to showing <italic>in vitro</italic> using
purified proteins that Spartan inhibits PCNA deubiquitylation by USP1 a strong support for
this model is also provided by our <italic>in vivo</italic> observation that Spartan
depletion increases the number of SCEs, whereas overexpression of Spartan stimulates the
access of PolÎ· to the replication fork. <fig id="gks850-F6" position="float"><label>Figure
6.</label><caption><p>Model for the role of Spartan in DNA damage tolerance. We
suggest that at the stalled replication fork, the Rad6-Rad18-dependent PCNA
ubiquitylation and the USP1-dependent PCNA deubiquitylation are dynamic processes, of
which balance determines the life-time of ubiquitin-PCNA and the choice of fork rescue
mechanism. In the absence of ubiquitin-PCNA, replication fork can be rescued by
recombination-dependent mechanisms, which, however, have a potential for DNA
rearrangements. In the presence of ubiquitin-conjugated-PCNA, damage bypass or
template switching can provide replication through the lesion without the formation of
a DSB intermediate. Spartan can provide one regulatory level by binding to
ubiquitin-modified PCNA, which protects against PCNA deubiquitylation by USP1. Thus,
Spartan can channel the reviving of stalled replication from a recombination-dependent
pathway that does not require PCNA ubiquitylation to PCNA ubiquitylation-dependent
translesion synthesis or PCNA polyubiquitylation-dependent template switching
pathways.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gks850f6p"/></fig></p><p>Recently, PCNA deubiquitylation by the USP1-UAF1 complex in conjunction with ELG1, which
directs the USP1-UAF1 to ubiquitin-PCNA, has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism of
damage bypass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B26">26</xref>). In facilitating PCNA deubiquitylation, ELG1 and USP1-UAF1
have been suggested to initiate the switch from the low-fidelity polymerase to the
high-fidelity replicative polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B26">26</xref>). To
further support this model, loss of USP1 was shown to lead to aberrant recruitment of TLS
polymerase Îº to replication forks resulting in genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B28">28</xref>). Indeed, because of the error-prone nature of
DNA damage bypass and the low fidelity of TLS polymerases, PCNA ubiquitylation and
deubiquitylation need to be tightly regulated. One level of regulation is provided by UV
irradiation-dependent inactivation of USP1 through an autocleavage event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B24">24</xref>). However, it is unclear what regulates USP1
activity when the protein is not actively degraded following other types of DNA damage
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B25">25</xref>). Our study suggests a new regulatory
mechanism by revealing that Spartan can antagonize USP1-dependent PCNA deubiquitylation.
Because the rescue of stalled replication forks by uncontrolled recombination could lead to
gross chromosomal rearrangements, we propose that by channeling fork rescue to damage bypass
Spartan functions as a guardian during replication of damaged DNA. In fact, Spartan gene is
significantly deleted in different tumors, implicating that Spartan might be paramount for
cancer prevention in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks850-B43">43</xref>).</p><p>Undoubtedly, gaining more insight into the Spartan-dependent mechanisms will have important
implications in understanding how deregulation of the DDT pathways can lead to chromosomal
instability and cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks850/DC1">Supplementary
