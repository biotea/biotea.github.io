          <title>Background</title>
          <p>LGR6 (leucine-rich repeat containing, G protein-coupled receptor 6) is a member of the rhodopsin-like seven transmembrane domain receptor superfamily with the highest homology to LGR4 and LGR5. LGR6 was found as one of the novel genes mutated in colon cancer through total exon sequencing and its promoter region is hypermethylated in 20â50% of colon cancer cases. In the skin, LGR6 marks a population of stem cells that can give rise to all cell lineages. Recently, we and others demonstrated that LGR4 and LGR5 function as receptors of R-spondins to potentiate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. However, the binding affinity and functional response of LGR6 to R-spondins, and the activity of colon cancer mutants of LGR6 have not been determined.</p>

          <title>Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We found that LGR6 also binds and responds to R-spondins 1â3 with high affinity to enhance Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling through increased LRP6 phosphorylation. Similar to LGR4 and LGR5, LGR6 is not coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins or to Î²-arrestin following R-spondin stimulation. Functional and expression analysis of three somatic mutations identified in colon cancer samples indicates that one mutant fails to bind and respond to R-spondin (loss-of-function), but the other two have no significant effect on receptor function. Overexpression of wild-type LGR6 in HeLa cells leads to increased cell migration following co-treatment with R-spondin1 and Wnt3a when compared to vector control cells or cells overexpressing the loss-of-function mutant.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>LGR6 is a high affinity receptor for R-spondins 1â3 and potentially functions as a tumor suppressor despite its positive effect on Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>LGR6 (leucine rich-repeat containing, G protein-coupled receptor 6) is a member of the glycoprotein hormone receptor subfamily of rhodopsin-like, seven transmembrane domain (7TM) receptors <xref rid="pone.0037137-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It is most homologous to two other receptors, LGR4 and LGR5 with 50% identity between each other at the amino acid level <xref rid="pone.0037137-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The trio of receptors (LGR4â6) is unique in having a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) containing 17 leucine-rich repeats which are flanked by cysteine-rich sequences at both the N- and C-termini. Another common feature of the three receptors is their expression in distinct types of adult stem cells <xref rid="pone.0037137-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. LGR6 was shown to mark a group of stem cells in the skin that can give rise to all cell lineages of the skin, including those of the hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and interfollicular dermis <xref rid="pone.0037137-Snippert1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. LGR5 marks a distinct population of stem cells in the skin, which, however, only provide progenitor cells of hair follicles <xref rid="pone.0037137-Jaks1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In the gastrointestinal tract, LGR5 marks the rapidly cycling stem cells in the crypts that can give rise to all cell types of the gut epithelium <xref rid="pone.0037137-Barker2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. LGR4, though not a marker of adult stem cells, is generally expressed at high levels in proliferating cells of many tissues, including adult stem cells and early progenitors cells <xref rid="pone.0037137-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-VanSchoore1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Mustata1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Importantly, LGR4 is essential for the survival and proliferation of the crypt stem cells <xref rid="pone.0037137-Mustata1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-deLau1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These observations suggest that LGR4â6 have unique ligands and signaling mechanisms as they are the only receptors, among hundreds of members of the rhodopsin family, found to be specifically expressed in adult stem cells and/or essential for their survival.</p>
      <p>Recently, we and others demonstrated that LGR4 and LGR5 function as receptors of the R-spondin family of stem cell factors to potentiate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling <xref rid="pone.0037137-deLau1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037137-Glinka1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. R-spondins (RSPOs) are a group of four secreted proteins (RSPO1â4) that share an overall identity of 40â60% at the amino acid sequence level and are comprised of similar domains <xref rid="pone.0037137-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. They were originally identified as Wnt agonists based on their robust, positive effect on Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling <xref rid="pone.0037137-Kazanskaya1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Nam1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Stimulation of LGR4 or LGR5 with any of the four RSPOs greatly potentiates Î²-catenin-dependent transcription induced by Wnt3a, with RSPO2 and RSPO3 showing the highest potency and affinity <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Though LGR4 and LGR5 contain a 7TM domain with significant homology to those of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, and are predicted to be G protein-coupled receptors, stimulation of neither receptor with RSPOs lead to changes in intracellular levels of cAMP or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, or translocation of Î²-arrestin <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, also referred to as canonical Wnt signaling, is initiated through phosphorylation of the Wnt coreceptors LRP5/6 at multiple sites following Wnt ligand stimulation <xref rid="pone.0037137-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Niehrs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. One of the key phosphorylation sites is Ser-1490 of LRP6, which is greatly enhanced by co-treatment with RSPO <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore, activation of LGR4/5 by RSPOs most likely leads to increased activity of one or multiple kinases that phosphorylate LRP6 through a yet unknown mechanism.</p>
      <p>LGR6 was shown to be able to rescue the effect of R-spondin on Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in HEK293T cells when endogenously expressed LGR4 was knocked down <xref rid="pone.0037137-deLau1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, suggesting that LGR6 functions similarly as LGR4 and LGR5. However, activation of LGR6 by the different RSPOs has not yet been characterized. More importantly, LGR6 was found to be one of the commonly mutated genes in a group of colon cancer samples that were sequenced by whole-exon sequencing <xref rid="pone.0037137-Sjoblom1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Out of 37 colon cancer samples randomly selected for sequencing, three mutations (299â300insGRS, G725C, and P928H) in LGR6 were found, with the mutation P928H being homozygous <xref rid="pone.0037137-Sjoblom1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. An independent, transcriptome-wide approach also found that the promoter region of LGR6 is hypermethylated in â¼20% of colon cancer cases <xref rid="pone.0037137-Schuebel1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A follow-up analysis showed that LGR6 is hypermethylated in â¼50% of colon cancer <xref rid="pone.0037137-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Mokarram1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, suggesting that LGR6 functions as a tumor suppressor. We mined the COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer <xref rid="pone.0037137-Forbes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>) database for additional mutations and found that LGR6 is also somatically mutated in cancers of the ovary and pancreas <xref rid="pone.0037137-Forbes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway is well known to have critical roles in the initiation and growth of many types of cancer, especially in colon cancer, as nearly 90% of colon cancers have aberrant activation of this pathway <xref rid="pone.0037137-Vogelstein1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Therefore, it is important to determine if LGR6 interacts with the different RSPOS to regulate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and whether the cancer mutations affect LGR6-mediated signaling. In this study, we have characterized the binding and activation of LGR6 by RSPOs. To gain a better understanding of the function of LGR6 in Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and oncogenesis, we also evaluated the activity of the different LGR6 mutants identified in colon cancer. Here we show that one of the mutants is incapable of binding to R-spondins and fails to activate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling.</p>

        <title>R-Spondin binds to and co-internalizes with LGR6</title>
        <p>Previously, we reported that R-spondins bind to and co-internalize with LGR4 and LGR5 using immunofluoresence and whole cell binding analysis <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We used the same methods to examine if they can also bind to and co-internalize with LGR6. HEK293 cells stably expressing human LGR6 with a Flag-tag at the N-terminus were generated and used in the binding study. A fusion protein consisting of mouse RSPO1 with mouse IgG2a-Fc at the C-terminus (designated mRSPO1-Fc) was shown to be biologically active <xref rid="pone.0037137-Ootani1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and used here as a probe. When mRSPO1-Fc was incubated with live cells expressing LGR6 at 4Â°C to prevent internalization, a strong signal was detected using an anti-IgG2a antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, upper mid panel) while no signal was observed in the absence of mRSPO1-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, lower mid panel). Co-staining with an anti-Flag antibody showed strong receptor expression in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, upper and lower left panels). No binding of mRSPO1-Fc to vector control cells could be detected <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. When the binding was performed at 37Â°C with live cells, both LGR6 (red) and mRSPO1-Fc (green) were observed in intracellular bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, upper left and mid panels), indicating that both mRSPO1-Fc and LGR6 were internalized. Superimposing of the two images revealed near 100% co-localization of mRSPO1-Fc with LGR6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, upper right panel). Again, no anti-IgG2a signal was detected in the absence of mRSPO1-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, lower mid panel), or in vector control cells <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It should be mentioned that intracellular staining of LGR6 was also observed in the absence of mRSPO1-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, lower left panel), suggesting that a significant portion of LGR6 was internalized by either constitutive activity or endogenous expression of RSPOs in HEK293 cells <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Kazanskaya1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Binnerts1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We then used competition binding analysis to determine the affinities of the four RSPOs in binding to LGR6. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, all RSPOs are able to displace the binding of mRSPO1-Fc completely. The IC50s displayed by RSPO1, 2, 3, and 4 under these conditions are 3.3, 0.5, 1.7, and 7 nM, respectively. Taken together, these results show that RSPO1â4 bind to LGR6 strongly and specifically, with RSPO2 showing the highest affinity. Furthermore, the affinity profile of LGR6 for RSPO1â4 is highly similar to that of LGR5 <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>

Flag-LGR6 was detected with a Cy3-labeled anti-Flag antibody (red) and mRSPO1-Fc was detected using Alexa488-labeled anti-IgG2a antibody (green). Nuclei were counterstained with To-Pro-3 (blue). The data shown are from one of three independent experiments with similar results. C, Quantitative binding analysis using a whole-cell-based assay. HEK293 cells stably expressing Flag-LGR6 were incubated with mRSPO1-Fc plus serial dilutions of purified recombinant RSPO1â4. Maximum specific binding is defined by the difference between the data with and without mRSPO1-Fc, which is â¼50% of total binding in general. All error bars are SEM (nâ=â3).</p>

        <p>Since RSPOSs are well known to enhance Î²-catenin signaling in a Wnt-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0037137-Kazanskaya1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Nam1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, we next investigated whether LGR6 can affect the activity of RSPO in this pathway. Activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling is routinely measured by monitoring the activity of the Super TOPflash construct which contains a reporter enzyme under the control of 8 TCF/LEF Î²-catenin-responsive elements <xref rid="pone.0037137-Korinek1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Veeman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Using the Super TOPflash assay, we examined the effect of R-spondin treatment on Wnt signaling in HEK293T cells overexpressing LGR6 in the presence of low concentrations of exogenous Wnt3a which is required for R-spondin to function <xref rid="pone.0037137-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Overexpression of LGR6 increased the potency of RSPO1 by â¼30-fold when compared to vector-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). For RSPO2, strong, endogenous response was observed in vector cells, which was further enhanced upon transfection of LGR6 as shown by the increased potency of the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). A similar increase in potency was also found for RSPO3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). On the other hand, overexpression of LGR6 had no effect on the activity of RSPO4 even though RSPO4 showed high affinity binding to LGR6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Previously, it was demonstrated the endogenous response to RSPOs in HEK293T cells are predominantly mediated by LGR4 <xref rid="pone.0037137-deLau1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037137-Glinka1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Overexpression of LGR4 or LGR5 in these cells still led to dramatic increase in the potencies of RSPO1â4 (â¼1000-fold in the case of RSPO2) <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. LGR6 binds RSPO1â4 with affinities similar to those of LGR5, but showed much less dramatic effect on the potencies of the four ligands in the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling assay. These results suggest that LGR6 is intrinsically weaker in potentiating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling following RSPO stimulation. Alternatively, RSPO binding to LGR6 may lead to activation of other signaling pathways yet to be identified.</p>

        <p>Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1) antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling by competitively binding to the Wnt ligand binding site of LRP6. This prevents the activity of RSPOs, since co-stimulation with a Wnt ligand is required for RSPOs <xref rid="pone.0037137-Binnerts1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037137-Bourhis1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We then tested the effect of Dkk1 on the LGR6-mediated increase in the activity of RSPO1, since the RSPO1 ligand exhibited the weakest endogenous response in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Cotransfection of Dkk1 completely blocked RSPO1 signaling in vector cells as well as in LGR6-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), similar to what was observed with LGR4 and LGR5 <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These data suggest that LGR6 functions in a similar mechanism to that of LGR4/5 in mediating RSPO-induced potentiation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling.</p>

        <title>LGR6 is not coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins or to Î²-arrestin following RSPO stimulation</title>
        <p>Since LGR4â6 contain a 7TM domain typical of rhodopsin-like GPCRs, they are thus predicted to be coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins for signal transduction <xref rid="pone.0037137-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Heterotrimeric G proteins are classified into four groups, GÎ±s(stimulation of cAMP production), GÎ±(i/o) (inhibition of cAMP production), GÎ±q, (Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization), and G<sub>Î±(12/13)</sub> (Rho activation) <xref rid="pone.0037137-Gurevich1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition, nearly 90% of GPCRs induce Î²-arrestin translocation for receptor desensitization and alternative signaling <xref rid="pone.0037137-Shenoy1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Previously, we demonstrated that stimulation of LGR4 or LGR5 with RSPOs did not induce changes in any of the pathways typically associated with GPCR activation, i.e., cAMP alteration, Ca <sup>2+</sup> mobilization, or Î²-arrestin translocation <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We therefore investigated if this is also true for LGR6. First, we examined cAMP response in cells transiently transfected with vector control or LGR6 after treatment with various concentrations of RSPO1â2. No hint of increased cAMP production in either control or LGR6 cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). As a positive control, these cells showed a normal, robust increase in cAMP levels in response to forskolin stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). We then tested if LGR6 inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, but found no such activity at any of the tested concentrations of RSPO1 or RSPO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization also failed to detect any LGR6-mediated activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). We also examined if activation of LGR6 is coupled to the GÎ±<sub>(12/13)</sub> pathway using a serum response factor-based reporter enzyme assay, which is one of the standard methods for monitoring activation of this pathway <xref rid="pone.0037137-Riobo1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Cells transfected with either vector control or LGR6 showed no response to RSPO1 in this assay, with or without Wnt3a co-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Treatment with fetal bovine serum (FBS), as expected, resulted in a dose-dependent increase in reporter enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). LGR6-transfected cells showed a moderate increase in the potency of serum, the significance of which needs further investigation. Lastly, we investigated if Î²-arrestin is involved in LGR6 activation. No translocation of Î²-arrestin was detected in HEK293T cells transfected with vector or LGR6 following treatment with RSPO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>). LGR6 expression and ligand-receptor co-localization were clearly confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>). As positive control, cells expressing Î²2-adrenerigc receptor showed robust translocation of Î²-arrestin following stimulation with its agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>). Furthermore, co-stimulation with recombinant Wnt3a in any of the above GPCR assays made no difference. Taken together, these data indicate that LGR6, like LGR4 and LGR5, is not coupled to any of the heterotrimeric G protein classes or to Î²-arrestin, at least when stimulated by RSPOs.</p>

        <title>LGR6 mutation identified in colon cancer has loss of function</title>
        <p>Total exon or complete genomic sequencing has increasingly been used to identify all mutations of cancer genomes in a nonbiased fashion <xref rid="pone.0037137-Sjoblom1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Stratton1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In the very first sequencing of total exons from breast and colon cancer samples, LGR6 was found to be one of the commonly mutated genes in colon cancer with three mutations found in a total of 37 cases <xref rid="pone.0037137-Sjoblom1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Two of the three mutations are missense and the 3<sup>rd</sup> one was an inframe insertion of three amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0037137-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0037137-Sjoblom1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Since then, one additional mutation was found in pancreatic cancer and two in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0037137-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0037137-Forbes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Yachida1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, the consequences of these mutations, with one exception, have never been determined since no functional assay was available until now. The frameshift mutation (230fs*6) found in ovarian cancer truncates 737 out of 967 amino acids and is thus expected to be a loss-of-function mutation. With the finding that LGR6 functions as a receptor of RSPOs to potentiate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, we set out to determine the activity of the three mutants identified in colon cancer by comparing them with LGR6 WT. The three mutants and LGR6 WT, along with vector control, were transfected into HEK293T cells and their responses to RSPO1 were compared side-by-side. The two point mutation mutants, G725C and P928H, showed increased responses that are not significantly different from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), implying that they do not affect RSPO1-simulated LGR6 activity. The response curve of the insGRS mutant, however, was indistinguishable from that of vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that it has lost the function of responding to RSPO1 in potentiating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Immunoblot analysis showed all receptors were expressed at a similar level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), indicating no defects in expression.</p>

        <p>Next, we investigated potential defects of the insGRS mutant by comparing its activities with those of WT with respect to LRP6 phosphorylation, accumulation of non-membranous Î²-catenin, and ligand binding. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with vector control, LGR6WT, or insGRS plasmids and treated with RSPO1 for different periods of time (0 to 6 hrs) before being harvested for analysis. In vector control cells, RSPO1 stimulation increased LRP6 phorphorylation and accumulation of Î²-catenin as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In LGR6 transfected cells, phosphorylation was further increased across all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), consistent with the increased activity in the Super TOPflash reporter enzyme assay. In LGR6-insGRS-transfected cells, both LRP6 phosphorylation and Î²-catenin accumulation were reduced at later time points when compared to vector control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), indicating the mutant is defective in enhancing Wnt3a-stimulated signaling. Again, the expression level of the mutant was similar to that of the WT receptor based on western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). We then performed ligand binding analysis to determine if the LGR6-insGRS receptor is still capable of binding to RSPO1, especially since the mutation is located in the presumed ligand-binding ECD. When the binding was carried out at 37Â°C, LGR6-insGRS-expressing cells showed receptor staining at both the cell surface and in the cytoplasmic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, upper left panels). However, no staining of mRSPO-Fc was observed, indicating that the mutant is incapable of binding to the ligand. LGR6-WT-expressing cells showed strong staining of the ligand which is co-localized with the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, lower panels). Furthermore, examination of the intracellular staining pattern of the insGRS mutant found no vesicular structures typically observed with LGR4â6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, left panels) <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This suggests that the mutant does not undergo normal receptor internalization, potentially due to its failure to bind ligand. The strong, non-vesicular intracellular staining also suggests that the mutant is potentially defective in trafficking to the membrane after synthesis in the ER. Collectively, these data indicate that RSPO1 stimulation of LGR6-WT enhanced Wnt-induced LRP6 phosphorylation and Î²-catenin accumulation, leading to increased Wnt signaling output. Of the three mutants found in colon cancer through random sequencing, only the insGRS mutant has loss of function. This loss of function is due to its inability to bind ligand, which may be attributed to a conformational change in the receptor as a consequence of the insertion of three amino acid residues in the ECD's leucine-rich repeat #10. Together with the finding that LGR6 is hypermethylated in up to 50% of colon cancer samples and an LGR6 truncation mutant has been identified in ovarian cancer, these data imply that LGR6 functions as tumor suppressor for colon and ovarian cancer.</p>

Of the three receptors, LGR4 is the most commonly and abundantly expressed receptor in the cancer cell lines, with the exception of the HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). LGR6 is expressed at negligible levels except in Colo320 cells. Interestingly, none of the colon cancer cell lines expressed significant levels of RSPOs while previous published results showed HeLa cells express high levels of RSPO3 <xref rid="pone.0037137-Kazanskaya1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). To examine the effect of LGR6 on growth and migration of cancer cells, we attempted to overexpress LGR6 WT and insGRS mutant in SW620 cells which have relative low expression of LGR4â6 and are routinely used as a model of colon cancer studies. However, repeated efforts failed to establish cell lines stably expressing WT or mutant LGR6. We then used HeLa cells as a host cell line and obtained bulk cell lines stably expressing FLAG-tagged LGR6 WT or insGRS after sorting with anti-Flag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g005">Fig. 5 DâE</xref>). No difference among the three cell lines expressing vector, LGR6-WT or LGR6-insGRS was observed in growth rate as measured by the xCelligence assay (data not shown). We then compared migration of the three cell lines treated with vehicle control, RSPO1, Wnt3a, or Wnt3a+RSPO1. No significant difference in baseline migration was observed among the three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Interestingly, cells expressing LGR6-WT displayed increased migration when treated with RSPO1+Wnt3a while cells expressing the insGRS mutant cells or the vector control showed no response, confirming the loss of function result for the insGRS mutant. Confocal immunofluoresence analysis showed that the insGRS mutant, like in HEK293 cells, is not located in intracellular bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). In contrast, WT LGR6 consistently displayed a pattern of vesicular staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037137-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). These results indicate that overexpression of LGR6 in HeLa cells can increase cell migration when co-stimulated by Wnt3a and RSPO1.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study we determined the affinity and potency of LGR6 for RSPO1â4 in potentiating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, and characterized the activity of three mutations identified in colon cancer samples. Compared to LGR4 and LGR5, LGR6 appears to have a more limited tissue distribution with lower expression in general (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/ESTProfileViewer.cgi?uglist=Hs.497402">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/ESTProfileViewer.cgi?uglist=Hs.497402</ext-link>). Knockout of LGR6 in the mouse has no obvious phenotype while homozygous deletion of either LGR4 or LGR5 leads to total embryonic or neonatal lethality <xref rid="pone.0037137-Snippert1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Mazerbourg1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Morita1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. As loss of RSPOs leads to embryonic lethality or major developmental defects <xref rid="pone.0037137-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, these observations suggest that LGR6 does not have a major role in mediating the effect in RSPOs in vivo. Interestingly, our in vitro analysis substantiates that LGR6 is much less effective in potentiating RSPO-mediated Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling as shown by the much less dramatic increase in the potencies of RSPO1â4 when compared to LGR4/5, even though recombinant expression of LGR6 gave comparable receptor levels and binding affinities for RSPO1â4. Assuming the 7TM domain of LGR4â6 is responsible for receptor signaling, we compared the 7TM sequence of LGR6 with those of LGR4 and LGR5, and found that LGR6 is unique in one potentially important motif. The âDRYâ motif located at the end of TM3, of which the Arg residue (often referred to as residue 3â¶50) is almost absolutely conserved in the rhodopsin family of GPCRs. In LGR4 and LGR5, the sequence is âERGâ and âERSâ, respectively. In LGR6, however, the sequence is âQCSâ, representing one of the rare cases of receptors without an Arg residue at the 3â¶50 position in the rhodopsin family. This deviation may be one of the factors for the decreased efficacy of LGR6 in potentiating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling.</p>
      <p>Similar to LGR4 and LGR5, LGR6 is not coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins or to Î²-arrestin following stimulation with RSPO alone or RSPO plus Wnt3a. This conclusion is based on our analysis of 2<sup>nd</sup> messengers, GÎ±<sub>(12/13)</sub>-induced transcriptional activation, and Î²-arrestin translocation. The observation that HEK293T cells showed no hint of endogenous response to RSPO1 or SPO2 in the GÎ±<sub>(12/13)</sub> assay also indicates that LGR4 is not coupled to this pathway since these cells have strong endogenous expression of LGR4 and respond to RSPO1 stimulation in the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling assay <xref rid="pone.0037137-deLau1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Though the 7TM region of LGR4â6 has significant overall homology to those of rhodopsin-like GPCRs and contains all the important motifs, it does have unique features that may hold the answer to their lack of coupling to G proteins. The intracellular loop between TM5 and TM6 in GPCRs directly interacts with the Î± subunit of the heterotrimeric complex <xref rid="pone.0037137-Rosenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and generally has an overall basicity (pIâ=ââ¼9). For LGR4â6, however, the loops have a calculated pI of â¼5.5, which can potentially hinder interactions with G proteins. The CWXP motif in TM6, commonly conserved in the rhodopsin family of receptors, has the sequence XXCP for LGR4â6. This motif plays a critical role in the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins <xref rid="pone.0037137-Gurevich1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Rasmussen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Kobilka1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. All the other members of the LGR family (LGR1â3 and LGR7â8), which are universally coupled to GÎ±s and are the most closely related homologs of LGR4â6, have the sequence CMAP (LGR1â3) or CWIP (LGR7â8) for this motif <xref rid="pone.0037137-BenShlomo1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The Drosophila receptor dLGR2, a GÎ±s-coupled receptor for the neuropeptide bursicon <xref rid="pone.0037137-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Mendive1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, is most homologous to LGR4â6 and was believed to be the invertebrate ortholog of mammalian LGR4â6 <xref rid="pone.0037137-Luo2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Notably, dLGR2 has the sequence CWSP for this motif. Interestingly, orthologs of RSPOs have not been identified in invertebrates and bursicon-like mammalian peptides such as gremlins don't not activate LGR4â6 <xref rid="pone.0037137-Carmon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that LGR4â6 have evolved away from their typical ancestor GPCRs to function as receptors for the newly evolved RSPO proteins to potentiate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in vertebrates. In fact, several regulators of the Wnt signaling pathways are only found in vertebrates, such as DKK1 and WTX, both of which inhibit canonical Wnt signaling <xref rid="pone.0037137-Glinka2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The finding of a vertebrate-specific LGR-RSPO receptor ligand system being uncoupled to heterotrimeric G proteins is rather surprising, but perhaps not unexpected since they are the only receptors of this family that are specifically associated with stem cell function among the hundreds of 7TM rhodopsin-like receptors. Delineation of the signaling mechanisms of LGR4â6 will provide important insights to the function of these receptors and the control of proliferation and differentiation of adult stem cells.</p>
      <p>LGR4â6 are all known to be associated with various types of cancer, but their roles and mechanisms in oncogenesis remain largely unknown. LGR4 expression was shown to be increased in approximately half of colon cancer cases with high levels being associated with more severe metastasis <xref rid="pone.0037137-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. For LGR5, earlier studies suggest that it has increased expression in colon cancer and basal cell carcinoma with expression potentially enriched in cancer stem cells <xref rid="pone.0037137-Tanese1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037137-MerlosSuarez1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. More recent publications, on the other hand, reported that LGR5 may actually function as a tumor suppressor and its expression level is inversely correlated with prognosis <xref rid="pone.0037137-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-deSousa1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Somatic cancer mutations of LGR5 have also been identified, all of which are distinct missense mutations with the exception of one truncation <xref rid="pone.0037137-Forbes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor. For LGR6, the initial evidence came from the finding of three mutations in random, total exon sequencing of 37 colon cancer samples <xref rid="pone.0037137-Sjoblom1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A transcriptome-wide approach showed that LGR6 is hypermethylated in the promoter region in â¼20% of colon cancer <xref rid="pone.0037137-Schuebel1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and a follow-up study found hypermethylation in up to 50% of colon cancer samples depending patient ethnicity <xref rid="pone.0037137-Mokarram1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our analysis of the three mutations found in colon cancer clearly indicates that one of them (insGRS) is a loss-of-function mutation. Based on these data, it is suggested that LGR6 plays the role of a tumor suppressor in colon and ovarian cancer. Interestingly, RSPO1, a high affinity ligand of LGR6, also appears to function as a tumor suppressor. Loss of RSPO1 in females recessively leads to increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0037137-DeLorenzi1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The notion that LGR6 is expressed specifically in a population of stem cells that can give rise to all cell lineages of the skin and that cancer often originates from stem cells suggests that LGR6 may be the underlying receptor for the tumor suppressive role of RSPO1. On the other hand, the finding that LGR6 has positive effects on Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and cell migration appears to be inconsistent with a tumor suppressor function. It is generally believed that hyperactivation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling leads to increased cell proliferation and cell migration is important for metastasis, both of which are expected to have oncogenic function. However, emerging evidence suggests that Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling has to be kept at an appropriate (âjust rightâ) level to balance proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0037137-Bordonaro1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-Segditsas1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Thus, suppression of LGR6 function may be important for cancer cells to maintain the right level of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. As for cell migration, the effect of LGR6 may be specific to HeLa cells. LGR5, for example, showed oncogenic properties in colon cancer cells and basal cell carcinoma cells <xref rid="pone.0037137-Tanese1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037137-McClanahan1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, but displayed tumor suppressor function in colon cancer cell lines with Î²-catenin mutations <xref rid="pone.0037137-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Interestingly, the tumor sample containing the LGR6 insGRS mutation also has mutation in APC but not in Î²-catenin <xref rid="pone.0037137-Forbes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, suggesting that the action of LGR6 does not depend on the genetic status of Î²-catenin. Nevertheless, the finding of loss-of-function mutations in cancer cells and promoter hypermethylation strongly argues that LGR6 functions as a tumor suppress in colon and ovarian cancer.</p>
      <p>In summary, we characterized the binding and functional activities of RSPO1â4 on LGR6 and found that LGR6 has the highest affinity for RSPO2. Stimulation of LGR6 with RSPO1 leads to increased LRP6 phosphorylation and Î²-catenin-controlled transcriptional activity. We also determined the activity of three somatic mutations found in colon cancer and demonstrated that the insGRS mutant is a loss-of-function mutation due to failure of ligand binding. Overexpression of LGR6 in HeLa cells leads to increased cell migration in response to treatment with Wnt3a and RSPO1. These results suggest that LGR6 is potentially a tumor suppressor and provide a basis for future research into the roles and mechanisms of LGR6 in oncogenesis.</p>
