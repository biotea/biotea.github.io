        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The ARF tumor suppressor is a central component of the cellular defense against oncogene activation in mammals. p14ARF activates p53 by binding and inhibiting HDM2, resulting, inter alia, in increased transcription and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and consequent cell-cycle arrest. We analyzed the effect of p14ARF induction on nucleolar protein dynamics using SILAC mass spectrometry and have identified the human Formin-2 (FMN2) protein as a component of the p14ARF tumor suppressor pathway. We show that FMN2 isÂ increased upon p14ARF induction at both the mRNA and the protein level via a NF-ÎºB-dependent mechanism that is independent of p53. FMN2 enhances expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 by preventing its degradation. FMN2 is also induced by activation of other oncogenes, hypoxia, and DNAÂ damage. These results identify FMN2 asÂ a crucial component in the regulation of p21 and consequent oncogene/stress-induced cell-cycle arrest in human cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ARF tumor suppressor initiates the cellular response to aberrant oncogene activation through binding to and inhibiting the activity of Hdm2/Mdm2, the E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sherr, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Vousden, 2002</xref>). As such, upon ARF induction, p53 can escape from degradation and activate transcription of its target genes. These include proapoptotic genes such as puma and noxa (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zilfou and Lowe, 2009</xref>) and cell-cycle inhibitors such as p21 (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zilfou and Lowe, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>A high percentage of human leukemia and melanoma patients have ARF mutations (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Curtin etÂ al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein etÂ al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Soufir etÂ al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the ARF locus is found hypermethylated (and hence silenced) in a great number of human cancers (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Badal etÂ al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dâalessandro etÂ al., 2002</xref>). Genetic studies have shown that ARF deletion promotes tumor development with high frequency (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sherr, 2001</xref>). Moreover, p53 action as a tumor suppressor is severely impaired in the absence of ARF (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Christophorou etÂ al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Efeyan etÂ al., 2006</xref>). However, genetic and biochemical studies on p53 and ARF pathways showed there are also ARF tumor suppressor pathways that are p53 independent (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Chen etÂ al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rocha etÂ al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wadhwa etÂ al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Weber etÂ al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>ARF accumulates in nucleoli during oncogene activation and either inhibits cell-cycle progression or promotes apoptosis through both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rocha etÂ al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). One of the p53-independent functions of ARF is the regulation of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sherr, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>The nucleolus is a subnuclear organelle in which rRNAs are transcribed, processed, and assembled with ribosomal proteins into ribosome subunits (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Boisvert etÂ al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Granneman and Baserga, 2004</xref>). However, recent studies also suggested that the nucleolus is not only the site of ribosome subunit biogenesis but also is associated with additional biological functions, e.g., cell-cycle regulation, stress responses, and human disease (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Boulon etÂ al., 2010b</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Boyd etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Pederson, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Pederson and Tsai, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, studies on the rates of protein turnover in human nucleoli using pulse SILAC showed that p14ARF was one of the nucleolar proteins with the fastest rate of turnover (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lam etÂ al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The function of p14ARF in nucleoli is still not fully characterized. Furthermore, mechanistic aspects of ARF-mediated tumor suppression independent of p53 are relatively unknown. To address these questions, we performed an unbiased screen for proteomic changes in the nucleolus following p14ARF induction. Here we report the characterization of a component in the p14ARF tumor suppressor pathway, called FMN2. We find that FMN2 is induced by p14ARF at the transcriptional level, independent of p53, via a NF-ÎºB-dependent mechanism. Importantly, FMN2 is required for stable protein expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21. FMN2 is necessary and sufficient for increasing p21 protein expression via a mechanism that involves the inhibition of protein degradation.</p>

        <title>Dynamic Change of Nucleolar Proteins during ARF Induction</title>
        <p>To identify ARF-mediated changes in nucleoli, we performed a quantitative analysis of alterations to the nucleolar proteome following induction of p14ARF expression. For this we used two model human cell systems allowing inducible p14ARF expression that have been extensively characterized by us, and others (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Llanos etÂ al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rocha etÂ al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). NARF2 cells are derived from the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS, which has the p14ARF gene promoter methylated and hence silenced. NARF2 cells possess an exogenous, IPTG-inducible p14ARF construct. In addition, we also used NARF2-E6 cells, which are analagous to the NARF2 cells, but in addition express the HPV protein E6. E6 continually targets p53 for degradation and as such renders the NARF2-E6 cells nonfunctional for p53 (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rocha etÂ al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p>
        <p>Using these model human cell systems, we have analyzed ARF-induced nucleolar protein dynamics using SILAC mass spectrometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen etÂ al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Boisvert etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lam etÂ al., 2007</xref>). To confirm that the SILAC culture medium is compatible with these cell systems, we determined the G1, S, G2, and M populations of NARF2 cells grown both in normal culture medium and in SILAC medium (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>A and S1B online). This showed that the SILAC medium has little or no effect on NARF2 cell growth (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>A and S1B). We also determined the quality of nucleoli purified from NARF2 cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>C), and confirmed independently using immunofluorescence microscopy the nucleolar accumulation of p14ARF protein following IPTG induction (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>D).</p>
        <p>As a further control, we verified by MS analysis the presence of p14ARF peptides in nucleoli following induction with IPTG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B). This revealed 86.8% sequence coverage of the p14ARF protein (data not shown). By performing a time course induction of p14ARF, we compared the dynamic change of p14ARF expression in both NARF2 and NARF-E6 cells. p14ARF protein levels increased in both cell lines after induction with IPTG, as expected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C). We also compared the mass spectrometry data with signal intensity from fluorescence microscope-based live-cell imaging for GFP-tagged p14ARF. This revealed a similar increase in p14ARF expression levels as judged by both MS and microscopy-based quantitation methods (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>E), further validating our analysis. Similar results were also obtained for other nucleolar proteins, including NPM1 and fibrillarin (FBL) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>F).</p>
        <p>The mass spectrometry data identified changes in the relative levels of thousands of nucleolar proteins following p14ARF induction. The top 5% of proteins showing the largest relative change in abundance in the nucleolus are shown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). The majority of these proteins showed decreased levels in the nucleolus following p14ARF induction. Interestingly, the protein distribution pattern in NARF2 and NARF2-E6 was very similar, indicating that most, if not all, of these changes are independent of p53, at least in this model cell system (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>Identification of an ARF-Induced Protein, FMN2</title>
        <p>The MS analysis identified that in particular the Formin-2 (FMN2) protein was highly induced by ARF in a p53-independent manner. There is relatively little information on the function of the FMN2 protein, particularly in human cells, but reported roles include modulation of cytokinesis (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Katoh and Katoh, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Leader etÂ al., 2002</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, no association of FMN2 with either p14ARF or p53 has previously been reported. Due to the dynamics and level of FMN2 induction observed by mass spectrometry, we decided to investigate the significance of this finding for downstream effects of p14ARF pathways.</p>
        <p>Given the absence of previous studies on human FMN2 protein function, few reagents were available. We therefore cloned full-length human FMN2 cDNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>, see the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>) and developed specific antibodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>). The anti-FMN2 antibodies detected FMN2 protein both by immunofluorescence microscopy and by protein blotting, with the signal specifically reduced following siRNA-mediated knockdown of FMN2, but not after treatment of cells with control siRNAs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>AâS4C). Protein blot analysis using these antibodies further showed that FMN2 levels increased after induction of p14ARF in both p53-positive andÂ -negative cell lines, confirming the previous MS data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>A and S4B). To further rule out any p53 dependency, siRNA-mediated depletion of p53 in NARF-E6 was performed. The data show that p53 is not required for p14ARF-mediated induction of the FMN2 protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>ARF Upregulates FMN2 at the Transcriptional Level</title>
        <p>To determine the mechanism behind increased FMN2 protein levels after induction of p14ARF, we next analyzed FMN2 mRNA levels by qPCR. This revealed that ARF induction increases FMN2 transcript levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). In addition, northern blot analysis also demonstrated an increase in FMN2 transcript levels following ARF induction (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>A). Furthermore, microarray analysis showed that FMN2 mRNA levels were highly increased following ARF induction (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>B). In contrast, addition of IPTG to normal U2OS cells did not result in any significant change in FMN2 levels (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>C). These data indicate that ARF regulates FMN2 expression either at the transcriptional level, or at the level of RNA stability.</p>
        <p>To determine whether transcription ofÂ the FMN2 gene is regulated by ARF, we investigated if the activity of the FMN2 promoter was responsive to ARF induction. To do this, we cloned a 2 kbp genomic region from upstream of the FMN2 ORF, containing the predicted FMN2 promoter, into plasmid mCherry-N1, which possesses a truncated CMV promoter. This assay allows direct visualization of FMN2 promoter activity in expressing cells, at the single-cell level, based on detection of mCherry by fluorescence microscopy. In addition, a smaller 1 kbp region of this promoter was also cloned in the same construct. When transfected into either NARF2 or NARF2-E6 cells, addition of IPTG and hence ARF induction increased mCherry expression in both cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>Bâ3D, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>D and S5E). The negative control plasmid, which does not include any upstream genomic FMN2 promoter region, did not show mCherry expression either with or without ARF induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>D and S5E).</p>
        <p>The previous results suggest that the FMN2 promoter has an ARF responsive element in the â1 to â2,000Â bp region. Further analysis compared the ability of different sequences within this region of the promoter to support ARF-dependent induction of mCherry expression. For example, deletion of sequences from â2,000 up to â1,400Â bp did not prevent ARF-mediated induction of mCherry. On the other hand, deletion up to â1,200Â bp abolished ARF responsiveness of this promoter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>D and S5E).</p>
        <p>The promoter analysis revealed that a fragment correspondingÂ to the DNA sequence between â1,400 and â1,200 of the FMN2Â promoter was necessary and sufficient for ARF-mediated induction of mCherry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>D and S5E). Closer inspection of the sequence within this 200Â bp minimal fragment revealed overlapping putative binding sites for the transcription factors NF-ÎºB and E2F1 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>, bold). Given the previous connection reported between ARF and NF-ÎºB (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rocha etÂ al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), we tested for the involvement of these binding sites by mutating the two NF-ÎºB sites in the FMN2 promoter constructs and repeating the analysis. Interestingly, mutation of the NF-ÎºB sites resulted in constitutive expression of mCherry from the FMN2 promoter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>D and S5E). WeÂ infer that NF-ÎºB binding to the FMN2 promoter represses transcription of the FMN2 gene. Taken together, these results suggest that ARF may modulate NF-ÎºB function to control FMN2 promoter activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>D).</p>

        <title>ARF Upregulates FMN2 at the Transcriptional Level by Inhibiting NF-ÎºB and E2F1</title>
        <p>The FMN2 promoter analysis revealed a possible role for NF-ÎºB and E2F1 in the regulation of FMN2 by ARF. To validate these findings, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses on the FMN2 promoter, using NF-ÎºB/RelA antibodies. We also used anti-AcH3 antibodies as a marker for active transcription. Under basal conditions we could detect NF-ÎºB/RelA binding to the FMN2 promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). However, upon ARF induction, the amount of NF-ÎºB/RelA present at the promoter was reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). Furthermore, this reduction in NF-ÎºB/RelA binding was accompanied by an increase in the levels of AcH3 present in this region of the promoter, consistent with NF-ÎºB/RelA acting as a transcriptional repressor of this gene. To determine if the results obtained with the promoter occupancy assay were reflected in the levels of FMN2 protein and mRNA, siRNA depletion of either NF-ÎºB/RelA or E2F1 was performed, either with or without ARF induction in NARF2 cells. As seen before, ARF induction resulted in increased levels of both FMN2 protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B) and mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>C and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S6</xref>). Interestingly, when either NF-ÎºB/RelA or E2F1 was depleted, constitutive high levels of FMN2 protein and mRNA were observed that were not further elevated upon ARF induction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B and 4C). Of note, ARF induction resulted in reduced E2F1 mRNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S6</xref>B) and protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B), indicating that E2F1 is prevented from repressing FMN2 by ARF. The ARF-mediated repression of E2F1 has been shown previously to be p53 independent (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mason etÂ al., 2002</xref>). This is consistent with our current observations that ARF induction of FMN2 does not depend on p53 expression. We also performed double siRNA knockdown of both E2F1 and NF-ÎºB/RelA and analyzed FMN2 mRNA levels (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S6</xref>C and S6D). Once again, depletion of E2F1 and NF-ÎºB/RelA resulted in higher levels of FMN2 mRNA, which was not further elevated by ARF induction (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S6</xref>C).</p>
        <p>To further establish the role of NF-ÎºB at the FMN2 promoter, we depleted cells of NF-ÎºB/RelA using siRNA and performed ChIP using both anti-RelA and anti-AcH3 antibodies. Once again, in control cells we could detect binding of NF-ÎºB/RelA toÂ the FMN2 promoter, and this was significantly reduced in cellsÂ depleted of NF-ÎºB/RelA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). Importantly, levels ofÂ AcH3 present at the FMN2 promoter were increased when NF-ÎºB/RelA was depleted, supporting the previous mRNA and protein expression analysis.</p>

        <title>FMN2 Is Induced by Oncogenic Stress, DNA Damage, and Hypoxia</title>
        <p>Given that NF-ÎºB is a transcription factor that responds to many stresses in different cells types (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Perkins, 2007</xref>), we next determined if the modulation of FMN2 by NF-ÎºB was restricted to ARF induction or was also observed with other stimuli and in different cell types. First, we investigated if activation of the SRC oncogene could lead to changes in FMN2 expression. For this we used a previously described v-SRC-inducible cell system in the breast epithelial MCF10A cells (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos etÂ al., 2010</xref>). Following induction of v-SRC with tamoxifen, levels of both FMN2 protein and mRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B) increased. These results demonstrate that FMN2 levels increase in different cellular backgrounds in response to oncogenic stress, at least under conditions leading to induction of p14ARF.</p>
        <p>Next, we investigated if additional stresses would modulate FMN2 expression, independently of ARF. We therefore extended our analysis to examine the effects of DNA damage and hypoxic stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 5D), both conditions that have been shown to modulate NF-ÎºB function (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Campbell etÂ al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Culver etÂ al., 2010</xref>). In both these situations, FMN2 expression increased. This is illustrated for UV-induced DNA damage by analysis of FMN2 protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C) and mRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D) levels and for hypoxia by analysis of FMN2 mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E). These data indicate that FMN2 can respond to several different types of stimuli that all result in the arrest of cell growth.</p>

        <title>FMN2 Controls p21 Protein Levels</title>
        <p>To investigate the potential functional significance of increased levels of the FMN2 protein in the stress pathways analyzed, we next suppressed FMN2 expression in cells using siRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>). FMN2 protein levels were decreased by the siRNA treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). However, we did not observe any changes in the corresponding levels of either p53 or Hdm2 after knockdown of FMN2. Interestingly, however, the levels of the p21 protein were markedly reduced when FMN2 was knocked down (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A), but not changed when cells were treated with control siRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). This effect was prevented by expression of a siRNA-resistant version of FMN2 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>A), demonstrating that it is the specific change in levels of FMN2 following siRNA treatment that is responsible for altering p21 expression. Levels of p21 protein were also decreased when ARF was knocked down by siRNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>B). In contrast, we did not detect any changes in the levels of other known p53 targets, including puma and DR5, after FMN2 knockdown, indicating that FMN2 is not altering general p53 transcriptional activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A).</p>
        <p>To examine the mechanism affecting p21 protein levels, we analyzed if p53-mediated induction of p21 mRNA was also altered specifically by FMN2 depletion. We performed qPCR analysis following ARF induction in NARF2 cells, either in the presence or absence of FMN2 knockdown with siRNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>C). The results demonstrate that p21 mRNA was induced to similar levels by ARF, regardless of whether FMN2 protein levels were decreased (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>C). As expected, levels of Hdm2, puma, and DR5 mRNA were also unaltered (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Given that DNA damage and hypoxia also induce p21 protein expression, we next determined if FMN2 was also required for full induction of p21 protein under these types of stress conditions. The results demonstrate that FMN2 is required for p21 protein expression, not only following ARF induction but also following hypoxia and etoposide-induced DNA damage (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B), indicating a more general role for FMN2 in the control of p21 protein levels. FMN2 depletion by siRNA also resulted inÂ lower p21 protein levels in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs)Â subjected to DNA damage by treatment with etoposide (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>D), demonstrating that this effect is seen in multiple cell types.</p>
        <p>The simplest hypothesis explaining these observations is that an increase in FMN2 protein levels is able to stabilize the p21 protein. To test this hypothesis, we depleted FMN2 in NARF2 cells with siRNA, induced ARF expression with IPTG, and added the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The results show that MG132 treatment partially rescues the levels of p21 protein expression after FMN2 depletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C), further suggesting that FMN2 can alter the degree of p21 degradation. Furthermore, this was observed in both NARF2 and NARF-E6 cells, demonstrating the independence from p53 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C).</p>
        <p>It has been reported that p21 is degraded by both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent pathways (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abbas and Dutta, 2009</xref>). To determine which of these pathways are altered by FMN2, we designed siRNAs targeting the proteasome-associated protein PA28Î³ (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chen etÂ al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Li etÂ al., 2007</xref>) and p21 E3 ligase SKP2 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Frescas and Pagano, 2008</xref>), respectively. Knockdown of PA28Î³ by siRNA partially stabilized p21 protein levels after ARF induction, even when FMN2 was absent (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>E). On the other hand, double depletion of SKP2 and FMN2 also partially stabilized p21 levels after ARF induction (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>E, lanes 11 and 12). Given the partial rescue observed with both PA28Î³ and SKP2 knockdowns, we next performed a triple siRNA knockdown experiment, where FMN2 was depleted at the same time as both PA28Î³ and SKP2. Under these conditions, p21 levels were completely rescued following ARF induction. These results strongly suggest that FMN2 functions to stabilize p21 protein levels by preventing its degradation via both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent pathways (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D).</p>
        <p>To further test the model of FMN2 function, we examined theÂ effect of increased levels of FMN2 resulting from transientÂ overexpression of exogenous protein. NARF2 cells were transfected either with an empty vector or with a FMN2-expressing construct, and p14ARF was either induced by the addition ofÂ IPTG, or not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>E). Protein blot analysis demonstrated that even in the absence of p14ARF, exogenous FMN2 proteinÂ expression led to increased levels of p21 protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>E). This was more pronounced when ARF was induced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>E). Importantly, increasing FMN2 levels by transient expression did not result in increased levels of p21 mRNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>F), further demonstrating the role of FMN2 in posttranscriptional control of p21. Interestingly, an increased basal levelÂ of p21 protein is also observed when NF-ÎºB is depleted by siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B), a condition that leads to increased FMN2 expression. Stabilization of p21 was also observed in NARF-E6 cells, when exogenous FMN2 was transiently overexpressed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>E).</p>
        <p>To investigate the mechanism by which FMN2 stabilizes p21, we determined if FMN2 was in a complex with p21. To this end, we immunoprecipitated FMN2 and analyzed whether there was coimmunoprecipitation of p21 by western blot. Our analysis revealed that FMN2 and p21 associate in a common complex, both with and without p14ARF induction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>F, upper panel). Immunoprecipitation of p21 also revealed its association with FMN2 in a common complex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>F, lower panel). In addition, transient expression analysis of fragments of the full-length FMN2 protein revealed that the N terminus of FMN2 is required for p21 stabilization. Thus, exogenous expression of FMN2 exons 1â5 resulted in higher levels of p21 protein, while exogenous expression of FMN2 exons 6â18 did not (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>G). Taken together, these results indicate that FMN2 may increase p21 protein levels by forming a complex in cells that protects p21 from degradation.</p>

        <title>FMN2 Depletion Induces Apoptosis</title>
        <p>To determine the functional consequences of the loss of FMN2, and hence reduced p21 levels, in the cellular responses to ARF induction, we analyzed cellular proliferation and viability under conditions in which FMN2 was depleted. ARF induction of p53 can result in either cell-cycle arrest or the induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rocha etÂ al., 2005</xref>). Most commonly, the initial cellular response is cell-cycle arrest. In NARF2 cells, ARF induction results in stalled proliferation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A), with associated cell-cycle arrest (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rocha etÂ al., 2005</xref>). However, when FMN2 was knocked down by siRNA treatment, cell proliferation was not only stalled, but less viable cells remained compared with the start of the experiment, indicative of cell death (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Given that ARF induction in the absence of FMN2 still results in the induction of proapoptotic genes, such as puma and DR5 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>B), we analyzed markers of apoptosis under conditions of FMN2 depletion. The results indicate that after knockdown of FMN2, cells undergo apoptosis, as judged by both caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Interestingly, this response was also observed in the absence of ARF induction, indicating that FMN2 is required for suppression of apoptosis and hence survival of cancer cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B). To examine whether there were defects in cell-cycle progression elicited by FMN2 depletion in combination with p14ARF induction, we performed FACS analysis. These data show that p14ARF induces arrest of cells in both G1 and G2 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>H), as previously observed (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rocha etÂ al., 2005</xref>). FMN2 depletion following p14ARF induction reduces the percentage of cells in G1 but not G2, with a concomitant modest reduction in the number of cells in S phase (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>H). Importantly, depletion of FMN2 with siRNA increases the percentage of cells in sub-G1, indicating an increase in apoptosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C). To determine if this increased apoptosis is due to p21 destabilization, we investigated the effects of p21 depletion following ARF induction. Our analysis revealed that p21 knockdown with siRNA resulted in increased levels of apoptotic markers, including PARP cleavage and caspase activation, consistent with higher numbers of apoptotic cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that depletion of FMN2 results in lower p21 protein levels, thereby shifting the cellular response from cell-cycle arrest to apoptosis.</p>

        <title>FMN2 Is Induced Following ARF Induction, Oncogenic Stress, DNA Damage, and Hypoxia</title>
        <p>In this study we have identified FMN2 as a key human protein involved in stress-induced cell-cycle arrest. We have shown that FMN2 is critical for p21 protein stabilization but not required for p21 mRNA production. FMN2 levels are upregulated by several different stress stimuli via a common transcriptional mechanism involving NF-ÎºB.</p>
        <p>ARF is an important tumor suppressor, acting during oncogene activation (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dominguez-Brauer etÂ al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ozenne etÂ al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rocha etÂ al., 2005</xref>). ARF is a nuclear protein that accumulates in the nucleolus, with a smaller pool also present in the nucleoplasm. This localization is dynamic, and ARF can shuttle between the nucleolus and other nuclear locations. It is best known for its role in binding to and inhibiting Hdm2, the p53 E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in stabilization of p53. However, the detailed function of ARF is still not fully characterized. Here we performed a study on nucleolar protein dynamics following a time course of ARF induction in human cells, using quantitative mass spectrometry. We found that ARF induction resulted in the majority of nucleolar proteins decreasing in abundance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). One of the main exceptions was a protein called FMN2, which significantly increased its levels in purified nucleoli following ARF activation.</p>
        <p>FMN2 belongs to a family of ubiquitous, conserved multidomain proteins called formins (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Faix and Grosse, 2006</xref>). Formins are defined by the presence of a formin homology (FH) domain, which confers an actin-nucleating activity to these proteins. FMN2 is expressed in the brain, in the spinal cord, and in oocytes in the mouse. The mouse FMN2 gene has been knocked out and the progeny are viable, but it has been reported that Formin-2-deficient oocytes (<italic>fmn2</italic><sup>â/â</sup>) do not extrude a first polar body and that they harbor chromosomes that remain most of the time centrally located, suggesting that the first meiotic spindle does not migrate to the cortex in these oocytes (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Leader etÂ al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, human FMN2 has relatively low homology with mouse FMN2, with the exception of the FH domain. In particular, the FMN2 N-terminal region has low sequence homology between human and mouse. Of note, despite ARF-mediated stabilization of p53 being conserved in mice, the structure of human p14ARF also differs substantially from the larger mouse ortholog, p19ARF (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ozenne etÂ al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wadhwa etÂ al., 2002</xref>). Correspondingly, this may suggest that the FMN2 orthologs in human and mouse have evolved with different partner proteins and/or functions in the ARF activation pathway.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, our analysis showed that FMN2 is induced not only by ARF, but also by other stresses, including separate forms of DNA damage and hypoxia. The common features in all of these responses appear to be the involvement of NF-ÎºB in the mechanism of transcriptional activation of FMN2 and the downstream effect that they all cause activation of p21 and hence result in an arrest of cell proliferation. The involvement of the FMN2 protein in these responses is an important observation, as is our finding that activation of p21 depends upon actively preventing its rapid degradation and does not result solely from increasing its transcription and translation.</p>
        <p>Consistent with our observations in this study, a previous large-scale proteomic analysis of protein targets for phosphorylation by ATR/ATM identified FMN2 as one of multiple targets (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Matsuoka etÂ al., 2007</xref>). More recently, FMN2 was also reported as a potential oncogene in leukemia (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Charfi etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Investigation of publicly available data sets in Oncomine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.oncomine.org/resource/login.html">https://www.oncomine.org/resource/login.html</ext-link>) has revealed differential FMN2 RNA expression in human tumors, depending on cancer type. For example, FMN2 RNA is reported to be overexpressed in certain breast cancers and melanomas but underexpressed in certain renal cancers (oncomine). However, the mechanism behind these observations has not been investigated.</p>
        <p>Our data demonstrate that under normal growth conditions the transcription factors NF-ÎºB and E2F1 both contribute to repressing FMN2 expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>). Specifically, we have demonstrated that NF-ÎºB binds to the FMN2 promoter and is required for transcriptional repression. The NF-ÎºB family of transcription factors, and in particular RelA, has been shown to be activated by stresses such as expression of oncogenes, multiple forms of DNA damage, and hypoxia (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Culver etÂ al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Perkins, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, NF-ÎºB, when directly binding to its target promoters, can act as both an activator and a repressor of transcription, depending on posttranslational modifications and association with either coactivators or corepressor proteins (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Campbell and Perkins, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, NF-ÎºB/RelA and E2F1 have been shown previously to cooperate in the activation of other target promoters, such as EGR1 (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Zheng etÂ al., 2009</xref>), among others (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lim etÂ al., 2007</xref>). Our data now show that NF-ÎºB/RelA and E2F1, which have overlapping binding sites on the FMN2 promoter, can also act to repress transcription, identifying a shared target by these transcription factors. E2F1 and NF-ÎºB proteins are often deregulated in cancer and could account for the lack of FMN2 expression observed in certain cancer types. Further research is necessary to determine if additional control mechanisms are involved in the regulation of FMN2.</p>

        <title>FMN2 Regulates p21 Protein Levels during Oncogene Activation, DNA Damage, and Hypoxia</title>
        <p>Our results demonstrate that FMN2 plays an important role in p21 stabilization and reveal that activation of p21 requires a mechanism to actively prevent its rapid degradation. We suggest that this helps to ensure the efficient removal of p21 and prevent its accumulation, except when cells are acutely responding to stress. FMN2 is thus identified as an integral component of the p14ARF-p53 pathway that has a central role in regulating the response to oncogene activation, DNA damage, and hypoxia in human cells. We propose that all stress stimuli that induce cell-cycle arrest via p21 induction may also rely on FMN2 to prevent p21 degradation and hence allow p21 to accumulate to a level where it can promote cell-cycle arrest.</p>
        <p>p21 is an important cell-cycle inhibitor, which binds to and prevents the action of cyclin-dependent kinases (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abbas and Dutta, 2009</xref>). In addition, it also binds to PCNA and thereby impinges on DNA replication (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Li etÂ al., 1994</xref>). The p21 protein is a major transcriptional target for the tumor suppressor p53 (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zilfou and Lowe, 2009</xref>). Apart from transcriptional control, p21 protein levels are also influenced through both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent degradation pathways (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abbas and Dutta, 2009</xref>). Our analysis revealed that FMN2 prevents both degradation pathways from acting on p21 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>). Indeed, the reduction of p21 levels observed following FMN2 depletion by siRNA could be partially rescued with codepletion of either Skp2 or PA28Î³ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>). Importantly, a complete rescue of p21 levels was observed when FMN2 was depleted at the same time as the two different degradation pathways mentioned above. These data indicate that FMN2 is required to protect p21 from the action of pathways that depend on both Skp2 and PA28Î³. In addition, we observed that exogenous expression of FMN2 could stabilize the p21 protein, without changing the levels of p21 mRNA. Our analysis revealed that p21 and FMN2 form a complex in cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>F). We also found that the N terminus of human FMN2, which is poorly conserved between the human and mouse orthologs, is important for p21 stabilization (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S7</xref>G). We directly identified peptides from the N terminus of FMN2 in our mass spectrometry analysis. We note that the conserved, actin-binding formin repeats are located in the C terminus of the FMN2 protein. These data indicate an important function for the FMN2 protein that may be independent of the actin binding domain. Indeed, it remains possible that the FMN2 gene could give rise to separate isoforms with distinct functions.</p>
        <p>Our data suggest a new extension to the model for ARF tumor suppressor function; thus, while the current model highlights that upon oncogene activation p14ARF-mediated p53 stabilization upregulates p21 mRNA levels, we now show that ARF also transcriptionally upregulates expression of FMN2, independently of p53. In the extended model we present this role of FMN2 as critical to stabilize the p21 protein and allow it to accumulate by preventing its constitutive, rapid degradation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>E). We propose this revised model involving FMN2 applies generally to the other forms of stress that rely on p21 activation to promote cell-cycle arrest.</p>
        <p>Although we focus here on the nucleolar function of ARF, we noticed that FMN2 is also expressed throughout the cell, not only in nucleoli, as observed in a range of different cell types (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>). In this study we have concentrated on characterizing the role of FMN2 in the ARF pathway. In the future, however, it will be interesting to extend this proteomic analysis of ARF to evaluate more broadly downstream effects of ARF induction on protein levels and interactions throughout the cell. A major goal for future studies will now be to investigate in more detail the structure and function of the different domains of FMN2 and how these are regulated in conditions of malignancy.</p>

Data were acquired usin Xcalibur spftware, and quantification was performed using MS-Quant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://msquant.sourceforge.net/">http://msquant.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>) and Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) for peptide identification against the International Protein Index (IPI) human protein database. The initial mass tolerance was set to 7 ppm, and MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.5Â kDa. Enzyme was set to trypsin/p with three missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was searched as fixed modification, whereas N-acetyl-protein and oxidation of methionine were searched as variable modification. A minimum of two peptides was quantified for each protein.</p>

        <title>Cells and Transfections</title>
        <p>NARF2 and NARF2-E6 cell lines were provided by Dr. Gordon Peters (Cancer Research UK London Research Institute) and have been described previously (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Llanos etÂ al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rocha etÂ al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Stott etÂ al., 1998</xref>). NARF2 cells, a derivative of the human osteosarcoma U-2OS cells containing an isopropyl Î²-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible p14<sup>ARF</sup> gene, have been described previously (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Stott etÂ al., 1998</xref>). The NARF2-E6 cells are a derivative of NARF2 cells but contain, in addition, constitutively expressed human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein. MCF-10A and MCF-10A<sup>Src-ER</sup> were cultured as previously described (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos etÂ al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Schulze etÂ al., 2001</xref>). U2OS and HFFs were maintained at 5% CO2 in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Lonza), and 1% L-glutamine (Lonza). All plasmid transfections were performed using effectin (Invitrogen) or GeneJuice (MERCK).</p>

        <title>RNA Isolation and qPCR</title>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted using PeqGold total RNA extraction kit (Peqlab) and converted to cDNA using Quantitect Reverse transcription kit (QIAGEN). For quantitative PCR, Brilliant II Sybr green kit (Stratagene/Agilent), including specific MX3005P 96-well semiskirted plates, were used to analyze samples on the Mx3005P QPCR platform (Stratagene/Agilent). Actin was used as a normalizing gene in all experiments. FMN2 expression was analyzed using a one-step Brilliant II Sybr green QRT-PCR mix (Agilent) or using Brilliant II Sybr green kit (Stratagene/Agilent).

        <title>Cell Treatments</title>
        <p>Cells were incubated in 1% O<sub>2</sub> level in an InÂ Vivo 300 hypoxia workstation (Ruskin, UK) for 24Â hr. Cells were lysed for protein extracts and RNA extraction in the workstation to avoid reoxygenation. For DNA damage treatments, cells were treated with 10Â Î¼M etoposide (Enzo LifeSciences) for 24Â hr or exposed to 40 J/m<sup>2</sup> and harvested 4Â hr later. MG132 was purchased from Merck Chemicals and used at the final concentration of 50Â Î¼M.</p>

        <title>siRNA</title>
        <p>siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG and transfected using Interferin (Polyplus) as per the manufacturerâs instructions. In brief, cells were plated the day before transfection at the concentration of 2Â Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 6-well plates. The following day, cells were transfected with the final concentration of 5Â nM of siRNA oligonucleotides in fresh media, final volume of 2.2Â mL. Cells were incubated for additional 48Â hr prior to harvesting. IPTG was added for 24Â hr unless otherwise stated. siRNA sequences can be found in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Information</xref>.</p>

        <title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation</title>
        <p>Proteins were crosslinked with formaldehyde for 10Â min. Glycine (0.125 M) was added and cells washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10Â mM EDTA, 50Â mM Tris-HCL [pH 8.1], 1Â mM PMSF, 1Â mg/ml leupeptin, 1Â mg/ml aprotonin), followed by sonication and centrifugation. The supernatant was precleared with sheared salmon sperm DNA and protein G Sepharose beads (Sigma). The supernatant was incubated with specific antibodies overnight, and then with protein G Sepharose beads for 1Â hr. After an extensive wash step, the complexes were eluted with buffer (100Â mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1% SDS) and incubated with Proteinase K. DNA was purified using NBS polymerase chain reaction purification kit (NBS). PCR was performed for the FMN2 promoter.</p>

        <p>Determination of Nucleolar Protein Dynamics</p>
        <p>(A) The proteomes in three cell populations are encoded by incorporation of stable isotope derivatives of arginine (SILAC method). Cells are metabolically labeled with Arg0, Arg6, and Arg10 for at least five cell doublings and are then treated with IPTG for 0, 4, and 8Â hr or 0, 16, and 24Â hr to induce p14ARF, respectively. Cells are mixed and nucleoli purified and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The analysis is repeated three times with a common zero point.</p>
