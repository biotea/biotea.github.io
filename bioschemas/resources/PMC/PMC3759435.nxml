      <abstract>
        <p>Forkhead box (Fox) transcription factors are important regulators of cardiovascular development and several Fox-proteins have recently been shown to modulate embryonic and post-natal angiogenesis. However, the role of the FoxP subfamily, which is highly expressed in cardiovascular tissue, has not been investigated so far. Here, we show that the transcription factor FoxP1 is the highest expressed FoxP-protein in endothelial cells and that it is upregulated at the site of neovascularization during hindlimb ischemia in mice. Silencing of FoxP1 results in a strong inhibition of proliferation, tube formation and migration of cultured endothelial cells. Accordingly, knockdown of FoxP1 in zebrafish was followed by a disruption of intersomitic vascular formation. Using gene expression profiling, we show that FoxP1 induces a specific change of the endothelial transcriptome and functions as a suppressor of semaphorin 5B, which has previously been described as a neuronal inhibitory factor. Our findings now demonstrate that semaphorin 5B also acts as a FoxP1- dependent suppressor of endothelial cell proliferation, migration and sprouting, mediating the effects of FoxP1. In summary, our data indicate that the transcription factor FoxP1 is essential for the angiogenic function of endothelial cells and functions as a suppressor of the inhibitory guidance cue semaphorin 5B, suggesting an important function of FoxP1 in the regulation of neovascularization.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The development and growth of capillary and arterial blood vessels is a basic process in embryonic development as well as during physiological and pathophysiological processes in the adult organism, such as the neoplastic tumor growth, inflammation, wound healing and the adaptive response to tissue ischemia due to atherosclerotic vascular disease. The regulation of these adaptive processes is a complex event, orchestrated by transcriptional factors that regulate the expression of both pro- and anti-angiogenic genes <xref rid="pone.0070873-Carmeliet1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Recently, the Forkhead box (Fox) class of transcription factors was implicated in this process <xref rid="pone.0070873-Potente1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The Fox proteins constitute a large group of transcriptional regulators that are characterized by an evolutionary conserved âwinged helixâ DNA-binding domain <xref rid="pone.0070873-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The more than 100 different Fox-proteins are divided into subgroups based on their sequence homology and are of critical importance for different aspects of embryonic development and various postnatal cellular processes. So far, three families of Fox-proteins have been studied in the context of blood vessel development and neovascularization: the FoxO-family, FoxH1 and FoxC.</p>
      <p>First, following the discovery of embryonic lethality of FoxO1-deficient mice by Furuyama et al. <xref rid="pone.0070873-Furuyama1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, Potente and co-workers demonstrated that FoxO1 and FoxO3a are the strongest expressed FoxO-isoforms in endothelial cells and that both exhibit an inhibitory function on angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0070873-Potente1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. For FoxH1, Choi et al. recently showed that the VEGF-receptor-2 (flk1/kdr) has a conserved FoxH1 binding-site and that overexpression of this transcription factor in zebrafish embryos results in a disruption of vascular pattern formation <xref rid="pone.0070873-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Seo et al. described the role of FoxC1 in inhibiting corneal angiogenesis by regulating VEGF signalling <xref rid="pone.0070873-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Despite a strong expression in cardiovascular tissue and an important function in the development and adaptive remodelling of the endocardium <xref rid="pone.0070873-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the FoxP subgroup has not been studied in the context of blood vessel growth before. This small subgroup of the Fox family contains four members (FoxP1-4) that function predominantly as transcriptional repressors with very different functions in a diverse range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, ranging from speech development (FoxP2) <xref rid="pone.0070873-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> to immunomodulation in regulatory T-cells (FoxP3) <xref rid="pone.0070873-Kohlhaas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and cardiogenesis (FoxP1, FoxP4) <xref rid="pone.0070873-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Besides the winged-helix forkhead domain, the FoxP subgroup is characterized by a zinc-finger and a leucin-zipper motif in the N-terminus, allowing the formation of heterodimers with other forkhead proteins <xref rid="pone.0070873-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In the present study, we now show for the first time that FoxP1 is the highest expressed FoxP-family member in endothelial cells and study its function in endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis. This transcription factor was first identified by Li et al. <xref rid="pone.0070873-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and shows a strong expression in a wide selection of tissues, with the highest expression in lymphoid and gastrointestinal samples. It is expressed in at least four splice isoforms. Although sequence differences suggest potential functional differences between the isoforms, little is known about their distinct expression patterns and regulatory properties, which can differ between individual cell types. E.g. Foxp1A and Foxp1D repress the IL-2 promoter at similar levels in Jurkat cells, whereas Foxp1D is significantly stronger than Foxp1A in 293T cells <xref rid="pone.0070873-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In malignant neoplastic tissue, FoxP1 shows a heterogeneous expression pattern <xref rid="pone.0070873-Banham1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A special importance of FoxP1 in B-cell lymphopoiesis was recently identified by Hu et al. <xref rid="pone.0070873-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and overexpression of this transcription factor in a subset of diffuse large B cell lymphoma indicates a poor prognosis for this disease.</p>
      <p>FoxP1 was first mentioned In the cardiovascular field by Wang et al, describing the phenotype of genetic FoxP1 deficiency in mouse embryonic stem cells <xref rid="pone.0070873-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>: inactivation of Foxp1 resulted in severe cardiac defects, including defective ventricular and outflow tract septation and valve formation. While indirect observations, such as perivascular hemorrhage, indicated a potential involvement of FoxP1 in vascular development, the dominant cardiac phenotype did not allow a specific investigation of vascular growth in these embryos.</p>
      <p>Our data now indicate a pro-angiogenic role of FoxP1 on endothelial cell proliferation, migration and angiogenic tube formation as well as vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. In addition, we describe the modulation of the endothelial cell transcriptome by FoxP1, including the suppression of the inhibitory guidance molecule semaphorin 5B.</p>

        <p>To assess the potential involvement of FoxP transcription factors in endothelial biology, we first analyzed the baseline expression of FoxP1-4 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Microarray analysis of unstimulated HUVECs cultured under standard conditions showed that FoxP1 is the predominant FoxP isoform expressed in HUVECs, whereas FoxP4 shows the second highest expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070873-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

        <title>FoxP1 stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation</title>
        <p>As FoxP1 was highly expressed in endothelial cells and upregulated following induction of blood vessel growth in vivo, our next aim was to investigate the direct effect of FoxP1 on angiogenic endothelial cell function by loss-of-function and gain-of function experiments. Therefore we transfected HUVECs with siRNA against FoxP1 and achieved a sustained knockdown of FoxP1 mRNA and protein levels for up to 48 h by two different siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070873-g002">Figure 2</xref> A+B). This reduction of FoxP1-levels resulted in a strong attenuation of endothelial cell proliferation as assessed by BrdU-incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070873-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and a lower total tube length in the two-dimensional matrigel assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070873-g002">Figure 2</xref> D+E).

        <p>Our next step was to investigate the potential functional importance of FoxP1 for the regulation of blood vessel growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. FoxP1-deficient mice have been reported to die early during embryonic development due to cardiac malformations <xref rid="pone.0070873-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, prohibiting the selective investigation of vascular development in this model. As FoxP1 is evolutionary highly conserved among vertebrate species, we therefore investigated blood vessel formation in <italic>Tg (vegfr4:gfp)<sup>s843</sup></italic> transgenic zebrafish (danio rerio). This transgenic strain expresses green fluorescent protein under control of the endothelial-specific promoter of the VEGF-receptor kdr, allowing for direct observation of blood vessel formation using fluorescence microscopy. Two morpholinos (MOs) were designed to block mRNA-splicing of both FoxP1 paralogues (FoxP1a and FoxP1b) that exist in the zebrafish and resulted in either the generation of a mis-spliced band (MO1) or the reduction of wildtype FoxP1 transcript to 20% of uninjected controls (MO2). Development of the GFP-labeled blood vessels was observed in the live fish for 5 days.</p>
        <p>While the isolated knockdown of a single paralogue induced inconsistent morphological changes, the combined silencing of FoxP1a and FoxP1b by simultaneous injection of two MOs resulted in a specific and reproducible cardiovascular phenotype. In good correspondence with the previously published findings in mice and supporting the specificity of our approach, FoxP1a/b knockdown impaired cardiac development and resulted in a string-like heart with reduced cardiac fraction and pericardial effusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070873-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, we observed a consistent defect in vascular network formation: at day one post fertilization (dpf), silencing of FoxP1a and FoxP1b resulted in missing or misdirected intersomitic vessels (ISV) predominantly in the trunk. With the continuation of development, most ISVs of the trunk remained missing and most ISV that eventually sprouted from the dorsal aorta did not follow the normal intersomitic pathways, but penetrated intersomitic boundaries and even crossed the adjacent ISV before connecting to the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel. At three dpf, 90% of the morphants showed this aberrant ISV pattern that persisted until day 5, the last time point observed.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We describe the increased expression of the Forkhead box protein P1 during neovascularization and investigated for the first time the role of this transcription factor in endothelial cell biology. Our data indicates a role of FoxP1 as a stimulator of angiogenesis by promoting endothelial proliferation, migration and endothelial tube formation as well as its function as a suppressor of the inhibitory guidance cue semaphorin 5B.</p>
      <p>With FoxP1, we now add the first member of the FoxP-subfamily to the forkhead transcription factor group of vascular regulators. While the functional role of FoxP1 has so far been investigated in circulating cell populations and in neurons, we now describe for the first time a pro-angiogenic role of this transcription factor in endothelial cells. Using both loss of function as well as gain of function approaches, we found that FoxP1 stimulates the proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells in several established cell culture angiogenesis assays, indicating a significant regulatory function of FoxP1 in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells.</p>
      <p>Since FoxP1 deficiency results in early intra-uterine lethality in mice and the defective cardiac development in these embryos prohibits the characterization of the vascular phenotype, we used a kdr:GFP transgenic zebrafish line to investigate the importance of FoxP1 for vascular formation in vivo. In this organism, tissue oxygenation and vasculogenesis is independent of cardiac function during early embryonic development, enabling the study of vascular development under conditions of FoxP1 deficiency using morpholino-mediated knockdown.</p>
      <p>Indeed, next to the previously described impaired cardiac development, we observed a consistent defect in vascular pattern formation, predominantly of the truncal intersomitic blood vessels.</p>
      <p>Following these findings, our next step was to elucidate the mechanism by which this transcriptional regulator achieves these effects. Using microarray based analysis of endothelial cells after FoxP1 knockdown, we detected a specific modulation of the endothelial transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070873-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We selected genes for further analysis by a sequential approach: as FoxP1 is known to function predominantly as a transcriptional repressor <xref rid="pone.0070873-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, we focused primarily on genes upregulated after FoxP1 knockdown. This relatively short list of 10 genes, showed a very similar moderate degree of suppression, with a fold change between 2.0 and 2.25. Among this group was the inhibitory guidance protein semaphorin 5B, which we chose for further investigation because of the common link of semaphorins and FoxP1 to axonal guidance and neuronal pattern formation <xref rid="pone.0070873-Lett1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070873-Dasen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070873-DelliCarri1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This process of axonal path finding shares many regulatory mechanisms with vascular proliferation and pattern formation <xref rid="pone.0070873-Suchting1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070873-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and several mediators of vascular sprouting were subsequently discovered to exert a similar function in neuronal connectivity <xref rid="pone.0070873-Makita1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We now identified FoxP1 as an inhibitor of semaphorin 5B expression in endothelial cells and validated our primary microarray results on both mRNA and protein level, as semaphorin 5B levels increased rapidly after siRNA-mediated FoxP1 knockdown. While other studies on the regulatory functions of forkhead transcription factors frequently used overexpression of the transcription factor as the independent variable, we opted for a gene-silencing approach, as we already detected high endogenous FoxP1 levels under cell culture conditions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.</p>
      <p>Semaphorin 5B was first cloned by Adams and coworkers in 1996 <xref rid="pone.0070873-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and in the human fetus, this protein shows an intermediate expression in heart, brain, lung, kidney, ovary, testis, spinal cord, fetal liver and the fetal brain <xref rid="pone.0070873-Nagase1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The still growing family of semaphorins is characterized by the approximately 500 amino acid long sema domain, which is essential for their activity and receptor binding specificity <xref rid="pone.0070873-Feiner1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Semaphorin 5B was recently described as a repulsive neural guidance cue, which is proteolytically processed from its transmembrane form <xref rid="pone.0070873-Browne1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. While several semaphorin family members have already been shown to exert anti-angiogenic functions <xref rid="pone.0070873-GuttmannRaviv1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070873-Kessler1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070873-Basile1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, we now provide evidence for an inhibitory effect of semaphorin 5B on endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. Besides the sema-domain, class 5 semaphorins are characterized by additional thrombospondin repeats, similar to the type 1 TSP repeats found in thrombospondin-1 and -2, which could potentially mediate this anti-angiogenic function. These domains contain specific peptide sequences able to bind the endothelial cell surface receptor CD36, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070873-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our study describes a regulatory role of FoxP1 in adaptive neovascularization and demonstrates the modulation of anti-angiogenic gene expression as the potential mechanism of this FoxP1-function. However, the precise mechanism of FoxP1 regulatory function and the necessary co-factors in endothelial cells remain to be elucidated. Our results clearly demonstrate that knockdown of FoxP1 levels by siRNA-transfection in endothelial cells results in the upregulation of semaphorin 5B. Still, the semaphorin 5B promoter region region has not been characterized yet and a direct regulation by FoxP1 cannot be concluded from our data. If FoxP1 inhibits the anti-angiogenic function of this protein by direct binding to the semaphorin 5B promoter region or via an indirect regulatory element therefore remains to be elucidated. Although immunohistochemistry localized FoxP1 expression to endothelial cells in vivo, its expression is not cell type specific and regulatory functions in bone marrow derived cell populations are well described <xref rid="pone.0070873-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070873-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. As these circulating cells infiltrate ischemic tissue, a direct conclusion about the cell population responsible for the increase in FoxP1 expression after femoral artery ligation is not possible from our data.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our findings suggest an important pro-angiogenic function of the Forkhead box protein P1 by repressing the inhibitory guidance cue semaphorin 5B in endothelial cells.</p>
      <p>Further investigation of the common regulatory mechanisms of neuronal and vascular growth could yield more targets for the positive or negative modulation of blood vessel growth.</p>
