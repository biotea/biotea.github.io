      <abstract>
        <p>GPR56 is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Despite the importance of GPR56 in brain development, where mutations cause a devastating human brain malformation called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP), the signaling mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. Like many other adhesion GPCRs, GPR56 is cleaved via a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain into N- and C-terminal fragments (GPR56<sup>N</sup> and GPR56<sup>C</sup>); however, the biological significance of this cleavage is elusive. Taking advantage of the recent identification of a GPR56 ligand and the presence of BFPP-associated mutations, we investigated the molecular mechanism of GPR56 signaling. We demonstrate that ligand binding releases GPR56<sup>N</sup> from the membrane-bound GPR56<sup>C</sup> and triggers the association of GPR56<sup>C</sup> with lipid rafts and RhoA activation. Furthermore, one of the BFPP-associated mutations, L640R, does not affect collagen III-induced lipid raft association of GPR56. Instead, it specifically abolishes collagen III-mediated RhoA activation. Together, these findings reveal a novel signaling mechanism that may apply to other members of the adhesion GPCR family.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a family of noncanonical seven transmembrane spanning (7TM) receptors. There are a total of 33 members in the family in both humans and mice, present in almost every organ system with physiological functions in development, reproduction, immunity, neuronal and epithelial function, as well as tumorigenesis <xref rid="pone.0100043-Bjarnadottir1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Structurally, they are differentiated from other subgroups of GPCRs by the presence of an exceptionally long extracellular N-terminal region and juxtamembrane GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain <xref rid="pone.0100043-Arac1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0100043-Promel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Most members of the adhesion GPCRs undergo GAIN domain-mediated autoproteolytic process at the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS) motif to produce an N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment <xref rid="pone.0100043-Promel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Yona1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The biological significance of this autocleavage and its implication in receptor signaling remain largely unknown.</p>
      <p>GPR56 is one important member of the adhesion GPCR family, as mutations in GPR56 cause a devastating human brain malformation called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP) <xref rid="pone.0100043-Piao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Piao2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Additionally, GPR56 has also been reported to play a critical role in cancer progression by regulating angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0100043-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We recently discovered that collagen III is a ligand of GPR56 in the developing brain and that the binding of GPR56 to collagen III activates RhoA by coupling to GÎ±<sub>12/13</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0100043-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the context of cancer biology, GPR56 was shown to bind tissue transglutaminase (TG2). Although it is unclear whether the binding of TG2 to GPR56 triggers downstream signaling, deleting the binding site of TG2 in GPR56 activates PKCÎ± and elevates VEGF production in a melanoma cell line MC-1 <xref rid="pone.0100043-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying GPR56 signaling, including the importance of GPR56<sup>N</sup>-GPR56<sup>C</sup> interactions, remain poorly understood.</p>
      <p>To gain insight into GPR56 signaling, we explored the molecular mechanism of the activation of GPR56 signaling by collagen III using wild type GPR56 and its BFPP associated mutants. Our results demonstrate that collagen III binding causes the release of GPR56<sup>N</sup> from cell surfaces and induces GPR56<sup>C</sup> redistribution to detergent resistant membrane fragments (DRMs), the biochemical correlate of lipid rafts. Furthermore, L640 is an evolutionarily conserved amino acid in GPR56 across multiple species, and a BFPP-associated mutation at this amino acid residue, L640R, specifically abolishes collagen III-induced RhoA activation.</p>

        <p>Among the reported disease-associated GPR56 mutant alleles, we have previously shown that mutations in the N-terminus of GPR56 abolish ligand binding and mutations in the GPS motif affect GAIN domain-mediated GPR56 protein cleavage <xref rid="pone.0100043-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Luo2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. To further study the mechanism of the receptor signaling, we turned our attention to the three reported GPR56<sup>C</sup> mutants, E496K, R565W, and L640R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0100043-Piao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Piao2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Luo3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We hypothesized that normally expressed BFPP-causing mutants could provide insight into GPR56 signaling. In order to identify mutations that do not affect the level of cell surface expression, we performed biotinylation experiments. HEK293T cells transfected with wild type or mutant GPR56 were labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin, a membrane impermeable biotinylation agent. Thus, only cell surface-expressed proteins were labeled by biotin. The cells were lysed, and all biotinylated proteins were isolated by streptavidin affinity chromatography. Only the L640R mutant had a comparable level of GPR56<sup>C</sup> expression as the wild type GPR56 and was selected for further studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g001">Fig. 1B and C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Ligand Stimulation Triggers a Shift of GPR56<sup>C</sup> from Non-DRM to DRM Fractions in both Wild Type and L640R Mutant GPR56</title>
        <p>In recent decades, the original fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane proposed by Singer and Nichols has been challenged <xref rid="pone.0100043-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Instead of a relatively continuous and homogenous fluid of amphipathic lipids interspersed with a mosaic of proteins, it has been found that the plasma membrane contains nanoscale domains of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and membrane proteins, which together form what is referred to as âlipid raftsâ that function as receptor signaling platforms <xref rid="pone.0100043-Guirland1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Lingwood1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Lipid rafts are resistant to cold nonionic detergent treatment, causing them to float to the top fraction of isopycnic sucrose gradients; thus they are named detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) <xref rid="pone.0100043-Guirland1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0100043-Staubach1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Proteins that associate with lipid rafts are defined as those that co-fractionate with DRM fractions. Therefore, cold-detergent extraction and membrane fractionation have been extensively used to identify proteins associated with lipid rafts.</p>
        <p>It was recently reported that a low level of GPR56<sup>C</sup> is constitutively associated with membrane lipid rafts <xref rid="pone.0100043-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, it is not known whether there is a dynamic presence of GPR56 in the lipid raft upon ligand stimulation. We set out to test the hypothesis that lipid raft association is required for GPR56 signaling. HEK 293T cells transfected with GPR56 cDNA were stimulated with either collagen III or acetic acid for 5 minutes. The cells were lysed in the presence of detergent (1% Triton X-100) on ice and subjected to DRM fractionation. GPR56<sup>N</sup> is tethered non-covalently with GPR56<sup>C</sup> on the plasma membrane, and therefore is restrictedly present in the non-raft fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Consistent with a previous report <xref rid="pone.0100043-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, we did detect a low basal level of GPR56<sup>C</sup> in the lipid raft fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a significant shift of GPR56<sup>C</sup> from non-raft to lipid raft fractions upon collagen III stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>), indicating that GPR56 probably needs lipid rafts as a platform for its signal transduction.</p>

        <p>To examine whether the L640R mutation affects the GPR56<sup>C</sup> shift to a lipid raft upon ligand stimulation, DRM analysis was performed using this mutant receptor. Our result showed that the mutant GPR56<sup>C</sup> also translocated to lipid raft fractions after ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g002">Fig. 2</xref> C and D), similar to the behavior of wild type GPR56. This data indicated that this disease-associated C-terminal mutation does not disrupt collagen III-induced association of GPR56 with plasma membrane lipid nanodomains. Thus, collagen III binds both wild type and the L640R mutant, resulting in the C-terminal fragment associating with DRMs.</p>

Therefore, we hypothesized that the binding of collagen III activates RhoA by removing GPR56<sup>N</sup> from GPR56<sup>C</sup>. To test this hypothesis, we transfected <italic>Gpr56</italic> cDNA into SY5Y cells and stimulated the cells with collagen III or acetic acid as a control for 5 minutes. The cells were stained with antibodies against GPR56<sup>C</sup> or GPR56<sup>N</sup>. There was no significant change in the level of plasma membrane wild type or L640R mutant GPR56<sup>C</sup> upon collagen III binding as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g003">Fig. 3A, D, G, J</xref>), indicating that 5 min of stimulation does not induce GPR56<sup>C</sup> endocytosis. Interestingly, membrane-bound GPR56<sup>N</sup> was dramatically decreased upon collagen III treatment for both wild type and the L640R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g003">Fig. 3B, E, H, K</xref>). To quantify the reduction of cell surface GPR56<sup>N</sup> after collagen III treatment, we performed flow cytometry analysis. Indeed, compared to the control and consistent with panels AâL, collagen III stimulation caused a significant reduction of surface GPR56<sup>N</sup> in both wild type and L640 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g003">Fig. 3M and N</xref>). To exclude the possibility that GPR56<sup>N</sup> was internalized upon binding to collagen III, we subjected the cell conditioned media to western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g003">Fig. 3O</xref>, higher level of GPR56<sup>N</sup> was detected in collagen III treated cell conditioned media, indicating that the binding of collagen III releases GPR56<sup>N</sup> from cell plasma membrane.

        <title>Collagen III Stimulation does not Induce RhoA Activation in the L640R Mutant</title>
        <p>Thus far, L640R appears to behave like the wild type receptor in our assays, despite the fact that it confers a deleterious null phenotype in humans <xref rid="pone.0100043-Piao2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Parrini1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that the single amino acid change from Leucine to Arginine in the seventh transmembrane spanning abolishes the signaling capacity of the receptor upon ligand binding. To test this hypothesis, we performed a RhoA activation assay. HEK 293T cells were transfected with either wild type or L640R mutant <italic>Gpr56</italic> cDNA. The transfected cells were treated with either acetic acid or collagen III for 5 minutes, followed by GTP-Rho pull-down assay as previously described <xref rid="pone.0100043-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

To further confirm that the lack of RhoA activation associated with L640R mutant is GPR56 signaling specific, we measured RhoA activation in cells expressing wild type or L640R upon the addition of RhoA activator Calpeptin. L640R transfected cells demonstrated a robust RhoA activation upon Calpeptin treatment comparable to cells transfected with wild type GPR56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

        <title>L640, an Evolutionarily Conserved Amino Acid Residue, is Important for GPR56 Signaling</title>

These structures shed light on how GPCRs are activated, and indicate that there are major differences among the different GPCR families, especially in the ligand binding extracellular cavity.

      <p>Like most other adhesion GPCRs, GPR56 is autocatalytically cleaved through the GPS motif between amino acids histidine-381 and leucine-382 into N- and C-terminal fragments, GPR56<sup>N</sup> and GPR56<sup>C</sup>, respectively <xref rid="pone.0100043-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Shashidhar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Although mutations in the GPS domain disrupt this cleavage and cause human BFPP disease, the biological significance of this cleavage is not entirely clear. We previously showed that the cleaved GPR56<sup>N</sup> remains associated with GPR56<sup>C</sup> at the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0100043-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, work from Hallâs group showed that overexpression of GPR56<sup>C</sup> alone results in constitutive activation of RhoA <xref rid="pone.0100043-Paavola1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that the association of GPR56<sup>N</sup> and GPR56<sup>C</sup> keeps the receptor in an inactivated state, and the binding of collagen III activates the receptor by removing GPR56<sup>N</sup> from GPR56<sup>C</sup>. Indeed, our data show that collagen III treatment cause the releases of GPR56<sup>N</sup> from cell surface and the activation of RhoA.</p>
      <p>Lipid rafts are special microdomains on the cell plasma membrane, composed of a combination of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and membrane proteins. These specialized membranes mediate cellular processes by serving as organizing centers for the assembly of signaling molecules, influencing membrane protein trafficking, and regulating neurotransmission. Many membrane-localized signaling pathways have been reported to depend on association with lipid rafts including those activated by EGF, IgE, the T- and B-cell receptors, and CD40-mediated Akt phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0100043-Simons1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. A recent report showed a dynamic residence of the myeloid cell-specific adhesion GPCR EMR2 during signaling <xref rid="pone.0100043-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrated that collagen III treatment causes a shift of GPR56<sup>C</sup> from non-raft to raft fractions, suggesting that GPR56 probably signals most efficiently in these nanodomains. In contrary to the previous report, we also observed a similar shift in L640R mutant receptors upon ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>
<italic>In vitro</italic> characterization of GPR56 indicates that various BFPP-associated mutations disrupt its function through different mechanisms. Mutations in the tip of GPR56<sup>N</sup> renders the receptor inactive by abolishing ligand binding <xref rid="pone.0100043-Luo2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100043-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, whereas mutations at the GPS motif within the GAIN domain disrupt receptor function by abolishing the GAIN domain-mediated receptor autocleavage <xref rid="pone.0100043-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Previous biochemical studies have demonstrated that most disease-associated mutations reduce the surface expression of GPR56, with the exception of the L640R mutant that actually retains a high level of surface expression <xref rid="pone.0100043-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This reinforces the reasoning that there are probably other mechanisms responsible for the null phenotype associated with this mutation. In this study, we discovered that L640R mutant receptor behaves very similarly to the wild type GPR56 except in regards to collagen III-mediated RhoA activation. One possible explanation is that the L640R mutation disrupts coupling with GÎ±<sub>12/13</sub>, thereby abolishing RhoA signaling capabilities. As we did not directly measure collagen III binding to the L640R mutant, it is also formally possible that collagen III binding is compromised by this mutation, thereby blocking RhoA signal transduction. This seems implausible as collagen III treatment released GPR56<sup>N</sup> from the membrane-bound GPR56<sup>C</sup> as well as triggered a shift of GPR56<sup>C</sup> from non-DRM to DRM fractions in both wild type and L640R mutant GPR56.</p>

Amino acid sequence alignment revealed that L640 is evolutionarily conserved in GPR56, across multiple species, but not so in the majority of other adhesion GPCRs family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g005">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Taken together, it is possible that the mutation of Leucine to an Arginine may interfere with the activation of the receptor by creating a locked inactive receptor. The long and charged side chain of arginine may reach out to residues from other transmembrane helices of the receptor and become involved in new interactions that favor an inactive receptor conformation, abolishing the signaling ability of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100043-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Alternatively, L640 could be critical for GÎ±<sub>12/13</sub> docking to GPR56C, thereby rendering L640R incapable of signaling via RhoA.</p>
