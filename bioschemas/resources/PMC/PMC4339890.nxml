      <abstract>
        <p>Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a major pathway to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can display different types of broken ends. However, it is unclear how NHEJ factors organize to repair diverse types of DNA breaks. Here, through systematic analysis of the human NHEJ factor interactome, we identify PAXX as a direct interactor of Ku. The crystal structure of PAXX is similar to those of XRCC4 and XLF. Importantly, PAXX-deficient cells are sensitive to DSB-causing agents. Moreover, epistasis analysis demonstrates that PAXX functions together with XLF in response to ionizing radiation-induced complex DSBs, whereas they function redundantly in response to Topo2 inhibitor-induced simple DSBs. Consistently, PAXX and XLF coordinately promote the ligation of complex but not simple DNA ends <italic>in vitro</italic>. Altogether, our data identify PAXX as a new NHEJ factor and provide insight regarding the organization of NHEJ factors responding to diverse types of DSB ends.</p>

  <body>
    <p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), one of the most dangerous forms of DNA damage, are caused by aberrant replication and repair, programmed recombination and exposure to exogenous agents used in cancer therapies. Unrepaired DSBs can lead to apoptosis or senescence, whereas misrepaired DSBs can cause developmental defects, accelerated ageing and cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a major pathway for detection and repair of DSBs in mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The core factors mediating NHEJ are the Ku70/80 heterodimer (Ku), DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), XRCC4, DNA ligase IV (Lig4) and XRCC4-like factor (XLF, also called Cernunnos)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. For simple DSBs, these core factors are sufficient to recognize, align and ligate a pair of broken ends. However, for complex or âdirtyâ breaks, which have mismatched or covalently modified DNA ends, additional factors are required to modify the ends and facilitate their ligation. These factors include Artemis, DNA polymerases Î» and Î¼, terminal dinucletidyltrasferase, polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase, aprataxin (APTX) and APTXâpolynucleotide kinase-phosphatase-like factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. It remains unclear how these auxiliary factors are targeted to specific DSBs, in particular those with ends that contain densely clustered damage. It has been speculated that a fraction of NHEJ proceeds by a âtrial and errorâ process, in which sequential attempts at ligation and end processing by different enzymes are repeated until the substrate is cleaned for ligation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. This process requires a stable NHEJ complex to maintain the end-alignment. Many DSB repair proteins have been implicated in this role, including XRCC4 and its paralogue, XLF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p>
    <p>The XRCC4-like proteins, including XRCC4, XLF and SAS6, function as homodimers composed of an amino-terminal globular head domain and a carboxy-terminal coiled-coil stalk. All of these proteins play important scaffold roles by forming various high-order structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. XRCC4 and XLF can form super-helical filaments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, which have been shown to bridge, align or protect DNA ends<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In addition, they interact with Ku<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and Lig4 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), respectively, and can stimulate Lig4 activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Moreover, XLF preferentially stimulates the end joining of non-cohesive ends over cohesive ends<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, suggesting that it may be specifically needed for the repair of complex DNA ends.</p>
    <p>We have previously identified Rif1 as a novel NHEJ regulator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Here we perform systematic interactome analyses of human NHEJ factors and identify a novel XRCC4-like protein named paralogue of XRCC4 and XLF (PAXX). The crystal structure study reveals that PAXX forms a homodimer through its N-terminal domain that is structurally similar to XRCC4 and XLF. In contrast to XRCC4 and XLF, PAXX directly and strongly interacts with the Ku complex. Interestingly, PAXX and XLF cooperate to promote the ligation of non-cohesive but not blunt ends <italic>in vitro</italic>. Importantly, the epistasis analysis suggests that PAXX is upstream of XRCC4 and Lig4 in DSB repair, while PAXX and XLF display both epistatic and non-epistatic interactions that are dependent on the complexity of the DSB ends. Thus, our data reveal that PAXX is a new core NHEJ factor that plays a key role in the organization of NHEJ complexes for the repair of diverse types of DSB ends.</p>

        <title>PAXX is a new component of NHEJ</title>
        <p>We systematically expressed 19 Flag-tagged NHEJ proteins in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated their associated complexes using an anti-Flag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). A silver-stained gel of partial samples confirmed the high quality of the immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Mass spectrometry identified a novel protein, C9orf142, in the immunoprecipitates from 4 (XLF, Lig4, Ku70 and Ku80) of the 5 NHEJ core proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, lanes 2, 3 and 5â7) and 2 (DNA polymerases Î» and APTXâpolynucleotide kinase-phosphatase-like factor) of the 14 non-core NHEJ proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Immunoblotting of the Ku80-associated complex further validated this finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Based on the sequence and structural similarity to XRCC4 and XLF (see below), we renamed C9orf142 as PAXX. Silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, lane 4), mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) of the reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed the presence of major NHEJ proteins, including XLF, XRCC4, Lig4, Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs in the PAXX-associated complexes, demonstrating that PAXX is a new component of the NHEJ complex.</p>
        <p>NHEJ factors have been reported to relocalize to laser-induced DSB sites <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We expressed green fluorescent protein-fused PAXX in U2OS cells and induced DSBs with a micro-laser. Green fluorescent protein-PAXX relocalized to the DSB sites as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>), consistent with the biochemical results that PAXX is an NHEJ factor.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>PAXX forms a stable complex with Ku</title>
        <p>We noted that PAXX is enriched between 3- and 17-fold over other core NHEJ proteins examined in the Ku80-associated complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), suggesting that PAXX may interact with Ku more strongly than other NHEJ factors. In agreement with this notion, we found that the interaction between PAXX and Ku80 was more resistant to high salt treatment than those between PAXX and other NHEJ proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, lanes 4â7). Moreover, immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates of endogenous proteins showed that PAXX but not XRCC4 and XLF co-immunoprecipitated with Ku80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Interestingly, the three members of the XRCC4 family did not co-immunoprecipitate with one another in detectable quantities under our experimental conditions, which is inconsistent with a previous report showing that XRCC4 and XLF co-immunoprecipitate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. These data suggest that PAXX forms a more stable complex with Ku than with XRCC4, XLF and other NHEJ core factors.</p>

        <title>PAXX is structurally similar to XRCC4 and XLF</title>
        <p>Sequence homology searches using the BLAST algorithm showed that PAXX has no obvious similarity to any known proteins in the NCBI database. However, three-dimensional structure prediction with HHprep (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred#">http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred#</ext-link>) suggested that PAXX belongs to the same family as XRCC4 and XLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Specifically, PAXX protein is predicted to possess an N-terminal domain structure that is identical to XRCC4, XLF and SAS6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>); all of these proteins contain a globular head domain followed by a coiled-coil stalk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. To test this hypothesis, we determined the crystal structure of the PAXX N-terminal fragment (1â145) diffracted at 2.6âÃ (PDB 4WJA) using the SAD (single wavelength anomalous scattering) and MR (molecular replacement) methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). The space groups for both data sets were P6<sub>5</sub>22, with two molecules in each asymmetric unit. As predicted, the N-terminal domain of PAXX was highly similar to those of XLF and XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Seven Î²-strands (S1âS7) and three helixes (H1âH3) were observed in the PAXX 1â145 structure, in which a globular head domain and a coiled-coil stalk formed a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), consistent with the observation that PAXX 1â145 exists primarily as a dimer in solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Compared with XLF, PAXX showed more structural similarities to XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Different values for the angle between the head domain and H3 have been reported for XLF and XRCC4. The C terminus of XLF folds back to the linkage point between the head domain and H3, and elevates the head domain, forming a 90Â° angle between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In XRCC4 and PAXX, the angle between the head domain and H3 is only ~45Â° due to a lack of tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In addition, compared with XRCC4 and XLF, PAXX has a much shorter coiled-coil stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). The extended stalk of XRCC4 is required for Lig4 binding, implicating that the N-terminal domain of PAXX may lack the ability to bind Lig4.</p>
        <p>The database of the Human Protein Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/">http://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>) shows that PAXX is widely expressed in all human tissues, with particularly high expression in the blood and immune system. PAXX is present in all vertebrates but is absent in most invertebrates and in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This evolutionary distribution of PAXX differs from that of XRCC4 and XLF, which are conserved from yeast to vertebrates. PAXX appears to co-evolve with DNA-PKcs and Artemis, which implies that PAXX may function in a manner similar to DNA-PKcs and Artemis in joining the complex but not the simple DNA ends<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>

        <title>PAXX interacts with NHEJ factors via its C-terminal region</title>
        <p>Unlike the N-terminal domain structure that is shared among XRCC4 family members, C-terminal regions (CTRs) are more divergent and show little sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The C-terminal-conserved region of PAXX, similar to that of XLF, localizes at the end of C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.

We found that the CTR motif of PAXX is similarly required for these associations, because the deletion (AA 1â170) and point mutation (RRR177â179AAA, IN186â187AA or F201A) of the PAXX-CTR completely abolished its interaction with Ku and XRCC4, as well as Lig4 and DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Moreover, the F201A mutation also disrupted the localization of PAXX at laser-induced DSBs and compromised its exclusively nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). These data support the notion that PAXX and XLF may interact with common factors in the NHEJ pathway and imply that the two proteins may have overlapping functions.</p>

        <title>PAXX forms a complex with DNA-bound Ku</title>
        <p>It has been shown that the interaction between XLF and the Ku complex is mediated by DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. We found that the addition of ethidium bromide, which intercalates into DNA and interferes with DNAâprotein interactions, to cell lysates strongly reduced the association between PAXX and other NHEJ proteins, including Ku (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). These data suggest that PAXX and XLF share another common featureâthey both use DNA to mediate their interactions with Ku.</p>
        <p>We investigated how DNA mediates the interaction between PAXX and Ku. One possibility is that DNA acts as a bridge between proteins. We do not favour this possibility, because PAXX showed no detectable binding activity for DNA up to 315âbps in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a,b</xref>). This feature differs from its paralogues XRCC4 and XLF, which possess length-dependent DNA-binding activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (see DNA-binding activity of XLF in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8c,d</xref>). The finding that PAXX differs from its paralogues in terms of the DNA-binding characteristics implies that it may have a unique function in the NHEJ pathway.</p>
        <p>Another mechanism by which DNA may facilitate the PAXXâKu interaction is that DNA binding may alter the conformation of Ku to favour an interaction with PAXX. One prediction of this hypothesis is that PAXX would be capable of interacting with the DNA end-bound Ku complex. Consistent with this prediction, PAXX supershifted the DNA-bound Ku complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> lane 2) but not free DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, lanes 3â6). As a control, no supershift was observed for the PAXX-CTR domain mutant F201A, which is defective in its association with Ku in co-IP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, lanes 7â10). These results suggest that PAXX can interact with DNA-bound Ku through its CTR domain to form a DNAâKuâPAXX tertiary complex at DNA ends. This feature resembles that of XLF, which can form similar DNAâKuâXLF tertiary complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Thus, the two XLF paralogues form similar complexes at DNA ends to promote DNA end joining, which may explain why they have redundant functions in repairing Topo2 inhibitor-induced DSBs.</p>

        <title>PAXX promotes the assembly of the NHEJ complex</title>
        <p>The above data suggest that XLF and PAXX can each form a tertiary complex with DNA-bound Ku. This phenomenon prompted us to investigate whether each protein can be assembled into the tertiary complex pre-formed by its paralogue to produce a quaternary complex. Consistent with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, XLF supershifted the band corresponding to the DNA-bound Ku complex to produce a band corresponding to the DNAâKuâXLF tertiary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, lanes 2â5 and lane 12). PAXX further supershifted this band to produce a slower mobility band, which probably represents the DNAâKuâXLFâPAXX quaternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, lanes 13â15 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Notably, the addition of PAXX significantly reduced the amount of tertiary complex but not of the DNAâKu complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>), suggesting that the incorporation of XLF into the DNAâKu complex promotes the subsequent binding of PAXX. In the reciprocal experiment, XLF similarly supershifted a preformed DNAâKuâPAXX tertiary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, lane 6) to produce the DNAâKuâXLFâPAXX quaternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, lanes 7â10). Moreover, XLF substantially reduced the amount of tertiary complex but only modestly affected the amount of the binary (DNAâKu) complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, lanes 7â10 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>), indicating that the assembly of PAXX into the DNAâKu complex also facilitated subsequent binding by XLF. Together, these data suggest that the two XLF paralogues can cooperate to assemble a DNAâKuâXLFâPAXX quaternary complex at DNA ends. This quaternary complex is more stable than either tertiary complex, which explains why both XLF and PAXX are required for a stable NHEJ complex to repair IR-induced DSB ends.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we performed interactome analyses of the human NHEJ pathway and identified PAXX as a new component of this pathway. PAXX stably interacts with the DNA end-bound Ku complex, cooperates with XLF to stimulate non-cohesive DNA end ligation <italic>in vitro</italic> and is required for cellular resistance to DSB-causing agents <italic>in vivo</italic>. Genetic analyses further demonstrated that PAXX and the XRCC4âLig4 complex work in a common pathway to repair DSBs induced by IR, bleomycin and Topo2 inhibitors.</p>
      <p>PAXX shares structural and functional similarities with its paralogues XRCC4 and XLF; they all possess the same N-terminal domains, can stably assemble into a DNA-end-bound NHEJ complex, can rapidly relocalize to DSBs and can promote cellular resistance to DSB-inducing agents. Structurally, the N-terminal domain of PAXX is more similar to that of XRCC4, as both exhibit a 45Â° angle between the head domain and the helix stalk. Conversely, the C-terminal domain of PAXX is more similar to that of XLF, as indicated by the fact that both can directly interact with DNA-bound Ku.</p>
      <p>The finding that the inactivation of PAXX, XRCC4 and XLF in DT40 cells resulted in cellular hypersensitivity to agents causing DSBs indicates that each protein must have at least one unique role in the NHEJ pathway that cannot be substituted by its paralogues. One unique feature of PAXX is that it shows a strong association with Ku but no detectable direct association with Lig4. This characteristic differs from XRCC4, which stably associates with Lig4, and from XLF, which weakly associates with both Ku and XRCC4. Another unique feature of PAXX is that it is present in vertebrates but absent in yeast and most invertebrates, unlike XRCC4 and XLF, which are present in all eukaryotes. Another NHEJ factor that shows a similar evolutionary distribution is DNA-PKcs, which mediates the joining of complex but not simple ends in V(D)J recombination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. It is possible that PAXX co-evolved with DNA-PKcs to repair DSBs with more sophisticated ends in higher eukaryotes.</p>
      <p>The observation that PAXX and Ku can form a stable complex suggests that they work together in the NHEJ pathway. Consistent with this suggestion, our genetic data showed that similar to Ku, PAXX may act upstream of the XRCC4âLig4 complex. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that mutations in PAXX suppress the IR sensitivity of XRCC4 or Lig4 mutant DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), which mimics previous findings that the Ku mutation suppresses the phenotype of Lig4 mutations in DT40 cells and mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. One model to explain the observed genetic suppression is that without Lig4 or XRCC4, the NHEJ pathway is inactive and DSBs are channelled to alternative DSB repair pathways, including HR and microhomology-mediated end joining<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. However, binding of the PAXXâKu complex to DNA ends protects the ends against resection, and thus inhibits the alternative pathways. The deletion of either PAXX or Ku releases the block and allows resection and alternative repair reactions to occur, thus suppressing the mutant phenotypes of Lig4 or XRCC4.</p>
      <p>PAXX is closely related to XLF; both proteins can interact with the DNA end-bound Ku complex through their C-terminal domains and stimulate the ligation of non-cohesive DNA ends. Interestingly, genetic studies have revealed that the two proteins work through different mechanisms to promote cellular resistance to different types of DSBs induced by various agents. For IR-induced DSBs that carry DNA ends that are more complex or âdirtyâ (with many chemical modifications)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, the two proteins work in the same pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). However, for DSBs with DNA ends that are âcleanâ or have fewer modifications, such as those produced by Topo2 inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and processed by TDP2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>), the two proteins act in parallel pathways. One hypothesis to explain the difference is that the âdirtyâ ends require a more stable complex to maintain their alignment and to allow a âtrial and errorâ process by different enzymes to remove the complex covalent modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Both PAXX and XLF may be required to constitute such a stable complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). PAXX may first be recruited to DNA-bound Ku, because PAXX has a more stable association with the Ku complex than XLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c,e</xref>). This process results in the subsequent recruitment of XLF to form the PAXXâDNAâKuâXLF complex, which stabilizes the complex and enables the assembly of other NHEJ factors. For âcleanâ ends, the âtrial and errorâ process is not needed and, therefore, one XLF or PAXX protein may be sufficient to maintain the end alignment for ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). This finding is consistent with our biochemical observation that PAXX and XLF can be assembled individually into a DNA-bound Ku complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, our biochemistry data showed that PAXX and XLF cooperated to stimulate the ligation of complex (non-cohesive) but not simple (blunt) DNA ends. Thus, PAXX and XLF have both cooperative and redundant functions that are dependent on the complexity of the DSB ends.</p>
      <p>Altogether, our data provide new insight into the process of NHEJ factor organization and assembly in response to different DSBs that arise in a variety of ways.</p>

Se-derivative crystals were observed in a solution of 2.24âM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 0.1âM Bis-Tris, pH 5.5. After dehydration and cryo-protection in 50% glycerol, the crystals were flash-cooled using liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data were collected at 100âK at SSRF (Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility) beamline BL17U1 and processed using HKL2000 software. The selenium sites were discovered via SHELX using the single-wavelength anomalous scattering method. The initial phase was generated using AutoSol in PHENIX. AutoBuild was used alternately to improve the electron density map and generate the model. Approximately 90% of the residues in the protein were built automatically and additional missing residues were added manually in COOT and refined with PHENIX. The native structure was determined via Phaser using the MR method. The Se-derivative structure was used as the initial model. The final structure was refined using PHENIX. In the Ramachandran plot generated using PROCHECK, 94.4% and 4.8% of the amino acids in the final atomic model were in the most favourable and additional allowed regions, respectively.
