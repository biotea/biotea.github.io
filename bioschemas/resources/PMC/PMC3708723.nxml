        <p>Oxidation of cysteine residues to disulfides drives import of many proteins into the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Recent studies in yeast unraveled the basic principles of mitochondrial protein oxidation, but the kinetics under physiological conditions is unknown. We developed assays to follow protein oxidation in living mammalian cells, which reveal that import and oxidative folding of proteins are kinetically and functionally coupled and depend on the oxidoreductase Mia40, the sulfhydryl oxidase augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), and the intracellular glutathione pool. Kinetics of substrate oxidation depends on the amount of Mia40 and requires tightly balanced amounts of ALR. Mia40-dependent import of Cox19 in human cells depends on the inner membrane potential. Our observations reveal considerable differences in the velocities of mitochondrial import pathways: whereas preproteins with bipartite targeting sequences are imported within seconds, substrates of Mia40 remain in the cytosol for several minutes and apparently escape premature degradation and oxidation.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Disulfide bonds stabilize protein folds and complexes, regulate protein functions, and contribute to the distribution of proteins in specific cellular compartments. In eukaryotic cells cysteines are oxidized to disulfide bonds in two compartments that harbor dedicated enzymatic machineriesâthe endoplasmic reticulum and the intermembrane space of mitochondria (IMS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Stojanovski <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Riemer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Disulfide bond formation in both compartments takes place by similar principles: an oxidoreductase that contains an oxidized dicysteine motif interacts with reduced substrates and introduces disulfide bonds within these substrates. Consequently, the oxidoreductase becomes reduced and is reoxidized by a sulfhydryl oxidase, which couples de novo disulfide bond formation ultimately to the electron acceptor oxygen using the cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Stojanovski <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Riemer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Oxidative protein folding in the mitochondrial IMS presumably is coupled to protein import (oxidation-dependent import; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Chacinska <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Riemer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Herrmann and Riemer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Endo <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Sideris and Tokatlidis, 2010</xref>). The mechanism of disulfide bond formation has been characterized in molecular detail in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> using purified proteins and isolated mitochondria. The oxidoreductase and the sulfhydryl oxidase of the IMS are the essential proteins Mia40 and Erv1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Lisowsky <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Chacinska <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Naoe <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Mesecke <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Banci <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Proteins that follow the pathway for oxidation-driven import are typically &lt;15 kDa and form simple helix-loop-helix structures in which the antiparallel helices are connected by two disulfide bonds. Larger IMS proteins are often synthesized with so-called bipartite presequences, which direct these proteins to the general matrix-targeting import pathway, from which they deviate into the IMS by a stop-transfer mechanism at the level of the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Chacinska <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Substrates of the oxidation-dependent import pathway contain a Mia40-binding signal, also called MISS or ITS sequence, that is essential for their import into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Milenkovic <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Sideris <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Mia40 and Erv1 transfer electrons via cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase to oxygen, from which water is produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Allen <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Farrell and Thorpe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bihlmaier <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Dabir <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). At least in vitro, efficient Mia40-mediated protein oxidation relies on the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bien <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Basically all our knowledge of the mitochondrial disulfide relay is deduced from studies with mitochondria isolated from yeast cells. Only little is known about the mechanisms of disulfide bond formation in the mammalian IMS. The human homologues of Mia40 and Erv1 are Mia40 (also CHCHD4) and augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR; also growth factor erv1-like), respectively. Together Mia40 and ALR can mediate disulfide bond formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Banci <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Daithankar <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Purified ALR can interact with cytochrome <italic>c</italic> or oxygen to become oxidized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Farrell and Thorpe, 2005</xref>). Upon Mia40 depletion in human tissue culture cells, the levels of selected disulfide-containing IMS proteins decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Hofmann <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Moreover, Mia40 and ALR can replace their yeast counterparts, implying functional homology of the mammalian and yeast pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Chacinska <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Di Fonzo <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The absence of assays to assess disulfide bond formation in the IMS in intact cells prevented the investigation of oxidation-dependent import under physiological conditions. Here we establish an assay based on a pulse-chase approach coupled to a subsequent redox state determination and immunoprecipitation of specific proteins. The assay allows determination of protein oxidation in intact cells, which reveals half-time values of â¼8 min. Thus preproteins remain in the cytosol for a considerable time, during which they are protected from degradation and unwanted oxidative folding. We also find evidence that it is not targeting to mitochondria or electron transfer from Mia40 that define the kinetics of the overall process but instead recognition and folding of substrates by Mia40. Moreover, we define the contributions of ALR and the cellular glutathione system to oxidative folding in the IMS. Surprisingly, we find that, contrary to previous results from experiments with isolated yeast mitochondria, oxidation-dependent import in intact cells is strongly dependent on the mitochondrial membrane potential, which reveals an unexpected connection between the energetic state of mitochondria and the oxidation-dependent protein import into mitochondria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>In intact cells the kinetics of oxidative protein folding in the mitochondrial IMS can be followed by an oxidation assay</title><p>Protein import into the IMS mainly has been assessed in the model system <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and by in vitro approaches. We aimed to investigate this pathway in intact mammalian cells. To this end, we established a pulse-chase immunoprecipitation approach coupled to redox-state determination (âoxidation assayâ), which we applied to the twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C protein Cox19. Cox19 contains four cysteine residues that, if present in their reduced form, are accessible to modification with 4-acetamido-4â²-maleimidylstilbene-2,2â²-disulfonic acid (AMS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 1). Changes in the migration behavior of modified proteins in SDSâPAGE allow distinguishing between different redox forms of a protein. Cox19 is completely localized to mitochondria (Supplemental Figure S1), where the four cysteines form two disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 3).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Oxidative folding of Cox19 proceeds with a half-time of 8 min in intact mammalian cells. (A) In intact cells Cox19 is oxidized. Cells were precipitated with TCA, and samples were treated with TCEP, TCEP plus AMS, or only AMS (steady state). The Cox19 redox state was analyzed by SDSâPAGE and immunoblotting (WB). (B) Scheme of the oxidation assay to follow oxidative folding in intact cells. Cells are pulse labeled for 5 min with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and chased with cold methionine for different times. The chase is stopped by TCA precipitation, and then the lysate is treated with AMS to determine protein redox states, followed by IP against the protein of interest. Eluates are analyzed by Tris-Tricine-PAGE and autoradiography. Reduced Cox19 is modified with four AMS, whereas oxidized Cox19 remains unmodified. (C) Newly synthesized Cox19 becomes oxidized with a half-time of 8 min in HEK293 and HeLa cells. Experiments were performed as described in B, using an antibody against Cox19. Reported values are the mean of six independent experiments. (D) Mature Cox19 is oxidized during the duration of the entire oxidation assay. Experiments from C were analyzed by WB against Cox19. (E) The human twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C protein family consists of 31 members, 14 of which are conserved from yeast, whereas 17 are novel additions in higher eukaryotes. For a complete list of the members of the twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C family see Supplemental Table S1. Proteins of the twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C family contain diverse cysteine motifs, exemplified by Cmc1, Cmc3, and NDUFA8. (F) Oxidation of Cmc1-HA, Cmc3-HA, and NDUFA8-HA can be followed using the oxidation assay. Experiments were performed as described in B, using an antibody against the HA epitope tag. The indicated proteins were expressed in stable, inducible cell lines (see Supplemental Figure S1 for their localization to mitochondria). Reported values are the mean of two independent experiments. Error bars in all graphs are means Â± SD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2160fig1"/></fig><p>We performed the oxidation assay as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Cells were radioactively labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine for 5 min, followed by different chase times in medium containing nonradioactive methionine. The chase was stopped by rapid acidification using trichloroacetic acid (TCA), which prevents thiolâdisulfide exchange reactions. Subsequently, proteins were modified by AMS. Finally, endogenous Cox19 was immunoprecipitated using a specific antibody and analyzed by SDSâPAGE and autoradiography. Using this assay, we found that newly synthesized Cox19 was almost completely reduced directly after the pulse and became oxidized during the subsequent chase with a half-time of 8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Mature Cox19 (and thus nonradioactive protein) that was also precipitated in the assay was oxidized over the whole chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Whereas the number of twin-CX<sub>3</sub>C proteins is conserved between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, a recent in silico study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Cavallaro, 2010</xref>) identified 28 potential twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C proteins in the human genome, compared with the 14 twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C proteins in yeast. We extended this analysis and identified three additional potential twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C proteins, bringing their total number in human cells to 31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> and Supplemental Table S1). Thus human cells harbor more than twice the number of twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C proteins as yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Longen <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Many of these proteins contain additional cysteine residues outside the twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C motif. To test whether the oxidation kinetics observed with Cox19 is also valid for proteins with different cysteine patterns, we performed the oxidation assay on three additional proteins: Cmc1 (cysteine pattern: CX<sub>9</sub>CC-CX<sub>9</sub>C-C), Cmc3 (CX<sub>9</sub>CX<sub>9</sub>CX<sub>9</sub>C), and NDUFA8 (CX<sub>9</sub>C-CX<sub>9</sub>C-CX<sub>9</sub>C-CX<sub>9</sub>C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). To this end, we generated stable, inducible cell lines that express hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged variants of these proteins and compared the import with a cell line expressing HA-tagged Cox19. For all IMS-localized proteins investigated in this study (twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C proteins, Mia40 variants, ALR, Smac) we used stable, inducible cell lines because transient or constitutive overexpression of the proteins resulted in their mislocalization to the cytosol (for the establishment of expression conditions and cellular localizations see Supplemental Figures S1âS3). The HA tag did not interfere with the localization of Cox19 to mitochondria, and we also found that the three selected twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C proteins localized to mitochondria, indicating that these proteins are indeed twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C proteins (Supplemental Figure S1). Of note, the tagged and overexpressed proteins became oxidized with comparable kinetics that was slightly slower than that of endogenous Cox19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). The oxidation of NDUFA8 proceeded through a semioxidized intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, 4 AMS bound) that is probably a form in which one twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C motif has been fully oxidized, whereas the second one still is reduced. Due to its two twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C motifs the kinetics of NDUFA8 oxidation to the fully oxidized protein proceeded only at about half the rate of Cox19. Taken together, we established an assay to follow the oxidation kinetics of IMS-localized, disulfide-containing proteins in intact cells. Because all twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C proteins that we tested behaved in a similar way, we decided to focus in subsequent experiments on Cox19.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Mia40 is critical and limiting for oxidative folding in the IMS of intact mammalian cells.

To elucidate whether the machinery that mediates disulfide bond formation has only a limited capacity, we performed competition experiments in which we analyzed Cox19 oxidation while concomitantly overexpressing NDUFA8 (two twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C motifs), Cmc3 (one twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C motif), or Smac (import independent of Mia40), respectively. Whereas Smac overexpression did not impair Cox19 oxidation, the overexpression of both Cmc3 and NDUFA8 delayed the oxidation of Cox19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This suggests that twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C proteins compete with each other for oxidation-dependent import, most likely at the level of the oxidoreductase Mia40.</p><p>To investigate the relevance of the levels of human Mia40 for protein import, we established the small interfering RNA (siRNA)âmediated knockdown of Mia40 (Supplemental Figure S2, A and B), as well as an overexpression protocol for Mia40 in stable, inducible cell lines (Supplemental Figure S2, C and D). Mia40 could be depleted to levels &lt;10% compared with control siRNAâtreated cells, and the levels of substrate proteins were lowered compared with control siRNAâtreated cells (Supplemental Figure S2B). For Mia40 overexpression we used cells expressing either wild-type Mia40 (Mia40<sup>WT</sup>) or a Mia40 variant that lacks the redox-active CPC motif (Mia40<sup>SPS</sup>). Both proteins were overexpressed by â¼20-fold and localized to mitochondria (Supplemental Figure S2, C and D).</p><p>Under conditions of Mia40 depletion, we found a strong impairment of Cox19 oxidation to â¼20% of the rate found upon control siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of Mia40<sup>WT</sup> increased the initial oxidation rate of Cox19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), whereas overexpressed Mia40<sup>SPS</sup> almost completely prevented the oxidation of Cox19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). It has to be emphasized that overexpression of both Mia40 variants took place in cells that still contain endogenous Mia40 and that our overexpression protocol ensured that levels of endogenous Mia40 remained comparable in all cells (Supplemental Figure S2D). This indicates that Mia40<sup>SPS</sup> functions as a dominant-negative mutant for Cox19 oxidation. Taken together, our results show that in vivo the levels of redox-active Mia40 are critical for Cox19 oxidation rather than the diffusion time of newly synthesized precursor proteins to mitochondria.</p><p>Our data could indicate that Cox19 and Mia40 interact for a prolonged time. Mia40âsubstrate complexes could be observed under steady-state conditions in intact yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bottinger <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). It remained unclear, however, whether these interactions are long lasting. To trace Mia40-Cox19 complexes in vivo, we pulse labeled newly synthesized proteins in cells stably expressing Cox19-HA and then performed an immunoprecipitation (IP) against Mia40 followed by a second IP on the eluate against HA (i.e., Cox19-HA). Under nonreducing conditions we detected a mixed Mia40-Cox19 dimer of â¼30 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 2, arrowhead), which disappeared upon treatment with dithiothreitol (DTT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 3, circle). After chase times of 20 min this dimer disappeared almost completely, indicating that the Mia40-Cox19 dimer represented a reaction intermediate during Cox19 oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2).</p><p>Oxidative folding often is accompanied by misoxidation (i.e., generation of nonnative disulfide bonds) or the accumulation of trapped substrateâoxidoreductase complexes. In the endoplasmic reticulum reduced glutathione takes a prominent role in correcting these nonnative disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chakravarthi <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). We proposed a similar role for glutathione in oxidative folding in the yeast IMS based on in vitro reconstitution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bien <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The glutathione redox state in the IMS of human cells has not been systematically assessed. Thus we first applied a method using redox-sensitive, green fluorescent protein (roGFP)âbased sensor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Gutscher <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) that we recently established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Kojer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) to investigate the glutathione pools of cytosol, IMS, and matrix. The glutathione redox potential in all three compartments was similarly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), with values of â296, â292, and â289 mV for cytosol, IMS, and matrix, respectively. This again supports that protein oxidation in the IMS is not the consequence of changes in the redox environment compared with the cytosol but instead the consequence of an enzymatically catalyzed process. When glutathione reductase was inhibited with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) to deplete cells from reduced glutathione, a slightly more oxidized steady-state glutathione redox potential was observed in the matrix, and recovery after hydrogen peroxide treatment was strongly delayed in all three compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3, BâD</xref>), particularly in the IMS and the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, C and D</xref>).</p><p>Next we tested whether reduced glutathione facilitates oxidative folding by Mia40 and ALR. To this end, we treated cells with BCNU and applied the oxidation assay. Under these conditions we found a clear decrease of the Cox19 oxidation rate compared with control treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>; similar results for Cmc1 and Cmc3, Supplemental Figure S2E). Cox19 is a substrate with a simple fold, and thus the beneficial influence of reduced glutathione on protein oxidation might be more prominent when analyzing more complex substrates. We do not know any Mia40 substrates with complex disulfide patterns. However, the twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C protein NDUFA8 contains two twin-CX<sub>9</sub>C motifs in its structure and thus might be suited to further investigate the role of the glutathione pool in oxidative folding. When we compared the oxidation kinetics of NDUFA8 in the presence and absence of BCNU, we again observed a clear delay of oxidative folding upon inhibition of the glutathione reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Taking the results together, we have defined Mia40 as critical determinant of the oxidation rate in intact cells. Moreover, we have found that the reducing glutathione milieu contributes to the efficiency of oxidative folding in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>ALR is critical for oxidative folding and competes with substrates for interaction to Mia40</title><p>To investigate the role of the human Erv1 homologue ALR, we established protocols for siRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression (Supplemental Figure S3, AâE). Although silencing depleted the levels of ALR to levels &lt;10%, levels of cysteine-rich IMS proteins, including Mia40, were found unchanged, indicating that ALR levels are not as limiting for their biogenesis as are the levels of Mia40 (Supplemental Figure S3B). Overexpression in stable, inducible cell lines resulted in an increase of ALR levels by a factor of 10 (Supplemental Figure S3C). Upon depletion of ALR, the oxidation rate of Cox19 decreased to â¼50% of control siRNA rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Surprisingly, also upon overexpression of ALR the oxidation rate of Cox19 decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Using DTT titration experiments, we could exclude that this slower oxidative folding was caused by Mia40 overoxidation that might have impaired a potential isomerization function of Mia40 (Supplemental Figure S3F). Instead we found that ALR competes with substrates for binding to Mia40. When we assessed the interaction of Mia40 with Cox19 in the presence of different ALR levels, we observed that upon overÂ­expression of ALR the amount of Cox19 bound to Mia40 was diminished compared with the control situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). Consistently, we found that a larger fraction of endogenous Mia40 was bound to ALR upon ALR overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). These findings are in line with in vitro data showing that ALR reoxidizes Mia40 by interacting with the substrate-binding cleft of Mia40 and that Mia40 only interacts with either ALR or its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Banci <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The final electron acceptor for the formation of disulfide bonds is molecular oxygen. To test whether modulations of the oxygen tension influence the kinetics of oxidation in the IMS, we investigated oxidative folding at 1 and 20% oxygen. Of interest, we did not observe a significant difference in the kinetics, indicating that oxidation-dependent import is not affected by changes in oxygen tension in this range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). This finding, together with the long interaction of substrates and Mia40, suggests that folding and not oxidation constitutes the rate-limiting step of oxidation-dependent import. Thus we propose that small changes in the oxidation kinetics do not result in changed rates of overall oxidation-dependent import if folding still proceeds more slowly than the oxidation step. Taking the results together, we find ALR to be a critical determinant of the oxidation rate. Its amounts have to be carefully balanced because too high as well as too low amounts of ALR result in reduced oxidative folding rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxidation-dependent protein import couples posttranslational translocation with oxidative folding</title><p>To test how the oxidation of Cox19 correlates with its translocation into mitochondria, we performed cell fractionations using digitonin after the pulse chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We verified that MTS-mediated import is reestablished very rapidly even after treatment with high concentrations of CCCP (Supplemental Figure S5C). To test whether Cox19 that accumulated upon CCCP/valinomycin treatment is still import competent if the membrane potential is reestablished, we next performed a washout experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). To this end, we followed the oxidation of Cox19 in the presence of CCCP/valinomycin for 8 min and then washed the cells and further followed oxidative folding. Of importance, after washout the cytosolically accumulated Cox19 could be chased into the mitochondria, where it was oxidized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). The impaired oxidation kinetics upon CCCP/valinomycin treatment correlated with a decreased translocation into mitochondria (Supplemental Figure S5D). Of interest, the interaction between Mia40 and Cox19 was not disturbed upon depletion of the membrane potential (Supplemental Figure S5E), indicating a different reason for delayed oxidation-dependent import of Cox19 under these conditions. Taken together, the results show that depletion of the membrane potential reversibly inhibits Cox19 oxidation and import into mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxidation-dependent import in primary cell lines</title><p>To this point we performed all experiments using immortalized cells. Next we wanted to address whether oxidation-dependent import proceeds similarly in primary nonimmortalized cells. To this end, we prepared primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and performed the oxidation assay. Mouse Cox19 contains five instead of four cysteines, and thus mature mouse Cox19 migrates in its AMS-modified form slightly more slowly than with the nonmodified protein (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2â4). The kinetics of Cox19 oxidation, however, was similar to that in HEK293 and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>, top). Moreover, also in primary MEF cells we observed a dependence of oxidative folding on the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>, middle) and no changes in kinetics under conditions of low oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>, bottom). In summary, under physiological conditions, oxidation-dependent import follows a common set of principles that results in similar oxidation kinetics and depends on the mitochondrial membrane potential.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8:</label><caption><p>Mitochondrial import proceeds with similar kinetics in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. (A) Experiments on primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts were performed as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, using an antibody against human Cox19 that also recognizes mouse Cox19. Cells were exposed to different oxygen tensions, as well as to a treatment with CCCP and valinomycin (Val). Reported values are the mean of at least three independent experiments. Error bars are means Â± SD. (B) Model of Cox19 import into mammalian mitochondria. Oxidation-dependent import of Cox19 in mammalian cells depends on ALR, glutathione, the mitochondrial membrane potential, and Mia40. On the basis of our data, we propose that endogenous Mia40 is placed in a position where it optimally recognizes incoming proteins. From this position it likely is replaced by Mia40<sup>SPS</sup>, which therefore serves as a dominant-negative mutant for protein oxidation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2160fig8"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here we established assays in intact mammalian cells to assess oxidation and import of mitochondrial IMS proteins. On the basis of data obtained with these assays, we propose the following model for oxidation-dependent import of Cox19 as it takes place in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). This model likely also applies to other cysteine-rich Mia40 substrates in different cell types. According to our model, Cox19 accumulates after its synthesis in the cytosol, where it remains stable for several minutes, thereby being kept from degradation. Only after a considerable time is Cox19 threaded through the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) channel into the IMS, where it encounters Mia40 and forms a disulfide-linked complex with the oxidoreductase. Overexpression of Mia40 strongly accelerates import and oxidation of Cox19, indicating that the concentration of Mia40 in the IMS is rate limiting for Cox19 translocation into mitochondria. This suggests that translocation into the IMS occurs only at TOM complexes that are in close contact to Mia40. Such a receptor-like function for yeast Mia40 has been proposed according to which Mia40 is associated with some TOM complexes via the structural IMS protein Fcj1/mitofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">von der Malsburg <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Accordingly, overexpression of the redox-inactive Mia40<sup>SPS</sup> mutant decreases protein translocation, as it reduces the chance of precursors to find a TOM pore that is in contact with a functional Mia40 protein. However, some Cox19 is still imported upon Mia40<sup>SPS</sup> overexpression, although it does not become oxidized, indicating that noncovalent interactions between Cox19 and Mia40 can drive mitochondrial accumulation.</p><p>Upon interaction with Mia40, formation of both disulfides in Cox19 takes place. Of note, we do not observe Cox19 intermediates that only contain one disulfide bond, suggesting that both disulfide bonds are introduced in a rapid, potentially coordinated process. Mia40-mediated formation of disulfide bonds within Cox19 is most likely accompanied by a proofreading step that involves GSH. When we apply an inhibitor of glutathione reductase we find a clear reduction in the oxidation rate of Cox19, suggesting that GSH improves oxidation efficiency. This oxidation rate decrease becomes even more pronounced for NDUFA8, which contains four disulfide bonds in its mature form. Our data from intact cells are in line with data obtained by in vitro reconstitution approaches in which GSH accelerates oxidative folding by releasing trapped Mia40 from unproductive Mia40âsubstrate complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bien <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Translocation of newly synthesized Cox19 from the cytosol to mitochondria parallels the kinetics of Cox19 oxidation. On impairment of the machinery for oxidative folding by down-regulation of Mia40 or ALR or expression of the Mia40<sup>SPS</sup> protein, oxidation and import are hampered. We thus conclude that import and oxidation are tightly coupled processes, which can be explained by our model, according to which import only occurs at TOM channels that are associated with Mia40.</p><p>On cytosolic accumulation, Cox19 is initially protected from premature oxidation and degradation. We propose that this stabilization also takes place during normally proceeding import of Cox19. Accordingly, Cox19 that accumulates in the cytosol due to a dissolved membrane potential is still import competent, as it becomes oxidized upon reestablishment of the membrane potential. This finding also strongly supports the notion that Cox19 import proceeds posttranslationally from a cytosolic pool of Cox19 precursors in intact cells. That this cytosolic pool might be a point of regulation is supported by recent data obtained with the yeast system that indicate that the cytosolic thioredoxin system contributes to maintaining a reduced redox state of cytosolic precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Durigon <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In addition, another study in yeast demonstrated that the available amounts of cytosolic precursors are modulated by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bragoszewski <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In comparison to other pathways of mitochondrial protein import, oxidation-dependent import appears to proceed considerably more slowly. Smac, which contains a cleavable mitochondrial targeting sequence, is almost completely imported after the initial radioactive pulse, whereas Cox19 import proceeds over the entire 20-min chase period. It is important to note that, although Smac was processed and imported within a short time frame, this does not mean that the protein also became folded during this time. When we uncoupled oxidation and import of Cox19 by equipping the protein with the mitochondrial targeting sequence of Smac, we observed a fast processing of the presequence as for Smac but after an initial âjumpâ in the extent of oxidation, a slow oxidation rate of Cox19 comparable to that of wild-type Cox19. This indicates that it is not targeting to mitochondria that is limiting for oxidation-dependent import but recognition and oxidative folding by Mia40. It also explains why import and oxidation appear to be tightly coupled processes.</p><p>One hallmark of oxidation-dependent import into isolated mitochondria is its independence of the mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lutz <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Mesecke <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). This is in contrast to substrates relying on mitochondrial targeting sequences for mitochondrial import. Using our oxidation assay in intact cells, we also found a strong dependence of Cox19 import on the mitochondrial membrane potential. The inhibition of import is reversible, as removal of the chemicals restores the functionality of the pathway for oxidative protein folding. This also strongly supports the notion that in intact cells import of Cox19 can proceed posttranslationally. Eukaryotic cells contain many mitochondria, which can differ considerably in membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Exner <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Rugarli and Langer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>). The prerequisite of a high membrane potential and the stable nature of cytosolic precursor proteins imply that precursors might be predominantly imported into highly energized mitochondria, so that mitochondria with functional genomes might be preferred over those that carry mitochondrial DNA mutations. In the future, it will be exciting to further analyze oxidation-dependent import in living mammalian cells and study mitochondrial biogenesis in the context of propagating cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids, cell lines, siRNAs, and antibodies</title><p>For plasmids and cell lines used in this study see Supplemental Tables S2 and S3.
