        <p>Partial inactivation of the <italic>Ankyrin repeat domain 26</italic> (<italic>Ankrd26</italic>) gene causes obesity and diabetes in mice and increases spontaneous and induced adipogenesis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, it is not yet known how the Ankrd26 protein carries out its biological functions. We identified by yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays the triple functional domain protein (TRIO), the G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2), the delta-interacting protein A (DIPA) and the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) as ANKRD26 interacting partners. Adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells was increased by selective down-regulation of <italic>Ankrd26</italic>, <italic>Trio</italic>, <italic>Gps2, Hmmr</italic> and <italic>Dipa</italic>. Furthermore, GPS2 and DIPA, which are normally located in the nucleus, were translocated to the cytoplasm, when the C-terminus of ANKRD26 was introduced into these cells. These findings provide biochemical evidence that ANKRD26, TRIO, GPS2 and HMMR are novel and important regulators of adipogenisis and identify new targets for the modulation of adipogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The current epidemic of obesity and diabetes has stimulated research to improve the understanding of these diseases and to identify and characterize new genes involved in their pathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0038130-Zimmet1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0038130-Prokopenko1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. We recently demonstrated that the <italic>Ankyrin repeat domain 26</italic> (<italic>Ankrd26</italic>) gene plays an important role in the development of these pathologies. Mice with partial inactivation of the <italic>Ankrd26</italic> gene develop marked hyperphagia, severe obesity and an unusual form of diabetes in which white adipose tissue preserves its sensitivity to insulin <xref rid="pone.0038130-Bera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038130-Raciti1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Moreover, when young <italic>Ankrd26</italic> deficient mice were placed on a pair-feeding diet with normal mice, they maintained normal body weight, showed a better glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity in the white adipose tissue, indicating a dual role of the <italic>Ankrd26</italic> gene in the control of appetite and of adipose tissue insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0038130-Raciti1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from these mice have a higher rate of spontaneous adipogenesis compared to normal MEFs and their differentiation to adipocytes is greatly increased when they are exposed to a mixture of adipogenic inducers <xref rid="pone.0038130-Fei1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, indicating a prominent role of the <italic>Ankrd26</italic> gene in fat cells.</p>
      <p>The Ankrd26 protein is highly expressed in the hypothalamus and other regions of the brain, as well as in many tissues and organs, including white adipose tissue. The protein is located in the cytosol close to the inner aspect of the cell membrane in HeLa and 293T cells expressing ANKRD26-EGFP, and it contains both ankyrin repeats and spectrin helices, through which it is potentially able to interact with other proteins <xref rid="pone.0038130-Bera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, it is not yet known what these proteins are and how the Ankrd26 protein carries out its biological functions.</p>
      <p>In the present work, we used yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays to identify interacting partners for the Ankrd26 protein, and performed knock-down experiments to establish whether any of these interacting proteins were functionally relevant in adipogenesis and whether this process was carried out by their interaction with Ankrd26 protein.</p>

        <title>Identification of ANKRD26 protein interaction partners</title>
        <p>To identify potential interacting partners of the ANKRD26 protein, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using 18 baits, encoding overlapping fragments from the full-length ANKRD26 protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038130-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The baits were screened with three different cDNA expression libraries generated from human adult brain, human testis and mouse 11.5-day embryo, tissues known to express ANKRD26 <xref rid="pone.0038130-Bera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thirteen independent interacting proteins were identified by the screening, and 12 of them bound to the coiled-coil domain in the C-terminus, suggesting a prominent role of this domain for Ankrd26 protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038130-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Validation of ANKRD26 protein interaction partners by IP</title>
        <p>Among the 13 interacting partners, we selected five to validate their interactions with ANKRD26 in mammalian cells. These are the triple functional domain protein (Trio), G-protein pathway suppressor 2 (Gps2), delta interacting protein A (DIPA; also called coiled-coil domain-containing protein 85B, Ccdc85b), hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR), and Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family (N-terminal) member 7 (Rassf7; also referred to as LOC66985). Because all five partners interact with the C-terminus region of ANKRD26, we generated an expression plasmid containing the last 498 amino acids of human ANKRD26 (1212â1710 fragment) fused to a FLAG epitope tag located at the N-terminus of the protein (Flag-ANKRD26-C). Then a series of IP assays were performed in 293/T cells transiently co-transfected with Flag-ANKRD26-C and with different vectors, each expressing one of the selected proteins. IP analysis confirmed positive interactions for TRIO, GPS2, DIPA, and HMMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038130-g002">Figure 2</xref>). No interaction was observed for Rassf7 (data not shown).</p>

        <title>ANKRD26/TRIO interaction by IP</title>
        <p>Among the 13 interacting candidates, TRIO was pulled out once during the two-hybrid screening from the mouse embryo c-DNA library (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038130-t001">Table 1</xref>). TRIO is a triple functional domain protein that promotes Ras homolog gene family (Rho) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) activation through the exchange of GDP by GTP <xref rid="pone.0038130-Debant1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Also with the protein tyrosine phosphatase (LAR) it plays a role in coordinating cell-matrix and cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for cell migration and cell growth <xref rid="pone.0038130-Lanier1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038130-Medley1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. To validate the TRIO interaction with ANKRD26 in 293T cells, we cloned the TRIO interacting region (aa 773â1059) into a pcDNA3.1 vector with a myc-epitope tag and co-transfected it with pFlag-ANKRD26-C into 293/T cells. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody followed by immunoblot analysis with both anti-Flag and anti-Myc antibodies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038130-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows that both TRIO-Myc (lane 2) and Flag-ANKRD26-C (lanes 5 and 6) proteins were expressed in 293T cells, and that the Flag-ANKRD26-C protein was efficiently immunoprecipitated by TRIO-Myc protein (lane 8), validating their interaction in mammalian cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present work, we identified 13 potential interacting partners for ANKRD26 by yeast two-hybrid screening, and validated as novel ANKRD26 interacting proteins TRIO, GPS2, DIPA, and HMMR by co-immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells. Furthermore, our analysis of adipogenesis showed that the selective down-regulation of <italic>Ankrd26</italic>, <italic>Trio</italic>, <italic>Gps2, Hmmr</italic> and <italic>Dipa</italic>, increased adipocyte differentiation upon induction in 3T3-L1 cells. These finding indicated that ANKRD26, TRIO, GPS2, HMMR and DIPA are regulators of adipogenesis. Further, GPS2 and DIPA proteins, that usually are located in the nucleus, become translocated into the cytoplasm when co-transfected with the C-terminus of ANKRD26 in 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that the C-terminus may modulate the localization and function of these two proteins. However, due to our inability to transfect the very large full-length Ankrd26 cDNA into cells, we do not know if the full-length protein will have a similar interaction with the interacting proteins or change the nuclear localization of DIPA and GPS2. In addition we do not know if the interaction of one of the interacting partners affects the interaction of other interacting proteins with the carboxy-terminus of Ankrd26. Studies are underway to determine the binding site for each of the interacting proteins on Ankrd26.</p>
      <p>The <italic>ANKRD26</italic> gene was originally identified as the ancestor of primate specific <italic>ANKRD30A</italic> and the <italic>POTE</italic> gene family <xref rid="pone.0038130-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It maps to chromosome 10p12.1 and encodes a protein of 192 kDa, which is located close to the inner aspect of the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0038130-Bera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The ANKRD26 protein contains two conserved domains: Ankyrin repeats, located from amino acids 74â199, and helical regions (743â1538), which are structurally similar to the Î±-spectrin family proteins <xref rid="pone.0038130-Bera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The presence of these two domains, known to mediate protein-protein interactions <xref rid="pone.0038130-DjinovicCarugo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038130-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, suggested that ANKRD26 might play a role as an adaptor protein <xref rid="pone.0038130-Bera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. From the two-hybrid screening data only one protein (ANKRD17) was found to interact with the ankyrin repeat region at the N-terminus of ANKRD26; all the other 12 proteins interacted with region 901â1702 of ANKRD26 that contains the spectrin-like coiled-coil domains. These findings indicate that the coiled-coil domain at the C-terminus of ANKRD26 rather than Ankyrin domain is mainly involved in ANKRD26 protein-protein interactions, and is likely to be responsible for its biological functions. In support of this last statement are our previous data obtained in mutant mice <xref rid="pone.0038130-Bera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038130-Raciti1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, in which removal of the region encoding amino acids 1212â1710, encompassing part of the spectrin like helices and all the C-terminus of Ankrd26, cause extreme hyperphagia and severe obesity <xref rid="pone.0038130-Bera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>Ankrd26</italic> mutant mice develop an unusual form of obesity-induced diabetes in which white adipose tissue preserves its sensitivity to insulin in the context of whole body insulin resistance, and shows an improved sensitivity to the hormone when the mutant mice were pair fed with normal mice <xref rid="pone.0038130-Raciti1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These data indicate that the C-terminus of Ankrd26 has at least two functions: one is to control the response to insulin in white adipose tissue; the other is to control appetite and satiety.</p>
      <p>Recently we demonstrated that partial disruption of the <italic>Ankrd26</italic> gene regulates adipocyte differentiation both at the level of progenitor commitment and at early and late differentiation steps in MEF cells from <italic>Ankrd26</italic> mutant mice and that this process is associated with ERK-1/2 activation <xref rid="pone.0038130-Fei1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Here we show that down-regulation of <italic>Ankrd26</italic> expression caused an increase in adipogenesis when 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with a specific shRNA for the murine endogenous Ankrd26. All together these findings indicate that Ankrd26 has an important role in regulating differentiation of adipocytes.</p>
      <p>The protein TRIO was initially identified as a binding partner for LAR, a trans-membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase. Its association with LAR was suggested to play a key role in the integration of diverse signals needed for cell-matrix interaction and cytoskeletal rearrangements during cell migration <xref rid="pone.0038130-Debant1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0038130-Medley1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. TRIO is a multidomain protein, which contains two guanine nucleotide exchange factor domains that promote Rho and Rac1 activation, and a serine/threonine kinase domain <xref rid="pone.0038130-Debant1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, TRIO also possesses two pleckstrin homology domains that can recruit TRIO to different membranes, and four spectrin-like domains and an Ig-like domain that can mediate protein-protein interactions <xref rid="pone.0038130-Debant1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Here, we identified TRIO as a novel ANKRD26 interacting protein and we demonstrated for the first time the involvement of TRIO as negative regulator of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Although the mechanism by which TRIO can inhibit adipogenesis, and how ANKRD26 can interfere with the function of TRIO are not yet known and are under investigation. We suggest that TRIO could regulate adipogenesis in combination with LAR and/or through the activation of Rho GTPase signaling. In support of this hypothesis are the recent reports that LAR and Rho signaling are negative regulators of adipogenesis <xref rid="pone.0038130-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038130-Sordella1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Kim <italic>et al</italic>. reported in human mesenchymal stem cells and in 3T3-L1 cells that the knock-down of endogenous LAR induced a dramatic increase of adipogenesis in these cells, while its over-expression caused a strong reduction of adipogenic differentiation by inhibition of insulin/insulin receptor signaling <xref rid="pone.0038130-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. On the other hand, Sordella <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the modulation of Rho GTPase signaling regulates a switch between adipogenesis and myogenesis <xref rid="pone.0038130-Sordella1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Indeed, mice lacking the Rho inhibitory protein p190-B RhoGAP exhibit a complete absence of mature adipocytes and MEF cells derived from these mice are defective in adipogenesis and this defect is rescued by inhibiting Rho kinase. Furthermore, the introduction of excessive Rho activity in MEF cells from control mice and in 3T3-L1 cells is sufficient to disrupt adipogenesis <xref rid="pone.0038130-Sordella1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have also shown that the selective down-regulation of the expression of three other ANKRD26 interacting partners, GPS2, HMMR and DIPA, enhances the proportion of differentiated cells. GPS2 was originally identified based on its ability to suppress lethal G protein subunit-activating mutations in the yeast pheromone responsive pathway <xref rid="pone.0038130-Spain1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and its over-expression in mammalian cells potentially suppresses a RAS- and MAPK-mediated signal and interferes with JNK activity <xref rid="pone.0038130-Spain1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038130-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Most importantly, GPS2 was found as an integral subunit of N-CoR-HDAC3 complex. It interacts directly with N-CoR and transducing beta-like protein 1 (TÎ²L1) proteins inside the complex and it is essential for its assembly and stabilization <xref rid="pone.0038130-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It was recently demonstrated that the adipogenic transcription factor proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) recruits N-CoR in the absence of its ligand, and that this co-repressor down-regulates PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the silencing of N-CoR increases the expression of adipocyte specific genes and of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells <xref rid="pone.0038130-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Similarly, PPARÎ³ recruits HDAC3 to maintain transcriptional repression of its target genes <xref rid="pone.0038130-Fajas1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that GPS2 can act as a repressor of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and that its sequestration from the nucleus mediated by ANKRD26 may inhibit its function. Whether this regulatory process is mediated by GPS2 alone or in combination with the other proteins of the N-CoR-HDAC3 complex remain to be clarified.</p>
      <p>The protein DIPA was initially identified as an interacting protein for the viral HDAg and it was shown to affect hepatitis D virus replication <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0038130-Brazas1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Bezy <italic>et al</italic>. recently described DIPA also as a novel interacting partner for the adipocyte transcription factors C/EBPÎ² and Î´. They showed that over-expression of DIPA affects adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells; while its silencing enhances this process as we also showed in our study. Furthermore, they demonstrated that DIPA can co-localize with these two proteins in the nucleus of 3T3-L1 cells and may negatively modulate their transcriptional activity inhibiting adipogenesis <xref rid="pone.0038130-Bezy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Thus, our findings confirm the role of DIPA as negative regulator of this process and support the possible role of ANKRD26 as counter-regulator of DIPA mechanism by regulating DIPA localization.</p>
      <p>HMMR is an oncogenic protein implicated in the progression of many human cancers, such as breast, gastric, and prostate cancers <xref rid="pone.0038130-Maxwell2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It was originally identified as a soluble protein, which binds to CD44 or hyaluronan and promotes cell motility and invasion through sustained stimulation of the activity of ERK1/2 kinase <xref rid="pone.0038130-Turley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038130-Maxwell2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0038130-Hamilton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Within the cell, HMMR plays a role in the regulation of mitosis through its association with microtubules <xref rid="pone.0038130-Maxwell1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and it regulates the normal development of breast epithelial cells forming a complex with BRCA1 <xref rid="pone.0038130-Maxwell3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Furthermore it was recently shown that intracellular HMMR performs scaffolding functions to control both activity and targeting of ERK1/2 to tubulin <xref rid="pone.0038130-Tolg2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Here, we identified HMMR as a novel ANKRD26 interacting partner and we showed for the first time its involvement as regulator of adipogenesis. Although how HMMR inhibits adipocyte differentiation and how ANKRD26 interferes with HMMR function remain to be clarified, we suggest that it could involve HMMR's ability to modulate ERK1/2 activation. It should be noted that the adipogenic induction in 3T3L1 is consistently higher during selective knock down of each of the interacting partners of Ankrd26 yet the endogenous expression of those proteins are not consistently lower during the adipogenic induction suggesting the involvement of multiple pathways and complex interaction of these interacting proteins in vivo.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have identified several novel proteins that participate in the regulation of adipogenisis and we have shown that the region at the C-terminus of ANKRD26 that contains spectrin-like helices is responsible for its interaction with these proteins and in its regulation of adipogenesis. The identity of the residues that are responsible for the specific binding between ANKRD26 and its newly identified partners and the mechanism by which these proteins regulate adipogenisis are under investigation.</p>

        <title>293/T cells: culture conditions and transient transfection</title>
        <p>293/T cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM media (Quality Biologicals) supplemented with 10% FBS (Quality Biologicals), 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solutions in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37Â°C. For transient transfection, expression vectors for pcDNA3.1-Flag-ANKRD26-C (aa 1212â1710), pcDNA3.1-DIPA-Myc, pcDNA3.1-GPS2-Myc, pcDNA3.1-TRIO-Myc and pcDNA3.1-HMMR-Myc were transfected individually or in combination into 293/T cells using lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed 48 hr after transfection (see below).</p>

        <p>Both 293/T and 3T3-L1 (ATCC) cells were harvested and washed in PBS, and then lysed in Lysis Buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 5 Âµg/ml leupeptin, 5 Âµg/ml aprotinin, 10 ÂµM PMSF. Samples were incubated on ice 30 min after the addition of Lysis Buffer and then cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. The protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined using the Coomassie blue protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Protein lysates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane and subjected to WB analysis. For each IP experiment about 1 mg of protein lysate from 293/T cells transfected with the various combinations of vectors was incubated with 1.5 Âµg of anti-myc antibody (Sigma Aldrich) for 2 hr at 4Â°C. After incubation, 40 Âµl of protein A sepharose (Invitrogen) in a 1â¶1 mixture of protein A sepharose and Lysis Buffer were added to the IP samples. Purified interacting complex was released from protein A sepharose beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 4â20% Tris-glycine gel. Samples were then subjected to WB analysis. Membranes were firstly probed with antibodies to Myc (Sigma Aldrich), Flag M2 (Sigma Aldrich), PPARÎ³ (Santa Cruz Inc), C/EBPÎ± (Cell Signaling), and Î²-tubulin (Sigma Aldrich) and then with secondary mouse or rabbit antibodies (GE Healthcare) before detection of the signal with ECL plus (GE Healthcare).</p>
