        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Despite many decades of study, mitotic chromosome structure and composition remain poorly characterized. Here, we have integrated quantitative proteomics with bioinformatic analysis to generate a series of independent classifiers that describe the â¼4,000 proteins identified in isolated mitotic chromosomes. Integrating these classifiers by machine learning uncovers functional relationships between protein complexes in the context of intact chromosomes and reveals which of the â¼560 uncharacterized proteins identified here merits further study. Indeed, of 34 GFP-tagged predicted chromosomal proteins, 30 were chromosomal, including 13 with centromere-association. Of 16 GFP-tagged predicted nonchromosomal proteins, 14 were confirmed to be nonchromosomal. An unbiased analysis of the whole chromosome proteome from genetic knockouts of kinetochore protein <italic>Ska3</italic>/<italic>Rama1</italic> revealed that the APC/C and RanBP2/RanGAP1 complexes depend on the Ska complex for stable association with chromosomes. Our integrated analysis predicts that up to 97 new centromere-associated proteins remain to be discovered in our data set.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>As cells enter mitosis, chromosomes undergo a remarkable series of physiological and structural transformations known as chromosome condensation. This process involves individualization of the chromosomal territories to create the characteristic mitotic chromosome morphology and maturation of the kinetochores so that chromosomes can align and segregate on the mitotic spindle. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying chromosome condensation is still fragmentary. These processes can be fully understood only when all components of mitotic chromosomes have been identified and functional relationships between them determined. We have developed a new approach that we term multiclassifier combinatorial proteomics (MCCP) to do this.</p>
      <p>The current list of mitotic chromatin proteins reported in proteomic studies is surprisingly short. Early analyses described 62 and 79 proteins, respectively, in mitotic chromosome scaffolds (<xref rid="bib32 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 2002; Gassmann et al., 2005</xref>). A later study identified &gt; 250 proteins that bound to sperm chromatin in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts in vitro, revealing the kinetochore protein Bod1 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al., 2007</xref>). Other studies identified â¼240 proteins, subsequently corrected to roughly 50 bona fide putative structural proteins (<xref rid="bib46 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Uchiyama et al., 2005; Takata et al., 2007</xref>). In a targeted study, 98 proteins were identified as shared in isolated telomeres from wild-type and ALT cells (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dejardin and Kingston, 2009</xref>). Despite these efforts, currently available proteomics reports miss a significant fraction of known mitotic chromosomal proteins, particularly kinetochore components.</p>
      <p>Biochemical analysis of important chromosome substructures such as kinetochores is extremely challenging. The kinetochore is one of the most complex cellular substructures (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>), with over 120 constituents described by a range of approaches (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985</xref>), including targeted proteomic studies (<xref rid="bib34 bib12 bib35 bib17 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Obuse et al., 2004; Foltz et al., 2006; Okada et al., 2006; Hori et al., 2008; Amano et al., 2009</xref>). Biochemical dissection of kinetochores is complicated by the fact that it is not known to what extent the constituent protein complexes can be recovered in soluble form from chromosomes with their relevant intermolecular associations intact. As described here, those problems can be circumvented by purifying and analyzing whole mitotic chromosomes.</p>
      <p>Purifying large cellular structures or organelles free of contaminants is virtually impossible. Genuine components have been distinguished from contaminants in such preparations by subtractive (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Schirmer et al., 2003</xref>) or quantitative (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Foster et al., 2003</xref>) proteomics by determining the difference between two near-identical fractions, one enriched and the other depleted of the target structure. In protein correlation profiling, a set of known components was used to define a common intensity profile across neighboring biochemical fractions from sucrose gradients during purification of organelles and this was used to select other proteins that show a similar profile (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>). These methods do not recognize cellular background proteins that adhere to the structure of interest due to nonspecific hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions. This type of contamination is particularly relevant for vertebrate mitotic chromosomes.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we identified approximately 4000 polypeptides in highly purified chromosomes. We developed a statistical approach for analysis of proteomic data to confirm which known and uncharacterized proteins from this long list are chromosomal. An experimental test of our method led to the identification of 32 chromosomal proteins, including 13 kinetochore-associated proteins. Key to our analysis is the innovative use of <italic>s</italic>table <italic>i</italic>sotope <italic>l</italic>abeling with <italic>a</italic>mino acids in cell <italic>c</italic>ulture (SILAC) (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2002</xref>), plus development of a framework to integrate data from multiple classifiers, including nonproteomic classifiers, to reveal proteins of interest and determine functional relationships between protein complexes in the context of whole chromosomes.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.1">
        <title>Identification of the Proteome of Isolated Mitotic Chromosomes</title>
        <p>We isolated mitotic chromosomes from chicken DT40 cells by a refinement of the polyamine method (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lewis and Laemmli, 1982</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). These preparations are negative for porin in immunoblots (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C), indicating that mitochondrial contamination (common in chromosome preparations) is low.</p>
        <p>Proteomic analysis (<xref rid="bib6 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cox and Mann, 2008; de Godoy et al., 2008</xref>) of 250 Î¼g of total chromosomal protein identified 4029 proteins in 28 functional categories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref> available online), including essentially all previously described chromosomal proteins.</p>
        <p>When vertebrate cells enter mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down and chromosomes are newly exposed to cytoplasmic proteins, organelles and cellular membranes. Since highly positively charged histones contribute â¼38% of the chromosome mass and an equivalent amount is highly negatively charged DNA, many charged nonchromosomal proteins exhibit strong adventitious binding to chromosomes. These âhitchhikersâ differ from conventional contaminants (e.g., mitochondria), as they are physically associated with the chromosomes before cell lysis and apparently cannot be separated by conventional purification protocols. Thus, the 1331 cytoskeletal, cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, membrane and receptor proteins found in our preparations, may be physically associated with chromosomes following nuclear envelope disassembly, but many not be functionally relevant.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>A Classifier Approach to Identify Genuine Mitotic Chromosome Proteins</title>
        <p>The presence of hitchhiker proteins complicates the definition of what constitutes a âtrueâ chromosomal protein, as well as the design of biochemical control experiments. For example, comparing mitotic to interphase chromatin is of limited use, since the latter is shielded from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope. In such a comparison, cytoplasmic hitchhiker proteins would be scored as mitosis-specific chromosomal proteins.</p>
        <p>Here, we describe an approach to study the complex chromosomal proteome that both identifies proteins that merit further study and reveals functional relationships between all chromosomal proteins. We quantify the chromosomal association of each protein in a series of quantitative proteomics experiments, mostly using SILAC technology (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2002</xref>). Each experiment provides an independent measure of a protein's association with mitotic chromosomes, which we term a âclassifier.â Integration of the data obtained with all classifiers enables us to detect patterns in the behavior of groups of proteins that reveal shared membership in protein complexes as well as functional dependency relationships.</p>
        <p>The experimental protocols that define the five proteomic classifiers are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E and all classifiers are summarized below.</p>
        <sec id="sec2.2.1">
          <title>Classifier I: Abundance estimation</title>
          <p>To estimate the amounts of individual proteins in mitotic chromosomes, we used an established protocol (<xref rid="bib40 bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Rappsilber et al., 2002; Ishihama et al., 2005, 2008</xref>) to calculate a scaled protein abundance index based on the number of peptides observed and the number of times that each peptide is observed (spectral count) for each protein. This calculation and its validation are discussed in <xref rid="sec4.4" ref-type="sec">Extended Experimental Procedures</xref>.</p>
          <p>In the conventional pie chart of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, all proteins are weighted equally, independent of their actual abundance in isolated chromosomes. A more informative representation of chromosome composition is obtained by normalizing each class by its mass, obtained by multiplying the estimated abundance by the predicted molecular mass of each protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F). As expected, histones comprise the bulk of mitotic chromosomal protein (48%). Overall 68% of the protein mass is annotated as chromosomal.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec2.2.2">
          <title>Classifier II: Enrichment in Chromosomes</title>
          <p>We expected core chromosomal components like histones or structural proteins would be more abundant in isolated chromosomes than in cytoplasmic extracts. The reverse would be true of background proteins. We therefore mixed isolated chromosomes from mitotic DT40 cells grown in light medium with an equal mass of protein from post-chromosomal extracts of parallel cultures grown with heavy SILAC medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). Classifier II was calculated as the ratio of light/heavy peaks for each protein. Among the 20% most enriched proteins, chromosomal proteins outnumbered nonchromosomal proteins by 3 to 1. Conversely, among the 20% least enriched proteins, background proteins outnumbered chromosomal proteins 6 to 1.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec2.2.3">
          <title>Classifier III: In Vitro Exchange on Chromosomes</title>
          <p>We ranked proteins based on their ability to stably bind to chromosomes during an incubation in cytosol. A crude light chromosome fraction obtained by gentle centrifugation was mixed with an excess of heavy post-chromosomal extract and incubated to allow proteins to exchange at 14Â°C for 30 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). The chromosomes were then subjected to rigorous purification. All heavy proteins identified must have bound to the chromosomes during the incubation in vitro. Classifier III is the light/heavy ratio for each protein identified in this experiment.</p>
          <p>The most stable chromosomal-associated proteins were histones (average classifier III = 63), topoisomerase IIÎ± (classifier III = 61) and condensin I (average classifier III = 59). Interestingly, condensin II was more exchangeable (average classifier III = 14). In contrast, the ratios for â¼75% of ribosomal proteins were in the range from 0.45 to 3.0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G), indicating significant binding to chromosomes from cytosol during the incubation.</p>
          <p>Although we sought to optimize purity rather than preserve functionality of chromosomes, the exchange experiment revealed that at least one aspect of kinetochore function was retained in purified chromosomes. Similar to one recent study (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kulukian et al., 2009</xref>), kinetochores of the purified chromosomes can recruit spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2, Bub3, and BubR1 from cytosol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>H and 1I) but not Mad1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>J).</p>

          <p>We used a conditional genetic knockout of SMC2 in DT40 SMC2<sup>ON/OFF</sup> cells (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hudson et al., 2003</xref>) to compare the composition of mitotic chromosomes formed in the presence or absence of condensin, which is required for structural integrity of mitotic chromosomes. DT40 SMC2<sup>ON</sup> cells were cultured in SILAC<sup>heavy</sup> medium. To obtain chromosomes depleted of condensin, cells grown in SILAC<sup>light</sup> medium were cultured with doxycycline for 30 hr to shut down SMC2 expression prior to the nocodazole block (SMC2<sup>OFF</sup>). Equal numbers of mitotic cells from the two different populations were mixed and mitotic chromosomes isolated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). Classifier IV is the heavy/light ratio (SMC2<sup>ON</sup>/SMC2<sup>OFF</sup>) for each of the proteins identified in this experiment.</p>
          <p>SMC2-depleted chromosomes contained 5.8% of the wild-type level of SMC2.

        <title>Multiclassifier Combinatorial Proteomics</title>
        <p>Traditional one-dimensional analysis (e.g., sorting the various proteins according to their value for each classifier) was of limited utility, as the data lacked a clear boundary between chromosomal (red/pink in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A) and nonchromosomal proteins (green in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A) for each classifier (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref>AâS2E).</p>
        <p>By contrast, when classifiers were combined, our ability to identify chromosomal proteins was vastly improved. For example, an enrichment of centromeric or chromosomal proteins relative to nonchromosomal proteins was obtained when classifiers I (abundance) and II (enrichment) were plotted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Câ2E). The clustering of protein complex subunits in this plot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D) reflects both their relative stoichiometry (<italic>x</italic> axis), and the similar degree to which subunits in a complex are all present either on or off chromosomes (<italic>y</italic> axis). Members of the APC/C, Ndc80 and Mis12 complexes form closely knit clusters. It is important to note that this was achieved in the context of entire chromosomes and without requiring solubilization of the complexes.</p>
        <p>We used random forest (RF) analysis, a machine learning approach, to progress beyond two-dimensional analyses and integrate the information present in all proteomics classifiers. This analysis offered two powerful benefits. First, it enabled us to work with data sets that contain missing values. This is a significant advantage in proteomics studies where not every protein is observed in every experiment, as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>F. Second, RF analysis allowed us to use any descriptor of our proteins as a classifier and integrate it into our overall analysis. Here, we also included a bioinformatic analysis of the distribution of protein domains in our analysis distinguishing chromosomal from nonchromosomal proteins (classifier VI).</p>
        <p>In brief, RF is a decision tree analysis that separates data sets into âtrueâ and âfalseâ groups. The decision trees are trained on defined data sets and randomly built to optimize the separation between them. Analysis of the experimental data set then occurs by running each protein through all trees and adding up its overall RF score (i.e., the fraction of trees that scored it as âtrueâ). RFs perform much better on training data than application data, so their performance is evaluated by ten-fold cross-validation. The training data are split into random sections of 90% for training and 10% for evaluation, so that successively the entire set is used for evaluation. Here, the two training data sets chosen were ânonchromosomalâ (green wedges in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D) and âchromosomalâ (red + pink wedges in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D), and the RF score for a given protein is the fraction of trees that scored it as âchromosomal.â</p>
        <p>RF analysis readily discriminated chromosomal from nonchromosomal proteins. In the RF rug plot of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A, which represents the ranked list of proteins generated by RF analysis, the left side is predominantly red, while the right side is predominantly green. To reach the 500<sup>th</sup> chromosomal protein on the RF-ranked list only 229 nonchromosomal proteins are included (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). In contrast, 410-671 nonchromosomal proteins would be included when considering ranked lists from individual classifiers. Note that the RF-based sorting was done on the complete data set, including proteins that failed to be observed with some classifiers. Therefore, adding information from additional experiments did not decrease the number of proteins covered.</p>
        <p>The advantage of combining classifiers can be statistically expressed by ROC curves (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>A), with increased area under the curve (AUC) for our combined analysis when compared to each of the individual classifiers (AUC<sup>RF(cI-V)</sup> = 0.81, AUCs<sup>cI-V</sup> = 0.41-0.76). The combined classifiers assigned 88.8% of our gold standard, the 125 centromere proteins, correctly as chromosomal, at the cut-off that minimizes misassignment of chromosomal versus nonchromosomal proteins. This specificity was further improved when bioinformatic domain analysis (cVI) was integrated with our proteomic classifiers (AUC<sup>RF(cI-VI)</sup> = 0.97; identification of the first 500 chromosomal proteins yields 17 nonchromosomal proteins, Suppl. <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3</xref>B and S3C, proteins lacking known domains are excluded from this boost, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>D). Now, 92.4% of the centromere proteins were assigned as chromosomal. In summary, RF analysis provides us with a tool for productively combining the outcomes of our individual proteomics classifier experiments and further empowering our analysis by including data from other sources.</p>
        <p>If results of a random forest based on the five proteomic classifiers plus the bioinformatics-based classifier VI were plotted against those from the initial random forest analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), a near-perfect separation of the training data was achieved. Only a single chromosomal protein of the training set and two nonchromosomal proteins were misassigned when placing manually a separation line.</p>
        <p>Using ten-fold cross-validation, we found that 118 centromere proteins positioned right and only 7 left of the separation line (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). This compares to 14 and 9 centromere proteins being missed when using the one-dimensional ranked lists by classifiers I-V and I-VI, respectively. Accepting the line as a threshold returns known centromere proteins with a yield of 94.4% and all other chromosomal proteins with 93.1% success. In contrast, 83.1% of nonchromosomal proteins are rejected. Thus, the classifier approach is sufficiently powerful to suggest chromosomal proteins from among hitherto uncharacterized proteins.</p>

        <p>To test the predictive power of our RF analysis, we cloned and tested the location in mitosis of 50 previously uncharacterized proteins including 15 without known domains: 34 predicted to be and 16 predicted not to be on chromosomes in mitosis.</p>
        <p>Reasoning that important proteins would be conserved, we expressed GFP-tagged human homologs of these chicken proteins in U2OS cells. Remarkably, 30 of 34 cloned proteins from the chromosomal region were confirmed as chromosomal, contrasting with only 2 of the 16 predicted <italic>ab initio</italic> to be nonchromosomal. This confirms the power of our analysis and indicates a success rate of 88%, with 44 of 50 tagged proteins localizing as predicted.

        <p>We focused our initial functional analysis on kinetochore proteins. Clustering analysis (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gentleman et al., 2004</xref>) allowed us to combine data for proteins identified by all classifiers, and look for informative groupings. This revealed a striking tendency for functionally related proteins to form clusters, as exemplified by members of the NDC80, CPC, Nup107-160 and APC/C complexes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, our clustering sorted CENP-27 as a component of the APC/C.

          <title>Ska3/Rama1 and Functional Analysis of Kinetochore Subcomplexes</title>
          <p>C13orf3 was located adjacent to Ska2 in the cluster analysis. This protein now known as Ska3/Rama1 has been suggested to be involved in microtubule attachment to kinetochores (<xref rid="bib14 bib38 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Gaitanos et al., 2009; Raaijmakers et al., 2009; Welburn et al., 2009</xref>) or coordination of the spindle checkpoint response (<xref rid="bib7 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Daum et al., 2009; Theis et al., 2009</xref>). We analyzed the kinetochore proteome in the presence or absence of Ska3/Rama1 (defined as classifier V) in order to determine the role of this protein in kinetochore structure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
          <p>A map of the <italic>Ska3/Rama1</italic> locus in DT40 is shown in <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5</xref>A and S5B, together with a targeting strategy for inactivating the gene. The <italic>Ska3/Rama1</italic> gene is not essential for life in DT40 cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>C). However, these cells struggle to achieve a normal chromosome alignment, and show a â¼3Ã increase in mitotic index (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>D and S5E), a â¼3Ã increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells and a â¼6x increase in the number of bi-nucleated cells.</p>
          <p>Proteomic analysis of isolated chromosomes revealed that loss of Ska3/Rama1 was accompanied by the loss of Ska1 and Ska2. Loss of the Ska complex caused no systematic changes in the chromosomal association of proteins of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), Knl-1/Mis12/Ndc80 (KMN), Mis18, Ndc80, CPC, and Nup107-160 kinetochore subcomplexes. However, striking changes were seen in the levels of the APC/C, RanBP2/RanGAP1, spindle checkpoint, Rod/Zw10/Zwilch (RZZ), and dynein/dynactin complexes. We confirmed that the RanBP2/RanGAP1 complex is indeed depleted from kinetochores when <italic>Ska3/Rama1</italic> is deleted in HeLa cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>F and S5G). Attempts to confirm the specific kinetochore depletion of the APC/C were uninformative, as we were unable to reproducibly obtain kinetochore staining for the APC/C in HeLa cells using four independent antibodies.</p>

        <title>Multiclassifier Combinatorial Proteomics</title>
        <p>The approach described here for analysis of the proteome of vertebrate mitotic chromosomes can be used to study any complex proteome. The key approach of combining classifier data can in principle be expanded indefinitely and can include nonproteomics data sets such as the bioinformatic protein domain analysis used here. Other classifiers that could be used in the future include microarray, protein interaction (e.g., two hybrid screens or pull-down), protein phosphorylation, and localization data and, indeed, data from any experimental approach in which the proteins of interest are sorted systematically.</p>
        <p>We first showed that plotting pairs of classifiers against one another improved our ability to delineate potential chromosomal proteins. As that approach could not be generalized when the number of classifiers exceeded three, we adopted a random forest (RF) analysis approach. This allowed us to integrate information from all classifiers into decision trees on which known and unknown proteins could be classified. Importantly, RF analysis handles missing values systematically. This is crucial when not every protein is observed in every experiment. In contrast, cluster analysis, which has been used both in this study and in other recent work (<xref rid="bib44 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Theis et al., 2009; Neumann et al., 2010</xref>), can only integrate data for proteins that have a value for every classifier.</p>

        <title>Integrity of the Isolated Chromosomes</title>
        <p>Our methods focused on optimizing the purity of the chromosomes. Thus, our list of proteins is likely to represent the minimal, stably associated components of mitotic chromosomes. Nonetheless kinetochores of isolated chromosomes retain some function, as judged by their ability to recruit components of the mitotic checkpoint complex from cytoplasm. This may be because chromosomes were isolated from nocodazole-treated cells, with kinetochores actively engaged in spindle checkpoint signaling.</p>

        <title>New Insights into Kinetochore Functional Organization</title>
        <p>Remarkably, although no biochemical enrichment for centromeres was performed, our data set contained all known centromeric subcomplexes, with peptides from 125 reported centromere proteins (eight present as multiple isoforms) (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). We identified all members of the CCAN, KMN, Mis12 and Mis18 complexes and all members of the RZZ complex except Zwint (which is not yet annotated in the chicken genome). Our success in identifying centromere and telomere proteins may be explained because 66 of the 78 chicken DT40 chromosomes are microchromosomes whose purification provides a natural enrichment for centromeres and telomeres since the chromosome arms are so short.</p>
        <p>We combined genetics with whole proteome analysis in order to identify complexes and structural dependencies in their ânative environmentâ (e.g., kinetochore proteins in actual kinetochores). Chromosomes lacking Ska3/Rama1 were depleted for the entire Ska complex, confirming that these three proteins are interdependent for chromosome binding. Similarly, depletion of key condensin subunit SMC2 caused a loss of all seven subunits of the condensin I and II complexes from chromosomes. Importantly, this analysis did not require tagging of any proteins or attempts to solubilize functional complexes from large subcellular structures.</p>
        <p>In addition to these primary effects of depletion, loss of Ska3/Rama1 also caused a significant secondary depletion of the APC/C and RanBP2/RanGAP1 complexes from chromosomes but had no consistent effect on most other kinetochore proteins. Importantly, all members of the secondary-depleted complexes also behaved coordinately. Our results (e.g., the behavior of CENP-27/APC16 as a component of the APC/C) confirm the utility of single protein depletion analysis for the identification of protein complexes and determination of their mutual interdependencies for association with chromosomes.</p>
        <p>Our data suggest that the Ska complex may provide a docking site for the APC/C in the outer kinetochore. Alternatively, sumoylation by RanBP2 may have a role in APC/C binding to chromosomes. The RanBP2-RanGAP1 complex is known to be involved in kinetochore-microtubule interactions and localization of several spindle checkpoint proteins (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Joseph et al., 2004</xref>). We note that among the recent spate of publications on Ska3/Rama1, our observations appear to support a role in integration and regulation of the spindle checkpoint response (<xref rid="bib7 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Daum et al., 2009; Theis et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our whole-proteome analysis revealed that Cdc20 behaved like a member of the APC/C and was distinct from other components of the spindle checkpoint pathway with respect to its Ska complex dependency. Spindle checkpoint components associate with one another in cytoplasm as a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), containing BubR1, Bub3, Cdc20 and Mad2. Our data suggest that once the MCC associates with chromosomes, Cdc20 stably associates with the APC/C.</p>

        <title>What Classes of Kinetochore Proteins Remain to Be Discovered?</title>
        <p>We identified 13 kinetochore-associated proteins among previously uncharacterized proteins and, as discussed below, we predict that many more remain to be described. We therefore asked whether there is any functional relationship between these new proteins. That is, what sorts of kinetochore proteins had been missed in the many previous genetic and biochemical screens? An interesting answer has emerged.</p>
        <p>Since the new kinetochore proteins were identified solely based on their occurrence in chromosomes, they could potentially represent a wide range of functions. Nevertheless, it is striking that five of the new centromere proteins (namely, CENP-28, â29, â31, â35, and â36) are subunits of complexes that modify and/or bind histones (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). Yeast orthologs of two of these proteins (namely, CENP-28/C1orf149 and CENP-29/CFDP1) contribute to NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and SWR1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes, respectively. These complexes are known to share components (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2005</xref>) and together stimulate the exchange of histone H2A for H2A.Z, following acetylation of H2A or H4 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Altaf et al., 2010</xref>). A third centromere-associated protein, CENP-36/MSL1v1, is necessary for the activity of MOF, another HAT, on nucleosomal H4 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, CENP-31/PHD6 and CENP-35/PHF2 each contain PHD (plant homeodomain) zinc fingers, which are usually associated with chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation. The PHD of CENP-35, which also contains a JmjC (likely histone demethylase) domain, appears to be required for demethylation of H3 at the promoters of ribosomal RNA genes (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>Why were these proteins not discovered earlier as kinetochore-associated? One likely explanation is that they may have essential functions in other chromatin regions as well. Thus, mutations might have pleiotropic phenotypes not recognized as specific for mitosis. Furthermore, their association might depend on a fully assembled kinetochore and thus be lost when attempting other than whole chromosome analysis.</p>

This latter phenotype is very similar to an unusual spindle morphology phenotype seen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells following depletion of the CLASP homolog Mast/Orbit (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Maiato et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, in our analysis, CENP-32 clusters with CLASP1 and CLASP2. A yeast homolog of CENP-32 interacts with CBF5, an enzyme involved in the posttranscriptional modification of rRNA, that was shown to bind to budding yeast centromeres and microtubules (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 1993</xref>). Bioinformatics analysis suggests that CENP-32 is a member of the SPOUT family of methyltransferases but is atypical in possessing a possible RNA-binding OB fold inserted into its catalytic domain (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Tkaczuk et al., 2007</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that CENP-32 may function at kinetochores by interacting with an as-yet unknown RNA.</p>

        <title>How Complex Is the Kinetochore?</title>
        <p>MCCP analysis allows us to predict how many more kinetochore proteins remain to be identified in our data set. In the plot of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, where the chromosomal proteome is displayed in two dimensions, we found 35% of novel tagged proteins from region R and 6% from region L to associate with the kinetochore during mitosis. These regions have 224 and 287 as-yet uncharacterized novel proteins, respectively. Assuming no bias in the proteins we cloned, this suggests that approximately 97 more kinetochore proteins remain to be discovered. Taking into account the 13 kinetochore-associated proteins confirmed in our work, this roughly doubles the currently known protein complexity of the kinetochore during mitosis, confirming it as one of the most complex cellular substructures.</p>

        <p>Multiclassifier combinatorial proteomics and the data sets described here open the door to the identification of all functional components of mitotic chromosomes despite the adventitious binding of cellular background proteins during mitosis. Furthermore, MCCP can be extended by adding additional classifiers to delineate protein complexes and define functional dependencies between them in the context of intact mitotic chromosomes. This will serve both as a starting point for systematic determination of the full range of functions involved in mitotic chromosome segregation, and as a basis for the development of detailed structural and functional interaction maps of key chromosomal subdomains. MCCP should also prove useful for the analysis of other cellular structures that lack defined boundaries, e.g., membrane associated complexes like the post-synaptic density.</p>

                <p>Control experiments in which beads loaded with DNA were exposed to cytoplasm did not clearly differentiate between chromosomal proteins and contaminants (data not shown). Although those experiments did identify many obvious contaminants that can bind to DNA, they also yielded many true chromosomal proteins (e.g., histones and topoisomerases) whose presence in the cytoplasmic fractions was likely due to unavoidable nuclear damage during extract preparation. Likewise, although procedures have been published for the proteomic analysis of interphase chromatin from <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm (Chu et al., 2006) and from rice (Tan et al., 2007), comparing mitotic to interphase chromatin is of limited use. Interphase chromatin is shielded from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope. Thus in such a comparison, many cytoplasmic hitchhikers proteins would be scored as mitosis-specific chromosomal proteins.</p>

                <title>Sample Preparation and Fractionation for Mass Spectrometry</title>
                <p>300 Î¼g protein were separated into a high and a low molecular weight fraction on a 1mm 4%â12% tris-glycine NuPAGE gel in MOPS buffer (Invitrogen), fixed with 50% methanol, 5% acetic acid, and stained with Invitrogren's Colloidal Blue kit. The two fractions were excised, and proteins were digested using trypsin at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:50 as described (Shevchenko et al., 1996). In brief, proteins were reduced in 10 mm DTT for 30 min at 37Â°C, alkylated in 55 mm iodoacetamide for 20 min at room temperature in the dark, and digested overnight at 37Â°C with 12.5 ng/Î¼l trypsin (proteomics grade, Sigma). The digestion medium was then quenched with phosphoric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) until pH 3.0 was reached. The sample was then diluted with Buffer A (5 mM KH2PO4, 10% acetonitrile, pH 3.0) to 20% acetonitrile and fractionated using strong cation exchange chromatography (2.1-mm Ã 20-cm polysulfethyl A column, Poly LC, Columbia, MD) on an UltiMate 3000 HPLC instrument (Dionex UK Ltd., Surrey, UK). Peptides were separated using Buffer A, Buffer B (Buffer A with 1 M KCl), a flow rate of 200 Î¼l/min, and a 50 min gradient as follows: 0â1 min, 0% Buffer B; 1â5 min, raise to 0.5% Buffer B; 5â14 min, raise to 1.0% Buffer B; 14â41 min, raise to 70% Buffer B (curve 7 equation, CHROMELEON software version 6.80, Dionex UK Ltd.); 41â42 min, 70% Buffer B. Fractions were collected every 1 min. All the fractions were diluted with 0.1% TFA at a ratio of 1:1 and desalted using StageTips (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rappsilber et al., 2003</xref>) for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis.</p>

                <p>An LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific) coupled on line to an Agilent 1100 binary nanopump and an HTC PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics) was used to analyze the fractionated peptides. The analytical column with a self-assembled particle frit (Ishihama et al., 2002) was prepared by packing C18 material (ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 Î¼m, Dr. Maisch, GmbH) into a spray emitter (75-Î¼m inner diameter, 8-Î¼m opening, 70-mm length; New Objectives) using an air pressure pump (Proxeon Biosystems). 5% acetonitrile, and 0.5% acetic acid constituted mobile phase A, while mobile phase B comprised acetonitrile and 0.5% acetic acid. Peptides were loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 0.7 Î¼l/min and eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 Î¼l/min. The gradient used for each fraction varied from 2 to 4 hr depending on the estimated concentration of peptides in the fraction. For a 2-h gradient run, elution used a gradient from 0% B to 20% B over 75 min and then from 20% B to 80% B over 13 min. Orbitrap Fourier-transform mass spectra were recorded at 30,000 resolution, and the six most intense ions were selected in the ion trap for fragmentation (normal scan; wideband activation; 750,000 and 15,000 ions fill target for MS and MS/MS respectively; maximum fill time, 150 ms; dynamic exclusion for 60 s).</p>

                <title>Data Processing and Protein Identification</title>
                <p>MS data were processed using MaxQuant 1.0.11.2 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) using the default settings (slice peaks: true; recalibrate: true; correct mass errors: true; max. peptide FDR: 0.01; max. peptide FPR: 0.1; max. protein FDR: 0.01; min. peptide length: 6; peptides used for protein quantitation: razor). Searches were conducted using Mascot version 2.1.3 (Matrix Sciences) for database searches against the chicken IPI database (version 3.49) in target/decoy configuration. Parameters used for the Mascot search were Trypsin/P for cleavage, Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term) for variable modifications, Label:13C(6) (R) and Label:13C(6) (K) for SILAC labels, monoisotopic mass, 7 ppm for MS tolerance and 0.5 Da for MS2 tolerance. Protein identification required two peptides, of which at least one was required to be unique in the database. A minimum of two peptide SILAC ratios was require to report a protein ratio.</p>
                <p>Proteins that share some but not all of the observed peptides were combined for the purpose of abundance estimation into a group, with a summed, unique spectral count and summed mass of all group members minus sequence redundancies provided that they were at least the length of a tryptic peptide. The group was then split following a tree based on sequence similarities between proteins. At the first branch of the tree, for each subgroup the count was estimated again based on the unique spectral count and unique mass. The abundances of the subgroups were accepted if their sum was within a two-fold window of the total group's abundance. This was continued until each protein obtained an estimation of its own abundance or until the sum of abundances deviated from the group estimate on the previous level by more than two-fold (âout of rangeâ).</p>
                <p>To obtain the name and functions of each protein, we referred to the following online databases: International Protein Index (IPI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/IPIhelp.html">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/IPIhelp.html</ext-link>), Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org">http://www.ensembl.org</ext-link>), Uniprot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://beta.uniprot.org">http://beta.uniprot.org</ext-link>), Entrez Gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene</ext-link>) and InterPro (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro</ext-link>).

                <p>All experiments minimized the impact of biases introduced due to fluctuations in the preparation by using pooled material from four independent preparations of mitotic chromosomes, as described above. In addition, the experiments were performed in duplicate and thus classifier values are averages of two measurements. Finally, no protein measurement is considered alone but only in conjunction with measurements of the same protein for other classifiers in a multidimensional analysis. Alternatively, members of the same complex are considered together. Both strategies provide a safeguard mechanism against artifacts resulting from outliers despite pooling and duplicate analysis.</p>

                <title>Classifier I: Abundance</title>
                <p>In order to estimate the abundance of proteins in mitotic chromosomes based on mass spectrometric data we rely on emPAI (<xref rid="bib40 bib21 bib64" ref-type="bibr">Rappsilber et al., 2002; Ishihama et al., 2005, 2008</xref>) in slightly modified form. Briefly, emPAI is calculated based on the number of peptides observed (<xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>) and the number of times that each peptide is observed (spectral count) for each protein as follows:<disp-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/ns/archiving/1.0/" id="M1" altimg="si1.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>emPAI</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>spectral count</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>protein</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>specific normalization</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mtext>.</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p>
                <p>Protein molecular weight was used here as a specific normalization, to adjust for differences between proteins in the number of observable peptides.</p>
                <p>In order to estimate absolute abundance of proteins based on emPAI we have made three amendments to emPAI. First, a proportionality constant <italic>a</italic> was introduced, reflecting the fact that emPAI might in the best case be directly proportional to protein abundance. Second, a scaling constant <italic>b</italic> was introduced. The values obtained by emPAI have been shown to estimate stoichiometry within a factor of 1.7 Â± 0.8 accuracy for proteins varying 50-fold in their abundance {Ishihama, 2005 #1013}. However, it is unclear how this accuracy would scale when considering stoichiometries that span several orders of magnitude. These adjustments give the following formula:<disp-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/ns/archiving/1.0/" id="M2" altimg="si2.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>estimated copy number</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>a</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>b</mml:mtext><mml:mo>â</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>spectral count</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>protein</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>specific normalization</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>.</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p>
                <p>Third, calibrating emPAI by using internal standards for which the absolute abundance is known (or can be reliably estimated) and that span the dynamic range in protein abundance allows minimizing the scaling effects and determination of the proportionality and scaling constants. Further calibration and a full evaluation of our approach will be required before mechanistic conclusions should be drawn from estimated stoichiometries in our data. Such an evaluation exceeds the needs for the analysis presented here, however. In the present study, we use the estimated abundances in order to estimate the proportions by which different protein classes contribute to mitotic chromosomes and to construct classifier I. It is remarkable (though not emphasized in the text) that members of protein complexes whose abundances were all estimated independently, nonetheless turned out to consistently have similar values for classifier I. Ultimately, the success of our RF analysis demonstrates that classifier I must suffice in its current form.</p>
                <p>Independent experimental evidence supporting our estimation of copy numbers is provided by Coomassie-based quantitation of histones, which reveals that these proteins contribute 60% to the protein mass of mitotic chromosomes. This is remarkably close to our emPAI-based estimate of 48%. Since histones are so abundant, their estimation involves multiplication of by far and away the largest numbers. Thus even a minor scaling error could easily skew the proportion of histones versus all other proteins, particularly since the remainder of chromosomes is composed of many low abundance proteins. To illustrate this point, taking emPAI values without our scaling factor and proportionality constant returns histones as 100% of the chromosomal protein. In contrast, using spectral count alone would see histones at 10% of the chromatin protein mass.</p>
                <p>It should also be noted that we predict 24 copies of CENP-A to be present at each of the 156 DT40 centromeres. This compares to 25-40 copies of CENP-A as measured at DT40 kinetochores recently by quantitative super-resolution microscopy (Ribeiro et al., 2010). The close coincidence of these two values measured by two independent approaches offers further support for our classifier I.</p>
                <p>For approximate scaling of emPAI we used three proteins for which quantities had either been measured or estimated in chicken cells: CENP-H (4680 molecules/cell measured by quantitative fluorescence â (Ribeiro et al., 2009)), topoisomerase IIÎ± (400,000 molecules/mitotic cell measured in similar chicken cell lines by quantitative immunoprecipitation) and histone H4 (5 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> molecules/cell estimated based on a diploid genome size of 2.4 Ã 10<sup>9</sup> base pairs and 190 base pairs per nucleosome â J. Allan, personal communication). The proportionality and scaling constants in our modified equation for emPAI were approximated to provide values for the three reference proteins that approximate most closely the reported or predicted values. This resulted in the proportionality constant a = 285097 and the scaling constant b = 0.01055. Taking for the three proteins the reported/predicted and emPAI calculated abundance (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>) reveals a linear relationship over several orders of magnitude (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>A). This shows that the two constants can be chosen to fit all three data points. Abundance determined for all proteins observed in our analyses was reproducible when using the modified emPAI equation with the approximated constants, as shown by plotting the results from two independent experiments against one another (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>B). In this analysis, 60% of the determinations were within a factor of Â± 2x and 96% were within Â± 10x. For comparison, the reproducibility of all classifier experiments is plotted in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>C.</p>

                <title>Classifier VI: Domain Analysis</title>
                <p>We included prior knowledge in the form of domain annotations as part of our analysis. In order to obtain value from domain annotations, we first counted how many chromosomal and nonchromosomal proteins each domain was found in (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>), and expressed these as a proportion of all the training-set proteins the domain was found in (i.e., so that these two proportions add up to 1). For each protein, we then summed the proportions for all domains found in that protein, giving us a sum of chromosomal domain proportions and a sum of nonchromosomal domain proportions. We used these two values as variables for each protein in classifier VI. We allowed the relative importance of these columns to be determined by the random forest itself.</p>

                  <p>Spc24 (IPI00576606) was identified 36 independent times in our reference experiment. This means that 36 individual fragmentation spectra were matched to peptide sequences from Spc24. This number is known as the spectral count. The protein abundance index (PAI) attempts to normalize for the size of the protein, since larger proteins have a greater chance of being seen because they can generate more peptides. In this case we divide the spectral count by the molecular weight of this protein in kDa, 22.831, to give a PAI of 1.58.</p>
                  <p>Plugging this into our calibrated emPAI equation gives the following:<disp-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/ns/archiving/1.0/" id="M3" altimg="si3.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>MSMS Count</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>36; MW</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>22</mml:mn><mml:mtext>.</mml:mtext><mml:mn>831</mml:mn><mml:mtext>; PAI</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>MSMS Count</mml:mtext><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mtext>MW</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>36</mml:mtext><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>22</mml:mn><mml:mtext>.</mml:mtext><mml:mn>831</mml:mn><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mtext>.</mml:mtext><mml:mn>57680346896763</mml:mn><mml:mtext>; a</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>285097</mml:mn><mml:mtext>.</mml:mtext><mml:mn>187780369</mml:mn><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>b</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>0</mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>.</mml:mtext><mml:mn>01054633137937</mml:mn><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Abundance estimate</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>a</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>Ë</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>b</mml:mtext><mml:mo>â</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mtext>PAI</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>285097.187780369</mml:mn><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>Ë</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.01054633137937</mml:mn><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.57680346896763</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>11128.3013920301</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p>

                  <title>Domains Calculation</title>
                  <p>For example, INCENP (IPI00823144) is annotated with 3 domains, an Aurora-related kinase (ARK) binding domain (PF03941), a tropomyosin signature domain (PR00194) and a glutamic acid-rich region (PS50313). <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref> shows the number of TRUE (chromosomal) and FALSE (nonchromosomal) proteins that each domain is associated with in our dataset. We calculated the proportion of true and false proteins that each domain was associated, e.g., the tropomyosin domain was found in 20 TRUE proteins and 42 FALSE protein, so the proportions are 20/62 = 0.32 and 42/62 = 0.68 for TRUE and FALSE respectively. We then summed these proportion for all domains in each protein, as shown at the bottom of the table.</p>
                  <p>These two sums provide the two columns for this classifier.</p>

                  <title>Combination of Classifiers by Random Forest Analysis</title>
                  <p>Combination of classifiers was performed using the WEKA implementation of random forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001; Frank et al., 2004; Hall et al., 2009). We defined two classes of proteins whose assignment as chromosomal or nonchromosomal was in general nonambiguous: centromere, telomere, chromosomal periphery, other chromosomal, replication and repair, transcription factors, RNA polymerases, histones and histone modifying proteins were labeled as true and cytoskeletal, cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, membrane and receptor proteins were labeled as false. Note that the choice of training data sets to establish the random forest is crucial. Our choice of the training data was validated in retrospect by the characterization of the 50 novel cloned proteins as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. We asked the RF to train on the training data and give values on all of our identified proteins. However, additional steps were taken to improve the value of the dataset prior to combination. Each classifier was subject to k-nearest-neighbors (k-NN) (Cover and Hart, 1980) using in-house software, and these values were added to the raw classifier data to be used in the RF. The k-NN was optimized at 50 nearest neighbors using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) across a range of values from 10 to 100. In addition to k-NN, we also added the number of missing data points in a protein as another variable to the random forest.</p>
                  <p>Random forests work by constructing a series of decision trees, the aim of each of which is to discriminate different classes of data (e.g., true and false). The trees are built randomly, so at each node (decision point) in the tree any classifier could be used. Then the data are divided on this classifier, each decision giving rise to another node where another random decision is made. Eventually, a node will adequately segregate the data on which it operates into two classes, and no more nodes are needed. Each tree is capable of distinguishing different classes of data, but a single tree does not perform definitively on data that was not in the training set, so multiple trees are used. The summation of all trees provides a âvoteâ on each data point to decide which class (true/chromosomal, false/nonchromosomal) the data point (e.g., a protein) is likely to be.</p>
                  <p>The data were subjected to RF using WEKA, via Java. The number of trees used was optimized using 10-fold cross-validation and ROC. The optimal number of trees was found to be 450. The depth of the trees was not limited. 10-fold cross-validation is a standard method of evaluating RF, since RF are susceptible to over-training and evaluation on the training set gives deceivingly good results, not likely to be representative of how the RF will perform on new data.</p>
                  <p>WEKA does not enable output of the 10-fold cross-validation data itself, so to obtain these data for proteins in our training set, we randomly split our training set into 10 portions of roughly equal size (within 10%) and use 9 of the ten portions to train the RF, which was then used to produce values for the tenth portion. This was repeated until each protein had a value from an RF in which it was not a member of the training set. All the RF data we show on chromosomal (true) and nonchromosomal (false) proteins, except in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, are derived from these cross-validation data.</p>
                  <p>The output of the random forest, in this context, is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the probability that a protein is chromosomal as opposed to nonchromosomal. It does not consider any other class of protein, and makes the implicit assumption that our training set (in this case 772 chromosomal and 1331 nonchromosomal proteins) adequately represents the unknown proteins that we would like to classify.</p>

Cells maintained in this medium for 48 (Ska3/Rama1 and CENP-32), 72 (CENP-27) hours were fixed for 5 min. with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services) in PBS or for 20 min. with Methanol in â20Â°C. After permeabilization with 0.15% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, coverslips were blocked with 1% (v/v) BSA in PBS. Cells were probed with antibodies against: CENP-C (1:600, rabbit 554), ACA (1:200, human), Î±-tubulin (B512, 1:2000, mouse; Sigma), RanBP2 (1:1000, goat) (Hutten et al., 2008), RacGAP1 (N-19, 1:100, goat, Santa-Cruz Biotechnology), SBP (1:300, mouse 20), Pericentrin (ab4448, 1:1000, rabbit, Abcam), Î³-tubulin (AK15, 1:1000, rabbit; Sigma). Cells were washed three times with cytoskeleton buffer for 5 min, fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies were applied at 1:200, and the DNA was counterstained with DAPI at 0.1 Î¼g/ml.</p>

                  <p>Multiple sequence alignments were produced with T-Coffee (Notredame et al., 2000) using default parameters, slightly refined manually and viewed with the Belvu program (Sonnhammer and Hollich, 2005). The amino acid coloring scheme indicates average BLOSUM62 scores (correlated with amino acid conservation) for each alignment column: red (greater than 3), violet (between 3 and 1.5) and light yellow (between 1.5 and 0.5).</p>
                  <p>Sequence names (and UniProt accession codes in parentheses) for the analysis of CENP-32 are as follows: hCENP32 (Q5T280) <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>; Fly (Q8MSZ6) <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>; Worm (Q10950) <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>; Plant (Q6NLH7) <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>; YGR283C (P53336) <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>; YMR310C (Q04867) <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>; S_pombe (O13641) <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>; 1K3R (O26109) <italic>Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</italic> protein of known structure.</p>
                  <p>The ribbon representation and electrostatic surface potential map for a homology model of the human CENP-32 protein was based on the published crystal structure of the CENP-32 homolog from <italic>M. thermoautotrophicum</italic> (Zarembinski et al., 2003) and obtained using MODELER (Marti-Renom et al., 2000). Images and electrostatic potentials were created with Pymol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net">http://pymol.sourceforge.net</ext-link>) and APBS (Baker et al., 2001).</p>
                  <p>Among the other novel kinetochore proteins, CENP-30/FBOX28 contains an F-box domain characteristic of proteins that link substrates with E3 ubiquitin ligases. Skp1, a member of the SCF complex (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) regulates the stability of kinetochore protein Ctf13 in budding yeast (Kaplan et al., 1997), and with Sgt1 (another component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase) is involved in checkpoint regulation (Kitagawa et al., 1999). Thus, CENP-30 may be involved in regulating protein turnover within the kinetochore.</p>

            <p>Details of the proteins identified across the five proteomic experiments. Column âTFâ refers to whether the protein is considered true (chromosomal) or false (nonchromosomal) in the training set. Columns âLocalization,â âFunction,â âNameâ and âComplexâ are various annotations we have made to the proteins. âDomain Accessionsâ are the accession numbers from Ensembl of domains annotated in each protein. âcIâ through âcVâ are the values for classifiers I..V and âk-NN cIâ through âk-NN cVâ are the nearest neighbor results for each classifier. âQâ is the number of missing values among the classifiers. âTrue Domain Score and âFalse Domain Scoreâ are as described in Supplementary Experimental Procedures. In brief they represent the trueness (tendency to occur on chromosomal proteins) or falseness (tendency to occur on nonchromosomal proteins) of domains annotated in each protein. Columns âCloned IPI,â âCloned Ensembl,â âCloned MW,â âCloned Localizationâ and âCloned Nameâ give information about the novel/unknown proteins we cloned in this study. The remaining columns give the results of random forest analysis, with columns names ending âTFâ giving the predicted class of each protein and columns ending âprobability Tâ giving the proportion of trees that voted a protein as true (chromosomal). âRF(cI..V)â refers to classifiers I through V being combined using random forest analysis. â10CVâ denotes that the values are the result of 10-fold cross-validation.</p>

        <p>Proteomic Analysis of Mitotic Chromosome Proteins Gave Reproducible Classifier Values, Related to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></p>
        <p>(A) Calibrating the abundance estimation. Shown is a modified version of the emPAI equation, incorporating proportionality and scaling constants. We optimized these constants on three proteins to give the minimum error. The equation is capable of achieving a near linear relationship between known abundance and the abundance we estimate for the three standard proteins.</p>
        <p>(B) A scatter-plot comparing abundance between two independent analyses, using different preps, shows that the data have an approximately x = y correlation. Two-thirds of proteins have abundance values within 2-fold of each other and only 1% vary by &gt; 10-fold.</p>
        <p>(C) The values from two independent analyses of each classifier, using different preps, and divided one by the other to give a fold-error. For abundance, enrichment, exchange and Smc2 dependency, we found that 66%, 73%, 68% and 83% of proteins, respectively, had values falling within a factor of 2 for the two experiments and 90%, 92%, 93% and 97% were within a factor of 4.</p>

        <p>Smoothed Histograms Showing the Distribution of Proteins Across Classifiers and RF Analysis, Related to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></p>
        <p>(AâE) Classifiers I - V have been scaled between 0 and 1 on a log scale. The classifier is plotted on the <italic>x</italic> axis, while the <italic>y</italic> axis shows the number of proteins in each tenth of the classifier.</p>
        <p>(F) The equivalent plot for the result of the ten-fold cross-validation of the random forest analysis shows that the proteins are spread more widely and is expected to provide better enrichment of chromosomal proteins at higher scores than the other classifiers.</p>

        <p>The Performance of the Random Forest, Related to <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></p>
        <p>(A) A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot graphs sensitivity versus specificity. The area under the ROC curve demonstrates the power of each classifier. The ROC curve for all proteomic classifiers combined using the random forest is taken from a ten-fold cross-validation, indicating the robustness of the system when applied to data not included in the training set. This shows that the combination of classifiers is expected to outperform them individually.</p>
        <p>(B) Addition of a bioinformatic classifier, consisting of two variables: chromosomal domain score and nonchromosomal domain score. Integrating proteomic and nonproteomic classifiers by random forest provides the best performance as indicated by the area under curve (AUC = 0.97).</p>
        <p>(C) True over false positives when including domain data. A random forest integrating all six classifiers reports with the first 500 true positives only 17 false positives.</p>
        <p>(D) Success of Classifier VI (domains) used for training a random forest to separate chromosomal and nonchromosomal proteins. Note that this is the data for the training set (similar to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A) and not ten-fold cross-validation, i.e., showing the ability of the random forest to be trained using the training data and not the ability of the random forest to predict localization. The classifier is plotted on the <italic>y</italic> axis, while the <italic>x</italic> axis shows the result of the ten-fold cross-validation of the random forest analysis using Classifiers I - V. Classifier VI (domains) assigns a high score to many chromosomal training proteins and a low score to many nonchromosomal training proteins. For these proteins a random forest can be trained to separate the training set. However, for a significant group of proteins (roughly found at y = 0.42) no separation is achieved. For these proteins the random forest cannot be trained. This is not surprising as proteins lacking known domains are found on and off chromosomes and can thus not be assigned to either localization based on known domains or lack thereof. Note that these proteins are segregated into predicted chromosomal and nonchromosomal efficiently using random forest analysis and Classifiers I - V.</p>
