      <abstract>
        <p>Homologous recombination (HR) provides an efficient mechanism for error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, HR can be also harmful as inappropriate or untimely HR events can give rise to lethal recombination intermediates and chromosome rearrangements. A critical step of HR is the formation of a RAD51 filament on single-stranded (ss)DNA, which mediates the invasion of a homologous DNA molecule. In mammalian cells, several DNA helicases have been implicated in the regulation of this process. RECQ5, a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases, interacts physically with the RAD51 recombinase and disrupts RAD51 presynaptic filaments in a reaction dependent on ATP hydrolysis. Here, we have precisely mapped the RAD51-interacting domain of RECQ5 and generated mutants that fail to interact with RAD51. We show that although these mutants retain normal ATPase activity, they are impaired in their ability to displace RAD51 from ssDNA. Moreover, we show that ablation of RECQ5-RAD51 complex formation by a point mutation alleviates the inhibitory effect of RECQ5 on HR-mediated DSB repair. These findings provide support for the proposal that interaction with RAD51 is critical for the anti-recombinase attribute of RECQ5.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homologous recombination (HR)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> provides an efficient mechanism for accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are generated during S/G2 by DNA-damaging agents or arise as a consequence of replication fork demise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). However, HR must be tightly regulated, as it could generate toxic intermediates, interfere with other important DNA repair pathways, or give rise to gross chromosomal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>In the budding yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>, the Srs2 DNA helicase regulates HR at an early step by acting as a DNA translocase that disassembles the Rad51 presynaptic filament, which catalyzes the invasion of the donor chromatid to give rise to a three-stranded structure called a displacement (D)-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In mammalian cells, several DNA helicases have been implicated in the regulation of HR initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). One of these, RECQ5, belongs to the RecQ family of DNA helicases that play important roles in maintenance of genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Inactivation of the <italic>Recql5</italic> gene in mice results in genomic instability and cancer susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Cells derived from the knock-out mice show increased frequency of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal rearrangements, prolonged persistence of RAD51 foci after replication stress and elevated efficiency of HR-mediated DSB repair as compared with normal cells, suggesting that RECQ5 acts as a suppressor of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Human RECQ5 has been shown to accumulate at sites of DNA DSBs and replication arrest in a manner dependent on the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex, a key player in DNA damage recognition and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Like Srs2, RECQ5 physically interacts with RAD51 and possesses the ability to disrupt ATP-bound form of RAD51-ssDNA filament, thereby preventing RAD51-mediated D-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of how RECQ5 removes RAD51 from ssDNA is not completely understood. RECQ5-mediated release of RAD51 from ssDNA is fully dependent on the ATPase activity of RECQ5 that drives its translocation along DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Moreover, this reaction is enhanced by the ssDNA-binding factor replication protein A (RPA) that prevents renucleation of RAD51 onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Interestingly, other RecQ helicases such as WRN are not capable of catalyzing RAD51 presynaptic filament disruption, suggesting that RECQ5-mediated removal of RAD51 from ssDNA does not stem simply from its ssDNA translocase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Here we address the role of the physical interaction between RECQ5 and RAD51 in the anti-recombinase activity of RECQ5. We have precisely mapped the RAD51-interacting domain of RECQ5 and generated mutants that retain normal ATPase activity, but fail to interact with RAD51. Using these mutants, we show that loss of interaction between RECQ5 and RAD51 significantly reduces the anti-recombinase activity of RECQ5 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data support the proposal that RECQ5 regulates HR by disrupting RAD51 presynaptic filaments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Plasmid Constructs and Protein Purification</title><p>Plasmid constructs for bacterial production of human RECQ5 and its variants are derived from the pTXB1 vector, in which protein of interest is expressed as a C-terminal fusion with a self-cleaving affinity tag composed of a Mxe intein fragment and a chitin-binding domain (CBD) (New England Biolabs). The plasmids pPG10 (wild-type RECQ5; amino acids 1â991), pPG17 (RECQ5<sup>1â410</sup>), pPG19 (RECQ5<sup>1â475</sup>), pPG21 (RECQ5<sup>1â561</sup>), pPG20 (RECQ5<sup>1â651</sup>), pPG18 (RECQ5<sup>1â725</sup>), pPG11 (RECQ5<sup>675â991</sup>), and pPG16 (RECQ5<sup>411â991</sup>) were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Note that the numbers in superscript refer to RECQ5 codons. The expression vector for RECQ5<sup>529â725</sup> (pPG10N529â725C) was constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding part of the <italic>RECQ5</italic> cDNA followed by its cloning in pTXB1 via NdeI/SapI sites. The internal deletion variant of RECQ5, RECQ5<sup>Î640â653</sup>, was constructed by linking two PCR products via Acc65I site that is in-frame with the codons 639 and 654 of RECQ5. The PCR products were cleaved with SacI/Acc651 (N-terminal fragment) and Acc65I/Bsu36I (C-terminal fragment), respectively, and ligated with the Bsu36I/SacI fragment of pPG10. Note that the resulting construct (pPG10Î640â653) contains two additional codons (GGTACC; Acc65I site) in between the codons 639 and 654. The expression vectors for RECQ5<sup>Î652â674</sup> (pPG10Î652â674) and RECQ5<sup>Î652â725</sup> (pPG10Î652â725) were constructed using the same strategy. The expression vectors for RECQ5<sup>Î515â568</sup> (pPG10Î515â568), RECQ5<sup>Î543â607</sup> (pPG10Î543â607) and RECQ5<sup>Î571â653</sup> (pPG10Î571â653) were constructed using restriction enzymes. The pPG10Î515â568 plasmid results from FspI/BsaAI deletion of pPG10. The pPG10Î543â607 plasmid results from BamHI/EcoRV deletion of pPG10 where BamHI end was filled by Klenow fragment. The pPG10Î571â653 plasmid results from BsaAI/Acc65I deletion of pPG10Î640â653 where the Acc65I end was filled by Klenow fragment. The expression vectors for RECQ5<sup>R654A</sup> (pPG10R654A), RECQ5<sup>F659A</sup> (pPG10F659A), RECQ5<sup>F666A</sup> (pPG10F666A), and RECQ5<sup>E671A</sup> (pPG10E671A) were prepared using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pPG10 as template. For ectopic expression of RECQ5, RECQ5<sup>Î652â674</sup>, and RECQ5<sup>F666A</sup> in human cells, the pcDNA3.1/HisC vector (Invitrogen) was used. For wild-type RECQ5, <italic>RECQ5</italic> cDNA was cloned between BamHI and NdeI sites in pcDNA3.1/HisC. The BamHI end of the cleaved vector was filled in by Klenow fragment. In the resulting plasmid, named pJP136, the N terminus of RECQ5 is fused to a (His)<sub>6</sub>-Xpress epitope tag. The expression vector for RECQ5<sup>Î652â674</sup> (pJP136Î652â674) was generated by replacement of the BstEII-Bsu36I fragment in pJP136 with the BstEII-Bsu36I fragment of pPG10Î652â674. The expression vector for RECQ5<sup>F666A</sup> was constructed using the same strategy with pPG10F666A as a source of the F666A mutation.</p><p>Wild-type and mutant forms of human RECQ5 were produced and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).

Biochemical studies have revealed that RECQ5 interacts physically with the RAD51 recombinase and displaces RAD51 from ssDNA in a manner dependent on ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Herein, we provide evidence that efficient RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament disruption by RECQ5 is reliant on protein complex formation. Through an extensive domain mapping effort, we show that RECQ5 interacts with RAD51 through a 70 amino acid domain that is located within the non-conserved C-terminal-half of the RECQ5 protein. Abolishment of the physical interaction between RECQ5 and RAD51 by mutations within this domain significantly reduces the ability of RECQ5 to disrupt the ATP-bound form of RAD51-ssDNA filament <italic>in vitro</italic> and to inhibit HR-mediated DSB repair <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings support the proposal that RECQ5 suppresses HR by disrupting RAD51 presynaptic filaments.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that disruption of Rad51 presynaptic filaments by the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> Srs2 helicase is also dependent on a specific protein-protein interaction between Srs2 and Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). It has been demonstrated that binding of Srs2 to Rad51 stimulates ATP hydrolysis within the Rad51 filament, which causes Rad51 dissociation from the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Based on these observations, a model has been proposed where the ATP-dependent ssDNA-translocase activity of Srs2 serves to position Srs2 for binding to each successive Rad51 subunits of the presynaptic filament to promote its dissociation from DNA by allosterically activating ATP hydrolysis by Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Because Srs2 also stimulated ATP hydrolysis by the K191R mutant of Rad51, an equivalent to the K133R mutant of human RAD51 used in our study, and promoted its dissociation from ssDNA, it is possible that RECQ5-mediated disruption of RAD51 presynaptic filaments occurs via a similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, RECQ5 mutants defective in interacting with RAD51 still exhibited a considerable level of RAD51 displacement activity in DNA topology modification assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Therefore, it is also possible that RECQ5 disrupts presynaptic filament by means of its ssDNA-translocase activity in a manner similar to the T4 Dda helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and the interaction between RECQ5 and RAD51 serves to facilitate the loading of RECQ5 on the DNA. It is also possible that the residual activity of RECQ5 mutants stems from RECQ5-mediated dissociation of ADP-bound RAD51 molecules resulting from basal ATP hydrolysis in the presynaptic filament. However, this scenario is less likely because we found that the RAD51<sup>K133R</sup>-ssDNA filament was fairly stable in the presence of the BLM helicase<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> that was shown to be capable of disrupting the ADP-bound form of the RAD51 filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Srs2 interacts with Rad51 through a domain that is located in the middle of the C-terminal-half of the Srs2 polypeptide while the N-terminal half of the Srs2 polypeptide constitutes the DNA-translocase/helicase module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Notably, such a domain organization is also seen in RECQ5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). In addition, RECQ5 and Srs2 contain a PCNA interaction domain at their extreme C termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Thus, RECQ5 and Srs2 exhibit extensive structural similarity that further supports the notion that these proteins have similar roles in the regulation of HR. However, a question arises as to how do these anti-recombinase distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate RAD51 filaments? Accumulating evidence suggests that Srs2 removes Rad51 from ssDNA indiscriminately, whereas recombination mediators such as Rad52 act to reform filaments when and where they are appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Biochemical experiments clearly showed that Rad52 is sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of Srs2 on Rad51-mediated D-loop reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Interestingly, Srs2 and Rad52 interact with overlapping motifs on Rad51, which are conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). It will be interesting to test whether these motifs contribute to the association of RAD51 with RECQ5 and BRCA2 in human cells. Like yeast Rad52, BRCA2 protein targets RAD51 to RPA-coated ssDNA and promotes assembly of the presynaptic filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). It has been shown that the C-terminal region of BRCA2 binds to and stabilizes the RAD51 presynaptic filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In this regard, it will be also interesting to evaluate the effect of this BRCA2 domain on the RAD51 filament disruption activity of RECQ5.</p></sec>
