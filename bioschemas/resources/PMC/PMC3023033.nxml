      <abstract>
        <p>ABCC6 is a member of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) gene subfamily C that encodes a protein
(MRP6) involved in active transport of intracellular compounds to the extracellular environment. Mutations in ABCC6
cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), an autosomal recessive disorder of the connective tissue characterized by progressive
calcification of elastic structures in the skin, the eyes, and the cardiovascular system. MRP6 is codified by 31 exons and contains
1503 amino acids. In addition to a full-length transcript of ABCC6, we have identified an alternatively spliced variant of ABCC6
from a cDNA of human liver that lacks exons 19 and 24. The novel isoform was named ABCC6 Î19Î24. PCR analysis from
cDNA of cell cultures of primary human hepatocites and embryonic kidney confirms the presence of the ABCC6Î19Î24 isoform.
Western blot analysis of the embryonic kidney cells shows a band corresponding to the molecular weight of the truncated protein.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>ABCC6 belongs to the subfamily C of ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transmembrane transporters. The ABCC6 gene
consists of 31 exons encoding for a protein of 1503 amino
acids and has 17 transmembrane spanning domains and
two conserved intracellular nucleotide binding domains
(NBDs). ABCC6 is homologous (45% identity on amino acid
level) to ABCC1, known to confer multidrug resistance to
tumor cells [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; for that reason, ABCC6 was classified as
a multidrug resistance associated protein and also named
MRP6. The NBDs contain two highly conserved Walker
motifs critical for ATP binding and transmembrane transporter
functions [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mutations of the ABCC6 gene cause
the pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) (OMIM 177850 and
264800), amultisystemdisorder characterized by progressive
calcification and degeneration of elastic fibers [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. </p>
      <p>ABCC6 is highly expressed in human liver and to lesser
extent in the proximal tubules of the kidney and only at
very low levels, if at all, in tissues, such as skin, eyes, and
cardiovascular system affected in pseudoxanthoma elasticum
(PXE) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To date, genetic studies have identified 165
mutations, mainly missense and nonsense mutations, as well
as large deletions (for a review see [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Since MRP6 is mainly
expressed in liver and kidney, but only low levels are found
in tissues affected by PXE, it has been suggested that PXE is
primarily a metabolic disorder with secondary involvement
of elastic fibers [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite the high correlation between
ABCC6 mutations and PXE, the activity of MRP6 and its role
in PXE remain largely unknown.</p>
      <p>Recently, a splice variant leading to a 5âbp deletion
in the ABCC6 transcript has been associated with cardiac
dystrophic calcifications in mice [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>In our study, we report the identification of a new variant
of ABCC6 from human liver cDNA lacking exons 19 and 24.
This splice variant was also confirmed in hepatic and renal
cell cultures.</p>

      <title>3. Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>
ABCC6 was amplified by PCR from human liver cDNA
using specific primers and cloned into pCDNA3.1 vector.
Surprisingly, the sequencing of some clones showed two
different sequences of 4512 and 4137 nucleotides corresponding
to the full length (ABCC6) and a shorter variant of
ABCC6, respectively. A comparison of the shorter one with
the exon/intron boundaries of ABCC6 gene revealed that the
exons 19 and 24 were missing.
</p>
      <p>In order to verify if the short form, namely, ABCC6
Î19Î24, was a result of low-frequency splicing events or
an ABCC6 variant, we amplified and sequenced the PCR
products of the exon 18â25 region from cDNA of human
liver, human kidney, primary human hepatocites (HI),
and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). Liver and
kidney showed essentially the complete exon 18â25 region
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> lanes 1 and 2), whereas the variant in which
both exons are missing has been found mainly in HI and
HEK293 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> lanes 3 and 4). Then, we suggest that
the isoform lacking exons 19 and 24 may be a product of a
splicing variant differently distributed in various tissues and
cell lines.</p>
      <p>Deletion of the entire exon 19 causes a shift of the
reading frame with insertion of a stop signal at nucleotides
2614â2616 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As consequence of the premature stop
codon, the putative novel protein has a different and shorter
C-terminus than that of native MRP6 protein. By a secondround
nested PCR, aberrant splicing of the ABCC6 mRNA
has been previously observed in tissues that do not express
appreciable amount of the protein [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More recently, it has
been demonstrated that a missense mutation in ABCC6 gene
of mice creates a premature stop codon that, apart fromPXE,
causes dystrophic cardiac calcification [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These findings
suggest that truncated forms of ABCC6 can somehow affect
cell activity.</p>
      <p>For this reason, the identification of different splicing
variants of ABCC6 in tissues such as liver and kidney, where
ABCC6 is normally expressed, may be an important step
in understanding the complex function of this gene and
in clarifying the pathogenetic mechanisms of the correlated
diseases.</p>
      <p>To examine if the shorter variant encodes an expressed
protein, we analyzed HEK293 by western blot analysis
using an MRP6 N-terminus antibody as described in
the methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The predicted wild type protein
of nearly 165âkDa (MRP6) and a more intense band of
about 100âkDa corresponding to the truncated protein
(MRP6 Î19Î24) are detected. The additional band between
them could correspond to a different glycosylated form of
the truncated protein. Western blot analysis is consistent
with the expression level of the ABCC6Î19Î24 variant
showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and suggests that this isoform prevails
in these cells.</p>
      <p>Different speculative hypothesis on the function of the
ABCC6Î19Î24 variant may be put forward.</p>
      <p>The finding that ABCC6Î19Î24 variant codifies an
expressed protein suggests a variety of functions for the
ABCC6 gene and confirms that the alternative splicing is a
diffuse mechanism to increase protein diversity in the ABC
transporter superfamily.</p>
      <p>We suggest that the translated protein of the ABCC6Î-19Î24 variant is a half transporter. In fact, translation of
the nucleotide sequence of this variant yields a putative
truncated protein of 871 amino acids, encompassing the
first two transmembrane domains and the first NBD at
the C-terminal end. It is well known that some other
human ABC genes encode half transporters as a consequence
of alternative splicing, such as the ABCA5 gene, which
encodes a protein of 1642 amminoacids and a polypeptide
of 925 amminoacids [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and the human ABCB6 that
produces two distinct molecular weight forms, localized
in the outer mitochondrial membrane and in the plasma
membrane [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
