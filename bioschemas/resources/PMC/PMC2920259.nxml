        <p id="P3">The Fic family of adenylyltransferases, defined by a core HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif, consist of over 2700 proteins found from bacteria to humans. IbpA from the bacterial pathogen <italic>Histophilus somni</italic> contains two Fic domains that adenylylate the switch1 Tyr residue of Rho-family GTPases, allowing the bacteria to subvert host defenses. Here we present the structure of the second Fic domain of IbpA (IbpAFic2) in complex with its substrate, Cdc42. IbpAFic2-bound Cdc42 mimics the GDI-bound state of Rho GTPases, with both its switch1 and switch2 regions gripped by IbpAFic2. Mutations disrupting the IbpAFic2-Cdc42 interface impair adenylylation and cytotoxicity. Importantly, the switch1 Tyr of Cdc42 is adenylylated in the structure, providing the first structural view for this post-translational modification. We also demonstrate that the nucleotide-binding mechanism is conserved among Fic proteins, and propose a catalytic mechanism for this recently discovered family of enzymes.</p>

    <p id="P4">The Fic (filamentation induced by cyclic AMP) domains are defined by a core HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif and are conserved from bacteria to humans<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Over 2700 Fic proteins exist in nature, and until recently, their biological activity had remained elusive. Orth and colleagues, as well as our laboratory recently reported that Fic domain proteins from two pathogenic bacteria use ATP to catalyze the addition of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to target host proteins<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Specifically, IbpA from <italic>Histophilus somni</italic> causes collapse of the host cell actin cytoskeleton by catalyzing the addition of AMP to the three mammalian Rho-family GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. The modification occurs on a conserved tyrosine residue in the switch1 region of these GTPases, resulting in their inability to interact with the downstream effectors. In contrast, VopS from <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> catalyzes the addition of AMP to a conserved switch1 threonine residue in the same family of GTPases<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P5">It is highly likely that all Fic proteins use the conserved HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif to catalyze the addition of AMP, or âadenylylationâ of target proteins. A small branch of the Fic proteins, known as Doc (death on curing), has been previously studied in the bacteriophage P1 of <italic>E. coli</italic> as part of a toxin-antitoxin module<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Doc triggers cytotoxicity by associating with the 30s ribosomal subunits and inhibiting translation elongation<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. The exact nature of Doc function remains unclear; however, Doc also harbors a central HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif. Mutating the conserved His or Asp in this motif attenuated the cytotoxicity of Doc, suggesting an enzymatic scheme<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P6">Fic domain-containing proteins are found in many species of bacterial pathogens. In particular, a list of effector proteins from pathogenic bacteria feature this domain, such as AnkX from <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, BepA from <italic>Bartonella spp.</italic><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, AvrAC from <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, and PfhB2 from <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. It remains to be determined whether these effectors also target the Rho-family GTPases. Structural analyses further expand the Fic/Doc family to include AvrB, an effector protein of the plant pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>; even though AvrB lacks the HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif. It is currently unknown whether AvrB represents a functional member of this family. The large number of Fic domain-containing proteins also makes it unlikely that they all function in a pathogenic setting. The presence of a Fic protein, called HYPE (Huntingtin yeast interacting protein E), in higher eukaryotes including humans suggests that Fic-mediated adenylylation might represent a new signaling paradigm that regulates cellular processes<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. As such, a deeper understanding of these Fic adenylyltransferases at a structural and functional level will likely shed light on both their physiology and pathology.</p>
    <p id="P7">The covalent addition of AMP to other proteins has been previously reported. In the late 1960s, adenylylation on tyrosine residues was reported for bacterial glutamine synthetase<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Transient adenylylation of a C-terminal glycine residue, or a catalytic lysine residue, also occurs during the activation of ubiquitin/ubiquitinlike proteins<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, or during DNA/RNA ligation processes<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. However, the Fic proteins share no homology with bacterial glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferases, the E1-like enzymes, or the polynucleotide ligases. Although structures of several Fic domain proteins have been determined by structural genomics efforts (PDB ID: 2F6S, 2G03, 3CUC, 3EQX, and 2VZA)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, they were achieved before the enzymatic activity of this family of proteins was revealed, and did not provide important insights into the catalytic mechanism of these proteins.</p>
    <p id="P8">IbpA is a large protein that is composed of 4095 amino acids. It contains an N-terminal secretion signal followed by a filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) domain, which presumably contributes to its attachment to the host cell<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. In its C-terminal region, it contains two consecutive Fic domains (Fic1 and Fic2), which share more than 70% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) and appear functionally redundant in disrupting the host cell cytoskeleton<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. A YopT cysteine protease homology domain resides at the C-terminal end of IbpA; however, this region is dispensable for cytotoxicity<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. To further the understanding of the virulence action of <italic>H. somni</italic>, and to gain fundamental insights into the functional mechanism of the Fic proteins, we have performed structural and functional studies on the Fic domain of IbpA. Here we report the crystal structure of IbpAFic2 in complex with Cdc42. Importantly, our structure captures an end product of the enzymatic reaction, in which the switch1 Tyr of Cdc42 is adenylylated. Further, we have elucidated the nucleotide-binding mechanism of IbpAFic2, which is conserved and can be extrapolated to other Fic proteins. Together, these results significantly expand our understanding of this unique family of enzymes and provide compelling new insights into the functional mechanism of these proteins.</p>

        <title>Structure of IbpAFic2</title>
        <p id="P9">IbpAFic2, composed of amino acids 3482-3797 of IbpA, is highly stable and has a similar catalytic activity to larger fragments of Fic1 or Fic2. It crystallized under a condition containing zinc sulfate; and the presence of zinc in the crystal is detected by fluorescence scanning at the synchrotron, even after the crystal is pre-washed with zinc-free solution. As such, we have been able to determine the structure of IbpAFic2 using the Zn-SAD (single-wavelength anomalous dispersion) method (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The structure is refined to a final 1.85 Ã resolution and reveals two zinc atoms bound per IbpAFic2 molecule, which are critical for mediating the crystal contact.</p>
        <p id="P10">The overall structure of IbpAFic2 reveals an all-helical molecule, containing 14 Î±-helices. It consists of two segments: an N-terminal helical module and a core Fic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The core Fic domain has a similar architecture to the Fic domains in other Fic protein structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) including Doc and AvrB, featuring a central helix-turn-helix motif (Î±11âÎ±12) surrounded by six additional Î±-helices (Î±6, Î±8, Î±9, Î±10, Î±13, and Î±14). The highly conserved HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R sequence motif constitutes the Î±11âÎ±12 loop as well as the first helical turn of Î±12. The N-terminal helical module is unique to IbpAFic2. In particular, helices Î±2, Î±3, and Î±4 form an independent âarmâ subdomain, which specifically recognizes the Rho-family GTPases (see below). It is intriguing that several of other Fic proteins have also evolved unique structural motifs besides the Fic domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Based on our knowledge of the structure and function of IbpAFic2, we speculate the unique structural element in each Fic protein is responsible for substrate recognition, while the Fic domains execute a common catalytic function.</p>

        <title>Structure of the IbpAFic2<sup>H3717A</sup>-Cdc42 complex</title>
        <p id="P11">To gain insights into the substrate binding mechanism of IbpAFic2, we have determined the crystal structure of a catalytically compromised mutant, IbpAFic2<sup>H3717A</sup> in complex with Cdc42 at 2.3 Ã resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Although IbpAFic2 is a monomer in solution based on gel filtration analysis, as well as in the crystal form described above, it emerges as a dimer in the IbpAFic2<sup>H3717A</sup>-Cdc42 complex structure, leading to the formation of a 2:2 (IbpAFic2: Cdc42) tetramer in the asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). There are no interactions between the two Cdc42 molecules in the tetramer. Comparison between the structures of apo and Cdc42-bound IbpAFic2 showed that their overall similarity is high. The root mean square difference between the two structures based on the CÎ± chains is 0.8 Ã. Most of the structural differences are located in the arm domain and the long Î±9âÎ±10 loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). In the dimer structure, the N-terminal half of the Î±9âÎ±10 loop interacts with the backside of the arm domain to form the dimer interface, resulting in slight overall displacements of both regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). The C-terminal half of the Î±9âÎ±10 loop (residues 3668â3672), disordered in the monomeric structure, also adopts a concrete conformation and plays a pivotal role in recognizing the switch1 region of Cdc42 (see below). The dimer interface buries ~923 Ã<sup>2</sup>, or ~6% solvent accessible surface from each protein and is mediated mostly by polar interactions, many through water molecules. The residues involved in dimer formation are largely conserved between Fic1 and Fic2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Since there are two Fic domains in IbpA, we cannot rule out the possibility that the Fic domains form dimers or heterodimers within the cell. The functional significance of this remains to be explored.</p>

        <title>IbpAFic2-bound Cdc42 mimics the GDI-bound state</title>
        <p id="P12">Comparison of IbpAFic2-bound Cdc42 with available Rho-family protein structures reveals intriguing similarity to the Rho proteins in their GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor)-bound states. When the Cdc42 structure in the IbpAFic2<sup>H3717A</sup>-Cdc42 complex was used to search for similar structures in the protein database, Rac2 and Cdc42 in their GDI-bound conformation were the best two matches (PDB ID: 1DS6<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and 1DOA<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, respectively). The root mean square deviations of alpha-carbon atoms between IbpAFic2-bound Cdc42 and the GDI-bound Rac2 and Cdc42 are 0.8 Ã and 0.6 Ã, respectively. Alignments with other Cdc42 structures in different functional states also reveal the switch1 and switch2 regions adopt conformations most similar to the GDI bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>

        <title>IbpAFic2<sup>H3717A</sup>-Cdc42 interface</title>
        <p id="P13">IbpAFic2 employs a tripartite mechanism of substrate recognition and mainly engages the switch1 and switch2 regions of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The binding interface between IbpAFic2 and Cdc42 buries an average of ~1142 Ã<sup>2</sup> solvent accessible surface (1170 Ã<sup>2</sup> and 1113 Ã<sup>2</sup> for the two complexes in the asymmetric unit, respectively) from each protein, with the switch1 and switch2 interfaces each constituting ~440 Ã<sup>2</sup> and ~610 Ã<sup>2</sup>, respectively. A third binding interface involves the Î²1âÎ±1 loop of Cdc42 and the Î±13âÎ±14 loop of IbpAFic2. This interface is small (~90 Ã<sup>2</sup>) compared to the former two interfaces, so we will focus our discussion on the interactions mediated by the switch1 and switch2 regions of Cdc42.</p>
        <p id="P14">At the switch1 region where the target tyrosine (Tyr32<sup>C</sup>, Cdc42 residues are denoted with superscript âCâ) is located, the side chains of Tyr32<sup>C</sup> and Pro34<sup>C</sup> make hydrophobic interactions with side chains of Leu3668 and Lys3670 from the Î±9âÎ²10 loop of IbpAFic2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In particular, the side chains of Leu3668 and Lys3670 form a âclampâ, which locks the position of the Tyr32<sup>C</sup> side chain in the correct orientation for modification. Mutating Leu3668 and Lys3670 to alanines substantially reduced the activity of IbpAFic2 towards the Rho-family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In addition to the hydrophobic contacts, a salt bridge between Asp38<sup>C</sup> and Lys3533, and three main chain-main chain hydrogen bonds between Thr35<sup>C</sup>, Val33<sup>C</sup> and Asn3667, Thr3669 also contribute to the interaction between IbpAFic2 and Cdc42 at this region.</p>
        <p id="P15">The binding interface at the switch2 region is more extensive than that at the switch1 region and is mediated by the arm domain of IbpAFic2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The side chains of Tyr64<sup>C</sup>, Arg66<sup>C</sup>, Leu67<sup>C</sup>, Leu70<sup>C</sup>, and Pro73<sup>C</sup> pack against a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the IbpAFic2 arm domain, formed by Ile3535, Pro3536, Thr3539, Met3543, Phe3549, Ile3552, Leu3553, Gly3556, Ala3557, and Val3560. Several polar interactions are also present at this area, including two salt bridges formed between Asp63<sup>C</sup> and Arg3563, and between Arg66<sup>C</sup> and Glu3555. To assess the functional importance of the arm domain, two double mutants, I3535E/P3536E and I3552E/L3553E, were generated. Both mutants display impaired activity towards the Rho-family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Reciprocally, a triple mutant of Cdc42 at the switch2 region, Y64A/L67E/L70E, is completely inert as substrate of IbpAFic2; and so are equivalent mutants of Rac1 (Y64A/L67E/L70E) and RhoA (Y66A/L69E/L72E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). These data indicate the arm domain dictates the ability of IbpAFic2 to recognize the Rho-family proteins <italic>via</italic> their switch2 regions, and are consistent with our observation that the switch1 region peptide is not a good substrate of IbpAFic2 (data not shown). Interestingly, the same Y/L/L residues are also required for VopS-mediated adenylylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Although VopS adenylylates Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 at a threonine residue, our data suggest that VopS might recognize the Rho-family proteins in a manner analogous to IbpAFic2. In agreement with our hypothesis, the recent reported structure of VopS shows that it contains a segment that resembles the arm domain of IbpAFic2<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p>

        <p id="P16">Although IbpAFic2<sup>H3717A</sup>, a catalytically compromised mutant was used in the co-crystallization experiments, the Tyr32 residues of both Cdc42 molecules in the crystal asymmetric unit are adenylylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). We reason this is caused by the residual enzyme activity of the mutant protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>) in conjugation with a long growth time for the crystals (several weeks). The AMP moiety attached to the Cdc42 molecule provides us with the first snapshot of this post-translational modification at the molecule level. Since our complex structure essentially captures an end product of the enzymatic reaction, it also sheds light on the catalytic mechanism of IbpAFic2 and the Fic domain-containing proteins in general.</p>
        <p id="P17">The AMP moiety is bound within a surface pocket of IbpAFic2. The adenosine group of AMP is partially enclosed in a hydrophobic environment created by IbpAFic2 residues Ala3673, Phe3675, Ile3714, Gly3724, Pro3752, Ile3754, and Ile3755 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). This hydrophobic environment is critical for the function of IbpAFic2. Single amino acid substitution mutants such as A3673E, F3675A, G3724E, and I3755E all have reduced or negligible enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Besides the hydrophobic contacts, IbpAFic2 also forms a total of 11 hydrogen bond interactions with AMP, mediated by residues including Lys3670, Glu3671, Asn3672, Gly3722, Asn3723, Gly3724, Arg3728 and Gln3757 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In particular, Gly3722, Asn3723, and Gly3724 in the HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif form four hydrogen bonds with the Î±-phosphate group of AMP, three of which are contributed by the main chain amide nitrogens of these residues. A sulfate ion binds at approximately the same location in our IbpAFic2 structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) and in two other Fic structures (<italic>H. pylori</italic> Fic and <italic>B. henselae</italic> BepA; PDB ID: 2F6S and 2VZA), suggesting the presence of an âanion holeâ at this region. This is reminiscent of the glycine-rich phosphate-binding loops (P-loops) commonly seen in other nucleotide-binding proteins<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Two other residues important for hydrogen bonding with AMP are Arg3728 and Gln3757. Arg3728 forms two hydrogen bonds with the ribose group, and thus serves as an important anchor at the middle of the adenine nucleotide. Gln3757 contributes two hydrogen bonds to interact with the adenine ring. Accordingly, R3728A/Q3757A, a double mutant of IbpAFic2 also has reduced enzymatic activity compared with the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P18">The three major elements involved in nucleotide binding: hydrophobic adenosine-binding pocket, ribose-coordinating arginine, and P-loop are generally conserved in all the available Fic structures. When other Fic structures are superimposed on IbpAFic2, hydrophobic side chains are commonly seen in the vicinity of IbpAFic2 residues Ala3673, Phe3675, Ile3714, Pro3752, Ile3754, and Ile3755 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c, 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Similarly, a conserved arginine always exists at the position corresponding to Arg3728 in IbpAFic2. Î±-Phosphate binding is largely mediated by the highly conserved HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif. These recurrent features again suggest that all the Fic domains perform a similar catalytic function. The substrates for most of the Fic proteins are currently unknown; however, we and other researchers have noticed that these proteins can auto-adenylylate <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of ATP<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. It is currently unclear whether this auto-adenylylation activity represents a non-specific reaction or has functional consequences. Nevertheless, it provides us with a tool to probe the putative ATP binding site in these proteins. Mutation of residues corresponding to IbpAFic2 amino acids Phe3675, Gly3724, and Arg3728 in two of these proteins, <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> Fic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and <italic>H. pylori</italic> Fic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), substantially reduced their auto-adenylylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). These data further support the hypothesis that the ATP-binding mechanism is generally conserved in all the Fic proteins.</p>

        <title>IbpAFic2 mutants display reduced cytotoxicity</title>
        <p id="P19">In mammalian cells, the Fic domains of IbpA mediated adenylylation of the Rho-family proteins causes collapse of the actin cytoskeleton and drastic cell rounding<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. To further validate the biological importance of our findings from above analyses, we expressed the various IbpAFic2 mutants as GFP fusion proteins in HeLa cells and evaluated their cytotoxicity. Changes in cell morphology were monitored by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The nucleotide-binding mutant G3724E, which failed to adenylylate any of the Rho-family proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>, also completely lost its cell-rounding activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, highlighting the importance of this conserved glycine residue. This result was almost identical to that of the catalytically compromised histidine mutant H3717A. In addition, approximately 50% of the cells expressing I3552E/L3553E (switch2-binding) or L3668A/K3670A (switch1-binding), and 20% of the cells expressing R3728A/Q3757A (nucleotid-binding) remained morphologically normal, indicating a partial loss of function of IbpAFic2 due to these particular mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The severity of cytotoxicity correlated with the protein expression levels of these mutants as visualized by GFP intensity. Finally, three other mutants retaining reasonably high enzymatic activity (I3535E/P3536E, F3675A, and I3755E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) were still capable of inducing pronounced cell rounding (data not shown). Overall, our <italic>in vivo</italic> cytotoxicity results mirror the in vitro adenylylation activities of the IbpAFic2 mutants.</p>

        <title>A possible catalytic mechanism</title>
        <p id="P20">His3717 in IbpAFic2 is part of the highly conserved HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif. Mutation of this residue significantly lowers the adenylyltransferase activity<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. There are two possible ways that this histidine could contribute to catalysis. It could be involved in forming a covalent histidine-AMP intermediate, analogous to the phosphoramidate intermediate during DNA/RNA ligase funciton<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, and then transfer the AMP group to the Rho proteins. The fact that the Fic proteins can auto adenylylate appears to be consistent with this hypothesis. However, several lines of evidence argue against this scenario. First, the H3717A mutant is not completely inactive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). In fact, it catalyzed the adenylylation of Cdc42 in our complex crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Second, if an enzyme-AMP intermediate is formed during catalysis, one would expect to see the accumulation of this intermediate if the substrate is not adenylylation competent, for example, in the presence of the Y32F mutant of Cdc42. However, this appears to be not the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Furthermore, our attempts to capture an enzyme-AMP intermediate by soaking IbpAFic2 crystals in ATP-containing solutions were not successful (data not shown). Although we are still not certain about the nature and function of the auto-adenylylation, the structural information we have obtained strongly suggests that the highly conserved histidine in the HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif functions as a general base during catalysis.</p>
        <p id="P21">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, structural superposition of wild-type IbpAFic2 and IbpAFic2<sup>H3717A</sup> revealed little geometric alteration in the positions of the residues in the active site region. We can thus examine the position of His3717 of the wild-type structure to evaluate its role during catalysis. Assuming the side chain of His3717 adopts the same rotamer orientation as seen in the crystal structure, its NE atom will be only ~2.2 Ã away from the O1P atom of the adenylylated tyrosine, which presumably corresponds to the hydroxyl group oxygen of the unmodified tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). This strongly suggests that the histidine functions to attract a proton from the tyrosine, which will prepare the tyrosine as a nucleophile to attack the Î±-phosphate of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). This substrate-assisted attack of ATP is also consistent with our observation that IbpAFic2 hydrolyzes ATP very slowly in the absence of Rho GTPases (~8 molecules of AMP generated per molecule of IbpAFic2 per hour at 30 Â°C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P22">In the late 1960s, the Stadtman laboratory reported that <italic>E. coli</italic> glutamine synthetase (GS) is modified on a Tyr residue by the addition of AMP. This modification, named âadenylylationâ, plays a key role in regulating GS activity. As such, adenylylation was demonstrated for the first time as a novel type of post-translational modification. However, the concept of protein adenylylation has remained largely quiescent until recently. As described earlier, both IbpA and VopS can elicit cytotoxicity by adenylylating Rho-family GTPases, albeit targeting different residues. These two proteins share no overall sequence homology, except at a conserved HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif. This motif is found in ~2700 bacterial proteins and has a single copy in the human genome. The function of the human protein, known as HYPE is currently unclear; however it also has the ability to adenylylate Rho GTPases <italic>in vitro</italic><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Collectively, these findings suggest that adenylylation is a widely used post-translational modification present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.</p>
      <p id="P23">We have characterized the structure of a ternary complex containing IbpAFic2 and adenylylated Cdc42. Our structure elucidates the nucleotide-binding mechanism of the Fic proteins. Based on our structure-based analysis, we can further predict residues that are important for nucleotide binding in other Fic proteins. For example, we have shown that by mutating relevant residues, we can disrupt the auto-adenylylation of two other Fic proteins: <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> Fic and <italic>H. pylori</italic> Fic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The active site architecture also leads us to propose a catalytic mechanism used by IbpAFic2 and possibly all Fic proteins, involving the highly conserved histidine as the general base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). In IbpAFic2, the side chain orientation of this histidine appears to be stabilized by the ring stacking interaction from residue Phe3675 to further assist catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Curiously, a ring-featured side chain appears to be a common feature for residues corresponding to IbpAFic2 Phe3675 in many other Fic structures, and a phenylalanine is highly preferred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c, 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). We also speculate the P-loop within the HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif might contribute to stabilize the negatively charged pentahedral intermediate during catalysis. The Î² and Î³ phosphates of ATP are most likely complexed with a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion to facilitate the formation of pyrophosphate as a leaving group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The rest of the HPFx(D/E)GN(G/K)R motif residues such as Pro3718, Phe3719, Ala3720, and Glu3721 in IbpAFic2, potentially make contacts with the Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Î², Î³-pyrophosphate, as suggested by their spatial location in reference to the AMP moiety in our complex structure. This will make the Î², Î³-pyrophosphate a better leaving group to complete the catalytic reaction. Many aspects of our herein proposed catalytic mechanism is supported by a recent kinetic study on VopS<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P24">We have also unraveled how IbpAFic2 specifically targets the switch1 Tyr residue of Rho-family GTPases. IbpAFic2 recognizes a 3D epitope in the Rho-family proteins, which involves their critical switch1 and switch2 regions, resulting in tight substrate specificity. The interaction is mediated by the arm domain and the Leu3668-Lys3670 clamp of IbpAFic2. Other proteins work on different substrates where alternative amino acid residues could be adenylylated. We have shown that VopS also requires a proper switch2 region in the Rho-family proteins for function. Consistent with our results, the recent published VopS structure reveals an IbpAFic2 arm like segment (PDB ID: 3LET)<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Superposing VopS onto IbpAFic2 in our complex structure suggests that this segment is in a perfect position to interact with the switch2 region of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Nevertheless, VopS must contain distinct structural elements that account for its modification of the threonine instead of the tyrosine residue. Our modeled VopSâCdc42 structure suggests that the long Î±2âÎ±3 loop in the C-terminal domain of VopS is most likely responsible for determining this specificity. However, several side-chain clashes exist between this region and the switch2 region of Cdc42 in this model, suggesting this region likely undergoes a conformational change upon substrate binding.</p>
      <p id="P25">Interestingly, IbpAFic2-bound Cdc42 adopts a GDI-bound conformation in the complex structure. This is reminiscent of the effect that <italic>Yersinia</italic> effector YpkA exerts on the Rho-family proteins<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, and might be another example of the molecular mimicry strategy commonly employed by bacterial effectors<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Our complex structure suggests that IbpAFic2 has the ability to elicit a conformational change in the Rho-family proteins and convert them into their inactive GDI-bound conformation. The GDI proteins can bind to both the GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms of the small GTPases and inhibit their functions<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. By exerting a GDI-mimicry activity, IbpA could pursue the Rho-family proteins irrespective of their functional states in the cell. This is borne out by our crystal structure, which suggests GDP-bound Cdc42 can be adenylylated by IbpAFic2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P26">In summary, we have determined the crystal structures of IbpAFic2, by itself and in complex with its reaction product, adenylylated Cdc42. The structural information, coupled with biochemical and cell biology experiments, has provided fundamental insights to the molecular mechanism of IbpAFic2 function and may facilitate the design of therapeutically important inhibitors. Our study also sheds light on the catalytic process of Fic mediated adenylylation, and we propose that our suggested catalytic mechanism is likely used by many of the more than 2700 Fic proteins.</p>
