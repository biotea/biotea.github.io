        <p>RNF111/Arkadia targets SUMOylated XPC for ubiquitylation, negatively regulating its association with damaged DNA</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Protein modifications by ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) play key roles in cellular signaling pathways. SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) directly couple these modifications by selectively recognizing SUMOylated target proteins through SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), promoting their K48-linked ubiquitylation and degradation. Only a single mammalian STUbL, RNF4, has been identified. We show that human RNF111/Arkadia is a new STUbL, which used three adjacent SIMs for specific recognition of poly-SUMO2/3 chains, and used Ubc13âMms2 as a cognate E2 enzyme to promote nonproteolytic, K63-linked ubiquitylation of SUMOylated target proteins. We demonstrate that RNF111 promoted ubiquitylation of SUMOylated XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum C) protein, a central DNA damage recognition factor in nucleotide excision repair (NER) extensively regulated by ultraviolet (UV)-induced SUMOylation and ubiquitylation. Moreover, we show that RNF111 facilitated NER by regulating the recruitment of XPC to UV-damaged DNA. Our findings establish RNF111 as a new STUbL that directly links nonproteolytic ubiquitylation and SUMOylation in the DNA damage response.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein modification by ubiquitin and the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) play important, often interconnected, regulatory roles in numerous signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gareau and Lima, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). Similar enzymatic cascades involving activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligase (E3) enzymes underlie protein modification by ubiquitin and SUMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>). Although no consensus sequences surrounding ubiquitylation sites have been described, SUMOylation is frequently, but not always, targeted to K-X-E/D motifs or an inverted version of this sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matic et al., 2010</xref>). Three different SUMO isoforms, SUMO1â3, are expressed in cells, and although SUMO2 and SUMO3 are 97% identical and thus often referred to as SUMO2/3, SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 only share â¼50% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gareau and Lima, 2010</xref>). Both ubiquitin and SUMO can be attached to target proteins as single moieties but additionally share the ability to form chains via internal lysine residues. Unlike ubiquitin, only a single lysine residue in SUMO that conforms to the SUMO consensus sequence is used for chain formation, and this ability is exclusive to SUMO2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tatham et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Different polyubiquitin chains have distinct cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). Although most of the known ubiquitylation processes generate K48-linked chains, which target substrates for degradation by the 26S proteasome, protein ubiquitylation does not always promote destruction; in particular, K63-linked polyubiquitylation, catalyzed by the E2 enzyme Ubc13 in conjunction with its partner proteins Mms2 or Uev1, is a nondegradative modification used in a range of signaling pathways, including cellular stress responses such as DNA damage and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Sun, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hakim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). The function of poly-SUMO chains is less well understood, but roles in processes such as chromosome segregation, DNA damage, and heat shock responses have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Golebiowski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). Several cellular processes, including the DNA damage response, are intimately coregulated by ubiquitin- and SUMO-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergink and Jentsch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bekker-Jensen and Mailand, 2011</xref>). The discovery of SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) revealed a further, direct interplay between these modifications. By means of tandem SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hecker et al., 2006</xref>), STUbLs recognize poly-SUMOylated proteins and target them for K48-linked polyubiquitylation and degradation via their E3 ubiquitin ligase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prudden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, although SUMOylation is not a degradative modification per se, it can indirectly promote proteasomal destruction via STUbLs. Only a few STUBLs have been identified so far, including Slx5-Slx8 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Rfp1/Rfp2-Slx8 in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, and RNF4 in mammalian cells. All of these enzymes play important roles in maintenance of genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prudden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galanty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yin et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with the extensive involvement of both ubiquitin and SUMO in cellular responses to DNA damage.</p><p>In a search for new SUMO-binding proteins, we discovered that the human RNF111 ubiquitin ligase (also known as Arkadia) is a STUbL, which can promote nonproteolytic ubiquitylation of target proteins through cognate E2 enzymes such as Ubc13. We demonstrate that RNF111 has a physiological role in nucleotide excision repair (NER), catalyzing DNA damageâinduced ubiquitylation of SUMOylated XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum C). Our findings reveal direct coupling between nonproteolytic ubiquitylation and SUMOylation in the DNA damage response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>RNF111 recognizes poly-SUMO chains via tandem SIMs</title><p>In a search for proteins containing SIMs, we noted that the human RNF111/Arkadia E3 ubiquitin ligase, which has been shown to function in amplification of TGF-Î² signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miyazono and Koinuma, 2011</xref>), contains three highly conserved, potential SIMs in its N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). To test whether these putative SIMs are functional SUMO-binding modules, we generated an RNF111 mutant (*SIM) in which the core hydrophobic residues in each of the three SIMs were mutated to alanines, predicted to disrupt their SUMO-binding ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hecker et al., 2006</xref>). We first assessed the SUMO-binding ability of ectopically expressed Strep-tagged forms of RNF111 wild type (WT) or *SIM purified on Strep-Tactin agarose. We found that RNF111 bound purified poly-SUMO2 chains with high affinity in vitro but was virtually unable to bind free SUMO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). This was fully dependent on the integrity of the SIM motifs, as the RNF111 *SIM mutant did not interact with poly-SUMO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). To test whether RNF111 binds to SUMOylated proteins in cells, we overexpressed RNF111 WT or *SIM in cells stably expressing FLAG-SUMO1 or 2 and analyzed their interactions in immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments. Consistent with in vitro binding experiments, RNF111 interacted with highâmolecular weight SUMOylated species, but not free SUMO2, in a SIM-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref> and not depicted). Moreover, RNF111 selectively interacted with proteins modified with SUMO2 but not SUMO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), in agreement with the notion that SUMO2, but not SUMO1, forms poly-SUMO chains in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tatham et al., 2001</xref>). Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the RNF111 SIM region bound directly to poly-SUMO2 with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of â¼15 ÂµM, whereas the *SIM mutations reduced binding to a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &gt; 80 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). These data demonstrate that RNF111 interacts with poly-SUMOylated proteins via three N-terminal SIM motifs, in accordance with recent findings that showed an additive contribution of each SIM to poly-SUMO binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun and Hunter, 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Human RNF111 binds to poly-SUMOylated proteins via an N-terminal SIM region.</bold> (A) Schematic of human RNF111/Arkadia.

Several potential RNF111-binding factors were identified by this approach, including components of the AP2 (clathrin adaptor 2) complex, consistent with the known role of RNF111 in regulating endocytosis via interaction with this complex (Fig. S1, A and B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miyazono and Koinuma, 2011</xref>). Among the RNF111-associated proteins, we also found two E2 ubiquitinâconjugating enzymes: Ubc13âMms2, which specifically catalyzes K63-linked ubiquitin chain formation, and UBE2O, a large E2 enzyme of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Fig. S1 B). The presence of both Ubc13 and Mms2 lends strong support to the possibility that this complex is a physiological E2 partner for RNF111. We validated the interactions between RNF111 and Ubc13 or UBE2O by reciprocal co-IP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201212075/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>). In contrast, we did not observe binding of RNF4, the known mammalian STUbL, to Ubc13 under a range of conditions (Fig. S2, C and D).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>RNF111 has STUbL activity in the presence of Ubc13âMms2.</bold> (A) MS-based analysis of RNF111-interacting proteins.

We noted that endogenous RNF111 is primarily localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), suggesting that in addition to facilitating amplification of TGF-Î² signaling and endocytosis, RNF111 might have other important nuclear functions. To test whether RNF111 has E3 ligase activity in the presence of Ubc13âMms2, we performed in vitro ubiquitylation assays using ectopic RNF111 immunopurified from cells. Because RNF111 appeared to form homodimers in cells (unpublished data), we depleted endogenous RNF111 to remove background E3 ligase activity of copurifying endogenous RNF111. We found that RNF111 was highly active as an E3 ligase in the presence of purified Ubc13âMms2, as judged from its autoubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). As expected, this required the integrity of the RNF111 RING domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>), whereas mutation of the SIMs did not impair intrinsic RNF111 E3 ligase activity (Fig. S2 E). In addition to Ubc13âMms2, RNF111 was active with more generic E2 enzymes, such as UbcH5, as expected (Fig. S2 F). To test whether RNF111 has STUbL activity in the presence of Ubc13âMms2, we analyzed the impact of SUMO2 on RNF111 E3 ligase activity. Strikingly, we found that poly-SUMO2 chains, but not free SUMO2, were efficiently targeted for Ubc13âMms2-dependent ubiquitylation by RNF111 in a manner fully dependent on the integrity of the SIMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> and not depicted). We conclude from these experiments that RNF111 functions as a STUbL that employs Ubc13âMms2 and likely other cognate E2 partners in ubiquitylation of SUMOylated substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>RNF111 promotes UV-induced ubiquitylation of XPC</title><p>We next attempted to identify physiological substrates for the STUbL activity of RNF111. The NER factor XPC is known to undergo both SUMOylation and ubiquitylation in response to UV radiation, and the UV-induced ubiquitin chains on XPC do not appear to destine XPC for proteasomal destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sugasawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). We reasoned that SUMOylated XPC might be a candidate target of the Ubc13âMms2-dependent E3 ligase activity of RNF111. Indeed, knockdown of RNF111 by any of several independent siRNAs impaired UV-induced ubiquitylation but not SUMOylation of XPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201212075/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S3, A and B</ext-link>), suggesting that XPC is SUMOylated before ubiquitylation by RNF111. The slow-migrating, UV-inducible XPC species seen in immunoblots represent a mixture of ubiquitin- and SUMO-modified forms; hence, the dramatic decrease in XPC ubiquitylation but not SUMOylation in RNF111-depleted cells manifests less prominently in total XPC blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Consistent with a direct role of RNF111 in ubiquitylating XPC after UV, we found that elevated levels of RNF111 augmented the UV-induced increase in XPC-GFP ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In contrast, depletion of RNF4, the known STUbL in mammalian cells, had no effect on UV-induced XPC ubiquitylation (Fig. S3 C). The ability of RNF111 to promote Ubc13âMms2-dependent ubiquitylation prompted us to test whether UV-induced XPC ubiquitylation required Ubc13 function. Like RNF111 knockdown, depletion of Ubc13 decreased UV-induced XPC ubiquitylation substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref> and Fig. S3 D), suggesting that RNF111-dependent XPC ubiquitylation after UV exposure was, at least partially, mediated by Ubc13-dependent, nonproteolytic ubiquitylation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>RNF111 promotes UV-induced ubiquitylation of XPC.</bold> (A) U2OS or U2OS/Strep-HA-ubiquitin cells transfected with control (â) or RNF111 siRNAs were exposed or not exposed to UV and collected 1 h later, and XPC ubiquitylation was analyzed by immunoblotting Strep-Tactin pull-downs of whole-cell extracts (WCE) with the XPC antibody.

Indeed, UV induced prominent, but transient, interaction between RNF111 and XPC at early time points after UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Interestingly, like several known NER factors, both endogenous and ectopic RNF111 underwent partial degradation after UV in a proteasome-dependent manner, which, however, did not require the intrinsic E3 ligase activity of RNF111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>; and Fig. S3 E). In general, the kinetics of UV-induced RNF111 interaction with XPC and degradation correlated with that of XPC ubiquitylation after UV exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>; and Fig. S3 F).</p></sec><sec><title>RNF111 selectively ubiquitylates SUMOylated XPC</title><p>The aforementioned findings suggested that RNF111 targets SUMOylated XPC for ubiquitylation in response to UV. Hence, we tested whether RNF111 specifically interacts with SUMO-modified XPC via its SIMs, using a strategy wherein GFP-tagged XPC immunopurified from cells was SUMOylated in vitro and then incubated with extracts of cells transfected with WT or mutant forms of ectopic RNF111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Under these conditions, RNF111 efficiently interacted with XPC, but only if XPC had been pre-SUMOylated, and this required the integrity of the RNF111 SIMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>), in agreement with the notion that RNF111 specifically recognizes SUMOylated XPC. We next tested whether RNF111 functions as a STUbL for XPC. To do this, we extended the setup to monitor SUMO-dependent RNF111-XPC binding, by subjecting the bound complexes to an in vitro ubiquitylation assay in the presence of Ubc13âMms2 as an E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Although a background level of Ubc13âMms2-dependent ubiquitylation of XPC-GFP could be seen in the absence of ectopically expressed RNF111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, compare lanes 1â6), the addition of RNF111 WT markedly enhanced XPC ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, compare lanes 6 and 7) but only if XPC had been pre-SUMOylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, compare lanes 2, 3, and 7). Importantly, this increase in RNF111-dependent XPC ubiquitylation required the functional integrity of both the RNF111 RING and SIM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, compare lanes 7â9).

Although UV-induced ubiquitylation of XPC has been suggested to increase its DNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sugasawa et al., 2005</xref>), the exact role of this modification in NER is unclear. Previous work suggested that XPC is ubiquitylated by CRL4<sup>DDB2</sup>, an E3 ligase complex functioning as a proximal sensor of UV lesions in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sugasawa et al., 2005</xref>). It is possible that XPC is ubiquitylated by both CRL4<sup>DDB2</sup> and RNF111 in response to UV. Indeed, using MS, we found that XPC ubiquitylation involves a variety of ubiquitin chains and â¥15 individual ubiquitylation sites (unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Povlsen et al., 2012</xref>); hence, the nature and regulation of XPC ubiquitylation appears to be highly complex, likely involving several E3 ligases. To determine whether RNF111 loss affects NER, we measured UV-induced DNA repair synthesis (UDS) in RNF111<sup>â/â</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mavrakis et al., 2007</xref>). Strikingly, these MEFs showed a marked reduction in UDS, as was also observed in XPC<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Moreover, using two independent siRNAs, we found that RNF111 knockdown resulted in increased accumulation of XPC-GFP to locally UV-irradiated chromatin, whereas knockdown of DDB2 had the opposite effect, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nishi et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, although DDB2 and RNF111 have opposing effects on XPC accumulation at UV lesions, interfering with the proper kinetics of XPC interaction with damaged chromatin by inactivation of either E3 reduces the efficiency of NER. These data suggest that RNF111 has a physiological role in promoting NER by regulating ubiquitylation of XPC and its association with damaged DNA.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>RNF111 promotes NER by regulating XPC recruitment to UV-damaged DNA.</bold> (A) UDS of the indicated MEF cell lines, determined by EdU incorporation for 3 h after exposure to 16 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV-C.

Although Ubc13âMms2 appears to be a major cognate E2 enzyme for RNF111 in cells, RNF111 also interacts with other E2 enzymes and is known to promote ubiquitin-dependent degradation of TGF-Î² signaling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koinuma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nagano et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, depending on the context, RNF111 may work with different E2s to promote degradative or nonproteolytic ubiquitylation of SUMOylated substrate proteins. Despite the fact that both RNF4 and RNF111 interact with poly-SUMOylated proteins through tandem SIMs, they appear to have largely nonoverlapping roles in the cell. For instance, RNF4, but not RNF111, was dispensable for UV-induced ubiquitylation of XPC, whereas RNF111 was not recruited to laser microirradiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks, unlike RNF4 (unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galanty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). This distribution of labor between RNF4 and RNF111 in targeting distinct subsets of SUMOylated factors may reflect differences in the SUMO-binding properties of their tandem SIMs, which have a distinct configuration, as well as differential target-binding specificity contributed by other domains in these proteins.</p><p>Although our comprehensive analysis of RNF111-binding factors in unperturbed cells uncovered several E2 partner proteins, we did not detect any known components of TGF-Î² signaling pathways, nor XPC. Given the involvement of RNF111 in regulating these proteins, we speculate that processes mediated by the RNF111 STUbL activity may, in many cases, be induced by stimuli such as TGF-Î² or UV treatment, which may promote SUMOylation of specific factors and thus trigger their RNF111-mediated ubiquitylation. This is consistent with previous findings that elevated levels of RNF111 only cause degradation of SnoN in TGF-Î²âstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy et al., 2007</xref>). Based on the large and heterogeneous group of proteins identified by MS as putative RNF111-interacting proteins, we propose that RNF111, like RNF4, is a multifunctional STUbL regulating a diverse range of cellular signaling processes, determined to a large extent by the SUMOylation state of target proteins. This scenario reconciles the involvement of RNF111 in radically different cellular processes, such as TGF-Î² signaling and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miyazono and Koinuma, 2011</xref>), and NER. Whether the ability of RNF111 to ubiquitylate proteins in the former processes involves its STUbL activity remains to be addressed. Our findings shed further light on how STUbLs directly couple ubiquitylation and SUMOylation in important cellular signaling pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids and siRNA</title><p>Full-length human <italic>RNF111</italic> cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted into pEGFP-C1 (Takara Bio Inc.) and pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) containing N-terminal Strep-HA or S-FLAG-Strep tags to generate mammalian expression constructs for GFP-, Strep-HAâ, and S-FLAG-Strepâtagged RNF111, respectively.

In brief, MEFs were seeded on coverslips 3 d before the UDS assay and cultured in medium without serum to reduce the number of S-phase cells. Cells were exposed to 16 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV-C and labeled with 5-ethynyl,2â²-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 3 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and EdU incorporation was visualized using Alexa Fluor 594 nm (Click-iT) according to manufacturerâs protocol (Invitrogen). UDS was quantified in â¥75 cells by measuring the overall nuclear fluorescence using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Images were obtained using a microscope (LSM-700; Carl Zeiss).</p><p>Kinetic study of XPC-GFP accumulation was performed in SV40-transformed XP4PA cells stably expressing XPC-GFP as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dinant et al., 2007</xref>). In brief, cells were cultured on 25-mm quartz coverslips (SPI Supplies) and imaged on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (SP5; Leica) using an Ultrafluar quartz 100Ã, 1.35 NA glycerol immersion lens (Carl Zeiss) at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Imaging medium was the same as culture medium. For UV laser irradiation, a 2-mW pulsed (7.8 kHz) diode pumped solid-state laser emitting at 266 nm (DPSL; Rapp OptoElectronic) was connected to the microscope (SP5) with all-quartz optics. Treated nuclei were imaged using the same scanning speed, zoom factor, and laser power. Images were acquired using the LAS AF software (Leica). Data analysis was performed using the ImageJ software package. Measured fluorescence levels were determined in the specific region of the damage in the nucleus over time and corrected for background values. Resulting curves show the relative amount of protein in the damaged area over time and were normalized to 1 for the data points before damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows MS-based analysis of RNF111-interacting proteins.
