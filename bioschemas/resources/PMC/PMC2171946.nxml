        <p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (SOC) channels regulate many cellular processes, but the underlying molecular components are not well defined. Using an RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen to identify genes that alter thapsigargin (TG)-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, we discovered a required and conserved role of <italic>Stim</italic> in SOC influx. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>Stim</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells significantly reduced TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Patch-clamp recording revealed nearly complete suppression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) current that has biophysical characteristics similar to CRAC current in human T cells. Similarly, knockdown of the human homologue STIM1 significantly reduced CRAC channel activity in Jurkat T cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of STIM1 inhibited TG- or agonist-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in HEK293 or SH-SY5Y cells. Conversely, overexpression of STIM1 in HEK293 cells modestly enhanced TG-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. We propose that STIM1, a ubiquitously expressed protein that is conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mammalian cells, plays an essential role in SOC influx and may be a common component of SOC and CRAC channels.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (SOC) influx is an important process in cellular physiology that controls such diverse functions as refilling of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Putney and Bird, 1993</xref>), activation of enzymatic activity (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Fagan et al., 2000</xref>), gene transcription (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 2001</xref>), and release of cytokines (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Winslow et al., 2003</xref>). In T lymphocytes and mast cells, SOC influx occurs through Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channels, a type of SOC channel that has been characterized extensively in patch-clamp experiments. Although considerable work has focused on the process of SOC entry and the biophysical properties of CRAC channels, the molecular components of the underlying channels and the mechanisms controlling them are still unclear (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Venkatachalam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Prakriya and Lewis, 2003</xref>). We recently characterized a store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective current in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and showed that it shares many of the properties of CRAC current in mammalian immune cells (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Yeromin et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, believed to be of hematopoietic origin (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Towers and Sattelle, 2002</xref>), may provide an advantage over many other cell types in studying CRAC channel function because S2 cells lack contaminating currents from other channel types (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Yeromin et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, these cells are particularly useful for gene silencing experiments, as they display highly efficient RNA interference (RNAi) with relatively simple protocols (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Clemens et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Worby et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, S2 cells are an appropriate model system to test the role of candidate genes in SOC influx using RNAi.</p>
      <p>Several gene products have been proposed to play a role in SOC influx. For example, at the level of the plasma membrane a number of studies have suggested that a subset of TRP proteins might be responsible for SOC influx (for reviews see <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Clapham, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Montell, 2003</xref>). However, SOC channels exhibit varying biophysical properties depending on cell type and it remains unclear which proteins may be involved in forming the channel or regulating channel activation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Prakriya and Lewis, 2003</xref>). In mammalian cells, TRPC1 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Mori et al., 2002</xref>), TRPC3 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Philipp et al., 2003</xref>), TRPC4 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Philipp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Tiruppathi et al., 2002</xref>), and TRPV6 (CaT1; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Yue et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Schindl et al., 2002</xref>) have been proposed to underlie SOC influx or channel activity, but these identifications remain controversial (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Voets et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Prakriya and Lewis, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Kahr et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>We sought to identify new genes potentially involved in SOC influx in a more systematic fashion. To accomplish this, an experimental system using <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells was developed in which expression of several targeted gene products were individually suppressed by RNAi and evaluated for their role in SOC influx. S2 cells express a thapsigargin (TG)-sensitive SERCA pump that serves to fill an intracellular store linked to the activation of SOC influx (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Magyar and Varadi, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Martinez et al., 2003</xref>). TG-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in S2 cells has been demonstrated by fura-2 ratiometric techniques (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Yagodin et al., 1999</xref>). We now report the identification of <italic>Stim</italic> as a critical component of TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and CRAC channel function in S2 cells. <italic>Stim</italic> is a type I transmembrane protein with two mammalian homologues, STIM1 and STIM2. We further demonstrate that the ubiquitously expressed homologue STIM1 controls CRAC channel function in human Jurkat T cells. Finally, we show that STIM1, but not STIM2, regulates SOC influx in human cells. STIM1 thus represents a conserved component regulating SOC influx and CRAC channel activity.</p>

        <title>Screening for genes that regulate SOC influx in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells: identification of CG9126 (<italic>Stim</italic>)</title>
        <p>To examine the role of individual target genes in SOC influx, a 96-well plate fluorescence assay was used to detect changes in intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) evoked by TG in conjunction with RNAi. Selected to include channel-like domains, transmembrane regions, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding domains, or putative function in SOC influx, 170 genes were tested for involvement in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling by incubating S2 cells with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) corresponding to 500 bp fragments of the candidate genes (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200502019/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200502019/DC1</ext-link>). Control S2 cells displayed both TG-independent and TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> response reached a plateau within three minutes of re-adding external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and was inhibited by 20 Î¼M 2-APB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B) or 50 Î¼M SKF96365 (not depicted), which is consistent with the block of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRAC currents by these compounds (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Yeromin et al., 2004</xref>). These results suggest that the TG-dependent SOC influx signal reflects activity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRAC channel. Cells incubated with a dsRNA probe to gene CG9126 (<italic>Drosophila Stim</italic>) displayed TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry that was reduced by &gt;90% compared with control, whereas the TG-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was reduced by only 10% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). In parallel, the level of <italic>Stim</italic> mRNA was reduced by &gt;50% compared with control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). A separate dsRNA targeting a different region of <italic>Stim</italic> (see Materials and methods) produced equivalent suppression of the SOC influx signal (unpublished data). Finally, suppression of <italic>Stim</italic> did not alter growth rate or loading with fluo-4, which is consistent with healthy cells.</p>

<bold>Essential role of gene CG9126 (<italic>Stim</italic>) in SOC influx in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells.</bold> (A) <italic>Drosophila</italic> SOC influx measured in a fluorimeter. Basal-subtracted fluo-4 fluorescence in relative fluorescence units (RFUs) from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells in a 96-well plate. Cells were initially in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution (Ca0). Bars indicate addition of TG (1 Î¼M, solid line) or vehicle (dotted line), followed by 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca2). The TG-independent response can be explained by partial store depletion during exposure to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution or possible damage to some cells. Traces are averages of recordings from four individual wells. (B) Development of an end point assay for screening gene candidates. Cells were treated as described in A and placed in a fluorimeter 3 min after adding 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Pre-incubating cells with 20 Î¼M 2-APB reduced TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry significantly (P &lt; 5 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>: unpaired <italic>t</italic> test) and to a greater extent than the TG-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (P &lt; 5 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>: unpaired <italic>t</italic> test); <italic>n</italic> = 24 for each treatment group. (C) Treatment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells with <italic>Stim</italic> dsRNA inhibits SOC influx by 90% (P &lt; 10<sup>â5</sup>; unpaired <italic>t</italic> test compared with control mock-treated cells). Data represent basal-subtracted RFUs divided by maximal fluorescence (F<sub>max</sub>) to normalize for cell number. The TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal can be obtained by subtracting the average TG-independent signal from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal after treatment with TG. Knockdown of <italic>Stim</italic> also inhibited the TG-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (vehicle) by &lt;10%, albeit significantly (P &lt; 10<sup>â4</sup>, unpaired <italic>t</italic> test). (D) mRNA reduction in <italic>Stim</italic> dsRNA-treated cells. RNA was isolated from mock-treated cells or cells treated with a dsRNA specific to <italic>Stim</italic>. RT-PCR analysis was performed using gene-specific primers to <italic>Stim</italic> or to a control gene, presenilin (PSN). (E) Suppression of other candidate genes did not markedly inhibit TG-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Cells were mock treated or treated with dsRNA specific for CG11059, CG1560, <italic>trp-l</italic>, CG8743, or <italic>Stim</italic> for 5 d. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was measured after pretreatment with TG. Data represent basal-subtracted RFUs divided by F<sub>max</sub> to normalize for cell number. (F) Knockdown of CG8743 or CG2165 elevates basal intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Cells were mock treated (control) or treated with dsRNA specific for CG8743 or CG2165 for 5 d. Data represents basal RFUs divided by the maximum fluorescence, F<sub>max</sub>, to normalize to cell number (P &lt; 0.01, one-way ANOVA, Dunnett's multiple comparison test compared with control mock-treated cells).

<italic>Stim</italic> is annotated in FlyBase as a cell adhesion molecule, presumably based upon studies first identifying its mammalian homologue STIM1 in a screen for cell adhesion molecules (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Oritani and Kincade, 1996</xref>). Although we did not observe any morphological or cell attachment effects in <italic>Stim</italic>-knockdown cells, we examined effects of RNAi directed at six genes that are annotated as scaffolding or cell adhesion genes (Table S1; CG11324, CG3504, CG11059, CG1560, CG5723, CG6378). Except for <italic>Stim</italic>, none of the cell adhesion molecules tested had a significant effect on TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E). The role of TRP-family proteins as molecular candidates for the CRAC channel has been widely discussed (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Clapham, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Montell, 2003</xref>). To test the possible role of <italic>trp</italic>-related proteins in S2 cells, we treated cells with dsRNAs corresponding to every known <italic>Drosophila trp</italic> gene (<italic>trp</italic>, <italic>trp-l</italic>, and <italic>trp-gamma</italic>) or <italic>trp</italic>-related gene (TRPM-type, CG16805; TRPV-type, CG5842, CG4536; TRPML-type, CG8743; TRPN-type, CG11020 (<italic>nompC</italic>); TRPA-type, CG15860 (<italic>painless</italic>), CG5751, CG17142, CG10409; and TRPP-type, CG6504) identified in silico, regardless of whether expression in S2 cells could be verified by RT-PCR (Table S1). Additionally, we treated cells with a pool of dsRNAs corresponding to <italic>trp</italic>, <italic>trp-l</italic>, and <italic>trp-gamma</italic>. In no instance were we able to measure an effect on SOC influx, despite confirming suppression of corresponding mRNAs (Table S1). When targeted by RNAi, two genes, CG2165 (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of the plasma membrane-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase) and CG8743 resulted in an elevation of basal intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F).

        <title>Suppression of TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in individual S2 cells by <italic>Stim</italic> dsRNA</title>
        <p>Population measurements of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> would include contributions of cells that had not been affected by gene silencing. Therefore, to clarify effects of gene silencing at the level of single cells we evaluated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and CRAC currents in S2 cells that were pretreated with dsRNA. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A illustrates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to TG-evoked store depletion in eight individual control cells treated with dsRNA for the cell adhesion molecule CG1560. Removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and readdition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> produced no significant change in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Addition of TG in zero-Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution produced a transient rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> due to release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER; the release transient reached a peak that averaged â¼200 nM before declining. Upon readdition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was revealed as a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that was sustained and often exceeded 1 Î¼M. In cells that were pretreated with <italic>Stim</italic> dsRNA, resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and the release transient were not altered significantly, but the rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon readdition of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> was prevented in most of the single cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). In contrast, suppression of CG8743 produced a significant elevation of the resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to â¼60% higher than in control cells (135 CG1560 dsRNA-treated control cells; 118 CG8743 dsRNA-treated cells; P &lt; 5 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>), which is consistent with results from the initial screen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F). However, CG8743 dsRNA did not alter the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release transient (not depicted) or Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx evoked by TG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C summarizes the results of three control experiments and six experiments with suppression of <italic>Stim</italic>. Occasionally, cells in the <italic>Stim</italic> dsRNA group exhibited normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses similar to control cells, suggesting either that these cells did not effectively take up the dsRNA, that gene suppression in these cells was less efficient, or that some cells with effective gene suppression express normal SOC influx, as found in DT40 cells after knockout of TRPC1 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Mori et al., 2002</xref>). These results demonstrate at the single-cell level that suppression of <italic>Stim</italic> effectively blocks both the early and sustained components of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry evoked by TG.</p>

        <title>Suppression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRAC current by <italic>Stim</italic> dsRNA</title>
        <p>In previous work, we demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry evoked in S2 cells by Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion occurs through store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective channels that are similar in biophysical properties to CRAC channels in T lymphocytes (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Yeromin et al., 2004</xref>). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (A and B) illustrates the time course of CRAC current development and the characteristic I-V relationship in control cells dialyzed with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA to deplete Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores passively. In cells treated with dsRNA for <italic>Stim</italic>, CRAC current was effectively suppressed in most cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). We performed similar experiments on six groups of cells: control cells that were untreated; two additional control groups in which cells were treated with dsRNA for cell adhesion molecules CG11059 and CG1560; cells treated with dsRNA directed against two <italic>trp</italic>-related genes that are expressed in S2 cells, <italic>trp-l</italic> and CG8743; or cells treated with dsRNA for <italic>Stim</italic>. Suppression of corresponding gene expression was confirmed by RT-PCR (unpublished data). As summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> E, CRAC currents were similar in all three control groups and in the <italic>trp-l</italic> and CG8743-suppressed groups. In the <italic>Stim</italic> dsRNA-treated cells, CRAC currents were suppressed to undetectable levels in 83% of cells. These experiments demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila Stim</italic> is required for normal activity of CRAC channels in S2 cells.</p>

        <title>Inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in STIM1-suppressed Jurkat T cells</title>
        <p>Mammalian cells express two homologues, STIM1 and STIM2, of <italic>Drosophila Stim</italic>. Both are single-pass transmembrane proteins that are present in rat, mouse, and human. STIM1 was detected by Western blot in human Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A) and in primary human T lymphocytes (not depicted). In these cells, T cell receptor stimulation leads to activation of the CRAC channel and subsequent gene expression and cytokine release (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 2001</xref>). To test the role of STIM1 in T cells, a stable pool of Jurkat cells expressing a short RNA hairpin loop (shRNA) targeting human STIM1 was generated (Jurkat clone 4A5). Stable pools of Jurkat cells expressing a negative control, nonsilencing scrambled shRNA were also generated (Jurkat negative control clone 2A4). In these cells, STIM1 mRNA and protein were reduced by &gt;50%, but there was no change in STIM2 mRNA levels indicating specificity of the STIM1 shRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Importantly, TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was significantly reduced in the 4A5 Jurkat cells, as seen in individual cells and the averaged responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, CâG). Removal and readdition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> produced no significant change in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, indicating that the TGâindependent response was negligible (unpublished data). TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx rates were evaluated from the maximal rate of rise in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, d[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>/dt, upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> readdition in both Jurkat Ringer and low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> Jurkat Ringer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, H and I</xref>); STIM1 suppression reduced mean influx rates by 68% and 82%, respectively. These results confirm that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in Jurkat T cells is effectively inhibited by suppression of STIM1, as seen for <italic>Stim</italic> in S2 cells.</p>

        <title>CRAC current reduction by STIM1 suppression in individual Jurkat T cells</title>
        <p>Depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in Jurkat T cells leads to the opening of CRAC channels that can be monitored as CRAC current (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Prakriya and Lewis, 2003</xref>). STIM1 suppression in 4A5 Jurkat T cells reduced the average CRAC current density evaluated during whole-cell recording. The time course of current and corresponding I-V relations recorded from one control and one STIM1-suppressed cell are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> (AâD), and a summary of data is presented in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> E. Only â¼9% of STIM1-suppressed cells developed detectable current, compared with 70% of control cells. In cells that exhibited detectable CRAC current, the inactivating Na<sup>+</sup> current through CRAC channels upon exposure to divalent-free external solution was also reduced. The ratio of peak Na<sup>+</sup> to Ca<sup>2+</sup> current was similar in control 2A4 cells (10 Â± 1.4, <italic>n</italic> = 6) and in STIM1-suppressed cells 4A5 cells (12.2 Â± 2.8, <italic>n</italic> = 5).

        <title>STIM1 modulates SOCE in mammalian cells</title>
        <p>To further examine the role of STIM1 in SOCE in mammalian cells, we generated siRNAs to STIM1 and STIM2 and tested them individually in HEK293 cells on TG-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, previously linked to TRPC1 and TRPC3 proteins (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). RT-PCR and Western blot analysis indicated that STIM1 mRNA and protein levels were selectively reduced by the STIM1 siRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). Immunofluorescence localization indicated an expression pattern consistent with plasma membrane and ER localization (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Manji et al., 2000</xref>) and confirmed the reduction of STIM1 protein by RNAi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). Cellular metabolism of the mitochondrial substrate alamarBlue was not altered (unpublished data), indicating the absence of cytotoxicity or mitochondrial stress after STIM1 suppression. In STIM1-suppressed cells, TG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was inhibited by 60%, whereas the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release transient was unaffected compared with control cells transfected with a nonsilencing scrambled siRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> D). In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was unaltered in cells treated with the siRNA for STIM2, even though STIM2 mRNA was effectively reduced. In addition to inhibiting TG-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, knockdown of STIM1 potently inhibited muscarinic receptor-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, but did not reduce IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> E). The store-operated cation entry pathway in HEK293 cells is known to be permeable to Ba<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Trebak et al., 2002</xref>). Measurement of Ba<sup>2+</sup> influx has the advantage of being a more direct reflection of cation entry via the plasma membrane because it avoids possible effects on cellular buffering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or other Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory mechanisms. The initial rate of TG-induced Ba<sup>2+</sup> entry in cells transfected with STIM1 siRNA was only 17% of control, whereas Ba<sup>2+</sup> entry was unaffected in cells transfected with siRNA for STIM2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> F). In contrast, stable overexpression of STIM1 in HEK293 cells modestly enhanced TG-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry by an average of 17% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). Interestingly, the increase in SOC influx was small in comparison to the robust increase in STIM1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A), and definitive SOC current was still not detected, nor was there any change in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-inhibited cation current (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, BâG). Thus, although STIM1 is required for SOC influx in HEK293 cells at the level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (or Ba<sup>2+</sup>) entry across the plasma membrane, overexpression does not appear to greatly enhance the number of activatable SOC channels.</p>

Together, these data indicate that STIM1 is required for SOC influx in mammalian cells but does not influence agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive stores, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, or the membrane potential.</p>

Suppression of <italic>Stim</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, or its homologue STIM1 in three different human cell lines, inhibited TG-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and CRAC channel activity, but did not significantly affect resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores induced by TG or by agonist stimulation. Suppression of STIM1 also had no effect on voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in mammalian cells, and did not alter plasma membrane or mitochondrial membrane potentials. These data indicate that STIM1 is not a general component of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channels, nor does it influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores, general Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering, or the membrane potential. Although we have not examined, and do not rule out, a role for STIM1 in other forms of PLC-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, it is clear that STIM1 is required for SOC influx and CRAC channel activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells.</p>
      <p>STIM1 was originally identified in a screen for stromal cell gene products that bound to preB cells (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Oritani and Kincade, 1996</xref>). This gene is conserved in sequence from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mammalian species and appears to be expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, based on published analyses of mRNA and protein expression (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Manji et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2001</xref>). In separate studies, STIM1, first named GOK, was proposed to suppress tumor cell growth and to affect cell morphology (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Sabbioni et al., 1997</xref>). In our RNAi experiments, we detected no changes in phenotype, growth characteristics, or cell adhesion after suppression of <italic>Stim</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (unpublished data). Thus, we could not establish a connection between CRAC currents and tumor suppressor genes; the effects of STIM1 on cell growth may depend on cell type.</p>

        <title>Models of STIM1 function</title>
        <p>How might STIM1 affect SOC influx and CRAC channel function? The simplest model would have STIM1 as the sole component of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channel. In support of this model, our <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome-wide search identified numerous potential ion channel genes as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins with transmembrane domains, yet only <italic>Stim</italic> had a detectable effect on SOC influx and CRAC channel activity. However, the possibility also exists that other ion channels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have novel protein domains and so eluded our bioinformatic search. Moreover, overexpression of STIM1 by nearly 100-fold in HEK293 cells enhanced SOC influx by only 17%, and did not induce detectable SOC current, arguing that STIM1 is probably not the channel itself. A second model suggests that STIM1 functions as a component that would facilitate assembly and regulate activity of SOC influx channels in different tissues, serving as an essential subunit. Mechanistically, STIM1 might function as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor or a coupler linking store depletion to activation of SOC influx channels. STIM1 is an abundant protein that is present on both plasma membrane and intracellular membranes (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Manji et al., 2000</xref>). Its NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal putative EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding motif is located outside the cell and, presumably, in the lumen of the ER where it could function as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor. In this model, STIM1 would be an integral component of SOC influx and CRAC channel activity on the plasma membrane in addition to being present in membranes of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, and homotypic association of STIM1 could play a role in linking Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion to activation of SOC influx channels. Consistent with this model, in an initial yeast two-hybrid screen using a human thymus library, a cytoplasmic region of STIM1 itself was the strongest interactor with the intracellular coiled-coil domain of STIM1 (unpublished data), and STIM1 has been reported to homo-oligomerize (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2002</xref>). These data make plausible a possible STIM1âSTIM1 interaction linking the cytoplasmic domains of STIM1 located at the plasma membrane with STIM1 in the ER.</p>

        <title>Other candidate genes</title>
        <p>Ion channels often exist in multi-subunit complexes, and regulatory functions can reside in auxiliary subunits. It is, therefore, of great interest to identify all components of store-operated channels, including the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel and components involved in the coupling of ER stores to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. We identified two genes that, when knocked down by RNAi, resulted in an increase in the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. One of these, CG2165, has homology to a plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase sequence. As would be expected, inhibiting expression of a plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump resulted in elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Suppression of CG8743 also elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in S2 cells, but neither CG2165 nor CG8743 detectably altered SOC influx or CRAC channel function.</p>
        <p>RNAi targeting all three <italic>trp</italic> genes individually, or as a group, had no detectable effect on SOC influx. We also targeted every <italic>trp</italic>-related gene without altering SOC influx. Nevertheless, because we were unable to verify the effectiveness of RNAi at the protein level, we cannot conclusively exclude all <italic>trp</italic>s as components of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRAC channels. CD20 is a tetraspanning membrane protein that has been implicated in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in B cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bubien et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2003</xref>), but its expression is restricted, and there is no <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of CD20; thus, CD20 would not be expected to have a generalized role in SOC influx. Reports of nonchannel-like proteins involved in the regulation of SOC influx are now emerging. The adaptor protein Homer binds to TRPC1 and is postulated to facilitate an association with the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2003</xref>). In this case, dissociation of Homer from TRPC1 activates the TRPC1 channel. We tested the role of <italic>Drosophila homer</italic> (CG11324) by RNAi in S2 cells, but detected no effect on SOC influx. Another example is the inhibitor of myogenic family, isoform a (I-mfa), which is an inhibitor of MyoD and other basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that was identified as a binding partner for TRPC1 by yeast two-hybrid studies (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2003</xref>). Overexpression of I-mfa inhibited store-operated currents in CHO-K1 cells that express TRPC1, whereas knockdown of I-mfa by RNAi enhanced TG-induced currents in A431 cells that also express TRPC1, suggesting I-mfa has a suppressive effect on native SOC influx mediated by TRPC1. However, we found no <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of I-mfa. A recent study demonstrated a structural role of PLCÎ³ in calcium signaling. However, in this case suppression of endogenous PLCÎ³ affected receptor-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry but not SOC influx activated by TG (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Patterson et al., 2002</xref>). An example of indirect regulation of SOC influx has been described in which a presenilin-1 mutant associated with familial Alzheimer's disease caused overfilling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and a reduction in SOC influx (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Leissring et al., 2000</xref>). We also targeted presenilin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, but saw no effect on SOC influx. Yet another report has implicated junctate in SOC influx and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Treves et al., 2004</xref>). However, we found no <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue for the junctate protein, so it is unlikely to play a conserved role in CRAC-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Finally, a role has been proposed for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent PLA<sub>2</sub> (iPLA<sub>2</sub>) in the control of SOC influx in vascular smooth muscle cells, human platelets, human Jurkat T lymphocytes, and rat basophilic leukemia cells (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Smani et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In this case, however, iPLA<sub>2</sub> is not implicated as a structural component of either SOC influx coupling or of the plasma membrane channel complex, but rather is suggested to involve a calcium influx factor, an uncharacterized molecule hypothesized to control the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in response to discharge of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Randriamampita and Tsien, 1993</xref>). Many genes, including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of iPLA2 (CG6718), were not tested in our S2 cell screen because they did not meet our in silico search criteria. Therefore, a more extensive genome-wide screen may identify additional novel components of the SOC influx pathway.</p>
        <p>It is, perhaps, surprising that after targeting 170 likely candidate genes the only one with a demonstrable role was <italic>Stim</italic>. The mammalian homologue STIM1, a modular single-pass transmembrane protein with proteinâprotein interaction domains on both sides of the membrane, thus emerges as a central and conserved component in controlling SOC influx and CRAC channel function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells. STIM1 should provide a key tool in identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in CRAC channel function, activation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p>

Stable pools of cells expressing functional short hairpin loop constructs were assessed by measuring levels of STIM1 protein and mRNA. To prepare HEK cell lines that overexpress STIM1, we first designed a cDNA encoding full-length human STIM1 using the strategy used by <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al.

<italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, plated in a 96-well plate, were loaded with 10 Î¼M fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 22Â°C in buffer containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Hepes, 2.5 probenecid, pH 7.2. Cells were then washed in calcium-free buffer and fluorescence levels were monitored in a FluoroSkan Ascent single-channel fluorimeter (Scientific Sales, Inc.). The single-read RNAi-based screen was based upon recording of initial fluorescence for 30 s to estimate basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, followed by addition of either vehicle (0.01% DMSO) or 1 Î¼M TG (LC Labs). After a 5-min incubation, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (final concentration) was added and cellular fluorescence was measured three min after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition as an index of SOC influx in each well. For kinetic measurements, fluorescence was recorded every 2 s throughout the entire protocol.</p>
        <p>HEK293 cells and SH-SY5Y cells plated in 384-well plates were loaded with 5 Î¼M fluo-4/AM in culture medium for 1 h at 25Â°C, then washed in calcium-free HBSS (Irvine Scientific) containing (in mM) 10 Hepes and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and placed in a FLIPR<sup>384</sup> fluorimeter (Molecular Devices). Cells were treated with 1 Î¼M TG or vehicle (DMSO) for 15 min followed by addition of 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (final concentration). To detect the rate of Ba<sup>2+</sup> entry in HEK293 cells, BaCl<sub>2</sub> (10 mM final concentration) was added instead of CaCl<sub>2</sub>. To quantify the rate of cation influx, the first 30 s after cation addition was analyzed by linear regression. For agonist-induced responses in HEK293 cells, cells in calcium-free buffer were stimulated with 300 Î¼M methylcholine for five min, followed by the addition of 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>

After treatment with dsRNA, <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells were loaded with fura-2 (2 Î¼M fura-2/AM and 0.02% pluronic acid both from Molecular Probes, in S2 Ringer solution for 1 h at RT) and imaged to monitor [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in individual cells. Jurkat T cells, both control 2A4 and STIM1-suppressed clone 4A5, were loaded with fura-2/AM (2 Î¼M for 30 min at RT) in culture medium (RPMI, 10% FCS, 1% glucose, 600 Î¼g/ml geneticin). S2 or Jurkat cells loaded with fura-2 were mounted in a chamber permitting solution exchange by a syringe-driven perfusion system and placed on the stage of an Axiovert 35 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) equipped with a 40Ã plan-Neofluar objective (NA 1.30 oil). Alternating 340 Â± 5 or 380 Â± 5 nm light controlled by a high speed wavelength switcher (Lambda DG-4; Sutter Instrument Co.), was used to excite fura-2. A 400-nm dichroic mirror and 480-nm long-pass emission filter (Chroma) supplied light to the Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific), and images were acquired under control of Metafluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.). [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was estimated using the formula [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> = K (R â R<sub>min</sub>)/(R<sub>max</sub>Â â R).</p>
        <p>The values of R<sub>min</sub> and R<sub>max</sub> were determined in intact cells by exposing cells to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution containing 1 Î¼M ionomycin (Calbiochem) to obtain R<sub>min</sub>, and 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution with 1 Î¼M ionomycin to obtain R<sub>max</sub>.

        <p>Patch-clamp experiments were performed at RT in the standard whole-cell recording configuration, as described previously (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Yeromin et al., 2004</xref>). External and internal solutions are indicated in Table S3. S2, Jurkat, or HEK cells were initially bathed in the appropriate external solution. After gigohm seal formation, whole-cell recording was initiated at time 0. The membrane potential was held at 10 mV. Voltage ramps from â110 mV to +110 mV lasting 220 ms were alternated with 220-ms pulses to â110 mV every 2. Up to eight I-V curves were averaged for display. Leak currents before channel activation were averaged (up to five sweeps) and subtracted from subsequent current records. External solutions were changed locally by fast application using a gravity-driven perfusion system. A complete local solution exchange was achieved within 2 s. Data were analyzed using Pulse (Heka Electronic) and Origin (OriginLab Corp.). The membrane capacitance (a measure of cell surface area) of S2 cells selected for recording was 11.3 Â± 0.5 pF (mean Â± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 211 cells); for Jurkat T cells the capacitance was 12.5 Â± 1.1 pF (<italic>n</italic> = 25). To calculate current densities, peak current amplitudes were divided by membrane capacitance for each cell.</p>
