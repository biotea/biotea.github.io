<italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> has evolved the ability to modify host cell function with intracellular active effectors to overcome the intestinal barrier. The detection of these microbial effectors and the initiation of innate immune responses are critical for rapid mucosal defense activation. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor H1 (GEF-H1) mediates RhoA activation required for cell invasion by the enteroinvasive pathogen <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>. Surprisingly, GEF-H1 is requisite for NF-ÎºB activation in response to <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. GEF-H1 interacts with NOD1 and is required for RIP2 dependent NF-ÎºB activation by H-Ala-D-Î³Glu-DAP (Î³TriDAP). GEF-H1 is essential for NF-ÎºB activation by the <italic>Shigella</italic> effectors IpgB2 and OspB, which were found to signal in a NOD1 and RhoA Kinase (ROCK) dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that GEF-H1 is a critical component of cellular defenses forming an intracellular sensing system with NOD1 for the detection of microbial effectors during cell invasion by pathogens.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>
<italic>Shigella</italic> is a bacterium that causes food poisoning and serious intestinal infections with diarrheal illness. Pathogens like <italic>Shigella</italic> utilize intracellular active effectors to overcome the intestinal barrier and invade the host. We demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells can sense the disturbance of the tight junctional seal, which normally prevents access of microbes to the circulation. A signaling molecule, which is required for cell invasion by <italic>Shigella</italic>, also activates messengers that activate immune defenses. This pathway of intestinal pathogen detection is activated by <italic>Shigella</italic> products, which are injected into host cells by the pathogen and depends on intracellular microbial recognition receptors. The detection of altered cellular function by bacterial effectors may be important for the ability to rapidly respond to barrier disruption in the intestine with the attraction and activation of immune cells to defend against the intruders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The tight junctions (TJs) of the intestinal epithelium act as a defensive barrier against microbial invaders and many pathogenic bacteria have developed mechanisms to overcome the tight junctional seal to exploit the intestinal epithelium as a replicative niche or to allow entry and dissemination into the host. TJs are multiprotein complexes which consist of transmembrane components, scaffolding proteins and signaling molecules that have the potential to initiate host immune surveillance upon disruption of the tight junctional seal <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Schneeberger1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Madara1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. GEF-H1 was originally identified in mice as an oncoprotein member of the DBL family that activates RhoA in hematopoietic cells <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Glaven1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Krendel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. GEF-H1 can associate with microtubules in non-polarized epithelial cells or the actin cytoskeleton in polarized epithelial cells and has been proposed to mediate cross talk between the two filament types <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Glaven1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. GEF-H1 associates with cingulin within TJs of epithelial cells and regulates paracellular permeability <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Krendel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Matsuzawa1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Shigella</italic> species are human pathogens capable of colonizing the intestinal epithelium by exploiting epithelial cell functions and circumventing the host innate immune response <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Sansonetti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The enteroinvasive pathogen <italic>S. flexneri</italic> can specifically target TJs to overcome the intestinal barrier and gain access to the basolateral membrane compartments of intestinal epithelial cells <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Sakaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, a prerequisite for the invasion of epithelial cells <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Sansonetti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. <italic>Shigella</italic> cell invasion depends on the release of a subset of effectors through the type III secretion system (T3SS) both around the bacterial surface and directly into the host cell <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Ogawa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Cossart1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is known that the ability of <italic>Shigella</italic> to invade epithelial cells and subsequently spread from cell to cell is pivotal in establishing intestinal infection. This process is associated with a strong inflammatory response, but the bacterial effectors and host cell response mechanisms leading to defense activation are not well understood. <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Ogawa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Sansonetti2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Signaling through nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) NOD1 provides the intestinal epithelium with a mechanism for activating innate immunity during infection by invasive pathogenic Gram negative bacteria <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Hisamatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Intracellular pattern recognition receptors such as NOD1 can detect the D-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) dipeptide of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> in macrophages and activate NF-ÎºB <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Girardin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Inohara1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. <italic>S. flexneri</italic> employs a diverse array of effectors to alter the host actin cytoskeleton and innate immune responses including regulators for Rho GTPases and NF-ÎºB <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Sansonetti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Hueck1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Sasakawa1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, it has not been established which bacterial and host mediators signal the disruption of the apical junctional complex to initiate cellular defense responses in the intestinal epithelium.</p>
      <p>In this study, we demonstrate that GEF-H1 is a central component of pathogen recognition by NOD1. GEF-H1 and NOD1 together not only detect the presence of peptidoglycan (PGN)-derived muropeptides but also signal in response to <italic>Shigella</italic> effectors in the cytoplasm. GEF-H1 is recruited into bacterial invasion sites of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> and the subsequent RhoA activation is required for cell invasion. In addition, GEF-H1 is requisite for the activation of NF-ÎºB dependent gene expression during <italic>Shigella</italic> cell invasion. NF-ÎºB activation by GEF-H1 is independent from the detection of bacterial products by Toll-like receptor (TLR) and cytokine receptor signaling. Instead, GEF-H1 interacts with NOD1 and is required for NF-ÎºB activation in response to Î³TriDAP. Importantly, we find that the <italic>Shigella</italic> effectors IpgB2 and OspB activate NF-ÎºB by a mechanism that depends on both NOD1 and GEF-H1 and requires ROCK activation. GEF-H1 is a central component in a detection system that directs NF-ÎºB activation in RhoA and RIP2 dependent pathways initiated by the action of bacterial effectors and intracellular pathogen pattern recognition.</p>

        <p>Interaction of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> with the polarized epithelium results in the redistribution of TJ associated proteins which results in the loss of barrier function and allows access to the basolateral membrane compartment to facilitate cell invasion <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Sakaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We utilized GFP expressing <italic>S. flexneri</italic> to determine the subcellular redistribution of GEF-H1 and its binding partner cingulin in TJs <xref rid="ppat.1000228-BenaisPont1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> during invasion of polarized Madden Darby canine kidney (MDCK) model epithelial cell monolayers.

</xref>, <italic>S. flexneri</italic> initially was found specifically attached to cell-cell contacts and co-localized with GEF-H1 and cingulin in TJs of polarized MDCK cell monolayers.

        <title>GEF-H1 function is required for host cell invasion by <italic>S. flexneri</italic>
</title>
        <p>The recruitment of GEF-H1 to invasion sites raised the possibility that GEF-H1 was targeted by bacterial effectors to activate Rho GTPases at the basolateral membrane compartments as a prerequisite for cell invasion by <italic>S. flexneri</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Sansonetti4" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We therefore determined the requirement of GEF-H1 and its contribution to Rho GTPase activation during <italic>Shigella</italic> cell invasion. Invasion of MDCK monolayers by <italic>S. flexneri</italic> was associated with an increase of GEF-H1 expression in Triton X-soluble protein fractions. The membrane associated pool of GEF-H1 remained high during the interaction of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> with the polarized epithelium, suggesting that GEF-H1 was rapidly redistributed from apical junctions to new membrane associated binding partners at bacterial entry sites or basolateral membrane compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000228-g002">
<bold>Figure 2A</bold>
</xref>). Cingulin was redistributed from the TJ associated Triton X-insoluble to the -soluble protein fractions during the initial phase of <italic>Shigella</italic> cell invasion potentially initiating the release of GEF-H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000228-g002">
<bold>Figure 2A</bold>
</xref>). However, within 90 minutes, cingulin levels in TJ associated membrane fractions recovered. In contrast, cytosolic GEF-H1 protein levels continued to increase over the 90 minute observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000228-g002">
<bold>Figure 2A</bold>
</xref>). The increase in cytosolic GEF-H1 expression observed in soluble protein fractions may not only result from subcellular redistribution, but could also include protein neosynthesis, since GEF-H1 mRNA expression was upregulated 13.3Â±0.5-fold within 2 hours of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000228-g002">

Conversely, overexpression of GEF-H1 together with NOD1 synergistically upregulated NF-ÎºB dependent gene transcription by up to 26Â±7-fold, while expression of GEF-H1 or NOD1 alone increased NF-ÎºB dependent transcription by 4Â±0.6-fold and 3.5Â±0.4-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000228-g004">

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The epithelial interface is involved in constant cross talk with the intestinal microbiota through molecular mechanisms that integrate intestinal epithelial barrier function with mucosal immune regulation. Failure to accurately monitor the intestinal environment or respond adequately to challenges by pathogens results in a breakdown of the intestinal barrier. Multiple signaling components are localized at epithelial TJs <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Balda1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000228-VanAelst1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Most of these signal mediators have been identified through their function in the regulation of epithelial polarization, differentiation and growth control, but very little information exists about their contribution to mucosal host defense responses. We now show that the disruption of TJs by <italic>Shigella</italic> effectors is linked to the activation of innate immune responses through GEF-H1 controlling NOD1 mediated NF-ÎºB activation.</p>
      <p>GEF-H1 was recruited to <italic>Shigella</italic> induced membrane ruffles similarly to NOD1 which has been shown to be enriched in bacterial entry sites in an actin dependent mechanism also required for signal transduction <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Kufer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. <italic>Shigella</italic> effectors secreted by the T3SS could initiate NF-ÎºB signaling before the PGN release from <italic>Shigella</italic> multiplying within epithelial cells that has been shown to activate the NOD pathway <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Fritz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>GEF-H1 is indispensable for NOD1 mediated NF-ÎºB activation by Î³TriDAP, and by the <italic>Shigella</italic> effectors OspB and IpgB2. However, the downstream signaling events leading to NF-ÎºB activation were specific for either Î³TriDAP or the <italic>Shigella</italic> effectors. <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection induces NOD1 oligomerization via the homophilic CARD-CARD interaction allowing transient recruitment of RIP2 and IKK, which phosphorylates IÎºB leading to prolonged activation of NF-ÎºB <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Girardin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Philpott1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In our experiments, GEF-H1 dependent activation of NF-ÎºB by Î³TriDAP and its synergistic effect on <italic>Shigella</italic> effector signaling was RIP2 dependent. The ability of GEF-H1 to mediate Î³TriDAP initiated NOD1 signal transduction was independent of the GEF function of GEF-H1 and the activation of RhoA. Instead, in Î³TriDAP signaling, GEF-H1 directly interacted with NOD1 serving as a signaling adaptor through protein motifs which need to be defined in future experiments. In contrast, OspB and IpgB2 mediated NF-ÎºB activation required RhoA mediated activation of ROCK but not RIP2. These findings demonstrate that GEF-H1 is a central component of RhoA and Rip2-mediated NF-kB activation during <italic>Shigella</italic> cell invasion.</p>
      <p>In the early stages of <italic>Shigella</italic> infection, effectors delivered by the T3SS include IpgB1, IpgB2, IpgD and VirA both around the bacterial surface and directly into the host cell. While both IpgB1 and IpgB2 associated with cellular junctions, only IpgB2 was a potent inducer of the GEF-H1 dependent activation of NF-ÎºB. Both IpgB1 and IpgB2 have been linked to Rho GTPase function. IpgB1 is presumed to have major roles in producing membrane ruffles by activating Rac-1 through ELMO and DOCK180, a Rac-1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor <xref rid="ppat.1000228-BourdetSicard1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. IpgB1 function has been linked to the activation of RhoG, resulting in downstream activation of Rac <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Handa1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. IpgB2 is an IpgB1 homolog that binds to mDia1 which facilitates actin nucleation and the Rho kinase ROCK through its GTPase binding domains <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Demali1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Therefore, IpgB2 may mimic the activity of RhoA in our experiments resulting in ROCK dependent NF-ÎºB activation. Invasiveness of IpgB1 or IpgB2 mutant <italic>Shigella</italic> has been recently assessed <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Hachani1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Consistent with our results, <italic>Shigella</italic> IpgB2 mutants have been found to exhibit the same invasive capacity as the wild type strain in non-polarized and polarized intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast, IpgB1 mutants were 50% less invasive in the non-polarized epithelium but slightly more invasive in the polarized epithelium <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Hachani1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Therefore, the reduced NF-ÎºB activation in response to IpgB2 mutants was not due to reduced cell invasion, while IpgB1 and OspB play a role in the cell invasion process itself, which may contribute to the reduced NF-ÎºB activation seen in response to <italic>Shigella</italic> mutants lacking these effectors.</p>
      <p>Independent of its role in cell invasion, OspB was able to activate GEF-H1 dependent NF-ÎºB activation. OspB is a MxiE regulated gene and is therefore likely expressed after <italic>S. flexneri</italic> invades host cells. It was therefore surprising that we recovered a reduced number of OspB deficient <italic>Shigella</italic> mutants in our gentamicin protection assays. OspB expressed in the cytoplasm could initiate GEF-H1 and NOD1 dependent NF-ÎºB signaling after the escape of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> from the phagosome. It needs to be determined if NF-ÎºB activation by this effector contributes to anti-apoptotic regulation supporting survival of the pathogen in the host cell.</p>
      <p>VirA is delivered into the host cell cytoplasm near the site of bacterial entry and induces local microtubule degradation <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Degradation of microtubules by the VirA related effector EspG from enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> results in the release of various microtubule associated proteins, including GEF-H1 <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Matsuzawa1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. VirA activity is assumed to contribute to ruffle formation during <italic>Shigella</italic> invasion through cross talk between RhoA and Rac-1. In our studies, VirA induced responses resulted in rapid induction of cell death in epithelial cell lines tested and failed to induce NF-ÎºB. The function of VirA might be more closely associated with the ability of <italic>Shigella</italic> to move within the cell than with direct cell invasion. During multiplication within the epithelium, <italic>Shigella</italic> secretes additional effectors including OspF and OspG. Consistent with previous findings, OspG and OspF both failed to induce NF-ÎºB. OspG has been demonstrated to interfere with the IÎºBÎ± degradation resulting in repression of NF-ÎºB activation and downregulated inflammatory response to infection <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. OspF has a specific phosphatase activity that dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPK leading to blockage of phosphorylation of histone H3 which is required for transcription of a subset of NF-ÎºB regulated genes <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Arbibe1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In polarized epithelial cells, GEF-H1 is associated with apical polarization complexes concentrated at TJs from which it is released and redistributed to bacterial invasion sites during <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Our experiments demonstrate that, in epithelial cells, GEF-H1 is essential for RhoA activation required for cell invasion by <italic>Shigella</italic>. Like Cdc42 and Rac, RhoA activity is required for <italic>Shigella</italic> entry <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Adam1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Watarai1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. RhoA is not critical for <italic>Shigella</italic> induced actin polymerization, but is required for the recruitment of ezrin to bacterial entry sites <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Kueltzo1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We demonstrate that RhoA activation through GEF-H1 can contribute to the activation of NF-ÎºB upon cell invasion by <italic>Shigella</italic>. Invasion by extracellular and intracellular pathogens is sensed by various signaling pathways that converge to activate NF-ÎºB which can initiate inflammatory mediator secretion, but is also a critical cell survival signal <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Members of the Rho family of GTPases are involved specifically in the regulation of NF-ÎºB dependent transcription. RhoA mediated activation of atypical protein kinase C can induce phosphorylation of p65/Rel-A at serine 811, a site that is crucial for modulating the interaction between Rel-A and CREB binding protein <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Teusch1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. A recent report demonstrated that Rac1 can interact and co-localize with NOD2, raising the possibility that regulators of Rho GTPases contribute specifically to intracellular innate immune recognition <xref rid="ppat.1000228-LegrandPoels1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Rho GTPases have been shown to be important factors in TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 signaling <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Teusch1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Arbibe2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Stovall1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. LPS released by <italic>Shigella</italic> as they escape from the phagosome into the macrophage cytoplasm activates caspase-1 which induces production of IL-1Î² and cell death <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Fritz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, TLR mediated recognition was not responsible for the rapid activation of NF-ÎºB in response to <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, its effectors and GEF-H1, since our experiments were carried out in HEK293 cells, which express low levels of TLR1-9 mRNA and consequently do not respond to TLR ligands <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This may resemble the situation encountered by <italic>Shigella in vivo</italic>, where intestinal epithelial cells lack membrane expression of CD14 and remain relatively refractory to activation by extracellular LPS or noninvasive Gram negative bacteria <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Abreu1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1000228-Philpott2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. However, our results do not exclude the possible involvement of GEF-H1 or other Rho-GEFs in bacterial recognition through TLRs in other cell types or in the recognition of other pathogens.</p>
      <p>Collectively, our findings support a model in which GEF-H1 is a new essential signal mediator in the activation of host defense initiated by the intracellular recognition of enteropathogens by NOD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000228-g007">
<bold>Figure 7</bold>
</xref>). GEF-H1 has two important functions, one in sensing muramyl dipeptides through NOD1 that is independent of its GEF activity, and another in the activation of NF-ÎºB by <italic>Shigella</italic> effector proteins, which requires its GEF activity and the activation of RhoA. GEF-H1 and NOD1 are central components in RhoA and RIP2 dependent NF-ÎºB signaling pathways activated upon <italic>Shigella</italic> cell invasion. <italic>Shigella</italic> release of LPS and PGN into host cells has been considered to be the main cause of the strong inflammatory response that is induced during <italic>Shigella</italic> infections <xref rid="ppat.1000228-Sansonetti2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Our experiments extend this model by demonstrating that NOD1 function is not limited to the detection of PGN fragments but, together with GEF-H1, functions in sensing the intracellular action of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> peptide effectors. This mechanism may allow intestinal epithelial cells to rapidly detect <italic>Shigella</italic> effectors and activate the NF-ÎºB pathway to initiate survival and inflammatory signals. Our findings raise the interesting possibility that other NLR family proteins are also involved in the sensing of modifications to cellular functions by microbial effectors in addition to their role as pattern recognition receptors. Recognition of altered cell function by bacterial effectors may be important for the ability to distinguish between pathogenic and commensal microorganisms which cannot be achieved based on extracellular pattern recognition receptors alone, since many of their ligands are commonly expressed by commensal, as well as infectious microbiota.</p>

          <title>Proposed model of GEF-H1 function in the activation of innate immune responses to <italic>Shigella</italic> cell invasion.</title>
          <p>Upon cell attachment <italic>Shigella</italic> releases effectors through the T3SS into the host cell to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and facilitate invasion. This releases GEF-H1 from its binding partners in tight junctions inducing its interaction with NOD1. GEF-H1 has at least two functions in the activation of cellular defenses to microbial effectors. One mediates the sensing of muramyl dipeptides through NOD1 that is independent of its GEF activity, and the other is required for the activation of NF-ÎºB by <italic>Shigella</italic> effector proteins, which requires its GEF activity mediated by the DBL homolgous domain (DH) and the activation of RhoA. RhoA activation by GEF-H1 is required for <italic>Shigella</italic> cell invasion through the recruitment of ezrin and regulation of the cytoskeleton potential cooperating with the RhoA mimicry of IpgB2. RhoA activation by GEF-H1 contributes to NF-ÎºB activation through ROCK dependent phosphorylation of NF-ÎºB proteins. Through interaction with GEF-H1, NOD1 can function in sensing the intracellular action of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> peptide effectors in addition to its role in the detection of peptidoglycan fragments.</p>

After washing three times, cells were treated with 480 Âµg/ml gentamicin for 60 minutes at 37Â°C. Intracellular bacteria were released by lysis with 1% Triton X-100 solution after washing 5 times. Cell lysates were sequentially diluted and plated on LB agar plates for counting of colony forming units. The same protocol was used for HEK293 cells plated on 24-well plates. All experiments were carried out at least 3 times and representative data are included.</p>
