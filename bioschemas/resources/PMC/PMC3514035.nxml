        <p>Epithelial junction formation and morphogenesis requires the GTPase-activating
protein SH3BP1 and the F-actinâcapping protein CapZ to guide Cdc42
signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Epithelial cellâcell adhesion and morphogenesis require dynamic control of
actin-driven membrane remodeling. The Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)
Cdc42 regulates sequential molecular processes during cellâcell junction
formation; hence, mechanisms must exist that inactivate Cdc42 in a temporally
and spatially controlled manner. In this paper, we identify SH3BP1, a
GTPase-activating protein for Cdc42 and Rac, as a regulator of junction assembly
and epithelial morphogenesis using a functional small interfering ribonucleic
acid screen. Depletion of SH3BP1 resulted in loss of spatial control of Cdc42
activity, stalled membrane remodeling, and enhanced growth of filopodia. SH3BP1
formed a complex with JACOP/paracingulin, a junctional adaptor, and CD2AP, a
scaffolding protein; both were required for normal Cdc42 signaling and junction
formation. The filamentous actinâcapping protein CapZ also associated
with the SH3BP1 complex and was required for control of actin remodeling.
Epithelial junction formation and morphogenesis thus require a dual activity
complex, containing SH3BP1 and CapZ, that is recruited to sites of active
membrane remodeling to guide Cdc42 signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial junction assembly and morphogenesis are driven by a complex set of
cytoskeletal rearrangements that drive dynamic membrane remodeling and the necessary
cell shape changes that underlie the formation of functional epithelial tissues
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson, 2009</xref>). Although there are
variations among different epithelia, junction formation is generally induced by
filopodia or lamellipodia initiating cellâcell contact followed by junction
formation and maturation, leading to the establishment of mature tight and adherens
junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vasioukhin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matter and Balda, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miyoshi and Takai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson, 2009</xref>). Actin remodeling underlies
these morphological transitions and needs to be carefully controlled to allow the
coordinated assembly of a functional apical junctional complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vasioukhin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Redd et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chhabra and Higgs, 2007</xref>).</p><p>RhoGTPases are central regulatory switches that guide actin organization, junction
formation, and epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braga
and Yap, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaffe and Hall,
2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ridley, 2006</xref>). They are
regulated by factors that catalyze the switch between the active, GTP-bound state,
and the inactive, GDP-bound state: activation is mediated by guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs) and inactivation by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bos et al., 2007</xref>). The RhoGTPase Cdc42 is an
evolutionarily conserved regulator of cell polarization and regulates different
steps of junction formation from filopodial extension to junctional maturation;
hence, mechanisms must exist that activate and inactivate Cdc42 in a temporally
controlled manner at specific subcellular sites to permit progression of dynamic
morphological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matter and Balda,
2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iden and Collard, 2008</xref>).
Although activation of Cdc42 is generally seen as the critical step, expression of
dominant-negative and constitutively active mutants of Cdc42 revealed that
inhibition as well as overstimulation of Cdc42 signaling prevents normal junction
formation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kroschewski et al.,
1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rojas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruewer et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, negative
regulation of Cdc42 is important for the successful completion of complex sequential
Cdc42-driven processes. This is supported by the finding that Rich1, a GAP for
Cdc42, is required for full polarization of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wells et al., 2006</xref>). However, Rich1 is thought to regulate
polarization once junctions are assembled, as it is not required for membrane
dynamics and adherens junction assembly. Whether specific GAPs are required for
junction assembly and are important to maintain actin dynamics and membrane
remodeling is not known. Moreover, it is likely that GTPase regulation is tightly
connected to other regulators of actin dynamics; however, little is known about
specific molecular cross talk that would mediate such cooperative regulatory
mechanisms.</p><p>Here, we use a functional siRNA screen to identify GAPs important for epithelial
morphogenesis that led to the identification of SH3BP1 as a crucial regulator of
epithelial junction formation and morphogenesis. SH3BP1 is a GAP for Rac and Cdc42
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cicchetti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parrini et al., 2011</xref>), and our data show that
its depletion leads to spatial and temporal deregulation of Cdc42 and, depending on
the cell model, a modest effect on Rac activation. SH3BP1 forms a complex with two
scaffolding proteins and the F-actinâcapping protein CapZ, suggesting that
this regulatory complex represents a dual activity module that links regulation of
Cdc42 and actin dynamics during membrane remodeling and junction formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>SH3BP1 is required for epithelial junction formation and
morphogenesis</title><p>We used the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 as a model system to screen
for functionally relevant Rho GAPs, as these cells form polarized monolayers and
can be efficiently transfected with siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Terry et al., 2011</xref>). The siRNA-mediated depletion of Cdc42 was
efficient and led to flatter cells with a disrupted distribution of ZO-1, a
tight junction protein, and Î²-catenin, a component of adherens junctions
as well as reduced and disorganized expression of the apical marker DPPIV and
the basolateral protein Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Similarly, overexpression
of constitutively active Cdc42, myc-Cdc42L61, disrupted the normal organization
of cell junctions and the actin cytoskeleton in Caco-2 as well as in the
epidermal carcinoma cell line A431 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1

interferes with normal epithelial junction formation and differentiation as
previously observed in other epithelial cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kroschewski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rojas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruewer et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>SH3BP1 depletion disrupts epithelial cellâcell

with an siRNA library targeting RhoGTPases and GAPs to identify RhoGTPase
regulators important for junction formation. Potential candidates identified in
the first round of screening using standard siRNAs were retested in a second
round using siRNAs modified to enhance specificity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201202094/DC1" id="supp3">Tables

phenotypes followed by the Cdc42 GAP SH3BP1 and two RhoA GAPs, OPHN1 and MYO9A
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref> and Fig. S1 B). Regulation
of RhoA is crucial during epithelial junction formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Terry et al., 2011</xref>), and both identified RhoA GAPs MYO9A
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abouhamed et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Omelchenko and Hall, 2012</xref>) and OPHN1
(Fig. S1, CâE) localize to the junctional complex. OPHN1 has also GAP
activity for Rac and Cdc42 in vitro; however, its main function in vivo seems to
be regulation of RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billuart et al.,
1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khelfaoui et al.,
2009</xref>).</p><p>Depletion of SH3BP1 caused the strongest phenotype of all GAPs tested. Subsequent
analysis in Caco-2 cells using different siRNAs resulted in monolayers that
failed to assemble a normal junctional actin belt and exhibited a strong
induction of basal F-actin, often in an astral shape along cell borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). Similar patterns of
disorganized actin were observed when cells were stained with Î²-actin
antibodies instead of phalloidin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201202094/DC1" id="supp6">Fig. S2
A</ext-link>). Tight and adherens junctions were also affected, as markers
such as ZO-1, cingulin, E-cadherin, and p120 catenin exhibited enhanced
cytoplasmic staining and were less concentrated along cellâcell contacts
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, GâI</xref>). Cells also
failed to differentiate normally, as the distributions of DPPIV and
Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase were disrupted, although
expression levels were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1
K</xref> and Fig. S2 B). Depleted cells remained flat and did not form
columnar cells with distinct tight and adherens junctions and, hence, were less
densely packed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 L</xref>). Similarly, in
SH3BP1-depleted human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells, a squamous epithelial cell
type, ZO-1, did not form a continuous junctional belt, and the adherens junction
marker Î²-catenin accumulated in filopodia-like structures (Fig. S2 C). In
the epidermal carcinoma cell line A431, depletion also triggered a
reorganization of F-actin, resulting in accumulation of filopodia (Fig. S2 D).
SH3BP1 is thus required for normal junction formation in epithelial cell models
originating from different tissues and representing different types of
epithelia. The accumulation of filopodia suggests that depletion may lead to
deregulation of Cdc42.</p><p>We next introduced silent mutations into an SH3BP1 cDNA to generate an
siRNA-resistant construct. Immunoblotting demonstrated that the construct was
efficiently expressed in cells transfected with control and SH3BP1-specific
siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 M</xref>). Immunofluorescence
revealed that the siRNA-resistant construct indeed counteracted the
depletion-induced phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, N and
O</xref>). Ectopically expressed SH3BP1 was enriched at cellâcell
junctions, suggesting that the GAP may interact with junctional components.
However, the overexpressed protein also accumulated in the cytosol, suggesting
that its targeting is easily saturated or may be a dynamically regulated.</p><p>We next asked whether Caco-2 cells were still able to form functional tight
junctions upon depletion of SH3BP1. To monitor de novo junction formation, we
performed Ca switch assays, in which cells are plated in low calcium and
junction formation is then induced in a synchronized manner by the addition of
calcium. Cells spread out normally after calcium addition, but conversion to a
continuous peripheral actin belt did not occur, and junctional markers were not
recruited efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2,
AâD</xref>; and Fig. S2, E and F). Consequently, the barrier properties
of SH3BP1-depleted cells were strongly compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>SH3BP1 regulates epithelial junction formation.</bold> (AâF)
Caco-2 cells transfected with siRNAs were plated in low calcium medium
before adding calcium to induce junction formation, which was followed
by staining with fluorescent phalloidin (A), ZO-1 (B), E-cadherin (C),
p120 catenin (D), or by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance
(TER; E). (F) After 48 h, paracellular tracer diffusion was measured. E
and F show means Â± 1 SD; <italic>n</italic> = 3. (G and H)
siRNA-transfected A431 cells were plated in low calcium medium and then
stimulated for different periods of time with calcium to induce junction
formation. Shown are images of cells stained phalloidin (G) or with
antiâE-cadherin antibodies (H). Note that depletion of SH3BP1
leads to a strong induction of E-cadherinâpositive filopodia.
Bars, 10 Âµm. p, phosphorylated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201202094_Fig2"/></fig><p>During de novo junction formation in keratinocytes, filopodia initiate
cellâcell contacts followed by formation of a zipperlike belt that
precedes formation of mature junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vasioukhin et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, the accumulation of filopodia
in SH3BP1-depleted A431 may reflect a failure in the transition from filopodia
to cell junctions. Addition of calcium to A431 cells plated in low calcium
resulted in the induction of filopodia-based cellâcell contacts, enriched
in F-actin and E-cadherin, followed by formation of continuous adherens
junctions over the course of a few hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.
2, G and H</xref>). In contrast, SH3BP1-depleted cells formed contacts, but
they did not progress beyond the stage of forming intercalating filopodia,
indicating that SH3BP1 is required for the transition from early
cellâcell contacts to cell junctions.</p><p>We next determined whether SH3BP1 is also important for epithelial morphogenesis
in an organotypic 3D culture system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3
A</xref> shows that depletion of the GAP resulted in generally smaller and
poorly organized cysts. Actin staining demonstrated that SH3BP1 depletion led to
cysts that often formed multiple instead of a single lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Quantification of these experiments indeed
supported the conclusion that SH3BP1 is essential for epithelial morphogenesis

Junctional SH3BP1 overlapped with Î²-catenin and occludin. There was also
staining in the nucleus and the cytosol; however, only the junctional staining
completely disappeared when SH3BP1 was depleted, suggesting that the
nonjunctional staining might be partly nonspecific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Confocal microscopy further supported the
junctional association of SH3BP1 and suggested a closer association with
adherens than tight junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).
In mouse colon, SH3BP1 and ZO-1 also overlapped, suggesting that the GAP
associates with cell junctions in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4

junctions. Conversely, inhibition of EGF receptor signaling with PD153035 led to
a reduction of junctional SH3BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4

cell scattering and junctional remodeling as well as junction stabilization and
enhanced barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Itallie et al.,

may also support junction formation in response to EGF. A431 cells, in which
SH3BP1 regulates calcium-induced junction assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), are well suited to address this question as their

of EGF led to the quick induction of dorsal ruffles to which ZO-1 and other
junctional proteins were recruited before appearing at cell junctions along with
the formation of a junctional actin belt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5

the GAP associates with EGF-induced sites of actin remodeling.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>SH3BP1 regulates EGF-induced dorsal ruffling and junction

junctional proteins was consequently also inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy with cells expressing
GFP-actin further indicated that depletion of SH3BP1 strongly attenuated
EGF-induced actin remodeling. Whereas control siRNA-transfected cells formed
extensive and dynamic dorsal ruffles that exhibited the same morphology as in
fixed cells, SH3BP1-depleted cells showed little signs of actin dynamics apart
from the slow growth of filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6

and/or signaling, we stimulated siRNA-transfected cells with fluorescent EGF to
monitor receptor internalization. However, the ligand was still internalized in
depleted cells, although apparently more slowly (Fig. S3 B). There was no
inhibition of extracellular signalâregulated kinase (Erk) activation
apparent (Fig. S3 C). Thus, SH3BP1 is not required for EGF receptor signaling
per se but for normal actin dynamics and junction assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>SH3BP1 spatially restricts Cdc42 signaling</title><p>SH3BP1 is a RhoGAP that stimulates GTP hydrolysis by Rac and Cdc42 in vitro and
in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cicchetti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parrini et al., 2011</xref>). To test the
importance of this GAP activity, we generated an siRNA-resistant construct
carrying a substitution of a conserved arginine residue required for GAP
activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bos et al., 2007</xref>). Whereas the
wild-type protein could rescue junction formation in siRNA-transfected cells,
the protein lacking a functional GAP domain could not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, CâF</xref>). Expression of the GAP mutant in
control siRNA-transfected cells already stimulated filopodia, suggesting that it
functioned as a dominant-negative mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6
F</xref>). The GAP activity of SH3BP1 is thus important for its role in
junction formation.</p><p>We next measured the effect of SH3BP1 depletion on the levels of active Cdc42 and
Rac in A431 cell extracts. In serum-starved cells, levels of Cdc42 were low and
increased upon induction of junction formation by EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Depletion of SH3BP1 indeed strongly elevated
levels of active Cdc42 during the entire EGF time course, which is in agreement
with the observed accumulation of filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). The effect of EGF and SH3BP1 depletion on Rac was limited.
A significant small increase in response to depletion of the GAP was only
observed after 15 min of EGF stimulation. This indicates that SH3BP1 plays a
major role in the regulation of Cdc42 and a more modest role in guiding Rac
signaling during junction formation.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Spatial regulation of Cdc42 activity by SH3BP1.</bold> (A) Levels

that SH3BP1 confines Cdc42 signaling and, thereby, promotes actin remodeling and
junction formation. Hence, we used a fluoresecence/FÃ¶rster resonance
energy transfer (FRET)âbased biosensor for Cdc42 to test whether
depletion of SH3BP1 led to a loss of spatial control of Cdc42 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshizaki et al., 2003</xref>). In control A431
cells, higher mean FRET activities were measured along the apical surface than
along the base of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, B and

cellâcell contacts and increased along the base of the cells, correlating
with the inhibition of junction formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig.
7 C</xref>).</p><p>We next used recently developed antibodies specific for the active form of Cdc42
to monitor activation of endogenous GTPases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201202094/DC1" id="supp16">Fig. S4,

A431 cells, staining intensity was low, reflecting the low levels of active
Cdc42 and indicating that the antibody background was low (Fig. S4 C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, Cdc42 levels). Stimulation with
EGF resulted in staining of dorsal ruffles within 5 min, in agreement with the
previously reported quick and sustained accumulation of active Cdc42 in ruffles
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurokawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kovacs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King et al., 2011</xref>). Active Rac1 also
increased in response to EGF and was more prominent along the dorsal aspects of
the cells; however, it did not accumulate in the large ruffles as active Cdc42
(Fig. S4 D). This is also in agreement with the biosensor experiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurokawa et al. (2004)</xref>, demonstrating
that Rac is transiently activated during ruffle initiation in A431 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kovacs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, the results
obtained with these antibodies are in agreement with previous work on Rac and
Cdc42 activation in the same model system.</p><p>In SH3BP1-depleted cells, Cdc42 levels were already higher before adding EGF and
then accumulated throughout the cells as well as in filopodia, indicating that
the normal spatial organization was lost (Fig. S4 C). Active Rac1 often
accumulated in perinuclear cuplike structures in depleted cells, indicating that
the spatial organization of Rac1 signaling was also partially disturbed (Fig. S4
D). Deregulated RhoGTPase signaling was also suggested by the increased
phosphorylation of cofilin upon SH3BP1 depletion (Fig. S4 E). These observations
thus indicate that SH3BP1 regulates the spatial organization of Cdc42 and, in a
more modest manner, Rac1 activity.</p><p>In Caco-2 cells, the GAP activity of SH3BP1 was also found to be important as the
GAP-defective mutant was also found to exert a dominant-negative effect by
inducing actin-rich membrane protrusions upon transfection, whereas the
wild-type protein did not, even at high expression levels that oversaturated
junctional recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>).
Analysis of the spatial distribution of Cdc42 activity supported the importance
of SH3BP1 in the regulation of RhoGTPase signaling, as active Cdc42 was enriched
apically in control cells but preferentially basal and reduced along
cellâcell contacts in depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, E and F</xref>). Staining with the antibodies recognizing active
Cdc42 led to the same conclusion, as the staining was enriched at junctions in
control cells and dispersed in depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, G and H</xref>; and Fig. S4 F, Cdc42 siRNA control). Lateral or
junctional Rac1 staining was not observed. As we did also not obtain clear
phenotypes in response to Rac1 depletion or inhibition, Rac1 does not seem to be
of importance for junction formation in Caco-2 cells.</p><p>As depletion of SH3BP1 led to loss of spatial control of Cdc42 activity, partial
depletion of the GTPase might be able to recover the phenotype; hence, we
transfected Cdc42-specific siRNAs at suboptimal concentrations either together
with nontargeting or SH3BP1-targeting siRNAs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref> shows that 20- and 30-nM Cdc42-specific siRNAs led to a
partial depletion of the GTPase; depletion of the GAP was not affected by the
cotransfection of different siRNAs. Partial depletion of Cdc42 already
interfered with normal junctional assembly but, as expected, not as efficiently
as at optimal siRNA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, B
and C</xref>). In SH3BP1-depleted cells, partial Cdc42 depletion
counteracted the phenotype, and cells formed more regular monolayers with
assembled junctions, indicating that Cdc42 is a major functional target of
SH3BP1. These data thus indicate that SH3BP1 is an important regulator of
epithelial Cdc42 signaling by controlling the spatial organization of the active
RhoGTPase, which is supported by the accumulation of SH3BP1 in areas enriched in
active Cdc42 during EGF- and calcium-induced junction assembly (Fig. S4, G and
H).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Cdc42 is a functionally important target of SH3BP1.</bold> Caco-2

coprecipitated not only the GAP but also CD2AP, suggesting that the three
proteins may exist in a triple complex. Coprecipitation of JACOP with other
proteins was not detected, possibly reflecting the low signal obtained in
immunoblots of total cell extracts. Coprecipitation of SH3BP1 with several other
major components of tight and adherens junctions was not observed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201202094/DC1" id="supp17">Fig. S5,

colocalize at established and forming cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, C and D</xref>) and in EGF-induced dorsal ruffles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 E</xref>). Complex formation did not
require EGF stimulation (Fig. S5 D), and recruitment of JACOP and CD2AP to cell
junctions was, like SH3BP1, attenuated when the EGF receptor was inhibited
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 F</xref>). Expression levels of the
GAP were affected by depletion of JACOP and CD2AP, suggesting that complex
formation may be important for stabilization of SH3BP1 (Fig. S5 E). Complex
formation was further supported by the enhanced recruitment of CD2AP and SH3BP1
to cell junctions upon overexpression of JACOP (Fig. S5 F).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>SH3BP1 forms a complex with CD2AP and the junctional scaffold

Recombinant full-length SH3BP1 as well as a fusion protein containing the

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 G</xref>). JACOP was only pulled
down by the N-terminal domain, suggesting that the recombinant full-length
protein might be in a confirmation that does not allow efficient binding. These
binding experiments suggest that SH3BP1 might serve as a bridge, linking JACOP
to CD2AP. Indeed, coprecipitation of CD2AP with JACOP required SH3BP1, whereas
depletion of CD2AP did not affect the coprecipitation efficiency of SH3BP1 with
JACOP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 H</xref>). The N-terminal domain
of SH3BP1 has recently been shown to associate with the exocyst in cells

Depletion of JACOP had the strongest effect on the lateral localization of the
other components, suggesting that it serves as the primary junctional linker of
the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 C</xref>). Depletion of
neither JACOP nor CD2AP led to the same disorganized F-actin appearance,
suggesting that disruption of the complex does not stimulate Cdc42. Indeed,
depletion of either of the two scaffolding proteins reduced Cdc42 activity
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>), indicating that loss of
normal complex formation leads to uncontrolled Cdc42 inactivation.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>CD2AP, JACOP, and CapZ are functional components of the SH3BP1

CapZÎ±1, a subunit of an F-actinâcapping protein that regulates
filopodial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mejillano et al.,
2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruck et al., 2006</xref>).
Therefore, we asked whether the SH3BP1âJACOPâparacingulin complex
contains two actin-modulating activities: a Rho GAP and an
F-actinâcapping activity. Indeed, CapZÎ±1 was detected in
precipitates of SH3BP1 and the two scaffolding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 B</xref>). CapZÎ±1 was recruited to dorsal ruffles
along with SH3BP1 in EGF-stimulated A431 cells but remained diffusely
distributed in SH3BP1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10
E</xref>). CapZÎ±1 depletion indeed disrupted formation of a
junctional actin belt and induced filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, F and G</xref>). Thus, the identified SH3BP1 complex contains two
activities that regulate the actin cytoskeleton: a GAP and a capping
activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have shown that regulation of actin-driven membrane remodeling and junction
formation requires an SH3BP1-based complex that modulates the actin cytoskeleton.
This complex can regulate two processes: Cdc42 and Rac signaling via the GAP
activity of SH3BP1 and actin polymerization via the capping activity of CapZ. It
also contains two scaffolding proteins: CD2AP, a protein that is part of the
submembrane actin cytoskeleton and binds and regulates CapZ, and JACOP, a junctional
protein that mediates subcellular targeting of SH3BP1.</p><p>Depletion of SH3BP1 did not only lead to deregulation of Cdc42, but the enhanced and
spatially deregulated activity led to the accumulation of large filopodia and a
strong reduction of actin dynamics. Hence, maintenance of actin dynamics and
morphological transitions rely not simply on Cdc42 activation but require the full
GTPase cycle. This is supported by results with dominant-negative and constitutively
active Cdc42 that both interfere with junction assembly and epithelial
differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and Fig. S1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kroschewski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rojas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruewer et al., 2004</xref>). Inactivation of Cdc42 is mainly
required to prevent excessive activation levels and maintain spatial control, as
partial depletion of Cdc42 was sufficient to counteract the effect of SH3BP1
depletion. Similarly, depletion of the GAP corrected the phenotype caused by partial
Cdc42 depletion; hence, Cdc42 seems to be the main substrate of SH3BP1 during
epithelial junction formation. Although GAPs are counteracting the function of GEFs
and, hence, are often seen as inhibiting processes while GEFs promote them, our data
show that GAPs, such as SH3BP1, are important to drive progression of complex
processes that require sequential morphological steps and cytoskeletal dynamics.</p><p>Epithelial junction formation is a complex process that involves sequential steps
starting with cell shape changes, initiation of cellâcell contacts, and
subsequent maturation to a fully differentiated apical junctional complex consisting
of tight and adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vasioukhin et
al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miyoshi and Takai,
2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson, 2009</xref>). This
sequential process requires continuous membrane remodeling driven by the actin
cytoskeleton. RhoGTPases play essential roles in these processes, and proper
regulation of RhoGTPases is required for successful junction assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braga and Yap, 2005</xref>). Our data now show that
SH3BP1 is a crucial negative regulator of RhoGTPase and, in particular, Cdc42
signaling, which is required for normal junction assembly and differentiation of
epithelial cells from different tissues, and indicate that SH3BP1 is required for
the morphological transition from early, immature cellâcell contacts to
continuous cellâcell junctions.</p><p>Epithelial differentiation seems to rely on different GAPs for Cdc42 that regulate
different steps. The Cdc42 GAP Rich1 associates with tight junctions via the
Par3â6 complex and regulates apical polarization, not junction assembly
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wells et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, epithelial
junctions recruit GAPs for Cdc42 with fundamentally different roles: SH3BP1 is
recruited early during junction formation and regulates junction assembly, whereas
Rich1 regulates polarization once junctions are assembled. Accordingly, we could not
detect a defect in junction assembly upon transfection of Rich1-targeting siRNAs in
the screen that has led to the identification of SH3BP1 (Table S1).</p><p>Although membrane dynamics underlie the initiation of cell contacts in all epithelial
models studied, different types of epithelia can make use of different mechanisms of
actin-driven processes. Although keratinocytes use filopodia, the kidney epithelial
cell line MDCK relies on lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vasioukhin
et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrlich et al.,
2002</xref>). As filopodia are induced by Cdc42, whereas lamellipodia require
Rac, different GTPases can initiate cellâcell contacts and, as they can both
regulate polarity complexes, lead to successful epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matter and Balda, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson, 2009</xref>). SH3BP1 was originally
identified as a GAP with similar activities toward Cdc42 and Rac1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cicchetti et al., 1995</xref>). This was recently
confirmed using cell-based biosensor assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parrini et al., 2011</xref>). The latter paper also demonstrated that SH3BP1
regulates Rac at the front of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parrini et al., 2011</xref>). Together with our data, this indicates that
SH3BP1 can stimulate GTP hydrolysis by both Rac and Cdc42 in vitro and in vivo and
that the activities toward both GTPases are relevant for specific biological
processes. Moreover, it could be that SH3BP1 regulates junction formation not only
in epithelia that rely on filopodia but also in those that use lamellipodia.</p><p>The observations that the GAP activity of SH3BP1 toward Rac and Cdc42 is
differentially used in specific cellular processes highlight the importance of the
subcellular targeting of the GAP. Although during migration, SH3BP1 is targeted to
the front of the cells and regulates Rac, which is active at the leading edge, it is
targeted to cellâcell contacts during junction formation and regulates Cdc42,
which is active at cell junctions. Similarly, in dorsal ruffles, SH3BP1 strongly
affects Cdc42 and, to a lesser extent, Rac1; both GTPases are stimulated during
dorsal ruffle formation. Targeting to subcellular sites that are enriched in the
active form of either Cdc42 or Rac thus seems to be a major determinant of the
GTPase selectivity of the GAP, and its activity seems to prevent the diffusion of
active GTPase away from specific sites. Complex formation seems to play a
fundamental role for junctional targeting of SH3BP1 and its function, as depletion
of JACOP and, to lesser extent, CD2AP resulted in loss of junctional SH3BP1,
deregulation of Cdc42, and inhibition of junction formation.</p><p>The SH3BP1 complex contains molecules that have different cellular roles. Two of
these proteins, JACOP and CD2AP, are scaffolding proteins that are linked to each
other by SH3BP1. JACOP, also called paracingulin, is a component of the apical
junctional complex and can bind different types of junctional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohnishi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pulimeno et al., 2011</xref>). Depletion of JACOP had a strong
effect on the junctional recruitment of SH3BP1 and CD2AP and led to a strong
reduction in Cdc42 activity, indicating that it is important for recruitment of the
complex and the control of the GAP activity of SH3BP1. In MDCK cells, JACOP has been
linked to the regulation of Rac and RhoA via two different GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guillemot et al., 2008</xref>); however, this is the
first study that links JACOP to the regulation of a GAP and of Cdc42.</p><p>CD2AP has been known to be recruited to cell junctions and is a cytoskeletal
regulator that has been linked to renal disease and slit diaphragm function, a
specialized cell junction formed by podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dustin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asanuma and
Mundel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mustonen et al.,
2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukasawa et al., 2009</xref>).
CD2AP is a regulator of actin dynamics and binds to the barbed-end binding protein
CapZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mejillano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruck et al., 2006</xref>). CapZ is also part of the
SH3BP1 complex, and its depletion induces filopodia, as has previously been
demonstrated by genetic ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mejillano et
al., 2004</xref>). CD2AP and CapZ thus provide the SH3BP1 complex with a second
cellular activity that can guide actin reorganization and membrane remodeling. Given
the link of CD2AP to renal disease, it will be important to determine whether and
how SH3BP1 and JACOP contribute to normal renal physiology and, if deregulated, play
a role in disease development. Because of its association with CapZ, we propose that
the SH3BP1 complex represents a dual activity feedback complex required for the
coordination of actin-driven morphological processes that is recruited to sites of
active membrane remodeling by the scaffolding components JACOP and CD2AP to
terminate individual steps, enabling activation of subsequent GTPase-activated
processes and junctional maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>RNAi, cDNAs, and transfection</title><p>A full-length human SH3BP1 cDNA (NM018957.3) was used to generate HA-tagged
