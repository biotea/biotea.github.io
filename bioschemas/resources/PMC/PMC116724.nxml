          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Annotations of completely sequenced genomes reveal that nearly half of the genes identified are of unknown function, and that some belong to uncharacterized gene families. To help resolve such issues, information can be obtained from the comparative analysis of homologous genes in model organisms.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>While characterizing genes from the retinitis pigmentosa locus <italic>RP26</italic> at 2q31-q33, we have identified a new gene, <italic>ORMDL1</italic>, that belongs to a novel gene family comprising three genes in humans (<italic>ORMDL1</italic>, <italic>ORMDL2</italic> and <italic>ORMDL3</italic>), and homologs in yeast, microsporidia, plants, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> urochordates and vertebrates. The human genes are expressed ubiquitously in adult and fetal tissues. The <italic>Drosophila ORMDL</italic> homolog is also expressed throughout embryonic and larval stages, particularly in ectodermally derived tissues. The <italic>ORMDL</italic> genes encode transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Double knockout of the two <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> homologs leads to decreased growth rate and greater sensitivity to tunicamycin and dithiothreitol. Yeast mutants can be rescued by human ORMDL homologs.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>From protein sequence comparisons we have defined a novel gene family, not previously recognized because of the absence of a characterized functional signature. The sequence conservation of this family from yeast to vertebrates, the maintenance of duplicate copies in different lineages, the ubiquitous pattern of expression in human and <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the partial functional redundancy of the yeast homologs and phenotypic rescue by the human homologs, strongly support functional conservation. Subcellular localization and the response of yeast mutants to specific agents point to the involvement of ORMDL in protein folding in the ER.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>The human genome project has generated raw information on an increasing number of novel genes and gene families whose function is still unknown. Positional cloning and large-scale genome analysis allow preliminary functional assignment of human genes on the basis of linkage to genetic diseases and reported information from model organisms. Although the available computational tools may fail to provide clear functional clues, they are still of great value in defining structural domains, pinpointing intra- and interspecific sequence homologies and establishing new gene families. In the human genome, a mutational approach to characterizing genes functionally is limited to patients that carry well characterized disease alleles. On the other hand, the availability of the mouse genome sequence is providing new tools for systematic functional characterization. This approach has already been used in yeast by the European Functional Analysis Network (EUROFAN) and has provided functional insights on evolutionarily conserved genes.</p>
      <p>We previously reported linkage of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (<italic>RP26</italic>) to chromosome 2q31-33, between markers D2S148 and D2S117 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Subsequent analyses narrowed the locus to the D2S350-D2S161 interval. This chromosomal region, (approximately 8 million base pairs (Mbp)) is characterized by a low percentage of G+C - basically made of L1+L2 isochores - and by sparse gene content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As no obvious positional candidates were found among known genes, an expressed sequence tag (EST) database search was undertaken to identify sequences expressed in the retina. One of the identified ESTs was homologous with two yeast open reading frames (ORFs), two predicted genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and one in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other human genomic and EST sequences. After full cDNA analyses and characterization of the corresponding genomic regions, a functional approach was undertaken. We report here a new evolutionarily conserved gene family, named <italic>ORMDL,</italic> for <italic>ORM1</italic> (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)-like genes, following the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee guidelines, and present what could be called a 'vertical' genomics approach in several model organisms. This comprises subcellular localization of the encoded proteins, expression analyses on human tissues and <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, and single and double yeast knockouts.</p>

        <title>Characterization of the full-length human <italic>ORMDL1</italic> cDNA</title>
        <p>A human retinal cDNA library was screened using a 647 base pair (bp) probe containing the WI-18706 STS (located at the <italic>RP26</italic> locus, see Materials and methods). A total of 13 positive clones were isolated, subcloned in pBluescript II KS(+), and sequenced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Eight of the clones contained an apparently complete ORF, and the other five were truncated. The 5' and 3' ends of the messages were verified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using placental RNA as template. In the 5' experiment, two extended products were detected with the same 5' end but a differentially spliced 110 bp non-coding exon. The longer RACE product started 175 bp upstream of a putative initiation codon and this 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) contained two in-frame stop codons. The shorter RACE product did not contain an in-frame stop codon. In the 3' experiment, a single extension product was detected which contained a polyadenylation signal (ATTAAA) situated 24 nucleotides 5' of the poly(A) tail. Some of the cDNA clones had an extended 3'-UTR which could be the result of the use of different polyadenylation signals further downstream. The full-length cDNA (1,092 bp) contained an ORF consisting of 462 bp, from nucleotides 176 to 637. The deduced protein chain consisted of 153 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 17.4 kDa.</p>

        <title>Characterization of <italic>ORMDL1</italic> homologs cDNAs</title>
        <p>When searching the nucleotide databases with the full-length human <italic>ORMDL1</italic> cDNA, human homologous EST sequences were identified which belonged to two separate UniGene clusters (Hs.13144 and Hs.293711). Corresponding IMAGE cDNA clones were obtained and sequenced. The deduced ORFs (denoted <italic>ORMDL2</italic> and <italic>ORMDL3</italic>) had the same size as <italic>ORMDL1.</italic> Comparison of the proteins showed between 80% and 84% positional identities (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), and 116 out of 153 amino-acid residues were conserved between the three sequences. Moreover, in 26 of the 37 remaining positions the substitutions are conservative.</p>
        <p>No homologous sequences were identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> EST databases. Screening of an adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cDNA library using the human <italic>ORMDL1</italic> cDNA as a heterologous probe was not successful either. We then designed a homologous probe based on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomic high-throughput sequence. Five positive clones were isolated and sequenced. Although none of the clones was full-length, one covered more than 80% of the ORF. The complete ORF could then be deduced by overlapping this sequence to the genomic data. The conceptual translated sequence was one amino acid longer at the amino terminus than the human forms and shared between 48% and 50% residue identities. Subsequently, in the completed <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genome Project, this sequence has appeared annotated as <italic>predicted gene CG14577</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>

      <sec>
        <title><italic>ORMDL1</italic> belongs to an evolutionarily conserved gene family</title>
        <p>The <italic>ORMDL1</italic> ORF was used for database sequence comparisons using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] (tBLASTN against nucleotide databases, and BLASTP, PSI-BLAST and PHI-BLAST against the non-redundant protein database). Homologous protein sequences were found in yeast, microsporidia (<italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi,</italic> an opportunistic pathogen in AIDS), plants (including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>), invertebrates (<italic>Drosophila</italic>), urochordates (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>) and vertebrates. The search for distant relatives using PSI-BLAST and PHI-BLAST programs and for short, nearly exact, matches (BLASTP) did not yield any additional homologs. In vertebrates, three different genes were distinguished, corresponding to <italic>ORMDL1, ORMDL2</italic> and <italic>ORMDL3. S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> showed two copies each, while a single copy was found in <italic>C. intestinalis, D. melanogaster, Saccharomyces monacensis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>E. cuniculi.</italic> Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> lists most of the genes, with their corresponding annotations in the public databases, if available, and summarizes other relevant features.</p>
        <p>When all the protein sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW, several conserved domains became evident (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In addition, all yeast proteins were longer, at both the amino- and carboxy-terminal ends. Pairwise comparisons revealed a very high level of identity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Searches for characterized functional domains did not reveal any significant homology. However, four putative transmembrane domains were detected when considering the protein alignment of all known members of the family. Similar results were obtained when analyzing the ORMDL1 sequence on its own (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p>
        <p>A phylogenetic tree using all the available protein sequences was drawn with CLUSTALW and the bootstrap values were also calculated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). According to this tree, each human <italic>ORMDL</italic> gene has an extremely conserved counterpart in all vertebrates analyzed. Vertebrate sequences cluster together in a separate branch. Similarly, yeast, microsporidian and plant ORMDLs group in well differentiated lineages.</p>

        <title>Genomic structure of the <italic>ORMDL</italic> sequences</title>
        <p>The full-length human <italic>ORMDL1</italic> cDNA clone was compared to non-redundant DNA databases and the 5' end was found to be homologous to the promoter region of the <italic>PMS1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The P1 genomic clone 1670, containing this region, was analyzed by restriction mapping and Southern blot with the <italic>ORMDL1</italic> cDNA as a probe. Positive fragments were sub-cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence contained 4.8 kilobases (kb) of the upstream region, all of the five exons, and the four introns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The third intron was not fully sequenced and the size was determined by restriction mapping after amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All introns were flanked by the consensus donor and acceptor splice sites. No putative TATA box was found on the upstream genomic sequence, although several Sp1-binding sites were detected using the TESS server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Using the EMBL CpG Islands service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] a presumptive 0.9 kb CpG island containing 0.4 kb of the upstream region, the first exon of the 5'-UTR, and parts of the first intron was detected.</p>
        <p>Database searches against releases of the public Human Genome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] confirmed the genomic <italic>ORMDL1</italic> structure. Furthermore, the genomic structures of the coding region of the two human paralogs <italic>ORMDL2</italic> and <italic>ORMDL3</italic> and the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> homolog were deduced after alignment of the characterized human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cDNAs with genomic sequence databases. For the A. <italic>thaliana ORMDL</italic> homolog, tBLASTN searches were carried out with the human ORMDL proteins against the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. The data obtained were contrasted with gene predictions from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Genome Initiative (actually, one of these predictions has already been confirmed; GenBank accession no. AF360237). In all these genes a genomic structure of three coding exons is totally conserved, including the positions of the exon-intron boundaries ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In contrast, the yeast homologs were each encoded in one single continuous ORF. Interestingly, the introns of human <italic>ORMDL2</italic> and <italic>ORMDL3</italic> genes were found to be much smaller than those of <italic>ORMDL1.</italic> The human <italic>ORMDL</italic> homologs mapped to different chromosomes from <italic>ORMDL1 (ORMDL2</italic> to 12q13.2 and <italic>ORMDL3</italic> to 17q21.1). No further human homologs were detected in the public databanks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or in the Celera database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], except for two putative processed pseudogenes. One of these showed 86% positional identity to <italic>ORMDL1</italic> and mapped to chromosome 10p14, and the other showed 84% identity to <italic>ORMDL2</italic> and mapped to 8q22.1. Both <inline-graphic xlink:href="gb-2002-3-6-research0027-i1.gif"/><italic>ORMDL1</italic> and <inline-graphic xlink:href="gb-2002-3-6-research0027-i1.gif"/><italic>ORMDL2</italic> lacked introns and appeared to have acquired several indels (insertions/deletions). In addition, <inline-graphic xlink:href="gb-2002-3-6-research0027-i1.gif"/><italic>ORMDL2</italic> lacked the first coding exon of <italic>ORMDL2.</italic></p>

        <title>Expression analysis of human <italic>ORMDL</italic> genes</title>
        <p>To study the expression pattern of human <italic>ORMDL</italic> genes, RT-PCR and northern analyses were performed. RT-PCR expression analysis on sixteen adult and fetal tissue samples showed a ubiquitous expression pattern for all three human genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). Northern analysis using full-length as well as 3'-UTR <italic>ORMDL1</italic> cDNA probes identified three transcripts of 1.4, 2.5 and 3.3 kb in most human adult tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). The expression of <italic>ORMDL1</italic> was moderately high in pancreas, placenta and brain but low in skeletal muscle and lung.</p>

        <title>Subcellular localization of human ORMDL proteins: expression of ORMDL-EGFP fusion proteins in COS-7 cells</title>
        <p>To determine the subcellular localization of the ORMDL proteins, the cDNAs corresponding to the human <italic>ORMDL</italic> genes were cloned into pEGFP-derived vectors and transiently expressed in transfected COS-7 cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, fusion proteins of enhanced green fluorescent protein and ORMDL (EGFP-ORMDL) appeared predominantly in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, to a lesser extent, throughout the extended ER network (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). Confocal scanning microscopy using an antibody against protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), an ER-marker protein, showed an overlapping signal in the endoplasmic reticulum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a,6b,6c</xref>). In contrast, double-label fluorescence with biotin-labeled concanavalin A (which shows affinity for terminal Î±-D-mannosyl and Î±-D-glucosyl residues, and thus binds to the plasma membrane in non-permeabilized cells), detected with Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin, showed no overlapping signal with EGFP-ORMDL at the plasmatic membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d,6e,6f</xref>). The subcellular patterns observed for EGFP-ORMDL1, EGFP-ORMDL2 and EGFP-ORMDL3 fusion proteins were similar, in either fixed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6g,6h,6i</xref>, respectively) or <italic>in vivo</italic> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6j,6k</xref>), co-localizing with an <italic>in vivo</italic> ER marker. Similar results were obtained from COS-7 cells transfected with either pEGFP-N2- or pEGFP-C2-derived constructs. In contrast, EGFP alone was uniformly distributed throughout the cell, including the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6l</xref>), in all experiments. Overall, these data show that the ORMDL proteins locate at the ER membrane in agreement with their predicted transmembrane topology.</p>

        <title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and larval imaginal discs</title>
        <p>We analyzed the expression pattern of the <italic>Drosophila ORMDL</italic> homolog (<italic>DORMDL</italic>) during different developmental stages. To this end, a 391 bp antisense riboprobe containing most of the coding sequence was used for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on wild-type Canton S <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> 0 h to 24 h embryos (stages 1 to 17). <italic>DORMDL</italic> was ubiquitously and homogeneously expressed in the syncytial blastoderm and during the cellularization stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a,7b</xref>). In stages 11-12, the germ-band layer (which later gives rise to all somatic cell lines, including ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) gave a positive hybridization signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7c,7d</xref>). In later stages (stage 14), the signal was mainly detected in the ectodermal tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7e</xref>). The <italic>DORMDL</italic> riboprobe was also used to analyze the expression pattern in imaginal discs in third-instar larvae. Uniform and homogeneous expression was observed in eye-antenna, leg, wing, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7g,7h,7i</xref>) and haltere (data not shown) imaginal discs, which was consistent with the former ectodermal expression detected in late-stage embryos.</p>

        <title>Yeast single and double knockouts: analysis of deletion strains</title>
        <p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome contained two members of this family: <italic>ORM1</italic> (ORF YGR038w) at chromosome VII and <italic>ORM2</italic> (ORF YLR350w) at chromosome XII. To provide functional clues for the human homologs, we generated and analyzed single and double knockouts. We used the W303-1A and W303-1B yeast wild-type strains (see genotypes in Materials and methods) and the <italic>kanMX4</italic> cassette for gene disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Single gene targetings were assessed by designing specific PCR reactions. The double knockout mutant was obtained by mating the two single knockout strains, subsequent sporulation, tetrad dissection and analysis of single spores. Verification of <italic>ORM1</italic> and <italic>ORM2</italic> gene integrity and/or deletion for the clones derived from each spore was carried out by independent PCRs with specific primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Overall, 42 independent clones were analyzed, from which 23.8% were wild-type for <italic>ORM1</italic> and <italic>ORM2</italic> (and thus did not grow on G418-supplemented medium), 28.57% single <italic>ORM1</italic> deletants, 28.57% single <italic>ORM2</italic> deletants, 14.28% double knockouts and 4.76% diploids. The two single and double knockouts were viable and no morphological differences were detected between them and the wild-type cells. However, growth rates on rich media (YPD) differed: the double mutant grew much slower than the wild-type and single-knockout strains (data not shown).</p>
        <p>A battery of tests was carried out to characterize the yeast mutants on the basis of their sensitivity or resistance to toxic compounds. The YPAD medium was supplemented with one of the following: dithiothreitol (DTT), tunicamycin, HgCl<sub>2</sub>, cycloheximide, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, KCl, caffeine, EGTA or SDS. In all cases the double-knockout strain was more sensitive to the toxic agent. In contrast, the growth of the single knockouts did not differ from that of the wild-type strain. This result was particularly evident in the plates supplemented with DTT, HgCl<sub>2</sub> or tunicamycin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b,8c</xref>). We also carried out complementation analyses with <italic>ORMDL3,</italic> the human counterpart with the greatest sequence similarity to yeast <italic>ORM1</italic> and <italic>ORM2.</italic> To this end, double-knockout yeast cells were transformed with either multicopy or centromeric expression vectors bearing <italic>ORMDL3</italic> under the control of a constitutive promoter, and dropout-plated in media supplemented with DTT, HgCl<sub>2</sub> or tunicamycin. In all cases, some degree of phenotypic rescue was clearly observed, further arguing in favor of functional conservation in the <italic>ORMDL</italic> family (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8c</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report here the characterization of a novel gene family highly conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals. Most of the species studied have more than one member of this gene family: <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and A. <italic>thaliana</italic> each contain two <italic>ORMDL</italic> genes, whereas three copies are present in vertebrates. On the other hand, <italic>Encephalitozoon, Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Ciona</italic> appear to contain a single <italic>ORMDL</italic> gene and no homologous sequence was found in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans.</italic></p>
      <p>While this work was being carried out, many of the family members became incorporated in the genomic databases of the corresponding organisms, some only as predicted genes. However, even after a significant number of sequences had been annotated, the family had not been formally defined. This omission most probably reflects the fact that present annotations of gene families rely on previously characterized functional signatures or domains. In their absence, protein sequence comparisons remain as the only valuable tool.</p>
      <p>A phylogenetic tree was constructed to study the evolutionary relationships between the <italic>ORMDL</italic> members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Several gene duplication events have taken place independently in different lineages, and have given rise to multiple copies in most of the species analyzed. The three human paralogs (<italic>ORMDL1, ORMDL2</italic> and <italic>ORMDL3</italic>) showed amino-acid identities of around 80%, whereas pairwise comparisons revealed more than 95% identity between human and mouse orthologs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Recently, genomic data derived from the complete genome sequence of the pufferfish <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], cDNA annotation data in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and EST data collected from several vertebrate EST projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] support the evidence that the presence of three <italic>ORMDL</italic> genes - as characterized in humans - is common to all vertebrates. In addition, a single-copy <italic>ORMDL</italic> has been identified in the pre-vertebrate urochordate <italic>C. intestinalis.</italic> Overall, these data support the evidence that vertebrate <italic>ORMDL</italic> genes are true orthologs, probably arising by the postulated large-scale duplications, either genome doublings or extensive chromosomal duplications, in the vertebrate ancestry ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and references therein). In the human genome, the three <italic>ORMDL</italic> genes map within the large paralogous regions defined at 2q, 12q and 17q, which also include segments of chromosomes 7 and 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These regions contain the HOX clusters as well as two to four members of other families: <italic>ORMDL1</italic> and HOXD at 2q31-32; <italic>ORMDL2</italic> and HOXC at 12q13, and <italic>ORMDL3</italic> and HOXB at 17q21. Moreover, the HOX clusters in mammals are located within chromosomal regions that have maintained extensive chromosomal synteny throughout the vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. No further <italic>ORMDL</italic> sequences were found next to HOXA at 7p15 but, in this context, loss of a fourth copy is a feasible assumption.</p>
      <p>In invertebrates, one <italic>ORMDL</italic> gene has been characterized in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> Although no sequence with amino-acid identities above 30% has been found in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> it is possible that a homolog will be identified as the worm genome assembly is completed. Alternatively, it could be argued that <italic>ORMDL</italic> may have been lost in the phylogenetic lineage that leads to the nematode, as has happened with some genes involved in developmental pathways, which are broadly represented in animal phylogeny but missing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>In plants, different lineages show duplicated copies of <italic>ORMDL</italic> genes: the Solanaceae <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> (tomato) and <italic>Solarium tuberosum</italic> (potato; data not shown), the grasses <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> (sorghum) and <italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize; data not shown), and the brassica <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> The two gene sequences found in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and yeast are consistent either with the postulated genome duplications or large-scale segmental duplications in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, the yeast <italic>ORM1</italic> and <italic>ORM2</italic> are located within duplicated chromosomal blocks in chromosomes VII and XII, respectively, which include 15 other paralogous gene pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>Protein alignment showed extended amino-terminal segments of around 20-60 amino acid residues for the yeast ORM proteins in comparison to the plant and animal forms. The conserved residues were mostly clustered in the middle segment of the protein chain. Transmembrane (TM) segment prediction yielded from two to four TM domains, (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When using aligned sequences, four hydrophobic domains were apparent, and in most programs were recognized as putative TM sequences. Interestingly, the TM domains are conserved in their relative position but are much less conserved at the residue level than their flanking segments. In fact, the most conserved amino-acid segments are flanked by the two central hydrophobic domains, and probably indicate the location of an important functional domain. Whether this region is relevant to the reported association of yeast ORM2 with SLT2, a serine/threonine protein kinase of the MAP kinase family, remains to be proved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Unfortunately, the reported interaction, from a comprehensive yeast proteome-wide two-hybrid analysis, has not been substantiated with further experimental data. In accordance with the TM prediction, subcellular localization using GFP fusion proteins showed ER anchorage of the human ORMDL proteins. Although co-localization with PDI was used to verify the ER-staining pattern, one cannot discard the possibility that overexpression could influence protein folding and trafficking. Further experiments to characterize protein topology are underway. Searches for signal peptides, nuclear-localization signals, protease-cleavage sites and conserved protein domains were also carried out but did not yield any significant similarities.</p>
      <p>Human <italic>ORMDL</italic> homologs were ubiquitously expressed in adult and fetal samples with some minor tissue-specific differences. There was no evidence of alternative splicing affecting the coding region. However, the northern-blot analysis of <italic>ORMDL1</italic> revealed three transcripts of different size, which may be explained by the use of either different promoters or polyadenylation signals, and/or by alternative splicing affecting only the 5'- or 3'-UTRs. In fact, an alternative exon in the 5'-UTR of <italic>ORMDL1</italic> is reported here.</p>
      <p>Functional characterization of gene homologs in model organisms is an invaluable reference for investigating human genes with unknown function. In this respect, <italic>Drosophila</italic> is particularly informative when mutant strains for a specific gene are available. Unfortunately, neither P-element insertions next to <italic>DORMDL</italic> nor information on gene expression were available. Our data from <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis in different developmental stages and imaginal discs showed ubiquitous expression at early embryonic stages, although at late stages the signal was stronger in the ectodermally derived tissues. Overall, these data support a basic cellular function for this gene family.</p>
      <p>The search for additional functional clues prompted us to construct and analyze single and double yeast knockouts. Partial functional redundancy of the two yeast genes was deduced, as single mutants were viable and showed similar responses to the wild-type strain in sensitivity/resistance assays to toxic compounds. Deletion of both genes was not lethal, although yeast-cell growth and ability to respond to chemical aggression were partially affected in double knockouts. It is well known that DTT, a reducing agent that impairs disulfide bond formation, or tunicamycin, a glycosylation inhibitor that blocks the first step in the biosynthesis of <italic>N</italic>-linked oligosaccharides, induce the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. The cellular response to this type of stress (the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway) eventually leads to the activation of several ER-resident protein chaperons and chaperon cofactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Given the ER-membrane localization of the ORMDL proteins and the higher sensitivity of the double knockouts to both tunicamycin and DTT, it is reasonable to postulate that these proteins participate in correct protein folding and/or trafficking in the ER, or are involved in the cellular UPR. Interestingly, phenotypic rescue of the double-knockout mutants was achieved by functional complementation with a human homolog, thus clearly supporting functional as well as structural evolutionary conservation of this gene family.</p>
      <p>In summary, this study defines a novel eukaryotic gene family whose function is not yet clear. Several questions should be addressed in the future. They mainly concern protein topology, the cellular function of the family members and their association, if any, to human disease.</p>

Transient transfections on COS-7 cells grown on coverslips were performed using the FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's protocol (the ratio was 1.5 Î¼g DNA to 7.5 Î¼l FuGENE). Empty pEGFP-N2 and pEGFP-C2 vectors were used as controls. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were rinsed with 100 mM PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4Â°C for 45 min, then washed and permeabilized (if required) with 0.1% Triton X-100/20 mM glycine/10 mM PBS for 10 min.

Primer design and PCR conditions essentially followed the EUROFAN guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p>

        <title>Generation of yeast double knockouts</title>
        <p>The W303-1A Îorm1 (MAT<bold>a</bold>) and W303-1B Îorm2 (<italic>MATÎ±</italic>) deletant strains were crossed to obtain the double heterozygous diploid strain. The reciprocal cross was also performed. The double heterozygous diploids were plated on sporulation medium (1% potassium acetate, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.05% dextrose, 2% agar) to induce meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Tetrad dissection and analysis were carried out as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Clones from spores were re-streaked on YPD plates containing 200 mg/l G418, and G418-resistant transformants were verified by colony PCR to assess single and double knockouts.</p>

        <title>Qualitative phenotypic analysis of knockout strains</title>
        <p>To test growth differences and sensitivity/resistance of the mutant strains against toxic compounds, single and double knockouts as well as wild-type clones were grown on liquid yeast extract peptone adenine dextrose (YPAD) medium for 14 h at 30Â°C, diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.1 and grown to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.6-0.8. They were then sequentially diluted (5 dilutions, 1:5 each) with YPAD into the wells of microtiter plates and dropout-plated onto the corresponding test media (0.25 mM and 0.4 mM HgCl<sub>2</sub>; 10 mM and 15 mM DTT; 0.5 Î¼g/ml and 1 Î¼g/ml tunicamycin; 0.7 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>; 0.1% caffeine; 0.18 mg/ml and decreasing concentrations of cycloheximide; 3 mM EGTA; 1.5 M KCl; 0.01% SDS, all in YPAD). To test heat sensitivity, cultures were incubated in a water bath at 52Â°C for 35 min, sequentially diluted and plated on YPAD. We analyzed five independent clones for each mutant strain and three for each wild type, respectively.</p>

        <title>Functional complementation assay with human <italic>ORMDL3</italic> in yeast double knockouts</title>
        <p>A yeast centromeric plasmid, pSC16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] (kindly provided by S. Cervantes), and a non-centromeric plasmid (pVT-U) containing the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter and termination expression cassettes were used to clone human <italic>ORMDL3</italic> ORF. Each construct (100 ng) was used to transform yeast W303 Î<italic>orm1</italic> Î<italic>orm2</italic> strain by the lithium acetate method. Transformed yeast cells were recovered by selection on minimal synthetic dropout (SD) medium without leucine (centromeric plasmid) or without uracil (non-centromeric plasmid). Transformants were grown on liquid YPAD, sequentially diluted and dropout-plated onto the corresponding test media (0.25 mM and 0.4 mM HgCl<sub>2</sub>; 10 mM and 15 mM DTT; 0.5 Î¼g/ml and 1 Î¼g/ml tunicamycin, all in YPAD).</p>
