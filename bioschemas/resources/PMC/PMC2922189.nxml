          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is one of many viruses that exploits and modifies the cellular ubiquitin system. HSV-2 expresses the tegument protein UL56 that has been implicated in cytoplasmic transport and/or release of virions, and is a putative regulatory protein of Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase. In order to elucidate the biological function of UL56, this study examined the interaction of UL56 with the Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligase Itch and its role in the regulation of Itch. Additionally, we assessed the similarity between UL56 and regulatory proteins of Itch and Nedd4, Nedd4-family-interactins proteins (Ndfip).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>UL56 interacted with Itch, independent of additional viral proteins, and mediated more striking degradation of Itch, compared to Nedd4. Moreover, it was suggested that the lysosome pathway as well as the proteasome pathway was involved in the degradation of Itch. Other HSV-2 proteins with PY motifs, such as VP5 and VP16, did not mediate the degradation of endogenous Itch. Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 were similar in subcellular distribution patterns to UL56 and colocalized with UL56 in co-transfected cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>We believe that this is the first report demonstrating the interaction of a HSV-specific protein and Itch. Thus, UL56 could function as a regulatory protein of Itch. The mechanism, function and significance of regulating Itch in HSV-2 infection remain unclear and warrant further investigation.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Viruses act as intracellular parasites, depending heavily on functions provided by their host cells, and have evolved diverse strategies to exploit the biology and biochemistry of hosts for their benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The ubiquitin system is one of the mechanisms exploited by many viruses; it is involved in viral assembly and release, viral transcriptional regulation, viral immune invasion, and the suppression of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The ubiquitin system is a key regulatory mechanism for a diversity of cellular processes including protein turnover, protein sorting and trafficking, signal transduction, and cell-cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Ubiquitination is executed by a hierarchical cascade of enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. E3 ubiquitin ligases act as major specificity determinants of the ubiquitin system by facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to lysine residues of the target proteins. The human genome encodes more than 600 putative E3 ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which generate the diversity in the ubiquitin system. E3 ligases are classified into two main groups: really interesting novel genes (RING) and homologous to E6AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) proteins. The neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4 (Nedd4) family, comprised of nine members, is one of the main HECT E3 protein families.</p>
      <p>Viruses encode their own E3 ligases, de-ubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and adaptor/regulatory proteins to modify the host's ubiquitin system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a large, enveloped, double-stranded-DNA virus, which can cause various mild and life-threatening diseases, including herpes labialis, genital herpes, keratitis, encephalitis, and neonatal herpes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. HSV encodes a ubiquitin ligase (ICP0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and a DUB (UL36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, we identified that the HSV type 2 (HSV-2) tegument protein UL56 is a putative regulatory protein of Nedd4 E3 ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], specifically involved in protein stability and subcellular localization. UL56 induces phosphorylation of Nedd4 and promotes the proteasome-mediated degradation by increasing ubiquitination of Nedd4, however UL56 itself is not ubiquitinated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. UL56 relocates Nedd4 primarily to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and partially to endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>Approximately half of the 74 genes encoded by HSV are accessory genes that are not essential for viral replication in cell-culture system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. <italic>UL56 </italic>gene is an accessory gene encoded by most members of the Alphaherpesvirinae family (References are listed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). Interestingly, UL56-deficient HSV-1 is substantially less neuroinvasive in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], although little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the attenuation. Previously, we have shown that UL56 deficiency reduces the titer of extracellular HSV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These data suggest that UL56 facilitates the cytoplasmic transport of virions from the TGN to the plasma membrane and/or the release of virions. In addition, we found that UL56 interacts with two other proteins: KIF1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the neuron-specific kinesin; and HSV-2 UL11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a tegument protein that has dynamic membrane-trafficking properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and plays a role in the envelopment and egress of viral nucleocapsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These interactions also support the view that UL56 is involved in transports of vesicles and virions, however the precise roles and functions of UL56 remain elusive.</p>
      <p>UL56 is a 235 amino acid (aa), carboxyl-terminal anchored, type II membrane protein that is predicted to be inserted into the viral envelope so that the amino-terminal domain is located in the virion tegument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In this topology, UL56 is predicted to have a 216 aa cytoplasmic domain containing three PPXY (PY) motifs, which are important for its interaction with Nedd4 E3 ligase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p>

          <p><bold>HSV infection causes a marked decrease of Itch in the presence of UL56</bold>. (A) Schematic representation of Itch and UL56. Itch (862 aa) contains a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/lipid binding C2 domain, four WW domains that interact with PY motifs, and a catalytic HECT domain. HSV UL56 (HSV-1, 234 aa; HSV-2, 235 aa) contains three PY motifs and a predicted transmembrane domain (TMD). (B) Infection with wild-type (HSV-1; F, HSV-2; 186) and various mutant HSV (HSV-1; US3-deletion mutant R7041, UL13 deletion mutant R7356, Î³<sub>1</sub>34.5-deletion mutant R3616, HSV-2; US3-deletion mutant L1BR1, UL56-reverted virus ÎUL56Zrev), but not infection with UL56-deficient HSV (HSV-1; HF10, HSV-2; ÎUL56Z), caused a marked decrease of Itch. Vero cells were mock-infected or infected with wild-type or mutant viruses and harvested at 24 hpi. Nedd4 changed only in cells infected with HSV-2 viruses except ÎUL56Z. WWP2, another Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligase, showed no remarkable change. (C-D) Itch decreases as HSV-2 infection proceeds in Vero, HEp-2 (C), and HaCaT (C, D) cells. Wild-type (186) and ÎUL56Zrev infection caused a marked decrease of Itch. In ÎUL56Z-infected cells, Itch was maintained at almost constant levels for up to 12 hpi. (D) VP5 and VP16 were detected similarly in cells infected with all three viruses. Î±-tubulin or Î²-actin were used as loading controls.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In a previous study, Itch, a Nedd4-family ligase, was identified as a UL56-interacting protein by a yeast two-hybrid screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Itch is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, and Itch-deficient mice develop a systemic and progressive autoimmune disease that proves lethal beginning at 6 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Itch is composed of 862 aa with a domain architecture similar to other Nedd4-family ligases: an amino-terminal C2 domain; four protein-protein interacting WW domains, which most commonly recognize PY motifs of binding proteins; and a carboxyl terminal catalytic HECT domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Itch targets numerous proteins and has been implicated in signal transduction, endocytosis, differentiation, and transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p>
      <p>The catalytic activities of Nedd4-family ligases are in part regulated by some PY-motif containing membrane proteins such as Nedd4-family-interacting protein-1 (Ndfip1), -2 (Ndfip2), and Nedd4-binding partner 1 (N4BP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], although the mechanisms regulating the catalytic activity of Nedd4-family ligases have not been clearly defined. Ndfip proteins function as regulatory proteins of multiple Nedd4-family ligases, including Itch and Nedd4, by recruiting ligases to substrates and controlling ligase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, to elucidate the biological function of UL56 we studied the kinetics of Itch expression in HSV-2-infected cells, and also assessed the similarity between UL56 and Ndfip proteins.</p>

HaCaT cells (human keratinocyte cell line) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] were kindly provided by Dr. Norbert E Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). HaCaT cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Cell lines constitutively expressing GFP-UL56 (Vero-GFP-UL56) or GFP (Vero-GFP) were constructed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Briefly, Vero cells were transfected with pEGFP-UL56 or pEGFP-N3 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and selected with G418 (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). The expression of GFP-UL56 or GFP was verified with Western blot analysis and Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Vero-GFP-UL56 and Vero-GFP were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 8% calf serum (CS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, and 350 Î¼g/ml G418.

        <title>HSV infection causes a marked decrease of Itch in the presence of UL56</title>
        <p>Initially, we investigated the kinetics of Itch expression after HSV infection. Itch was markedly decreased in Vero cells infected with wild-type and various mutant HSV that expressed UL56, but not UL56-deficient mutants (HSV-1, HF10; HSV-2, ÎUL56Z) at 24 h post-infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Itch showed no decrease in cells infected with HF10, and remained at detectable level in cells infected with ÎUL56Z. Nedd4 was detected in two forms with different electrophoretic mobilities and had decreased levels in cells infected with HSV-2 viruses except ÎUL56Z, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, WWP2, another Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligase, which has been also identified as a UL56-interacting protein by a yeast two-hybrid screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], showed no remarkable change after viral infection. In time-course experiments, Itch decreased markedly as the infection with wild-type (186) or UL56-reverted (ÎUL56Zrev) viruses in multiple cell lines: Vero, HEp-2 and HaCaT cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In ÎUL56Z-infected cells, Itch was maintained at almost constant levels for up to 12 h post-infection whereas slightly decreased at 24 h post-infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). Thus, HSV infection causes a decrease of Itch, and HSV-1 and -2 UL56 have a prominent role in the process. In addition, the small decrease of Itch in cells infected with ÎUL56Z suggests the presence of additional viral factors responsible for the decrease of Itch in the course of HSV-2 infection.</p>

        <title>UL56 causes the decrease of intrinsic Itch in the absence of other viral proteins</title>
        <p>We next investigated whether UL56 causes the decrease of Itch without other HSV-2 proteins using stable UL56 transfected cells (Vero-GFP-UL56). Vero-GFP-UL56 was similar in morphology and growth properties to GFP-expressing Vero cells (Vero-GFP) that were used as a control (data not shown). Itch was markedly decreased in Vero-GFP-UL56 compared to control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast, WWP2 and Nedd4 showed relatively no decrease in Vero-GFP-UL56. These data suggest that UL56 specifically decreases Itch in the absence of any other viral proteins. We have previously reported that transient overexpression of UL56 caused the decrease of exogenous Nedd4 but had no apparent effect on endogenous Nedd4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This discrepancy may be due to the relatively low transfection efficiency (approx. 20%) in the previous study.</p>

Lysates from Vero, Vero-GFP-UL56, or Vero-GFP cells were analyzed for Itch and other Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligases. Itch was markedly decreased in Vero-GFP-UL56 cells. (B) VP5 did not decrease endogenous Itch. Vero cells were transfected with plasmids encoding VP5 (pcDNA-VP5) or control plasmids (pcDNA3.1(+)). The levels of Itch did not change in cells transfected with pcDNA-VP5. (C) VP5 and VP16, but not ICP0, caused the decrease of exogenous Itch. Vero cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Itch (pcDNA-Itch) and plasmids encoding a viral protein (pMyc-ICP0, pcDNA-VP5, or pcDNA-VP16) or control plasmids (pCMV-Myc or pcDNA3.1(+)). The levels of Itch decreased in cells transfected with pcDNA-VP5 or pcDNA-VP16. (D) Overexpression of Itch has no effect on the protein levels of VP5, VP16, or ICP0. Vero cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding a viral protein (pMyc-ICP0, pcDNA-VP5 or pcDNA-VP16) and either pcDNA-Itch or control plasmids (pcDNA-3.1(+)). The levels of viral proteins did not change with the overexpression of Itch. Î²-actin was used as a loading control.</p>

        <p>We further explored other possible HSV-2 proteins involved in the decrease of Itch. HSV-1 and -2 genomes encode four proteins with PY motif(s): VP5, a major capsid protein, with one motif; VP16, a tegument protein which activates the transcription of immediately early gene, with one motif; ICP0, a promiscuous transactivator, with one motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; and UL56, a tegument protein with three motifs. None of the three viral proteins with one PY motif (VP5, VP16, ICP0) decreased endogenous Itch (data for VP5 is shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), whereas VP5 and VP16 caused the decrease of overexpressed Itch in co-expressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These results indicated that VP5 and VP16 modulate the protein level of overexpressed Itch in the absence of other viral proteins.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, overexpression of Itch did not affect the level of VP5, VP16, or ICP0 in co-expressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In infection experiments, both VP5 and VP16 were detected at the same level in cells infected with 186 and those infected with ÎUL56Z despite the substantially different level of Itch expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These results suggest that VP5 and VP16 induce the decrease of overexpressed Itch although Itch has no apparent effect on VP5, VP16, or ICP0 levels.</p>

        <title>UL56 promotes lysosome- and proteasome-mediated degradation of Itch</title>
        <p>To clarify the mechanism by which the protein levels of Itch were decreased, we investigated the stability of Itch in the presence of inhibitors. The treatment of uninfected cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexemide (CHX, 100 Î¼g/ml) for 24 h did not alter the level of Itch (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), indicating that Itch is very stable in nature. In HSV-2-infected cells, the decrease of Itch was greatly blocked by chloroquine (CQ, 100 Î¼M), a lysosome inhibitor, and only partially blocked by MG132 (10 Î¼M), a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that Itch may be degraded by the lysosome pathway and in part by the proteasome pathway in HSV-2-infected cells. The decrease of Itch in Vero-GFP-UL56 cells was also blocked by CQ and partially by MG132 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Therefore, UL56 possibly promotes the degradation of Itch via the lysosome and proteasome in HSV-2-infected cells and UL56-expressing cells. In Vero-GFP-UL56 cells, the amount of GFP-UL56 was increased significantly by the addition of MG132 and CQ, suggesting that UL 56 is degraded together with Itch in this case.</p>

        <p>We next investigated whether UL56 and Itch interact. Co-immunoprecipitation assay using anti-Itch antibody revealed that UL56 was associated with Itch in cells infected with wild-type HSV-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and cells stably expressing UL56 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These results indicate that UL56 interacts with Itch during HSV-2 infection and that no other viral proteins are required for the interaction.

        <p>Confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed the colocalization of UL56 and Itch in HSV-2-infected cells and transiently UL56-expressing cells. Myc-tagged Itch (Myc-Itch) was mainly distributed throughout the cytoplasm with partial vesicular distribution in uninfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, top left panel). The Myc-Itch showed reduced signal intensity and altered subcellular distribution after 6 hpi, concomitant with UL56 detection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, middle and bottom panels). Myc-Itch accumulated in the perinuclear region with punctate distribution and colocalized with UL56 at 6 hpi and 9 hpi. These results support the view that Itch interacts with UL56, and decreases during HSV-2 infection. Co-expression with UL56 also reduced signal intensity and altered the distribution of Myc-Itch (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>); Myc-Itch showed the clear vesicular distribution and colocalized with UL56. These results highlight that UL56 interacts directly with Itch and causes Itch to decrease even without other viral proteins.</p>

        <title>siRNA knockdown of Itch has no apparent effect on the growth of either wild-type or UL56-deficient HSV-2</title>
        <p>To assess the role of Itch in HSV-2 replication, the effect of Itch knockdown on the efficiency of viral growth in Vero cells was measured. Itch protein levels were efficiently and specifically down-regulated by Itch siRNA (siItch) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Wild-type viruses showed similar growth kinetics in siCont-treated cells and siItch-treated cells both in multiple- (MOI 0.003, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) and single- (MOI 3, data not shown) growth experiments. ÎUL56Z also showed similar growth kinetics in siCont- and siItch-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Additionally, a major capsid protein VP5 and tegument proteins, VP16 and UL56, showed similar expression patterns in siCont- and siItch-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Thus, the knockdown of Itch did not influence the replication of wild-type and UL56-deficient HSV-2 in Vero cells.</p>

        <title>HSV-2 UL56 colocalizes with Ndfip proteins</title>
        <p>Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 are small membrane proteins with multiple PY motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) that regulate Nedd4 family ligases including Itch and Nedd4 by directly controlling ligase activity and relocating ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To provide evidence of similarity between UL56 and Ndfip proteins, we investigated whether UL56 and Ndfip proteins colocalize in HSV-2-infected cells and cells co-expressing UL56 and a Ndfip protein. EGFP-tagged-Ndfip1 (Ndfip1-EGFP) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) and -Ndfip2 (Ndfip2-EGFP) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) showed vesicular distribution with accumulation to the perinuclear space, consistent with results of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study demonstrates that HSV-2 UL56 interacts with the Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligase Itch, and moreover, targets Itch for degradation primarily via the lysosome pathway and partially via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the course of HSV-2 infection. UL56 interacted with Itch and induced the degradation of Itch independent of any other viral proteins. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that an HSV protein interacts with Itch. In addition, UL56 and Ndfip proteins, regulatory proteins of Nedd4 and Itch, showed similar subcellular distribution and colocalized.</p>
      <p>Itch differed from Nedd4, another UL56-interacting E3 ligase, in the following aspects: Itch decreased in both HSV-1-infected cells and HSV-2-infected cells, whereas Nedd4 decreased only in HSV-2-infected cells; endogenous Itch was degraded much more efficiently than Nedd4 in UL56-expressing cells; Itch was degraded primarily by the lysosome pathway whereas Nedd4 was degraded by the proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; and Itch was co-immunoprecipitated with a major tegument protein VP16 whereas Nedd4 was not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. UL56 caused more striking changes in Itch than in Nedd4 as a whole. The distinct effects of UL56 on Itch and Nedd4 support the view that each of Nedd4-family ligases is regulated in the specific way in spite of sharing many common properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. HSV-1 UL56 (234 aa) and HSV-2 UL56 (235 aa) share three PY motifs and one C-terminal transmembrane domain, and exhibit 62.6% identity on the amino acid level. UL56 itself and/or other viral proteins could account for the different effect of HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Nedd4 and Itch.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, UL56 is the first example of a protein which induces Itch to degrade except Itch itself. Itch is regulated by multiple mechanisms: phosphorylation mediated by Jun amino-terminal kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and Fyn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; conformational change and relocation induced by adaptor/regulatory proteins (Ndfip-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and -2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and N4BP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]); and modulation of the level of Itch ubiquitination mediated by Itch itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], FAM/USP9X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and Akt1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Little has been done to clarify how Itch degradation is controlled because of its high stability, and moreover, the limited results obtained so far are controversial. One report showed that autoubiquitinated Itch is degraded by the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], however others showed Itch is very stable even in polyubiquitinated state, and the level of ubiquitination has no discernible impact on Itch stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. UL56 originally induced Itch to degrade via primarily the lysosome and partially the proteasome pathways. From the view point of the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, this result concurs with the report which showed ubiquitinated proteins can undergo lysosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In addition, a proteasome inhibitor blocked the degradation at 12 hpi but not at 24 hpi, whereas a lysosome inhibitor blocked both at 12 and 24 hpi. These data suggest that the degradation pathway could change during the course of HSV-2 infection.</p>
      <p>Of the three viral proteins with PY motif(s) other than UL56, only VP16 was detected in the Itch-immunoprecipitates, albeit at a much lower level than UL56. VP16 is a tegument protein which activates viral transcription of immediate early genes after infection and plays an essential role during assembly in the late phase of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. VP16 interacts with multiple envelope- and tegument- proteins including UL36 (VP1/2), and appears to function in linking the outer tegument/glycoprotein and capsid/inner tegument complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. UL36 is a large inner tegument protein with the deubiquitinating activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and required for the addition of VP16 to the viral capsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It is noteworthy that VP16 associates with Itch, a cellular E3 ligase, and also with UL36, a viral DUB.</p>
      <p>We explored the possibility that additional viral proteins mediated the decrease of Itch, since there was a small decrease in cells infected with UL56-deficient HSV-2. Two of three HSV-2 proteins with one PY motif other than UL56, VP5 and VP16 caused the decrease of overexpressed Itch in co-expressing cells. In contrast, ICP0, a viral component with promiscuous transactivity and ubiquitin ligase activity, did not influence Itch expression. These results indicate that only specific viral proteins with PY motifs are capable of inducing Itch degradation. In addition, transient expressions of VP5 and VP16 caused no decrease of endogenous Itch, whereas stable expression of UL56 caused the striking decrease of endogenous Itch. These results support the notion that UL56 plays a prime role, and VP5 and VP16 can play secondary roles in the decrease of Itch during HSV-2 infection. The reason why UL56-deficient HSV-1 did not cause the decrease of Itch remains unknown.</p>
      <p>The experiments with inhibitors provided insights into the mechanism of UL56 degradation. Treatment with a lysosome inhibitor caused the increase of UL56 in cells stably expressing UL56. This result suggests that UL56 is also degraded via the lysosome pathway in UL56-expressing cells. Interestingly, treatment with a proteasome inhibitor also caused the increase of UL56, although the effect was minimal, suggesting that the proteasome pathway is also involved in UL56 degradation. Given that UL56 is lysine-free and not ubiquitinated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], some additional factors may be involved in the degradation of UL56. In this study, we used only one lysosome-inhibitor and one-proteasome-inhibitor, and did not analyze ubiquitinated substrates or free ubiquitin. Further investigation is needed concerning the turnover of UL56.</p>
      <p>We also investigated whether Itch can change the protein levels of VP5, VP16, and ICP0 because they contain a PY motif and also lysine residues, which are targets of ubiquitination. Contrary to expectations, overexpression of Itch did not affect the level of VP5, VP16, or ICP0, and knockdown of Itch did not change the expression patterns of VP5 and VP16 during the course of infection. Thus, the levels of these three viral proteins do not appear to be regulated by Itch.</p>
      <p>siRNA knockdown of Itch has no apparent effect on the growth of either wild-type or UL56-deficient HSV-2 in Vero cells. Itch is reported to be involved in viral replication and pathogenicity in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which belongs to Gammaherpesvirinae family, and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV). Itch interacts with latent membrane protein (LMP) 2A of EBV and down-regulates LMP2A activity in B-cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], and rescues a release-deficient MoMLV independent of PY motif of the Gag protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. More investigations are needed to elucidate how the decrease of Itch is involved in the replication and pathogenicity of HSV-2.</p>
      <p>UL56 and Ndfip proteins share some common features: small membrane proteins (Ndfip1, 221 aa; Ndfip2, 336 aa; and UL56, 234 aa); contain multiple PY motifs in the cytoplasmic domains (Ndfip1, two; Ndfip2 and UL56, three); interaction with Nedd4 and Itch via PY motifs; and relocate Nedd4 and Itch for degradation. This study revealed that UL56 and Ndfip proteins are similar in their subcellular localization. In co-expressing cells, UL56 and Ndfip proteins colocalized to the vesicles. UL56 localized primarily the TGN and early endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], while Ndfip proteins localized to the TGN, early endosomes, and late endosomes/multi vesicular bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The partial colocalization of UL56 and either Ndfip-1 or -2 in infected cells suggests that UL56 and Ndfip proteins behave similarly during the course of HSV infection. It is interesting that the viral protein UL56 shares so many properties with cellular regulatory proteins of Itch and Nedd4.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study demonstrates that HSV-2 UL56 interacts with a Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligase Itch, and moreover, relocates Itch and induces Itch to degrade in the course of HSV-2 infection. UL56 caused more striking changes in Itch than in Nedd4 as a whole. In addition, UL56 shared multiple common properties with Ndfip proteins. In light of these results, we propose that UL56 functions as a regulatory protein of Itch. The mechanism, function and significance of regulating Itch in HSV-2 infection remain unclear and warrant further investigation.</p>
