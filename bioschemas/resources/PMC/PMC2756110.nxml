      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Organized neuronal firing is critical for cortical processing and is disrupted in schizophrenia. Using 5â RACE in human brain, we identified a primate-specific isoform (3.1) of the K<sup>+</sup>-channel <italic>KCNH2</italic> that modulates neuronal firing. <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> mRNA levels are comparable to <italic>KCNH2-1A</italic> in brain, but 1000-fold lower in heart. In schizophrenic hippocampus, <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> expression is 2.5-fold greater than <italic>KCNH2-1A</italic>. A meta-analysis of 5 clinical samples (367 families, 1158 unrelated cases, 1704 controls) shows association of SNPs in <italic>KCNH2</italic> with schizophrenia. Risk-associated alleles predict lower IQ scores and speed of cognitive processing, altered memory-linked fMRI signals, and increased <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> expression in post-mortem hippocampus. <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> lacks a domain critical for slow channel deactivation. Overexpression of <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> in primary cortical neurons induces a rapidly deactivating K<sup>+</sup> current and a high-frequency, non-adapting firing pattern. These results identify a novel <italic>KCNH2</italic> channel involved in cortical physiology, cognition, and psychosis, providing a potential new psychotherapeutic drug target.</p>

    <p id="P2">A major challenge in modern medicine is to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying common mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, which involve complex genetic and environmental determinants<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Prevailing etiological hypotheses maintain that the interaction of multiple genetic factors with each other and with environmental risk factors results in neurodevelopmental abnormalities predisposing to illness later in life<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Given this complexity, together with imprecise and differing definitions of phenotype, it is not surprising that statistical association studies to identify risk genes for schizophrenia have not enjoyed unanimous replication<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Gene identification for complex polygenic disorders, such as schizophrenia, will likely require demonstration that risk variants impact on the biology of the gene in a manner that converges on important aspects of the biology of the illness<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Indeed, this approach has proven important in a number of complex genetic disorders, such as adult onset diabetes, in which multiple genes each account for only a very small share of risk but show stronger effects on related intermediate phenotypes even in normal subjectsâ e.g body mass index<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> or glucose induced insulin release<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Potential biologic intermediate phenotypes related to risk for schizophrenia include abnormalities related to hippocampal (HF) and prefrontal cortices (PFC), which are consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia and in their healthy relatives<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Thus, it follows that genes weakly associated with susceptibility for schizophrenia might show relatively robust effects on PFC and HF function in risk-allele carrying populations.</p>
    <p id="P3">Here, we identify a novel potential schizophrenia susceptibility gene, <italic>KCNH2</italic> (a hERG-family potassium channel), using meta-analyses of five independent clinical association samples. Moving beyond statistical association with clinical diagnosis, we describe association with several schizophrenia-linked biological intermediate phenotypes in large samples of normal individuals who carry risk-associated alleles. In searching for a molecular mechanism, we discovered a novel, primate and brain-specific <italic>KCNH2</italic> isoform (<italic>3.1</italic>), encoded in close proximity to the risk-associated SNPs. Expression of <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> is specifically increased within the HF of schizophrenia patients and in normal individuals who carry risk-associated alleles. Expression of <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> in rodent cortical neurons causes a dramatic alteration in <italic>KCNH2</italic> channel physiology resulting in high-frequency, non-adapting neuronal firing patterns. Such changes in spike frequency may underlie abnormalities in neuronal firing thought to be a fundamental aspect of cortical dysfunction in psychosis<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. These convergent results implicate a novel potassium channel in primate cortical physiology and in the etiology and pathophysiology of psychosis, making it a potentially new target for antipsychotic therapy.</p>
    <sec id="S1">
      <title>Identification of the <italic>KCNH2</italic> region associated with schizophrenia</title>
      <p id="P4">It has become increasingly apparent that genetic risk for schizophrenia and many other complex illnesses will not relate to major amino acid changes and highly detrimental protein mutations, though these may still occur in rare forms of the illness<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Instead, the molecular effects of susceptibility alleles are more likely to be subtle, relating to the regulation and splicing of transcripts or proteins. Thus, the gene expression profiles of patient tissue are a potentially informative starting point to search for candidate risk genes<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. We selected 10 genes previously reported as differentially expressed in schizophrenic brain<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and genotyped haplotype tagging SNPs in 170 Caucasian families having an offspring with schizophrenia. FBAT analysis<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> of gene-based haplotypes demonstrated significant global association with diagnosis in the genomic region of NOS3 (7q36.1) (p&lt;.005; p&lt;.05 after Bonferroni correction for ten association tests) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data S1</xref>). In the European sample (CEU) of the HapMap Project<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, the block tagged by these SNPs spans portions of <italic>NOS3</italic> and <italic>KCNH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The most strongly associated SNP in this 7q36.1 region is within <italic>KCNH2</italic> and was associated with schizophrenia following correction for the total number of SNP tests performed across all ten genes (M33 [rs1036145], corrected p = 0.042).</p>

    <sec id="S2">
      <title><italic>KCNH2</italic> as a potential risk gene for schizophrenia</title>
      <p id="P5">Additional SNPs were genotyped (43 in total) in an expanded sample of 296 families (âCBDB family sampleâ) from the 3â-end of <italic>KCNH2</italic> to the 3â-end of NOS3, including 11 SNPs detected through resequencing of the region in schizophrenia patients. Six SNPs were significantly associated with schizophrenia at Î± &lt; 0.05 (5 with p &lt; 0.01)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Most of the associated markers are in moderate to strong LD, suggesting the region of interest maps to a â¼3 kb segment of intron 2 of <italic>KCNH2</italic>.</p>
      <p id="P6">We tested for replication in a large German Caucasian case-control dataset, typing the 6 associated SNPs found in the CBDB sample and one SNP with marginal significance (p=0.057). Significant association at the genotype level was observed for minor allele homozygotes at four of these SNPs, M16, M17, M19 and M30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data S3</xref>). Three additional samples were tested with the same 6 markers: a Caucasian family-based sample from the NIMH Genetics Initiative project<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> (NIMHGI), a case-control sample from Armenia and a case-control sample from Italy.. Though the sizes and ascertainment strategies of these samples differed from the larger original samples, significant SNPs were observed in this region and/or the 6 implicated SNPs tended towards the same direction of association though not significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data S3</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P7">Given these results and power limitations, a combined family-based and case-control meta-analysis was conducted using the R package <bold>catmap</bold><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.

      <title>Impact of <italic>KCNH2</italic> SNPs on cognition, and cortical structure and function</title>
      <p id="P8">Given the high expression of <italic>KCNH2</italic> within the PFC and HF<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, two regions subserving attention and memory processes and consistently implicated in the neuropathology of schizophrenia<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, we hypothesized that if risk-associated SNPs impact on the biology of these brain regions, cognitive deficits referable to these regions would also be associated with risk genotypes, regardless of disease status. We selected three of the significantly associated SNPs from the meta-analysis (M30, 31, 33, all of which are in strong LD with the fourth positive SNP M17) to test for their effects on seven independent summary measures of cognition<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data S4</xref>) in a sample of healthy, unrelated controls independent from the prior control samples. The use of healthy controls for genetic association at the level of brain function avoids potential confounders related to chronic illness and medical treatment<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Significant association was observed between risk genotypes for each SNP and performance on the IQ/processing speed factor (p = 0.020; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Thus, even in healthy controls, the same alleles observed more frequently in schizophrenia patients predict significantly lower IQ/processing speed. It is noteworthy that similar cognitive phenotypes have been especially strongly related to genetic risk for schizophrenia in discordant twin samples<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P9">We also tested whether the same three SNPs would relate to changes in brain structure and physiology. Using MRI-based morphometry, significant volume decreases in HF structures (Î± = 0.05, FDR corrected), proportional to allelic load, were observed in normal individuals carrying risk-alleles of SNPs M30, M31, and M33 using whole brain and region of interest analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data S6</xref>). We next tested whether the same SNPs would influence the physiology of cognitive processing related to HF, again in healthy control risk allele carriers at M30, 31 and 33. fMRI was used to assess regional activation during incidental encoding of a temporal lobe memory task<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> in which task performance was controlled. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data S5</xref> for demographic statistics).

This pattern of inefficient processing of memory information (i.e. excessive activity for a fixed level of performance) suggests that the tuning of cortical microcircuits critical for information processing within the HF is relatively disordered in individuals with risk-associated alleles. Similar patterns of inefficient processing in HF have been reported for other genes and diseases affecting cognition e.g. <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>.</p>

Again, normal subjects carrying risk associated alleles of M30, M31, and M33 demonstrated significantly increased activity in an allele load pattern within the DLPFC despite controlled task performance (i.e. inefficient cortical processing) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data S5</xref>).

      <p id="P18">The slow deactivation of the <italic>KCNH2</italic> channel is mediated by a PAS domain (aa 25â136) of the <italic>KCNH2-1A</italic> N-terminus<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, most of which is missing in <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).

      <p id="P24">We report a novel genetic association with schizophrenia within a small region of intron two of <italic>KCNH2</italic>, which was observed in a meta-analysis of five independent clinical samples. Our results also suggest that the molecular mechanism of genetic susceptibility relates to changes in gene expression and regulation of a novel isoform of <italic>KCNH2</italic> with unique physiologic properties. The sequence of hypothesis-driven experiments and tests leading to this convergent evidence, from initial genetic screening to genetic association with aspects of human hippocampal structure and hippocampal and DLPFC function and gene expression to confirmatory experiments in tissue culture is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>. Though we report here significant association of several SNPs across independent samples and by meta-analysis, the exact risk structure may vary between populations while the regional location and overall effect on <italic>KCNH2</italic> gene processing may remain consistent with what is described here. The splicing mechanism related to variation in this region of <italic>KCNH2</italic> is yet to be determined (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P25">The region of interest on 7q36.1 has not, to date, been reported as a significant locus in the few genome wide association (GWA) studies of psychiatric illnesses<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>â<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>. These negative results may reflect the fact that these psychiatric GWA studies have relied largely on Affymetrix 5.0 SNP arrays, whose coverage is notably lacking over this genomic regionâ¥ Conversely, <italic>p</italic>-values reported here would not be significant if we corrected for all SNPs in the genome. Scanning the genome with hundreds of thousands of SNPs and employing the necessary rigid statistical correction because of no prior probability of any SNP being positive is a popular strategy at the moment, as it makes no assumptions about biology or function. This strategy has the appeal of a level of statistical significance being clear and incontrovertible. However, statistical significance does not, in and of itself, imply biological significance nor does it necessarily identify the genes most likely to be important in unraveling new strategies for prevention and treatment.</p>
      <p id="P26">In order to move beyond statistical association with clinical diagnosis and to obtain convergent evidence for association between <italic>KCNH2</italic> and schizophrenia-related biology, we have performed a series of convergent experiments testing risk-associated SNPs on several intermediate biological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>). While we believe our deductive, hypothesis-driven strategy minimizes serendipity, it does involve a number of tests. Thus, the potential for spurious association because of multiple testing is important to consider. Three of the four SNPs showing association in a meta-analysis of 5 independent clinical samples were tested for association with biologic phenotypes related to risk for schizophrenia and to molecular processing of <italic>KCNH2</italic> transcripts. A consistent pattern of allelic association was found in normal subjects, involving cognition and structural and functional imaging, and in expression of the 3.1 isoform in brain tissue from patients and controls of various ethnic backgrounds. The likelihood that by chance the same risk-associated alleles would predict variation in each of these independent phenotypes across these diverse samples and always in the direction of abnormality associated with illness is exceedingly remote.</p>
      <p id="P27">Exploration of the potential electrophysiologic effects of elevated <italic>KCNH2</italic>-3.1 levels on neuronal repolarization and spike frequency has intriguing implications for both normal cortical function and the pathophysiology of psychosis. Cortical information processing is critically dependent on well-orchestrated, persistent neuronal firing within cortical circuits<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. For example, neurons in the PFC exhibit sustained firing of high-frequency activity during the delay period that is thought to be critical for working memory<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. The cellular mechanism for this âsustainedâ firing is not clear. We found that expression of <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> in cultured cortical neurons results in a much faster deactivation of the hERG channels, leading to a marked increase in spike frequency and a conversion from adapting to predominantly non-adapting firing patterns. Such sustained firing patterns may be important for higher-order cognition and suggests a role for the primate-specific <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> in normal human cognitive processing. However, this critical evolutionary change in activation kinetics may require specific titration of isoform abundances to achieve optimum signal-to-noise relationships. The 2.5-fold relative increase in <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> in the schizophrenic brain might imbalance this titration, resulting in abnormally increased neuronal excitability, and disruption of neuronal firing patterns and regulation of signal-to-noise<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P28">The discovery of <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> may also have therapeutic implications. Some typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs bind and inhibit <italic>KCNH2</italic> with affinities comparable to their affinities for dopamine D2 receptors<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. While D2 receptor affinity is thought to account for the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics, <italic>KCNH2</italic> binding is responsible at least for side effects such as altered QT interval<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> or even sudden cardiac failure<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>. Given that <italic>KCNH2</italic> controls neuronal excitability and firing patterns, could the therapeutic effects of antipsychotic drugs also be related to their affinities for the brain-specific isoforms of <italic>KCNH2</italic>? Although the binding properties of antipsychotic drugs to <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic> remain to be tested, the unique structure of <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic>, its role in non-adaptive firing, its low expression in heart, and elevated expression in brains of schizophrenia patients and genetic risk carriers, makes it reasonable to speculate that selective inhibition of <italic>KCNH2-3.1</italic>, but not <italic>KCNH2-1A</italic>, could improve the disorganized firing in schizophrenia brain without eliciting cardiac side effects.</p>
      <p id="P29">In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a novel, primate-specific, brain-enriched potassium channel, and a potential genetic association of <italic>KCNH2</italic> with risk for schizophrenia. . Healthy control carriers of risk alleles demonstrate a schizophrenia-like shift in cognitive traits (IQ/processing speed), in hippocampal volume and physiologic engagement during memory processing, and in prefrontal physiologic engagement during executive cognition. The mechanism of these associations appears to be related to genetic regulation of this novel isoform of <italic>KCNH2</italic>, which has unique electrophysiological properties and expressional dependence on risk-associated genotypes. Together, these results may provide a novel insight about the etiology of schizophrenia and a new direction for therapeutic discovery.</p>
