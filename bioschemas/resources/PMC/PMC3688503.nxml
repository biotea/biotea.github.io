      <abstract>
        <p>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital disorder caused by mutations of the myotubularin gene, <italic>MTM1</italic>. Myotubularin belongs to a large family of conserved lipid phosphatases that include both catalytically active and inactive myotubularin-related proteins (i.e., âMTMRsâ). Biochemically, catalytically inactive MTMRs have been shown to form heteroligomers with active members within the myotubularin family through protein-protein interactions. However, the pathophysiological significance of catalytically inactive MTMRs remains unknown in muscle. By <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, we have identified that catalytically inactive myotubularin-related protein 12 (MTMR12) binds to myotubularin in skeletal muscle. Knockdown of the <italic>mtmr12</italic> gene in zebrafish resulted in skeletal muscle defects and impaired motor function. Analysis of <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish showed pathological changes with central nucleation, disorganized Triads, myofiber hypotrophy and whorled membrane structures similar to those seen in X-linked myotubular myopathy. Biochemical studies showed that deficiency of MTMR12 results in reduced levels of myotubularin protein in zebrafish and mammalian C2C12 cells. Loss of myotubularin also resulted in reduction of MTMR12 protein in C2C12 cells, mice and humans. Moreover, XLMTM mutations within the myotubularin interaction domain disrupted binding to MTMR12 in cell culture. Analysis of human XLMTM patient myotubes showed that mutations that disrupt the interaction between myotubularin and MTMR12 proteins result in reduction of both myotubularin and MTMR12. These studies strongly support the concept that interactions between myotubularin and MTMR12 are required for the stability of their functional protein complex in normal skeletal muscles. This work highlights an important physiological function of catalytically inactive phosphatases in the pathophysiology of myotubular myopathy and suggests a novel therapeutic approach through identification of drugs that could stabilize the myotubularin-MTMR12 complex and hence ameliorate this disorder.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Congenital myopathies are a group of heredity diseases characterized by muscle weakness and impaired locomotion that manifest in both children and adults. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a subtype of congenital myopathy that predominantly affects males and is caused by mutations in the myotubularin (<italic>MTM1</italic>) gene. To date, more than 200 pathogenic mutations have been identified in <italic>MTM1</italic>. However, no effective therapy is available to treat patients presenting with XLMTM. This is largely due to a lack of understanding of molecular processes perturbed in the XLMTM disease state, thereby limiting the availability of suitable therapeutic targets. In this study, we show that catalytically inactive MTMR12 interacts with myotubularin in skeletal muscle. This complex formation is required to provide stability to myotubularin in the normal functioning of skeletal muscle and these interactions appear to be disrupted in XLMTM. This work therefore offers a novel direction for therapy development, both in XLMTM and other genetic diseases, by identifying crucial protein interactors of disease-causing proteins whose complexes might be stabilized in the disease state to restore normal function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital disorder caused by mutations of the <italic>MTM1</italic> gene that encodes myotubularin <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Laporte1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-BujBello1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Affected males are born with severe generalized hypotonia and weakness of skeletal muscles with respiratory insufficiency. In majority of cases the disease is fatal within the first months of life, but a proportion of affected males survive into their teens or beyond yet are non ambulant and require ventilatory support. Histopathologically, affected muscle fibers exhibit hypotrophy with a large number of centrally placed nuclei in a high proportion of myofibers. Thus, XLMTM is considered a subtype of centronuclear myopathy (CNM) <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Pierson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. <italic>MTM1</italic> encodes a 3â²-phosphoinositide (PtdIns3<italic>P</italic>) lipid phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3<italic>P</italic>) and phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate PtdIns(3,5<italic>P)<sub>2</sub></italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003583-Blondeau1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Schaletzky1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Caldwell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Phosphoinositides (PIs) are critical for a variety of physiological processes, including cell proliferation, cell death, motility, cytoskeletal regulation, intracellular vesicle trafficking, autophagy and cell metabolism <xref rid="pgen.1003583-DiPaolo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> and PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic>
<sub>2</sub> are both important regulators of membrane trafficking <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Vicinanza1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Similar to humans, loss of myotubularin function in animal models also results in clinico-pathological symptoms similar to myotubular myopathy signifying evolutionary conservation of mechanisms involving myotubularin <xref rid="pgen.1003583-BujBello2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Pierson2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Beggs1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Dowling1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Myotubularin is the prototypic member of one of the largest and most conserved protein lipid phosphatase subfamilies in eukaryotes, the myotubularin-related proteins (MTMRs) <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Hnia1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, . There are nine catalytically active members of the MTMR family, and six members whose catalytic sites have been inactivated through missense changes (designated myotubularin and MTMR1-14). While several active members are known to play crucial roles in physiology and human diseases presumably related to loss of their enzymatic activities, the cellular functions of catalytically inactive members are still poorly understood. Catalytically inactive MTMR family members are highly conserved and retained in vertebrate genome from teleosts to humans during evolution <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Lecompte1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> suggesting that these inactive members have important roles in development and diseases independent of their enzymatic activities, as functionally redundant family members are often lost during evolution <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This is further evident by a recent study that showed that catalytically inactive form of myotubularin could ameliorate many of the structural abnormalities seen in <italic>Mtm1</italic> knockout mice <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Amoasii1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Myotubularins form homo- and heteroligomers with themselves and other members of the MTMR family, and the catalytically inactive MTMRs are thought to largely form oligomers with active family members <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Hnia1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Laporte2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These interactions appear to regulate the sub-cellular localization or catalytic activity of the active members of the myotubularin family. <italic>In vitro</italic>, catalytically inactive MTMR5 and MTMR9 modulate the enzymatic activity of their interacting catalytically active partners, MTMR2, and MTMR6 and MTMR8, respectively <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Zou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Zou2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Functional evidence for <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of these interactions comes from genetic studies in humans that show that mutations of either the catalytically active MTMR2 or its catalytically inactive binding partner MTMR13 result in similar forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Bolino1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Azzedine1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Senderek1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Similarly, mutations in either of the binding partners MTMR2 (catalytically active) or MTMR5 (catalytically inactive) lead to defective spermatogenesis in mice, suggesting the biological importance of these interactions <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Bolino2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Firestein1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Myotubularin-related protein 12 (MTMR12), previously sometimes referred to as 3-phosphatase adaptor protein (3-PAP), is a catalytically inactive member of myotubularin family that interacts with MTM1 and MTMR2 to regulate their sub-cellular localization in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of non-muscle cells <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Lorenzo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Nandurkar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of such interactions remains unknown, especially with reference to disease process in myotubular myopathy that primarily affects the skeletal muscles due to lack of myotubularin function <xref rid="pgen.1003583-BujBello2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Protein-protein interactions are critical components of almost every biological process and any disruption of these networks leads to pathological conditions resulting in related diseases <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Oti1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Michele1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Therefore, a proper understanding of myotubular myopathy necessitates a comprehensive knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern such processes. We have employed zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) as a vertebrate animal model to understand the role of MTMR12 as a molecular regulator of myotubularin. Zebrafish are an excellent vertebrate model to study skeletal muscle development and disease due to high genomic synteny and similar clinico-pathological changes as seen in the human myopathies. Our studies revealed that deficiency of MTMR12 in zebrafish results in myopathy and impaired motor function similar to that caused by loss of myotubularin. Our data suggest MTMR12 affects muscle function primarily by regulating the stability of myotubularin <italic>in vivo</italic>. Studies in cells, mice and humans further implicate MTMR12 as an important player in the pathophysiology of XLMTM.</p>

MTM1-GST protein pulled down MTMR12-B10 protein whereas no interaction was observed with the GST alone, suggesting myotubularin and MTMR12 interact with each other by direct protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The interaction between myotubularin and MTMR12 was also examined in the Cos1 cell line. MTM1 and MTMR12-B10 were over-expressed in Cos1 cells and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by an antibody against myotubularin (monoclonal, 1G1). This resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of MTMR12-B10 with myotubularin but not with control IgG or empty beads confirming that MTMR12 also interacts with myotubularin in the cellular context as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Nandurkar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Mutations in <italic>MTM1</italic> result in XLMTM, which is a congenital myopathy that primarily affects the skeletal muscles in human patients and animal models. Therefore, the interaction between myotubularin and MTMR12 was investigated in skeletal muscles. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using protein extracts from murine skeletal muscle (tibialis anterior) using an anti-myotubularin monoclonal antibody (1G1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Antibody against myotubularin co-immunoprecipitated endogenous MTMR12 protein showing that myotubularin and MTMR12 interact in skeletal muscles. Control IgG or empty beads failed to immunoprecipitate MTMR12 suggesting the specificity of interactions between myotubularin and MTMR12. <italic>In vivo</italic> interaction between these proteins was also investigated by immuno-colocalization of myotubularin and MTMR12 proteins in murine skeletal muscles. Immunofluorescence showed a striated expression of endogenous MTMR12 in mouse tibialis anterior skeletal muscle similar to the pattern of myotubularin staining, and double immunolabeling revealed that these colocalize at the resolution of confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, partial co-localization of MTMR12 was observed with ryanodine receptors, a sarcoplasmic reticulum marker. The expression of MTMR12 was restricted to triads as no co-localization was observed with Î±-actinin at Z-lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Therefore, a combination of GST pull down, co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies support the hypothesis that myotubularin and MTMR12 interact with each other in skeletal muscle.</p>

<italic>Mtmr12</italic> knockdown results in skeletal muscle myopathy in zebrafish</title>
        <p>To understand the function of MTMR12 <italic>in vivo</italic>, zebrafish was used as a vertebrate animal model. The zebrafish <italic>mtmr12</italic> gene encodes a protein of 736 amino acids that is 69% similar and 52% identical with the human MTMR12 protein. The expression of <italic>mtmr12</italic> was analyzed by whole mount in-situ hybridization and RT-PCR in developing zebrafish embryos. Whole mount in-situ hybridization showed that <italic>mtmr12</italic> transcripts were expressed ubiquitously in developing eyes, brain, heart and skeletal muscles at 1 day post fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This ubiquitous expression of <italic>mtmr12</italic> was similar to the ubiquitous expression of <italic>mtm1</italic> transcripts at 1 dpf. Similar to the zebrafish gene, human <italic>MTMR12</italic> transcripts have also been found to express in all organs <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Nandurkar2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. RT-PCR analysis further showed similar temporal expression of <italic>mtm1</italic> and <italic>mtmr12</italic> during zebrafish development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). RT-PCR revealed that <italic>mtmr12</italic> and <italic>mtm1</italic> were first detected as maternal transcripts at the 1 cell stage. Expression of these maternal transcripts decreased during gastrulation and zygotic expression appeared around 8 hours post fertilization (hpf). This zygotic expression persisted in all developmental stages tested (until 5 dpf). In murine muscle cells, <italic>Mtmr12</italic> transcripts were detected during proliferation as well as differentiation stages in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The expression of <italic>Mtmr12</italic> transcripts increased steadily during differentiation followed by a decrease in late differentiation. Comparison to <italic>Mtm1</italic> expression revealed a similar expression pattern with a continuous increase with the progression of differentiation. Similar to the mRNA expression, MTMR12 protein expression was also highest during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar expression of <italic>mtmr12</italic> and <italic>mtm1</italic> during zebrafish development and in muscle cell differentiation suggests that they may be involved in similar physiological processes.</p>

        <p>To investigate <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of the <italic>mtmr12</italic> gene in zebrafish, anti-sense morpholino technology was employed to achieve functional gene knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g002">Figure 2CâE</xref>). Morpholinos were designed to disrupt either the translation or splicing of <italic>mtmr12</italic> transcripts. Knockdown using either a splice site-morpholino targeting the exon3-intron3 junction or the translational (ATG) morpholino resulted in similar phenotypes at relatively low morpholino concentrations (3.5â5.0 ng), suggesting the specificity of their action. Microinjection of 1cell embryos with splice site morpholinos resulted in mis-splicing and exclusion of exon 3 from the mature mRNA as detected by RT-PCR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). <italic>Mtmr12</italic> knockdown fish (<italic>mtmr12</italic> morphants) are smaller in size compared to controls and exhibited a dorsal curvature through the back and tail, instead of the normal flat dorsum, similar to <italic>mtm1</italic> knockdown fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Axial skeletal muscles of zebrafish embryos were examined using a birefringence assay that involves examination of axial skeletal muscles of live zebrafish embryos using polarized filter microscopy. Skeletal muscles of <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant embryos showed a reduced birefringence in comparison to the control morpholino injected fish suggesting a defect in skeletal muscle organization. Several <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphants also displayed pericardial edema. Similar phenotypes were obtained with both translational as well as spice-site morpholinos suggesting the specificity of morpholino knockdown. None of the commercially available antibodies showed reactivity to zebrafish MTMR12 protein, therefore, the rest of the studies were performed with the splice-site blocking morpholino against exon3-intron3 junction as mRNA knockdown could be assayed. To further validate the specificity of these phenotypes and to rule out any off-site targeting effect of morpholinos, mRNA rescues were performed. Human <italic>MTMR12</italic> mRNA was co-injected with <italic>mtmr12</italic> morpholino in zebrafish embryos. Over-expression of <italic>MTMR12</italic> mRNA in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish resulted in a rescue of phenotypes seen in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish indicating the specificity of morpholino targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
        <p>To understand if the interacting partners myotubularin and MTMR12 are involved in similar biological processes or have functions that are independent of each other, double knockdowns were performed. Double knockdown fish were smaller in size then either <italic>mtm1</italic> or <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish. Polarized live microscopy of morphant fish also showed that birefringence of <italic>mtmr12-mtm1</italic> double morphant zebrafish muscle was lower than in either <italic>mtm1</italic> or <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish suggesting a severe muscle phenotype. The exacerbated phenotypes of double knockdown fish suggests that in addition to regulating similar biological processes these genes may be involved in different processes independent of each other.</p>

        <title>MTMR12 deficiency results in impaired motor function in zebrafish</title>
        <p>To understand the consequences of MTMR12 deficiency on motor function, behavioral analysis of zebrafish embryos was performed. During early development, zebrafish embryos hatch out of their chorions by regular contractions of their skeletal muscles. Typically, approximately 86Â±7.4% of control embryos hatch by 60 hpf. In contrast, only 25Â±9.3% of <italic>mtmr12</italic> morpholino-injected embryos hatched by this time, consistent with a continued decrease in motor activity early in development (P&lt;0.01, nâ=â100â170) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). <italic>Mtm1</italic> morphant embryos displayed similar behavior as <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphants (19.3Â±3.39, nâ=â100â150, P&lt;0.001).

        <p>
<italic>Mtmr12</italic> morphant fish were largely immotile and their touch evoked response was blunted; instead of rapidly swimming out of the field of view like control fish (6.44Â±0.712 cm/0.1 sec), they twitched and only moved several lengths when stimulated with a needle (2.16Â±(2.832 cm/0.1 sec), suggesting a significant degree of overall muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003583.s001">Movie S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g002">Figure 2G</xref>).

        <title>MTMR12 deficiency results in sarcomere disorganization with central nucleation in skeletal muscles</title>
        <p>To study the effect of MTMR12 deficiency on skeletal muscle structure, ultrathin toluidine blue-stained longitudinal sections of control and <italic>mtmr12</italic> knockdown fish were examined at 3 dpf. Histological examination of control muscle showed well-organized myofibers with elongated nuclei that were localized to the periphery of muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

Moreover, occasional rounded, central nuclei were seen in skeletal muscles of the morphant fish but were absent in the control fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, arrow). Remarkably, the sarcomeric disorganization with central nucleation was very similar to the histological changes observed in <italic>mtm1</italic> knockdown fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, arrow). The proportion of fibers with central nuclei was almost similar in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant (54.5Â±7.1%) and <italic>mtm1</italic> morphant (57.8Â±7.1%) fish and significantly higher than normal controls (2.2Â±1.1%). <italic>Mtm1-mtmr12</italic> double knockdown fish exhibited severe muscle abnormalities with larger number of myofibers displaying sarcomeric disorganization and central nucleation (69.2Â±6.4%) than single morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To evaluate if the sarcomeric defects observed in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish are developmental or due to degenerative changes in muscle, skeletal muscle histology was evaluated at different time points during zebrafish development.

Strikingly, highly reduced levels of myotubularin labeling were seen in morphant muscle as compared to control skeletal muscle.

        <p>These observations suggest that MTMR12 is likely involved in regulating the stability of myotubularin. To address this point, we quantified myotubularin protein levels in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish. Western blot analysis, performed in three independent groups of embryos injected with <italic>mtmr12</italic> morpholino, revealed a â¼90% reduction in myotubularin levels in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish in comparison to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

        <title>Over-expression of <italic>MTM1</italic> improves skeletal muscle function in <italic>Mtmr12</italic> morphants</title>
        <p>
<italic>Mtmr12</italic> morphant fish displayed reduced levels of myotubularin protein and similar pathological changes to those seen in myotubularin deficiency, suggesting that the ability of MTMR12 to stabilize endogenous myotubularin levels <italic>in vivo</italic> may be a primary physiological role. These findings gave rise to the intriguing possibility that overexpression of myotubularin may be able to reverse the phenotypes associated with MTMR12 deficiency in zebrafish. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed exogenous human <italic>MTM1</italic> mRNA to investigate its ability to rescue the muscle phenotype in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish and evaluated the resulting skeletal muscle phenotypes by birefringence assay and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>MTM1</italic> mRNA in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish restored the birefringence to almost normal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). While the skeletal muscle birefringence was drastically improved, the length of zebrafish embryos was smaller (75Â±5.4% of control fish) suggesting MTMR12 may have additional functions independent of myotubularin. The ultra-structure of skeletal muscle was also significantly improved with a decrease in fraction of abnormal triads. This result strengthens the finding that an important role of MTMR12 is to provide stability to myotubularin protein and hence regulate its function. The <italic>mtm1-mtmr12</italic> double knockdown fish exhibited severe muscle defects consistent with the idea that MTMR12 may have independent functional roles in addition to providing stability to myotubularin. This was investigated by overexpressing <italic>MTM1</italic> RNA in <italic>mtm1-mtmr12</italic> double knockdown fish. Overexpression of <italic>MTM1</italic> resulted in a moderate improvement in birefringence as well as skeletal muscle pathology in double knockdowns as quantified by number of normal triads in skeletal muscle of rescued fish. Nevertheless, rescued fish were still smaller in size (0.64Â±0.029) than wild-type controls (1.00Â±0), consistent with the notion that MTMR12 may have functions independent of MTM1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g007">Figure 7 C and E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Myotubularin-MTMR12 interactions are perturbed in XLMTM</title>
        <p>The significance of MTM1-MTMR12 interactions was investigated in the human neuromuscular disease XLMTM. In XLMTM, more than 200 mutations have been reported that are distributed on different domains of the myotubularin protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dmd.nl/">http://www.dmd.nl/</ext-link>). In addition to nonsense mutations, a large number of missense mutations in various myotubularin domains have been shown to be pathogenic. To test, if disease causing mutations in myotubularin affect its interaction with MTMR12, interactions between mutant myotubularins and wild-type MTMR12 were examined. A series of human myotubularin proteins modeling human missense mutations in different domains were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Exogenous wild type or mutant myotubularins were co-expressed with MTMR12-GFP protein in Cos7 cells. Immunoprecipitation of protein extracts with a myotubularin specific antibody revealed that missense mutations in the GRAM or RID domains abolished the interaction of myotubularin with MTMR12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). As over-expression in cell culture may not represent the physiological milieu, myotubes from XLMTM patients were also used to test if the pathogenic mutations on myotubularin protein affect myotubularin-MTMR12 interactions. Examination of XLMTM patient myotubes showed all mutations tested resulted in highly reduced levels of myotubularin compared to control samples. In addition, MTMR12 levels were also reduced in these patients suggesting an overall perturbation of myotubularin-MTMR12 complexes in XLMTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g008">Figure 8C</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Studies presented in this work were aimed at gaining insights into the molecular regulatory mechanism(s) of myotubularin function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previous studies have shown that MTMR12 is an interacting partner of myotubularin <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003583-Nandurkar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Nandurkar2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Here, we show that absence of catalytically inactive phosphatase MTMR12 protein resulted in skeletal muscle myopathy and pathological changes similar to XLMTM due to abrogation of protein-protein interactions between myotubularin and MTMR12 resulting in reduced stability and loss of myotubularin protein function.</p>
      <p>The interaction between myotubularin and MTMR12 in skeletal muscle and co-localization at the triad certainly suggests that they might be functioning together in similar biological processes in muscle cells. This hypothesis is supported by knockdown studies on the <italic>mtmr12</italic> gene in zebrafish that resulted in myopathic muscle in the affected fish similar to the myotubularin deficient zebrafish model <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Dowling1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To understand if these proteins function in similar biological processes or play roles in other processes independent of each other, <italic>mtm1</italic>-<italic>mtmr12</italic> double knockdown zebrafish were created. The phenotype of double knockdown zebrafish was more severe than fish deficient in either myotubularin or MTMR12 alone. Further, inability of MTM1 to rescue all the defects observed in double knock-down fish suggests that these proteins may play additional functions that are independent of each other either by interacting with other proteins within or outside of the myotubularin family. Previous studies have shown that in addition to myotubularin, MTMR12 also interacts with another catalytically active member, MTMR2, by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two hybrid interactions <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Lorenzo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Nandurkar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Therefore, future studies on identification of protein complexes of myotubularin and MTMR12 proteins may help in identifying other pathways that are regulated by these proteins.</p>
      <p>The presence of similar pathological changes in <italic>mtmr12</italic> knockdown and XLMTM muscles, such as myofibrillar disarray, excessive central nucleation, triad disorganization and presence of whorled membranous structures, suggests that <italic>mtmr12</italic> is a crucial regulator of disease pathology in XLMTM. Moreover, these pathological changes in zebrafish manifest early in zebrafish development (2â3 dpf), similar to pathological changes seen in human patients. As loss of <italic>mtmr12</italic> resulted in clinical symptoms similar to those associated with centronuclear myopathies, <italic>MTMR12</italic> represents an excellent candidate gene for patients with centronuclear myopathy but unknown genetic diagnosis. However, sequencing of 108 such cases failed to identify any pathogenic mutations in <italic>MTMR12</italic>, suggesting <italic>MTMR12</italic> may account for a small subset of patients or is mutated in a clinically different disease, perhaps with a skeletal muscle component, but related also to other functions of MTMR12 (V.A. Gupta, unpublished data). In our cellular models of MTMR12 deficiency, highly reduced levels of MTM1 were observed. Therefore, any genetically unknown cases exhibiting low levels of myotubularin without any <italic>MTM1</italic> mutations may also be good candidates for testing for <italic>MTMR12</italic> mutations. Next generation sequencing technologies have been exhibited great promise in identifying rare gene variants and may yet identify <italic>MTMR12</italic> mutations in the future. Regardless, these studies show a crucial role for MTMR12 function in XLMTM disease pathology.</p>
      <p>Complex formation between some catalytically inactive and active partners in the myotubularin family has been shown to increase the activity of the catalytically active binding partner either by recruitment to specific membrane subdomains rich in lipid substrate or by increasing the allosteric activity. In the absence of MTMR12 an increase in PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> was observed suggesting a decrease in myotubularin and/or another partner's enzymatic activity. However, unlike other catalytically active-inactive pairs, MTMR12 primarily regulates the function of myotubularin protein by affecting protein levels instead of modulating the enzymatic activity <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Zou2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Mochizuki1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Interestingly, PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> levels were higher in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish in comparison to <italic>mtm1</italic> morphant fish, suggesting that MTMR12 may function in regulating the enzymatic activity/protein stability of other phospholipid phosphatases in cells. In the absence of MTMR12, highly reduced levels of myotubularin protein was observed suggesting that protein-protein interactions between these proteins are required for maintaining myotubularin stability. Similarly, decreased levels of MTMR12 were seen in myotubularin deficient cells and mice suggesting that stability of MTMR12 is also dependent on the interaction with myotubularin.</p>
      <p>The abnormalities observed in MTMR12 deficient fish appear mainly due to loss of function of myotubularin as overexpression of <italic>MTM1</italic> mRNA dramatically improved the skeletal muscle defects observed in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant embryos while overexpression of catalytically inactive <italic>MTMR12</italic> mildly improved muscle pathology in <italic>mtm1</italic> morphant embryos. This suggests that enzymatic activity of myotubularin is required for its protein function, which was also seen, in a previous study where myotubularin deficiency could be rescued by catalytically active MTMR1 and MTMR2 <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Dowling1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Recent work also suggests that several but not all structural abnormalities observed in myotubularin deficiency can be rescued by over-expression of a catalytically inactive form of myotubularin <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Amoasii1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. As the catalytically inactive MTMR12 only partially but significantly rescues myotubularin function, it supports these recent findings <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Amoasii1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and suggests that MTMR proteins partially compensate for the lack of MTM1 through functions independent of their catalytic activity.</p>
      <p>This implies that the inability of catalytically inactive MTMR12 to rescue myotubularin function is not only due to the lack of phosphatase activity but could also be due to other properties of myotubularin not compensated by all MTMRs. MTMR12 also interacts with another catalytically active member, MTMR2, by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two hybrid <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Lorenzo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Nandurkar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Further MTMR2 and MTMR13 also interact by direct protein-protein binding. Mutations in genes encoding MTMR2 and MTMR13 have both been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease raising the possibility that MTMR12 deficiency may result in neurological defects such as those seen in CMT. <italic>Mtmr2</italic> as well as <italic>Mtmr13</italic> knockout mice exhibit a progressive neuropathy that becomes evident much later in the life span of these mice (â¼6 months) <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Bolino2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In comparison, no such neurological defects were seen in <italic>mtmr12</italic> morphant fish, which could be due to early mortality of these embryos (between 3â5 dpf), before such changes become evident. Finally, it is worth noting that the ability of human <italic>MTM1</italic> mRNA to rescue zebrafish <italic>mtm1</italic> morphants reinforces the notion that these orthologues have been functionally conserved despite their considerable evolutionary distance, validating the relevance of the zebrafish model to studies of human XLMTM.</p>
      <p>Studying the interaction of MTMR12 with myotubularins modeling various human mutations illuminates the role of myotubularin-MTMR12 interactions in XLMTM. Missense mutations in the N-terminal GRAM and RID domains resulted in abolishment of interaction between myotubularin and MTMR12. This was a surprising finding as previous studies have shown the myotubularin family members interact with each other through their SID or coiled-coil domains. It was also shown that an isoform of MTMR12 lacking the SID domain showed no interaction with myotubularin protein <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Nandurkar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. One reason for this discrepancy is that many of the previous studies have been performed using deletion constructs of different domains that may have a different effect on protein confirmation and thus its interactions than the missense changes we studied. Nonetheless a study of interactions between MTMR6 and KCa3.1 proteins has shown that along with the coiled-coil domain, the PH-GRAM domain is also required for protein-protein interactions <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Choudhury1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Similarly, oligomerization of MTMR2-MTMR13 in a complex occurs independent of coiled-coil domains <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Analysis of XLMTM patient myotubes showed that many mutations of myotubularin that result in low levels of myotubularin protein also lead to decreases in MTMR12 levels. Many patients with these types of myotubularin mutations are described with severe phenotypes and a further reduction of MTMR12 may exacerbate the clinical severity as seen in myotubularin-MTMR12 double knockdown zebrafish.</p>
      <p>Apart from the type III intermediate filament desmin <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Hnia2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, our study identifies a second interactor of myotubularin in skeletal muscle and underlines the concept that protein-interactions between myotubularin and MTMR12 are crucial for disease pathology in XLMTM. We propose a model whereby disruption of interactions between MTM1-MTMM12 results in destabilization of both partners in the complex, leading to centronuclear myopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003583-g009">Figure 9</xref>). As loss of MTMR12 results in reduction of myotubularin, we suspect that primary mutations of MTMR12 may result in centronuclear or related myopathies. As protein interactions play critical roles in almost all biological processes, efforts are currently focused on identifying drugs that can stabilize protein-protein interactions <xref rid="pgen.1003583-Lievens1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Stabilizing protein-protein interaction between myotubularin and MTMR12 may result in restoration of normal skeletal muscle function in XLMTM patients with certain missense mutations of myotubularin.</p>

          <title>MTM1-MTMR12 interactions in normal and disease states.</title>
          <p>Under normal conditions, MTM1 and MTMR12 interact in skeletal muscle and regulate skeletal muscle architecture and function. Loss of function mutations of <italic>MTM1</italic> (red cross) in skeletal muscle are associated with centronuclear myopathy and with a secondary reduction in MTMR12 levels. In centronuclear myopathy, disease causing missense mutations (red circle) that disrupt interactions between MTM1 and MTMR12 result in decreased stability of myotubularin causing myotubular myopathy associated with reduced levels of MTMR12. Loss of <italic>MTMR12</italic> in zebrafish and mammalian cells, results in decreased levels of myotubularin resulting in pathological changes similar to centronuclear myopathy.</p>
