      <abstract>
        <p>Topoisomerase II (Top2) activity involves an intermediate in which the topoisomerase is covalently bound to a DNA double-strand break via a 5â²-phosphotyrosyl bond. Although these intermediates are normally transient, they can be stabilized by antitumor agents that act as Top2 âpoisons,â resulting in the induction of cytotoxic double-strand breaks, and they are implicated in the formation of site-specific translocations that are commonly associated with cancer. Recently, we revealed that TRAF and TNF receptor-associated protein (TTRAP) is a 5â²-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase (5â²-TDP) that can cleave 5â²-phosphotyrosyl bonds, and we denoted this protein tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-2 (TDP2). Here, we have generated <italic>TDP2</italic>-deleted DT40 cells, and we show that TDP2 is the major if not the only 5â²-TDP activity present in vertebrate cells. We also show that <italic>TDP2</italic>-deleted DT40 cells are highly sensitive to the anticancer Top2 poison, etoposide, but are not hypersensitive to the Top1 poison camptothecin or the DNA-alkyating agent methyl methanesulfonate. These data identify an important mechanism for resistance to Top2-induced chromosome breakage and raise the possibility that TDP2 is a significant factor in cancer development and treatment.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Topoisomerases release torsional stress in DNA and decatenate chromosomes during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). A key intermediate of topoisomerase activity is the cleavage complex, within which the topoisomerase cleaves one or both strands of DNA and becomes covalently linked to the 3â² or 5â² terminus of the break via a phosphotyrosyl bond. The cleavage complex is normally transient because the topoisomerase reseals the break at the end of its catalytic cycle. However, cleavage complexes are the targets of a class of antitumor agents that act as topoisomerase âpoisons,â prolonging the half-life of the cleaved intermediate and resulting in the formation of potentially cytotoxic DNA strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Whereas topoisomerase I (Top1)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>4</sup></xref> poisons induce DNA breaks in which the topoisomerase is linked via a phosphotyrosyl bond to the 3â² terminus of the break, topoisomerase II (Top2) poisons induce DNA strand breaks in which the topoisomerase is linked via a phosphotyrosyl bond to the 5â² terminus. Top2-associated DNA breaks account not only for the clinical efficacy of Top2 poisons as antitumor cytotoxic drugs, but are also implicated in genome instability, chromosome translocations, and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Recently, we identified a human 5â²-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase (5â²-TDP) activity that can cleave 5â²-phosphotyrosyl bonds and might thereby release trapped topoisomerase from 5â² termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This enzyme, previously known as TTRAP, is a member of the metal-dependent superfamily of phosphodiesterases and has been implicated in NF-ÎºB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), ETS1-mediated transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), apoptotic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and left-right axis determination during development in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Based on its TDP activity we denoted TTRAP as tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) and speculated that this enzyme might play an important role in the repair of Top2-associated double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by Top2 poisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We now demonstrate using avian DT40 cells that TDP2 is the primary if not the only 5â²-TDP activity in vertebrate cells and that genetic deletion of <italic>TDP2</italic> results in specific and severe sensitivity to Top2 poisons. These data identify TDP2 as a novel cellular component of the DNA repair pathway(s) that protect cells from topoisomerase-induced chromosomal breakage and suggest that TDP2 may be a useful clinical target for inhibition during the chemotherapeutic application of anticancer Top2 poisons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>5â²-Tyrosyl DNA Phosphodiesterase Activity</title><p>The 19-mer and 20-mer DSB substrates were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Briefly, the 5â²-Y 18-bp (5â²-YTCCGTTGAAGCCTGCTTT-3â²) oligonucleotide was annealed with 19-bp (5â²-GAAAGCAGGCTTCAACGGA-3â²) or 20-bp (5â²-AGAAAGCAGGCTTCAACGGA-3â²) oligonucleotides, respectively, and the resulting 1-bp or 2-bp 5â²-overhang filled using Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of [Î±-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP (for the 19-mer) or both [Î±-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP and ddTTP (for the 20-mer). Inclusion of the latter for the 20-mer inhibits degradation of the substrate by nonspecific 3â²-nucleases present in whole cell extract. For single-stranded and nicked duplex substrates, the single-stranded <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 5â²-Y 19-mer prepared as above was gel-purified from denaturing gels and either employed alone (single-stranded substrate) or annealed, along with the 21-bp oligonucleotide (5â²-GCGCAGCTAGCGGCGGAT-GGC-3â²), to the 40-bp oligonucleotide (5â²-GAAAGCAGGCTTCAACGGAGCCATCCGCCGCTAGCTGCGC-3â²). Reactions were carried out by incubating the indicated substrate (50 n<sc>m</sc>) with whole cell protein extract (250 ng/ml) or the indicated concentration of recombinant human His-TDP2/TTRAP protein, which was expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> and prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), in 25 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, pH 8.0, 130 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 10 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 m<sc>m</sc> DTT and in the presence or absence of orthovanadate, BSA, or phosphotyrosine-BSA (Sigma) as indicated at 37 Â°C for 60 min. In reactions containing cell extract 50 Î¼<sc>m</sc> competitor single-stranded oligonucleotide (5â²-CTAACTTGAGCGAAACGGT-3â²) was also included to further reduce nonspecific nucleolytic degradation of the duplex substrate. To examine whether the product of hTDP2 activity was a ligatable 5â² terminus, nicked duplex substrate described above was incubated in ligation buffer with hTDP2 and/or human DNA ligase IIIÎ±, which was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).

The amplified PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. 2.5-kb HindIII/BamHI (left arm) and 4.4-kb BamHI/XhoI (right arm) DNA fragments were then ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO vector. A single drug-resistance gene (Puro, HisD, or bsr) was then inserted into the BamHI site of the pCR2.1 vector between the TDP2 targeting sequences. To generate <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/â</sup> cells, 2 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cells were electroporated (Bio-Rad) with 30 Î¼g of the relevant linearized (with XhoI) <italic>TDP2</italic> gene-disruption construct and drug-resistant colonies selected by incubation in medium containing 0.5 Î¼g/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.0 mg/ml <sc>d</sc>-histidinol dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), or 25 Î¼g/ml blasticidine S hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), alone or in combination as appropriate. To detect successful targeting of <italic>TDP2</italic> alleles, genomic DNA was isolated from multiple drug-resistant clones, digested with XhoI and EcoRV, and subjected to Southern blot analysis using a 0.8-kb probe (N-probe) amplified using the primers 5â²-TGAAGCAAAGCTGACAAGC-TGC-3â² and 5â²-CCAGTTAGCGGCAACATTTGAG-3â². Following three consecutive rounds of gene targeting with constructs encoding resistance to Puro, HisD, and Bsr, respectively, two <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/â</sup> clones (clone 8 and clone 93) were recovered. These clones were employed for phenotypic analysis along with parental DT40 cells and a single <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/+</sup> clone (clone H13) in which only two of the three <italic>TDP2</italic> alleles were targeted.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of hTDP2 and hTDP2 Catalytic Mutant Transfected DT40 Cells</title><p>pcDNA3.1-HisC (Invitrogen) constructs expressing wild-type human TDP2 and TDP2<sup>D262A</sup> were described previously (note that TDP2 was previously denoted TTRAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/â</sup> DT40 cells were electroporated with pcDNA3.1-HisC-TDP2, pcDNA3.1-HisC-TDP2 (D262A), or pcDNA3.1-HisC empty vector. After selection in 1.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 6 days, pooled populations of transfectants were collected.

Membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBS-Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% nonfat dried milk (NFDM) and then incubated for 2 h with affinity-purified anti-TDP2 polyclonal antibody (SY1340) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) at a 1/200 dilution, in PBST plus 5% nonfat dried milk. Membranes were rinsed in PBST and incubated in PBST plus 5% nonfat dried milk containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO), as appropriate, at a 1/3,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then rinsed with PBST and antibody complexes detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec><title>Clonogenic Survival Assays</title><p>To determine sensitivity, cells were plated in 5 ml of medium containing 1.5% (by weight) methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) in 6-well plates at 50, 500, and 5000 cells/well per treatment condition. Media also contained the indicated concentration of methyl methanesulfonate, camptothecin (CPT), or etoposide. In all experiments, cells were incubated for 7â11 days and visible colonies counted. The surviving fraction was calculated by dividing the average number of visible colonies in treated wells by the average number of colonies in untreated wells.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>TDP2 (also known as TTRAP) is the first human enzyme with 5â²-TDP activity to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). To characterize this enzyme further we examined its sensitivity to vanadate and its DNA substrate specificity. The 5â²-TDP activity of histidine-tagged TDP2 (His-TDP2) on oligonucleotide duplexes harboring 5â²-phosphotyrosyl termini was inhibited by vanadate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). This is similar to the 3â²-TDP activity of TDP1 and suggests the involvement of a phosphate transition state during the 5â²-TDP reaction. To examine the specificity of His-TDP2 for nucleic acid substrates we first examined whether this activity was inhibited by BSA-tyrosine phosphate, a derivative of BSA containing a phosphotyrosine bond similar to that present in the oligonucleotide 5â²-phosphotyrosyl substrate. BSA-tyrosine phosphate failed to inhibit the activity of His-TDP2, even if present at 60-fold higher concentrations than the oligonucleotide 5â²-phosphotyrosyl substrate, suggesting that His-TDP2 activity was specific for nucleic acid substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). His-TDP2 was active on a phosphotyrosyl bond present at the 5â² terminus of either a single-stranded oligonucleotide, a DSB, or a single strand break (SSB), but was most active on the DSB substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>). This is consistent with a role for TDP2 in the repair of Top2-associated DSBs. However, the activity of His-TDP2 on SSBs with 5â²-phosphotyrosyl termini may also be relevant because Top2 also induces this type of break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). We have suggested that the product of TDP2 activity is a 5â²-phosphate terminus that is competent for DNA ligation, based on the sensitivity of the TDP2 product to calf intestinal phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This is an important possibility because if true it would provide an error-free mechanism for repairing topoisomerase-associated DNA breaks by simple DNA ligation. We therefore addressed whether the termini created by TDP2 are ligatable, directly, by employing a substrate that contained a 5â²-phosphotyrosyl terminus within the context of a single-stranded nick. Indeed, incubation of this substrate with His-TDP2 and DNA ligase, but not with either His-TDP2 or DNA ligase alone, resulted in conversion of the radiolabeled 19-mer containing the phosphotyrosyl terminus into a radiolabeled 40-mer, confirming that the His-TDP2 generates a ligatable 5â²-phosphate terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The 5â²-TDP activity of His-TDP2 prefers DSBs and liberates ligatable 5â² termini from DNA 5â²-phosphotyrosine termini.</bold> <italic>A</italic>, purified recombinant human His-TDP2 (100 n<sc>m</sc>) was incubated with 50 n<sc>m</sc> duplex substrate harboring a DSB with a 5â²-phosphotyrosine (<italic>P-Y</italic>) terminus (<italic>top</italic>) in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of orthovanadate for 1 h at 37 Â°C and reaction products separated by denaturing PAGE and detected by autoradiography. <italic>Right</italic>, quantification of the fraction (%) of total labeled oligonucleotide converted to 5â²-phosphate (19-mer) product is shown.

Based on the 5â²-TDP activity of TDP2, we proposed that this enzyme might be important for cellular resistance to Top2 poisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we compared the sensitivity of <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>+/+/+</sup>, <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/+</sup>, and <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/â</sup> cells to etoposide, a Top2 poison employed in the treatment of lung, ovarian, and testicular cancer.

Importantly, <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/â</sup> <sup>hTDP2</sup> cells expressing human TDP2 exhibited levels of etoposide sensitivity similar to <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>+/+/+</sup> cells, confirming that the sensitivity of <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/â</sup> cells was due to loss of TDP2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). Moreover, <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/â</sup> <sup>hTDP2 D262A</sup> cells expressing catalytically impaired or inactive TDP2 were no more resistant to etoposide than were untransfected <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/â</sup> cells or <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/â</sup> cells transfected with empty vector, consistent with a requirement for TDP2 phosphodiesterase activity for cellular resistance to etoposide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>).

Here, we have extended the biochemical analysis of TDP2 and addressed, for the first time, the impact of <italic>TDP2</italic> deletion on vertebrate cells. The 5â²-TDP activity of TDP2 was inhibited by vanadate, suggesting that, like TDP1, cleavage of phosphotyrosyl bonds involves formation of a phosphate transition state. The activity of TDP2 was not inhibited by the presence of excess BSA-tyrosine phosphate, suggesting that TDP activity exhibits specificity for phosphotyrosyl bonds present in nucleic acid substrates. TDP2 exhibited a small preference for 5â²-phosphotyrosyl termini at blunt DSBs, compared with single strand 5â² termini or internal 5â² termini at SSBs, consistent with a role of TDP2 in the repair Top2-induced DSBs <italic>in vivo</italic>. The activity of TDP2 on single stranded termini may be physiologically relevant, however, because the phosphotyrosyl terminus at a Top2 DSB is present as a 4-bp 5â² single stranded overhang. Similarly, the activity of TDP2 on 5â²-phosphotyrosyl SSBs may be physiologically relevant because Top2 also induces this type of break, due most likely to incomplete temporal coordination in the cleavage activity of the two Top2 subunits that comprise the active homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition, topoisomerase III also creates DNA breaks with 5â²-phosphotyrosyl termini and preferentially does so in single stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>To examine the requirement for TDP2 for cellular response to Top2-induced DNA damage we generated an avian DT40 cell line in which all three <italic>TDP2</italic> alleles were disrupted. Notably, whereas robust 5â²-TDP activity was evident in wild-type cell extracts we detected little or no residual activity in cell extracts from <italic>TDP2</italic>-deleted cells. This suggests that TDP2 is the primary, if not the only, 5â²-TDP activity in higher eukaryotes. In addition, deletion of TDP2 resulted in a high level of hypersensitivity to the Top2 poison, etoposide, and expression of recombinant human TDP2 complemented this hypersensitivity, consistent with TDP2 being a major mechanism for the removal of trapped Top2 from DNA ends. Top2-induced DSBs are composed of 4-bp complementary 5â²-overhangs in which the 5â²-overhangs harbor the phosphotyrosyl termini. Consequently, because TDP2 can convert 5â²-phosphotyrosyl termini into ligatable termini, TDP2 could provide an error-free mechanism for repair of Top2 DSBs in which the only additional DNA processing that is required is DNA ligation. It is likely that TDP2 functions in conjunction with components of the nonhomologous end-joining machinery, with Ku and DNA ligase IV likely controlling events at the DSBs before and/or after TDP2 activity. Consistent with this idea, <italic>Lig4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Ku70</italic><sup>â/â</sup> DT40 cells also exhibit high levels of sensitivity to etoposide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to etoposide, little or no sensitivity was observed in <italic>TDP2</italic><sup>â/â/â</sup> DT40 cells to methyl methanesulfonate or the Top1 poison CPT. The lack of sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate is consistent with this agent inducing DNA breaks that possess 5â²-sugar phosphate (abasic) termini, rather than 5â²-phosphotyrosyl termini. In contrast, CPT induces DNA strand breaks in which Top1 is linked to 3â² termini of DNA breaks via a phosphotyrosyl bond. Although TDP2 possesses weak 3â²-TDP activity, it is likely that the primary source of such activity in cells is TDP1, providing a likely explanation for the absence of sensitivity to CPT in TDP2-deleted cells. However, we have shown previously that TDP2 can complement the CPT sensitivity observed in budding yeast cells that lack both Tdp1 and Rad1/Rad10 nuclease-dependent repair mechanisms for 3â²-phosphotyrosyl termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), raising the possibility that TDP2 may contribute to the survival of vertebrate cells in the absence of TDP1 and/or the Rad1/Rad10 homolog, ERCC1/XPF.</p><p>In summary, we describe here the first characterization of a TDP2-deleted cell line and demonstrate that TDP2 is the primary if not the only source of 5â²-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase activity in vertebrate cell extracts. Moreover, we show that genetic deletion of <italic>TDP2</italic> results in specific and high sensitivity to the Top2 poison and anticancer agent, etoposide, identifying TDP2 as a critical new component of the cellular defense against Top2-induced DNA damage. Top2 damage not only accounts for the clinical efficacy of Top2 poisons, an important and commonly used class of anticancer agents, but also accounts for some of the commonest site-specific translocations observed in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Consequently, TDP2 activity may thus impact significantly both on the development and subsequent treatment of cancer, and inhibitors of this novel enzyme may have clinical utility.</p></sec>
