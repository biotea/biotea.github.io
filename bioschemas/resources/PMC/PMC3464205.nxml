      <abstract>
        <p>Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) is an autoimmune condition of the eye that sequentially mimics uveitis, retinitis pigmentosa, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy as it progresses to complete blindness. We identified two different missense mutations in the <italic>CAPN5</italic> gene in three ADNIV kindreds. <italic>CAPN5</italic> encodes calpain-5, a calcium-activated cysteine protease that is expressed in retinal photoreceptor cells. Both mutations cause mislocalization from the cell membrane to the cytosol, and structural modeling reveals that both mutations lie within a calcium-sensitive domain near the active site. <italic>CAPN5</italic> is only the second member of the large calpain gene family to cause a human Mendelian disorder, and this is the first report of a specific molecular cause for autoimmune eye disease. Further investigation of these mutations is likely to provide insight into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of common diseases ranging from autoimmune disorders to diabetic retinopathy.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>We care for several families with an inherited form of autoimmune inflammation inside the eye. The patients also develop bleeding, scar tissue, and eventually blindness. Using advanced gene analysis methods, we discovered the cause of this disease is gene mutations in the <italic>CAPN5</italic> gene. This gene makes a protein, calpain-5, which belongs to a family of calcium-activated enzymes that slice other proteins inside cells. Calpain-5 is expressed in the retina, and the disease mutations alter its location inside the cell. Future studies to understand how this protein causes inflammation and bleeding inside the eye will help us develop treatments for this condition and more common eye diseases with inflammation and bleeding.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) is a heritable autoimmune condition. It is characterized by various stages that mimic several much more common eye diseases, including: uveitis, retinitis pigmentosa, proliferative diabetic retinopathy and proliferative vitreoretinopathy <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Mahajan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Together, these diseases account for a significant fraction of visual morbidity and human blindness <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Pascolini1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Resnikoff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Identification of a gene that generates the varied pathological features of these common conditions could have a significant impact on the understanding and treatment of blindness <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Sheffield1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Although there are numerous causative genes for retinitis pigmentosa, only a handful of genes have previously been associated with intraocular inflammation, neovascularization and fibrotic disease <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Because of its similarity to other common eye diseases, ADNIV patients are often misdiagnosed, unless the familial nature of their disease is recognized. Bennett and co-workers described the original ADNIV family, ADNIV-1 in this study <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, in which the characteristic clinical findings were transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion through eight-generations. The disease onset in this family varies between 10 and 30 years of age and the disease course can be divided into five stages, each lasting approximately ten years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003001.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Mahajan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In the first stage, ADNIV is clinically indistinguishable from an autoimmune, non-infectious uveitis <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Caspi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Although the retina appears normal, an abnormality is detectable with electroretinography very early in the course of the disease. In the second stage, retinitis pigmentosa-like photoreceptor degeneration is apparent. In the third stage, retinal neovascularization develops, which is very similar to the pathologic angiogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In the fourth stage, intraocular fibrosis leads to retinal detachment, similar to that seen in proliferative vitreoretinopathy <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Pastor1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the fifth stage, continued inflammation, intraocular hemorrhage, neovascular glaucoma, fibrosis and retinal detachment eventually lead to phthisis and complete blindness. There are no systemic features in this condition. This combination of overlapping clinical conditions is unusual and suggests that the disease-causing mutations may act through multiple pathways.</p>

      <p>Stone and co-workers previously mapped the genetic locus for ADNIV to chromosome 11q13 <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In this study, we identified two new ADNIV families, and these additional subjects provided an opportunity to refine the genetic interval and identify the causative gene. Two different mutations were identified among three ADNIV families in the gene encoding calpain-5, an intracellular calcium-activated cysteine protease with an unknown physiological function.</p>

        <title>Clinical Findings</title>
        <p>The new ADNIV families displayed a phenotype very similar to the original ADNIV-1 pedigree. Specifically, affected members showed all of the previously reported clinical signs of the disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003001.s001">Figure S1</xref>) including: non-infectious uveitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>), early loss of the b-wave on electroretinography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), pigmentary retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g001">Figure 1D, 1E</xref>), cystoid macular edema, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), retinal and iris neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g001">Figure 1H</xref>), epiretinal membrane formation, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), retinal detachment, cataract, neovascular glaucoma and ultimately phthisis and complete blindness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g001">Figure 1I</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Each pedigree was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g002">Figure 2</xref>). There were sixty-one affected subjects in ADNIV-1, seven in ADNIV-2, and thirty-one in ADNIV-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Forty-two of these 99 affected individuals (42%) were male. The clinical severity of the disease was indistinguishable between affected males and females. With the exception of psoriasis in one individual, there were no other systemic, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions present in any of the affected family members.</p>

        <title>Linkage Analysis</title>
        <p>Prior linkage analysis of the ADNIV-1 family mapped the disease-causing mutation to a 22-megabase (chr11: 91,760,018â69,339,635) interval on chromosome 11q13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Genotyping of the ADNIV-2 and ADNIV-3 families with short tandem repeat polymorphisms was consistent with linkage to the same locus. Haplotype analysis was suggestive of an ancestral relationship between ADNIV-1 and ADNIV-2. In addition, two affected individuals in the ADNIV-3 family were found to be recombinant within the disease interval, narrowing it to 6.5 megabases between D11S4139 and D11S1789. High resolution SNP genotyping of ADNIV-1 and ADNIV-3 further reduced the interval to the 6 megabases between rs879380 and D11S1789, a region harboring 86 known genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

        <title>Exome Sequencing</title>
        <p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed using DNA from two affected family members from the ADNIV-1 pedigree who were separated by seven meioses. Only one of the resultant sequence variations met the following four criteria: located within the 6 Mb ADNIV interval, shared by the two affected members of ADNIV-1, not previously reported as a polymorphism, and nonsynonymous. This variant is a guanine to thymine nucleotide change (c.728G&gt;T, p.Arg243Leu) in exon 6 of the <italic>CAPN5</italic> gene (NM_004055) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g003">Figure 3Bâ3D</xref>). A combination of SSCP and Sanger sequencing of <italic>CAPN5</italic> exon 6 verified that this mutation was present in all the affected members and none of the unaffected members of ADNIV-1.</p>
        <p>The coding sequence of <italic>CAPN5</italic> was then sequenced in affected members of the two other ADNIV pedigrees. All affected members of ADNIV-2 were found to harbor the same heterozygous variant (c.728G&gt;T, p.Arg243Leu) found in ADNIV-1, supporting the suspected ancestral relationship between these two families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). All affected members of the ADNIV-3 family, were found to harbor a heterozygous variant in the adjacent codon, a thymine to cytosine change (c.731T&gt;C, p.Leu244Pro) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Both of these putative disease-causing variants in exon 6 of <italic>CAPN5</italic> were easily detectable by SSCP in ADNIV patients, but were absent from all unaffected adult members of the ADNIV families (no asymptomatic minors were tested) as well as 272 ethnically similar control individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g003">Figure 3F</xref>).

        <title>Structural Analysis of Calpain-5 ADNIV Mutations</title>
        <p>Calpain-5 is an intracellular calcium-activated cysteine protease (NP_004046) with evolutionarily conserved domains required for protease activity. Both ADNIV-causing mutations were found in exon 6, which encodes a major part of the catalytic domain and contains two of the three catalytic residues that compose the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Modeling of secondary structure suggests that both the ADNIV-1/2 (p.Arg243Leu) and ADNIV-3 (p.Leu244Pro) mutations lie within a nearby alpha helical domain. The first of these mutations removes a charged residue while the second disrupts the putative helical structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

            <p>A. Both ADNIV mutations (red arrows) are located in exon 6, which encodes a portion of the catalytic domain and two of three catalytic residues (blue arrows). Primary protein sequence analysis shows the ADNIV-1/2 and ADNIV-3 mutations to be 8â9 amino acids upstream of the catalytic histidine residue. Secondary structure modeling shows that the two mutations are within a putative alpha helical domain. One mutated codon results in the loss of a basic residue, while the other introduces a proline into the putative alpha helix. B. Alignment of calpain-5 orthologs shows very high evolutionary conservation of the mutated residues (red arrows). Amino acid mismatches are color-highlighted. C. Twelve human calpain paralogs show significant differences in exon 6 (Black, 100% similarity; Dark grey, 80â100% similarity; Light grey, 60â80% similarity; White, less than 60% similarity). D. Three-dimensional modeling of the catalytic domain shows the location of the active site cleft (red outline). E. Magnified view of the active site cleft shows the catalytic triad (dashed line â blue text) and location of the two mutations (red arrows and text). Both mutations are located within a peptide loop that is homologous to a flexible loop of calpain-1 that undergoes a calcium-induced conformational change in association with regulation of the active site cleft (see text).</p>

        <p>The amino acid sequence of <italic>CAPN5</italic> exon 6 is highly conserved across vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The catalytic residues show 100% conservation among <italic>CAPN5</italic> orthologs. Interestingly, there is also 100% conservation of the Arg243 residue mutated in ADNIV-1/2 and 88% conservation of the Leu244 mutated in ADNIV-3. This small evolutionary divergence at the latter codon is also quite conservative: methionine for leucine in the frog. In contrast, the disease-causing mutation at this codon introduces a new proline bend within a putative alpha helix.</p>
        <p>Previous comparisons of calpain-5 to its human paralogs demonstrated that it has diverged significantly and now belongs to its own subfamily with calpain-6 <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Dear1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This divergence is also evident within exon 6 alone, where the calpain-5 catalytic domain shows relatively low homology to other human calpains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Each of the ADNIV mutant residues is conserved in four or fewer of 12 calpain paralogs, suggesting that the residues mutated in ADNIV are specifically important to calpain-5 function and may physiologically distinguish it from the other calpains. The PolyPhen2 sequence analysis program predicted both ADNIV mutations to have damaging effects on protein function (0.999 for Arg243Leu and 0.998 for Leu244Pro) comparable to an active site Cys81Ser mutation (1.0). The SIFT program predicted the Leu244Pro mutation to be comparably pathogenic (0.04) to Cys81Ser (0.03) but predicted the Arg243Leu mutation to be better tolerated (0.1).</p>
        <p>To better examine the relationship of ADNIV mutations within the calpain-5 catalytic domain, homology modeling to calpain-2 (m-calpain) was used to generate a three-dimensional structure for calpain-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Hanna1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Moldoveanu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Both mutations were outside the active site cleft and relatively far removed from the calcium-binding domains and the binding site of the endogenous inhibitor calpastatin. Interestingly, both the ADNIV-1/2, and ADNIV-3 mutations fell into a region of low electron density, suggesting the presence of a flexible loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). In calpain-1 (Î¼-calpain) models, the homologous loop undergoes calcium-induced conformational changes that regulate the proximity of catalytic residues within the active site cleft <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Moldoveanu2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This putative loop contains both ADNIV mutants and is highly conserved among all calpain-5 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

The transcript was observed at a level of 4.63 fragments per kilobase of exon per million, which places it between the first quartile and the median level of expression for all transcripts observed in the retina. No significant splice variants were detected. Two antibodies against calpain-5 were used to determine whether calpain-5 protein could also be detected in human retinal tissue sections. Both antibodies showed strong calpain-5 expression in the photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003001-g005">Figure 5A, 5B</xref>). There was a punctate pattern of labeling over the nuclei and inner segments with less expression along the outer segments and outer plexiform layer. There was no significant expression in the nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer, or retinal pigment epithelium. The localization to the photoreceptor cells is consistent with both the early electrophysiologic abnormalities and the later photoreceptor degeneration seen in ADNIV patients.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The calpains are an evolutionarily ancient family of calcium dependent intracellular proteases that utilize a cysteine residue in the active site to mediate limited proteolysis.

There is no consensus amino acid sequence or structural motif that is targeted for cleavage by calpains, and as a result it is often difficult to identify the physiologic substrates of these enzymes, including calpain-5 <xref rid="pgen.1003001-DuVerle1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Waghray1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. <italic>Capn5</italic> is expressed during nematode and mouse embryogenesis <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Dear2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

However, prior to this report, limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2A was the only disease shown to be caused in a monogenic fashion by variations in a calpain's protein sequence <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Richard1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The evidence that the two missense mutations we observed in <italic>CAPN5</italic> are responsible for ADNIV is compelling. The gene lies within the critical region previously linked to the disease, and all living subjects in the study who are clinically affected were found to harbor a <italic>CAPN5</italic> mutation in exon 6. Each of these two mutations alters an amino acid in the catalytic domain that has been highly conserved throughout evolution. Neither of these mutations was found among any of the clinically unaffected members of the three kindreds we studied, or among thousands of normal individuals.</p>
      <p>There are interesting similarities and differences between calpain-associated LGMD and ADNIV. In both disorders, the affected cells (skeletal muscle fibers and photoreceptor cells) experience large changes in membrane potential and intracellular calcium concentration as part of their normal behavior. In both disorders, the non-mutant calpain molecules display functionally critical subcellular localization <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Zatz1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Ermolova1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Goll1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Marcilhac1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. A subset of LGMD is associated with leukocyte infiltration into the tissue <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Krahn1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and all cases of ADNIV are marked by severe intraocular inflammation. The differences in these diseases are also noteworthy. Calpain-associated LGMD is inherited in a recessive fashion and appears to result from loss of calpain-3 function <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Richard1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In contrast, ADNIV is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by missense mutations near the active site. Although these mutations could cause disease through haploinsufficiency, it seems more likely that they result in a gain of function of calpain-5 that causes harm to the photoreceptor cells. <italic>Capn5</italic> knockout mice have no observable phenotype <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Franz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and several human neurological disorders have been associated with excess calpain activity <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Zatz1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Vanderklish1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, including photoreceptor degeneration <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Azuma1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A gain of function mechanism for ADNIV is also supported by the unusual inflammation and neovascularization associated with the disease. There are dozens of monogenic disorders that cause the apoptotic death of photoreceptor cells without causing severe intraocular inflammation or neovascularization of the retina. The latter is much more typical of proliferative diabetic retinopathy than it is heritable photoreceptor disease <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It is easier to imagine an unregulated or mislocalized calpain promiscuously activating different signaling pathways, or being released into the extracellular space after photoreceptor death and causing inappropriate angiogenesis and leukocyte recruitment, than it is to imagine a 50% reduction of such a protein causing these dramatic complications.</p>
      <p>Whether caused by a gain or loss of function of <italic>CAPN5</italic>, it is likely that the further elucidation of the pathogenic mechanism of ADNIV will provide important new insight into some of the most important causes of irreversible human blindness: autoimmune uveitis, retinitis pigmentosa, proliferative vitreoretinopathy and diabetic retinopathy. The latter condition alone is responsible for as much as 17% of blindness in some regions of the world <xref rid="pgen.1003001-Resnikoff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The fact that an amino acid change in a single protein can lead to such a phenotype raises the possibility that a common, therapeutically accessible pathway may be shared among these conditions that could be targeted with drugs, antibodies or gene transfer approaches. It is possible that variations in the structure or expression of <italic>CAPN5</italic> cause or modify some of these common disorders and this hypothesis will be important to test in future studies. However, given the extreme phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders, it will be important to study a large number of subjects in such an experiment, to subdivide the patient cohorts into clinically well-characterized groups, and to screen an equal number of ethnically matched controls for each of these groups.</p>
