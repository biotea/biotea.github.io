      <abstract>
        <p id="P3">Autophagy is a catabolic process where lysosomes degrade intracytoplasmic contents transported in double-membraned autophagosomes. Autophagosomes are formed by elongation and fusion of phagophores, which derive from pre-autophagosomal structures. The membrane origins of autophagosomes are unclear and may involve multiple sources, including the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Here we show in mammalian cells that clathrin heavy-chain interacts with Atg16L1, and is involved in the formation of Atg16L1-positive early autophagosome precursors. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated internalisation reduced the formation of both Atg16L1-positive precursors and mature autophagosomes, while Atg16L1 associated with clathrin-coated structures. We tested and demonstrated that the plasma membrane (PM) directly contributes to the formation of early Atg16L1-positive autophagosome precursors. This may be particularly important during periods of increased autophagosome formation, as the plasma membrane may serve as a large membrane reservoir that allows cells periods of autophagosome synthesis at levels many-fold higher than under basal conditions, without compromising other processes.</p>

    <p id="P4">Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process where intracytoplasmic proteins and organelles are engulfed in double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes and then transported to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagosomes are formed by elongation and fusion of phagophores, which are formed from pre-autophagosomal structures. The membrane origins of autophagosomes are unclear and may involve multiple sources, although contributions from the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>. The biogenesis of mammalian (and yeast) autophagosomes involves two ubiquitin-like molecules, Atg12 and LC3/Atg8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. In the first of these reactions, the C-terminal glycine of Atg12 is covalently linked to an internal lysine in Atg5. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate then forms an 800 kDa complex with Atg16L1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>. Atg16L1 localises to the outer surface of the pre-autophagosomal structures, and dissociates from fully formed (mature) autophagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. Thus, Atg16L1-positive vesicles represent pre-autophagosomal structures. In the second ubiquitin-like reaction, LC3 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form lipidated LC3-II, which is specifically targeted to elongating pre-autophagosomal structures and then remains on mature autophagosomes, until after fusion with lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. Accordingly, LC3-II levels, as a function of actin/tubulin or LC3-positive vesicles, reflect autophagosome numbers in the cell. The Atg12-Atg5 complex displays an E3 ligase-like activity for LC3-PE conjugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>. Furthermore, localisation of Atg16L1 complex is an important determinant of the site of LC3 lipidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. Interestingly, a recent genome-wide association study identified a variant of Atg16L1 (T300A) that is overrepresented in Crohn's disease patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>.</p>

        <title>Atg16L1 interacts with clathrin-heavy chain</title>
        <p id="P5">In order to understand the roles of Atg16L1, we performed mass spectrometry analysis on cell lysates immunoprecipitated with an antibody against endogenous Atg16L1, which identified clathrin-heavy chain (a major component of coated vesicles that plays a vital role in the endocytic pathway) as a novel interactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We validated the interaction by performing co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, 1C</xref>). We found that endogenous clathrin-heavy chain interacted both with endogenous or over-expressed Atg16L1, and this interaction was mediated via the N-terminal region of Atg16L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, 1C</xref>). Since Atg5 also interacts with the N-terminal region of Atg16L1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), we tested if over-expression of increasing concentrations of Atg5 altered the clathrin-Atg16L1 interaction. Since we observed no obvious effect of increasing Atg5 expression on clathrin-Atg16L1 interaction, it is likely that Atg5 and clathrin either bind to different sites on Atg16L1, or even to different subsets of Atg16L1 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). We also noted that clathrin heavy-chain interacted with the T300A variant of Atg16L1 with a similar efficiency as the âwild-typeâ Atg16L1, which is not surprising since the variant site is quite far downstream from the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>

        <title>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis regulates early stages of autophagosome formation</title>
        <p id="P6">Having shown that clathrin-heavy chain interacted with the autophagosome precursor marker, Atg16L1, we next tested if early steps in clathrin-mediated endocytosis regulated the initial stages of autophagosome formation. (This question needs to be distinguished from the distinct process where fully formed, mature (Atg16L1-negative) autophagosomes fuse with early and late endosomes to form the hybrid organelles called amphisomes, a step which appears to be important for subsequent autophagosome-lysosome fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). We first tested the effect of knockdown of some key components involved in early endocytosis on autophagosome formation. Changes in the steady state-levels of LC3-II can be altered due to formation and/or degradation. In order to assess changes in LC3-II (autophagosome) formation, one can assess LC3-II levels in the presence of saturating concentrations of bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). Since BafA1 inhibits LC3-II degradation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion, differences in LC3-II levels in response to particular siRNAs in the presence of saturating levels of BafA1 reflect changes in LC3-II (autophagosome) synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1B, S1C</xref>). siRNA knockdown of clathrin-heavy chain, epsin 1, AP2 but not AP1, inhibited the formation of new autophagosomes by about 30%, since these perturbations decreased the LC3-II levels in the presence of bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, 2B</xref>â;â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1D, S1E, S1F</xref>). Epsin is an accessory protein to clathrin that induces membrane curvature, while AP2 and AP1 are clathrin adaptor proteins at the plasma membrane and Golgi, respectively. We noted that the effects of clathrin-heavy chain knockdown on LC3-II levels in the absence of BafA1 varied â this is likely because clathrin knockdown decreases LC3-II formation, which will decrease LC3-II levels in the absence of BafA1, but clathrin knockdown also decreases autophagosome-lysosome fusion/LC3-II degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> (also see below), which will increase LC3-II levels in the absence of BafA1, and the net effect will depend on the relative kinetics of the two systems, which may vary according to the efficiency of knockdown or the different treatment conditions used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>. Our impression was that the effects of clathrin knockdown on synthesis were more pronounced with more effective knockdowns â e.g. two rounds of knockdown for 5 days. Such strategies are known to be required for effective clathrin knockdown, due to its long half-life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P7">In order to provide further support for the role of clathrin in autophagosome formation, given its additional effects that impair autophagosome maturation, we studied the effects of clathrin-heavy chain knockdown in HeLa cells stably expressing an mRFP-GFP-LC3 construct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>. Due to the different pK<sub>a</sub> of the two fluorescent proteins, this construct can be used as a probe for autophagosome maturation. At physiological pH, i.e. in newly formed autophagosomes, both proteins are stable, leading to both red and green fluorescence. Upon acidification, i.e. fusion with the lysosome, green fluorescence is rapidly lost due to the high pK<sub>a</sub> of GFP and only red fluorescence remains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>. Consistent with our LC3-II blotting data, clathrin-heavy chain knockdown resulted in an increase in the numbers of autophagosomes (red and green positive vesicles) and a decrease in the numbers of autolysosomes (red positive/green-negative) in the absence of BafA1 (due to decreased delivery of autophagosomes to lysosomes), but results in a decrease in the number of autophagosomes (about 30%) in the presence of BafA1 (due to impaired autophagosome formation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). As we saw with clathrin-heavy chain knockdown, AP2 knockdown also reduced autophagosome formation using this assay, while AP1 knockdown had no effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1G</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P8">The effects of clathrin-heavy chain, epsin or AP2 knockdown on autophagosome formation (LC3-II levels under BafA1 conditions) were also obvious under autophagy induction conditions (trehalose treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> or starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2A, S2B, S2C</xref>)), where these knockdowns all reduced new autophagosome formation by about 30% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2A, S2B, S2C</xref>). Consistent with our LC3 western blot data, we also observed a decrease in the proportion of cells with &gt;50 endogenous LC3 vesicles under starvation conditions upon clathrin-heavy chain or AP2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Similarly, we also saw a decrease in the proportion of cells transfected with tomato-LC3 with &gt;50 LC3-vesicles in trehalose-treated cells with clathrin-heavy chain or epsin knockdowns or in untreated cells with AP2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3A, S3B, S3C</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P9">The block in autophagic flux with clathrin-heavy chain, epsin or AP2 knockdown also correlated with an increase in aggregation of a model aggregate-prone protein, huntingtin exon-1 with 74 polyglutamine repeats (Q74) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, which is a potent autophagy substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3D, S3E</xref> shows epsin 1 and AP2 data and the clathrin data were published previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) â since aggregation is a concentration-dependent phenomenon, the proportion of cells with these aggregates increases with a wide range of autophagy inhibitors and decreases with autophagy inducers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. We also found that clathrin or AP2 knockdown increased the levels of endogenous p62, another autophagy substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3F, S3G</xref>). Clathrin knockdown also significantly increased the proportion of cells with endogenous p62 aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3G</xref>). However, since autophagic substrates will accumulate if there is either impaired autophagosome formation, and/or decreased delivery of autophagosomes to lysosomes, these substrate accumulation assays cannot distinguish between these scenarios.</p>

        <title>Influence of clathrin-mediated endocytosis on Atg16L1-positive autophagosome precursors</title>
        <p id="P10">Since the knockdown of clathrin-heavy chain, epsin or AP2 inhibited the formation of new autophagosomes, we next examined their effects on the formation of autophagosome precursors, as visualised by Atg16L1-positive structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. Endogenous Atg16L1 shows a punctate staining pattern upon autophagy induction (e.g. starvation, rapamycin or trehalose treatments), corresponding to an increase in the formation of precursor structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>â,â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S4A, S4B</xref> and data not shown). Furthermore, endogenous Atg16L1 vesicle numbers were not increased by BafA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S4C</xref>), suggesting that this readout is not affected by perturbations that impair the lysosomal degradation of mature autophagosomes. We observed that knockdown of clathrin-heavy chain, epsin or AP2 (but not AP1) resulted in a ~30% decrease in the Atg16L1 vesicle formation under starvation conditions, suggesting a block in the formation of pre-autophagosomal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B, C, D</xref>â,â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S4A, S4B</xref>). Knockdown of clathrin-heavy chain, epsin or AP2 also decreased the numbers of Atg16L1 structures associated with over-expressed Atg16L1 (data not shown; note that we found that low levels of Atg16L1 overexpression (400-750ng per 6 well) did not inhibit autophagosome formation, as has been reported for high-level viral overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). We found that the N-terminal deletion mutant of Atg16L1 (232-607) that did not interact with clathrin formed significantly fewer vesicles, compared to the wild-type protein or C-terminal deletion mutant that can bind clathrin (2-275) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E, 3F</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P11">During the autophagosome formation process, LC3-II is recruited onto the Atg16L1-positive pre-autophagosomal structures, which ultimately fuse to form autophagosomes, at which point the Atg16L1 complex is removed and recycled. We next performed co-localisation experiments with GFP-Atg16L1 and tomato-LC3 vesicles, to assess the progression of autophagosome formation from early pre-autophagosomal structures (Atg16L1-positive/LC3-negative) to maturing autophagosomes (Atg16L1-positive/LC3-positive). We found that clathrin-heavy chain, epsin or AP2 knockdown decreased the co-localisation of GFP-Atg16L1 vesicles with tomato-LC3 vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3G, 3H, 3I</xref>), which likely suggests that these proteins regulate the formation of autophagosomes at a very early stage in the pathway.</p>

        <title>Plasma membrane contributes to autophagosome precursors</title>
        <p id="P12">During our analyses of pre-autophagosomal structure formation, we often found Atg16L1 vesicles close to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This observation was supported by TIRF microscopy (TIRFM), which enables selective visualisation of thin regions, such as the plasma membrane (and the cytoplasmic area immediately beneath it). TIRFM with GFP-Atg16L1 and mRFP-tagged GPi (glycophosphatidylinositol) protein (found in small microdomains at the plasma membrane) revealed many Atg16L1 vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) that also co-localised significantly with mRFP-GPi structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that the GFP-Atg16L1 vesicles were at, or very close to, the plasma membrane. Indeed, immuno-gold electron microscopy (immuno-EM) analysis of GFP-Atg16L1-transfected cells showed Atg16L1 labelling on clathrin-coated vesicle profiles near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, untreated panels</xref>). These data, together with our earlier observation that autophagosome formation is impaired upon inhibition of very early endocytic trafficking, suggested that plasma membrane might be a source of membrane for the pre-autophagosomal structures.</p>
        <p id="P13">We next used different assays to assess the role of plasma membrane as a membrane contributor for autophagosome initiation. We used the cholera toxin-subunit B internalisation assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> to assess if the plasma membrane fused with GFP-Atg16L1 vesicles, as visualised by live-cell or fixed-cell microscopy and double-labelling immuno-EM. This assay relies on the binding of cholera toxin to the outside of the plasma membrane and its subsequent internalisation to track whether the plasma membrane is contributing to early precursor structures. Cholera toxin internalisation into HeLa cells is significantly attenuated by inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>. At very early time points, immediately after incubation with the cholera toxin, we observed clear labelling of the plasma membrane, and vesicles immediately internalising from the plasma membrane were often fused with GFP-Atg16L1 vesicles close to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>â,â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM">Supplementary Information, Fig. S5A, S5B, Movie S1</xref>). We observed many GFP-Atg16L1 vesicles close to the cell surface that co-localised with vesicles positive for cholera toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, 5B</xref>â,â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S5A, S5B</xref>). We noted that many of the small GFP-Atg16L1 vesicles close to the plasma membrane were LC3-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A yellow arrows on the merged panel</xref>), suggesting that they were very early precursors that later acquired the characteristics of phagophore when they were also LC3-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A blue arrows on the merged panel</xref>). The number of GFP-Atg16L1 vesicles decreased with 3-methyladenine treatment which blocks autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S5C</xref>). The GFP-Atg16L1 vesicles co-localised with other early autophagosomal markers like Atg5 and Atg12 (but did not co-localise with ER (BiP) or Golgi (GM130) markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S5D, S6A, S6B, S6C</xref>), and also did not colocalise with EEA1, an early endosomal marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This suggests that the GFP-Atg16L1-positive structures are very early autophagosome precursors that are associated with endocytic vesicles that have recently budded from the plasma membrane. These endocytic vesicles are likely not early endosomes (which are EEA1-positive) but are more analogous to the endocytic vesicle precursors that precede endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>. We observed similar results when we performed the cholera toxin internalisation assay with endogenous Atg16L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), GFP-Atg16L1 stable cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S7A, S7B</xref>), endogenous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) or overexpressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S7C</xref>) Atg5, or endogenous Atg12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). We found that vesicles containing 2-275 Atg16L1 (that binds clathrin) co-localised with cholera toxin vesicles, similar to wild-type Atg16L1, while this was not the case for 232-607 Atg16L1 (that cannot bind clathrin) (even though the cholera toxin-EEA1 co-localisation was similar for all three Atg16L1 constructs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S7D</xref>). Immuno-EM also showed internalised vesicles close to the plasma membrane labelled with both cholera toxin and GFP-Atg16L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S7E</xref>) supporting the immunofluorescence data. Similar results to the cholera toxin internalisation assay was observed when we used two other plasma membrane markers, the slow internalising dye, CellMask Orange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>) or the fast internalising FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S7F</xref>), which both showed that vesicles derived from the plasma membrane often fused with GFP-Atg16L1 vesicles near the plasma membrane.</p>
        <p id="P14">Importantly, clathrin heavy-chain or AP2 knockdown significantly decreased the co-localisation of Atg16L1-positive vesicles with cholera toxin-labelled vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B,C</xref>), consistent with our earlier data showing that knockdown of clathrin heavy-chain or AP2 inhibited autophagosome formation. (We tested clathrin-mediated endocytosis in our system by performing transferrin-internalisation assays and found that clathrin-heavy chain and AP2 knockdown conditions we used significantly impaired clathrin-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S8A</xref>)). The reason why the effects of clathrin heavy-chain or AP2 knockdown may not be even stronger than those we observed, is that non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis routes also contribute to the uptake of cholera toxin, and it is possible that these may also regulate autophagosome formation. Also, it is difficult to obtain strong functional knockdown with these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P15">Here, we have identified for the first time a direct contribution of the plasma membrane to the formation of pre-autophagosomal structures via clathrin-mediated internalisation of vesicles derived from the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that this is mediated via the interaction of Atg16L1 and clathrin heavy chain. Since AP2 also interacted with Atg16L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), we performed immunoprecipitation assays in cells with clathrin-heavy chain or AP2 knockdown. We observed a decrease in the Atg16L1-clathrin interaction with AP2 knockdown (but no change in the Atg16L1-AP2 interaction with clathrin-heavy chain knock down), suggesting that AP2 may mediate the Atg16L1-clathrin interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). This is not surprising, since AP2 links clathrin to the membrane and also mediates its interactions with other key endocytic proteins. It remains to be established exactly how Atg16L1 is specifically targeted to clathrin-coated vesicles. Since AP2 knockdown did not completely abolish the Atg16L1-clathrin interaction, it is possible that other adaptor/accessory proteins might be involved in mediating the Atg16L1-clathrin interaction, identification of which is however beyond the scope of this paper.</p>

        <title>Effect of endocytic vesicle scission on phagophore formation</title>
        <p id="P16">In order to further characterise the importance of endocytosis in phagophore formation, we inhibited endocytic vesicle scission with dominant-negative (DN) dynamin-II (K44A dynamin-II) and observed a decrease in the number of Atg16L1 vesicles, similar to clathrin-heavy chain or AP2 KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S8B</xref>). DN-dynamin treatment of cells analysed for cholera toxin-Atg16L1 vesicle co-localisation resulted in the formation of tubular morphologies with the cholera toxin, consistent with previous findings, and Atg16L1 was seen on these structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S8C</xref>). The DN-dynamin II also redistributed Atg16L1 close to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, as judged by significantly enhanced Atg16L1-PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> colocalisation by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information, Fig. S8D</xref>). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) is a well-recognised plasma membrane lipid, which is frequently used as a plasma membrane marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, and the PH domain of phospholipase CÎ´ fused to GFP (PLC(PH)-GFP) is routinely used to recognise PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in this context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>. Consistent with these observations, dynasore, a cell permeable dynamin inhibitor, caused a marked increase in the Atg16L1-clathrin interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C</xref>), which correlated with a dramatic accumulation of Atg16L1 in clathrin-coated structures close to the plasma membrane at the EM level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Thus, it is likely that Atg16L1 localises to the clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles close to the plasma membrane prior to scission, and our data are compatible with a requirement for vesicle scission for phagophore maturation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P17">The membrane origin(s) of autophagosomes is one of the critical questions in the autophagy field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. While contributions from multiple membrane sources are widely acknowledged to be a likely possibility, the mechanism by which they give rise to mature autophagosomes is largely unknown. Our data suggest that plasma membrane contributes to early autophagosomal precursor structures, a phenomenon that is dependent on the association of . Atg16L1-positive vesicles with the plasma membrane via Atg16L1-AP2/clathrin heavy chain interactions. Subsequent scission of the Atg16L1/clathrin/AP2-associated structures, leading to the formation of early endosomal-like intermediates is a crucial step that enables the liberation and maturation of these Atg16L1 vesicles into autophagosomes. These autophagosome precursors we see may be membrane structures that precede the phagophores, and these represent an even earlier stage in autophagosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>). The ability of plasma membrane to contribute to autophagosome formation may be particularly important during periods of increased autophagy, as the large surface area of the plasma membrane may serve as a large membrane reservoir that allows cells periods of autophagosome synthesis at levels many-fold higher than under basal conditions, without compromising other processes.</p>

Clathrin interacts with the N-terminus of Atg16L1, similar to Atg12-Atg5. Total lysates were run alongside as controls for protein input. <bold>C.</bold> HeLa cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with Atg16L1 antibody (+Ab) or no antibody (No Ab) and immunoblotted with anti-clathrin, anti-AP2 and anti-Atg16L1 antibodies. Total cell lysates (TL) were also blotted for input controls. Endogenous Atg16L1 interacts with clathrin-heavy chain and AP2. <bold>D.</bold> HeLa cells transfected with Flag-Atg16L1 and increasing concentrations of Atg5 for 24h were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Flag antibody (Atg16L1) and immunoblotted with anti-clathrin, anti-Flag and anti-Atg5 antibodies. Atg5 overexpression neither interferes with, nor increases, clathrin-Atg16L1 binding. TL â total cell lysate.</p>

        <p><bold>A.</bold> HeLa cells transfected for 24 h with GFP-Atg16L1 (green) and CFP-LC3 (blue) were incubated with Alexa fluor-555-conjugated cholera toxin-subunit B (red) for 15 minutes at 4Â°C (allowing toxin binding to the plasma membrane). Then cells were incubated at 37Â°C (which allows cholera toxin internalization) for 10 minutes and fixed for confocal analysis. Vesicles positive for Atg16L1 and cholera toxin are yellow (also see high magnification images). Note that the small Atg16L1 vesicles co-localising with cholera toxin are negative for LC3 (as marked with yellow arrows) and the Atg16L1 vesicles co-localising both with cholera toxin and LC3 (marked with blue arrows) are shown in the magnified panels on the right. Scale bar â 10 Î¼m. <bold>B.</bold> HeLa cells transfected for 24 h with GFP-Atg16L1 (green) were incubated with Alexa fluor-555-conjugated cholera toxin-subunit B (red) as in <bold>A</bold> after which they were fixed, immunostained for endogenous EEA1 (blue) and analysed by confocal microscopy. Vesicles positive for Atg16L1 and cholera toxin B are yellow (white arrows) and vesicles positive for both EEA1 and cholera toxin are purple (blue arrows) and is shown in the high magnification images. Graph shows percentage co-localisation. n = 20 cells. Scale bar â 10 Î¼m. <bold>C.</bold> HeLa cells treated with HBSS for 6 h were incubated Alexa fluor-555-labelled cholera toxin-subunit B (red) as in <bold>A</bold>. Cells were then fixed, and immunostained for endogenous Atg16L1 (green) and endogenous EEA1 (blue). Cells were analysed as in <bold>B</bold> and graph shows quantitation. Scale bar â 10 Î¼m. Arrows show Atg16L1-cholera toxin co-localisation. Triangles show EEA1-cholera toxin co-localisation. n = 20 cells. <bold>D.</bold> HeLa cells treated with HBSS for 6 h were incubated with Alexa fluor-555-labelled cholera toxin-subunit B (red) as in <bold>A</bold>. Cells were then fixed and immunostained for endogenous Atg5 (green) or endogenous Atg12 (green). Co-localisation of the Atg5 (n = 18 cells) or Atg12 vesicles (n = 39 cells) with cholera toxin is shown in yellow (arrows) and quantitated in graph. Scale bar â 10 Î¼m. All error bars in the graphs represent SEM.</p>

        <p><bold>A.</bold> HeLa cells transfected for 24 h with GFP-Atg16L1 (green) were incubated with CellMask orange plasma membrane stain for 5 minutes at 37Â°C, after which they were then imaged immediately (in an incubated chamber at 37Â°C). A time series following fusion of a CellMask orange vesicle (red) with GFP-Atg16L1 vesicle (green) is shown. Scale bar â 5 Î¼m. A higher magnification image showing co-localisation (yellow) of GFP-Atg16L1 vesicle (green) with CellMask orange-positive vesicle (red), that are marked by arrows is also shown in the top and bottom panels. <bold>B, C.</bold> HeLa cells transfected with control, clathrin-heavy chain, AP1 or AP2 siRNA for 72 h were subsequently transfected with GFP-Atg16L1 (green) together with the siRNA for the next 24 h. The cells were then incubated with Alexa fluor-555-conjugated cholera toxin-subunit B (red) for 15 minutes at 4Â°C, followed by further incubation at 37Â°C for 10 minutes, after which the cells were fixed for confocal analysis. The co-localisation (yellow) of GFP-Atg16L1 (green) with cholera toxin (red) in control or clathrin-heavy chain knockdown is shown, which is quantitated in the graph in <bold>C</bold>. n = 25 cells. *** - p=0.0002 for clathrin-heavy chain KD and &lt;0.0001 for AP2 KD.

        <title>Effect of endocytic vesicle scission on phagophore formation</title>
        <p><bold>A.</bold> Hela cells transfected with two rounds of control, clathrin-heavy chain or AP2 siRNA for 4 d were collected for immunoprecipitation with anti-Atg16L1 antibody (IP). Western blot for total lysate (bottom) and IP (top) were performed using anti-Atg16L1 and anti-clathrin antibodies. Note the decrease in Atg16L1-Clathrin interaction with AP2 knockdown. Graph shows quantitation of the Atg16L1-clathrin or Atg16L1-AP2 with control, clathrin-heavy chain or AP2 knockdown from two independent experiments. <bold>B.</bold> HeLa cells transfected for 24 h with Flag-tagged wild-type Atg16L1, GFP-PLC(PH) together with empty vector (Control) or dominant-negative dynamin-II mutant (K44A Dynamin; DN-Dyn) were fixed and analysed by confocal microscopy. Note co-localisation of Atg16L1 with PLC(PH) at the plasma membrane which is quantified in the graph. * - p&lt;0.01. Scale bar â 5 Î¼m. n = 20 cells. <bold>C.</bold> Hela cells treated with HBSS alone or HBSS with 80 Î¼M dynasore for 5 h were collected for immunoprecipitation with anti-Atg16L1 antibody (IP). Western blot analyses for total lysate (TL) and IP were performed using anti-Atg16L1 and anti clathrin antibodies. Note the strong Atg16L1-Clathrin interaction with dynasore treatment. Graph shows quantitation from two independent experiments. All error bars in the graphs represent SEM. <bold>D.</bold> Representation of plasma membrane contribution to autophagosome precursor formation. Cholera toxin is internalized by clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytosis. Clathrin knockdown significantly decreases cholera toxin uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>. Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) budding immediately from the plasma membrane (EEA1-negative) are precursors to early endosomes (EE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> (EEA1-positive). Previous studies showed that delivery of fully formed autophagosomes to lysosomes requires fusion of such autophagosomes with early or late endosomes/multi vesicular bodies (LE/MVB) to form amphisomes, which are Atg16L1-negative, LC3-positive and positive for endosomal markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> (red arrows). We show here that inhibition of clathrin-dependent internalization inhibits formation of early Atg16L1-positive precursors that mature to form phagophores and later autophagosomes (blue arrows). These Atg16L1-vesicles were positive for other early autophagosomal markers (Atg5 and Atg12), but not early endosomal markers (EEA1). AP2 is a clathrin adaptor at the plasma membrane while AP1 localises to TGN and endosomes.</p>
