      <abstract>
        <p>We recently demonstrated that WRAP53Î² acts as a key regulator of ubiquitin-dependent repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Here, we applied the proximity ligation assay (PLA) to show that at such breaks WRAP53Î² accumulates in close proximity to Î³H2AX and, furthermore as demonstrated by their co-immunoprecipitation (IP) binds to Î³H2AX, in a manner dependent on the ATM and ATR kinases. Moreover, formation of complexes between MDC1 and both its partners RNF8 and phosphorylated ATM was visualized. The interaction of MDC1 with RNF8, but not with ATM requires WRAP53Î², suggesting that WRAP53Î² facilitates the former interaction without altering phosphorylation of MDC1 by ATM. Furthermore, our findings highlight PLA as a more sensitive method for the analysis of recruitment of repair factors and complex formation at DNA breaks that are difficult to detect using conventional immunofluorescence.</p>

        <title>Ubiquitin-mediated repair of DNA double-strand breaks</title>
        <p>The human genome is under constant threat from various endogenous and exogenous sources. If double-strand breaks, one of the most severe types of DNA damage, are not repaired properly and in a timely manner, they may contribute to the development of degenerative diseases and cancer.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> To counteract such potentially life-threatening events, cells have evolved several sophisticated mechanisms of DNA repair, of which homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining are used to repair double-strand breaks.</p>
        <p>Both these pathways require numerous factors that accumulate at the site of damage under regulation primarily by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, either of the repair factors themselves or of other proteins associated with the damaged DNA, such as histones. These modifications enable repair proteins to interact in an appropriate manner. For example, upon double-strand break formation, the histone variant H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated at Serine 139 (termed Î³H2AX) by the ATM/ATR/DNA-PKcs kinases,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> which enables it to bind MDC1 and recruit this factor to the site of DNA damage.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Subsequent phosphorylation of MDC1 (on its TQXF motifs) by ATM promotes binding of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4,5</sup></xref> Together with RNF168, RNF8 catalyzes ubiquitylation of histones in the chromatin flanking the double-strand break, a process critical for assembly of the downstream repair factors BRCA1, RAD51 and 53BP1.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4,5</sup></xref></p>

        <title>The WD40 protein WRAP53Î² orchestrates ubiquitin-mediated repair</title>
        <p>Proteins containing WD40 domains consisting of several repeats approximately 40 amino acids long, with a C-terminal tryptophan (W) - aspartic acid (D), often act as scaffolds for large protein complexes. The repeats form a circular Î²-propeller structure, allowing several proteins to interact with the domain simultaneously.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6,7</sup></xref></p>
        <p>The gene encoding one such protein, WRAP53Î² (WD40-encoding RNA antisense to p53), is located on chromosome 17p13 and overlaps the p53 gene in a head-to-head fashion.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> This gene was shown in our laboratory to also encode WRAP53Î±, which regulates the expression of p53 RNA.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> WRAP53Î± is produced when transcription is initiated from exon 1Î±, one of the 3 alternative starting exons (1Î±, 1Î², 1Î³) in the gene, whereas transcription starting from exon 1Î² gives rise to WRAP53Î², which acts independently of WRAP53Î± and does not regulate p53. Instead this latter protein facilitates interactions between and localization of factors involved in splicing, telomere elongation and DNA repair,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9-12</sup></xref> as well as playing a critical role in the structural maintenance of the nuclear organelles known as Cajal bodies.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Mutations within the WD40 domain of WRAP53Î² cause a rare progressive congenital disorder referred to as dyskeratosis congenita, the symptoms of which include bone marrow failure, premature aging and predisposition for cancer.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In addition, loss of WRAP53Î² function has been associated with the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> as well as with reduced survival and radioresistance in patients with head and neck cancer.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Moreover, single nucleotide polymorphisms in <italic>WRAP53</italic> are correlated with an elevated risk for and poorer survival from various sporadic tumors, including ovarian and breast cancer.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15-17</sup></xref></p>
        <p>We recently demonstrated that WRAP53Î² acts as a scaffold for MDC1 and RNF8 during DNA double-strand break repair, binding these proteins simultaneously via its highly conserved WD40 domain, and thereby facilitating their interaction and the accumulation of RNF8 at double-strand breaks.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> RNF8 is the first E3 ligase to be recruited to DNA breaks and WRAP53Î² is thus required for ubiquitylation at sites of DNA damage and assembly of downstream repair proteins, including 53BP1, BRCA1 and RAD51. Consequently, loss of WRAP53Î² disrupts repair by homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining and enhances the frequency of spontaneous DNA breaks, highlighting its major role in the repair of double-strand breaks.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>

        <title>The proximity ligation assay as a tool to visualize factors at DNA double-strand breaks</title>
        <p>Recruitment of repair proteins to DNA lesions caused by ionizing radiation (IR) can be assessed from the formation of immunofluorescent foci representing their local accumulation, referred to as IR-induced foci. However, not all repair proteins form accumulations that are detectable in this manner.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>
        <p>The <italic>in situ</italic> proximity ligation assay (PLA) allows direct visualization, as well as quantification and precise subcellular localization of protein-protein interactions/associations in fixed cells. The proteins of interest are targeted by specific antibodies conjugated with oligonucleotides and if in close proximity, ligation of the oligonucleotide moieties creates a DNA sequence that can be amplified exponentially by PCR to obtain powerful signal amplification. In this manner, each protein-protein association generates a fluorescent signal detectable under the fluorescence microscope.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p>
        <p>The present investigation was designed to evaluate whether PLA can be applied to monitor repair proteins at sites of DNA damage that do not form detectable IR-induced foci. Employing this procedure, we confirmed our previous findings and achieved deeper insight into the involvement of WRAP53Î² in the DNA damage response cascade.</p>

        <title>PLA visualizes the localization and interactions of DNA repair proteins</title>
        <p>To assess whether PLA can detect repair proteins at sites of damage, we initially applied this method to MDC1 and Î³H2AX (a marker of DNA damage), which are known to interact only at sites of DNA damage. Localization of MDC1 to DNA lesions was first confirmed by immunofluorescent staining that, only after irradiation, revealed foci that exactly overlapped Î³H2AX foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001"><bold>Fig.Â 1A</bold></xref>).

</p>
        <p>No PLA signals indicative of interaction between Î³H2AX and MDC1 were detected in non-irradiated cells. In contrast, several such signals were detected following irradiation and these Î³H2AX-MDC1 PLA signals yielded a very similar pattern as foci formation of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001"><bold>Fig.Â 1B</bold></xref>). Knockdown of H2AX or MDC1 or inhibition of H2AX phosphorylation with an inhibitor of ATM reduced the number of these signals, indicating that the method is both specific and sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001"><bold>Fig.Â 1B</bold></xref>). Similar results were obtained with the repair protein 53BP1 and Î³H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001"><bold>Fig.Â 1C</bold></xref>) and moreover, following laser-microirradiation these proteins associated specifically at the laser stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001"><bold>Fig.Â 1D</bold></xref>). Clearly, PLA can be used to visualize repair proteins at sites of DNA damage in fixed cells.</p>

        <title>PLA reveals an association between WRAP53Î² and Î³H2AX at DNA double-strand breaks</title>
        <p>Recently, we identified WRAP53Î² as a novel player in the DNA damage response that orchestrates ubiquitin-dependent assembly of repair factors at double-strand breaks.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Although utilizing both immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) we could demonstrate that WRAP53Î² accumulates at sites of damage,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> most WRAP53Î² antibodies do not provide visualization of this protein in repair foci. On the other hand, PLA utilizing one such antibody revealed an association between WRAP53Î² and Î³H2AX in response to irradiation, i.e. accumulation of WRAP53Î² at sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002"><bold>Fig.Â 2A</bold></xref>). This association was specific, since no PLA signals were obtained when the WRAP53Î² and Î³H2AX antibodies were combined with mouse or rabbit IgG antibodies, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002"><bold>Fig.Â 2A</bold></xref>). In laser micro-irradiated cells this association was observed only at laser stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002"><bold>Fig.Â 2B</bold></xref>), a localization also confirmed by immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002"><bold>Fig.Â 2C</bold></xref>). Together, these findings show that PLA can be used to visualize recruitment of WRAP53Î² to sites of DNA damage, also in cases when this protein is undetectable in IR-induced foci.

        <p>To determine the region(s) of WRAP53Î² that interacts with Î³H2AX, a series of EGFP-WRAP53Î² deletion and mutation constructs was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003"><bold>Fig.Â 3C</bold></xref>). Deletion mutants of WRAP53Î² containing only the N-, WD40- or C-region all failed to bind Î³H2AX, indicating that several regions of WRAP53Î² are involved in binding Î³H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003"><bold>Fig.Â 3D</bold></xref>). Alternatively, the binding site(s) could be located in the borderlines of the WRAP53Î² deletions. To test this idea, another set of WRAP53Î² deletion constructs was used, in which the borderline sequences were intact. Deletion of either the N- (ÎN149) or C-terminal (ÎC93) region flanking the WD40 domain of WRAP53Î² prevented the interaction with Î³H2AX, while a construct lacking only the glycin-rich sequence (ÎC15) was fully capable of binding to Î³H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003"><bold>Fig.Â 3E</bold></xref>). Thus, the amino acids 1â533 of WRAP53Î² are critical for efficient binding to Î³H2AX.</p>
        <p>Missense mutations in WRAP53Î² cause the cancer predisposition-syndrome dyskeratosis congenita.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> These mutations disrupt the folding of WRAP53Î² by the chaperonin TRiC/CCT (TCP-1 Ring Complex, also called CCT for chaperonin containing TCP-1), which has been suggested to cause the defective function of WRAP53Î² in dyskeratosis congenita.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Interestingly, when analyzing these mutants for binding to Î³H2AX, none of them could interact with Î³H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003"><bold>Fig.Â 3F</bold></xref>). This indicates that TRiC-dependent folding of WRAP53Î² is required for binding to Î³H2AX and that impaired WRAP53Î²-Î³H2AX interaction may contribute to dyskeratosis congenita.</p>
        <p>To further characterize the interaction between WRAP53Î² and Î³H2AX, we explored what factors that regulate this interaction. Applying both PLA and IP, the interaction between WRAP53Î² and Î³H2AX was shown to be markedly reduced by inhibition of ATM or ATR, whereas inhibition of DNA-PK or PARP or, alternatively, siRNA depletion of the DNA repair factors MDC1, RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1 or RAD51 had no influence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003"><bold>Fig.Â 3G-I</bold></xref>). Thus, in response to DNA damage, WRAP53Î² associates with Î³H2AX in a manner dependent on TRiC, ATM and ATR, but no downstream repair factors.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we introduce the novel PLA procedure for visualization of proteins and their association at sites of DNA damage. This method accurately detects complexes between the established repair proteins MDC1 and 53BP1 and Î³H2AX at such lesions and is more powerful than traditional immunofluorescent staining in cases where IR-induced foci are difficult to detect, as demonstrated for the repair factor WRAP53Î². In addition, application of PLA to laser micro-irradiated cells confirmed that these protein interactions occur at sites of DNA damage (laser stripes).</p>
      <p>Further characterization revealed that WRAP53Î² and Î³H2AX are co-precipitated by IP and that WRAP53Î² binds Î³H2AX in a manner dependent on ATM and ATR. These findings are in agreement with our previous observations that accumulation of WRAP53Î² in repair foci depends on the ATM and ATR kinases.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> We previously showed that the WD40 domain of WRAP53Î² is responsible for binding MDC1 and RNF8.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Our current findings demonstrate that expression of a larger region of WRAP53Î² (amino acids 1â533 containing the proline-rich region and the WD40 domain) is required for interaction with Î³H2AX.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we show that single amino acid mutations in WRAP53Î² found in patients with dyskeratosis congenita<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> completely disrupt the capacity of this protein to bind Î³H2AX. Interestingly, it was recently shown that the chaperonin TRiC, which is involved in the folding of difficult-to-fold proteins, controls the folding and function of WRAP53Î².<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> By binding its WD40 domain, TRiC folds WRAP53Î², which enables binding between WRAP53Î² and the telomerase RNA component TERC and allows the subsequent function of WRAP53Î² in telomere elongation.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Our finding that dyskeratosis congenita-mutants of WRAP53Î² are unable to bind Î³H2AX indicates that TRiC-mediated folding of WRAP53Î² is required for Î³H2AX binding and opens the possibility that loss of WRAP53Î²-Î³H2AX interaction and disturbed DNA repair could contribute to the pathogenesis of dyskeratosis congenita.</p>
      <p>Since accumulation of WRAP53Î² in repair foci requires the MDC1 protein, it was surprising that knockdown of MDC1 did not attenuate WRAP53Î²-Î³H2AX PLA signals. Possibly, WRAP53Î² can interact with Î³H2AX in the absence of MDC1, but that extensive accumulation of WRAP53Î² in repair foci requires MDC1. Moreover, recruitment of different pools of WRAP53Î² to double-strand breaks may involve different factors. In cells containing a site-specific DNA double-strand break introduced by the I-PpoI endonuclease, ChIP revealed that a portion of WRAP53Î² accumulated in the vicinity of the breakpoint and overlapping Î³H2AX-positive sites, whereas another portion of WRAP53Î² accumulated at the breakpoint site itself, a region normally negative for Î³H2AX.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Moreover, these different pools of WRAP53Î² remained for different lengths of time at these two sites, indicating that the recruitment of WRAP53Î² to DNA breaks is regulated in different ways.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we tested our earlier proposal that by facilitating binding between RNF8 and MDC1, WRAP53Î² is required for recruitment of RNF8 to double-strand breaks and the subsequent ubiquitylation of the flanking chromatin.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Both PLA and IP revealed that WRAP53Î² interacts with RNF8 and MDC1 in a manner independent of DNA damage and ATM. Knockdown of WRAP53Î² abrogated the interaction between MDC1 and RNF8 without affecting binding between MDC1 and phosphorylated ATM. Thus, this loss of binding between RNF8 and MDC1 in the absence of WRAP53Î² is not due to attenuated phosphorylation of MDC1, but rather, WRAP53Î² appears to facilitate re-localization of RNF8 to sites of DNA damage and its subsequent interaction with phosphorylated MDC1. Possibly, such re-localization to DNA breaks involves binding between WRAP53Î² and Î³H2AX.</p>
      <p>In summary, we demonstrate here that PLA allows sensitive monitoring of the localization of and association between proteins at DNA breaks. Moreover, WRAP53Î² interacts with Î³H2AX at sites of DNA damage, and also enables direct binding between MDC1 and RNF8 without altering the association between MDC1 and ATM.</p>
