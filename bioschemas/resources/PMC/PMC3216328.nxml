        <p>Inhibition of p110Î± or of the downstream PI3K signaling pathway components PDK1 and Akt, as well as phosphoinositide sequestration, blocks invadopodia formation in breast cancer cells.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Invadopodia are extracellular matrixâdegrading protrusions formed by invasive cancer cells that are thought to function in cancer invasion. Although many invadopodia components have been identified, signaling pathways that link extracellular stimuli to invadopodia formation remain largely unknown. We investigate the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling during invadopodia formation. We find that in human breast cancer cells, both invadopodia formation and degradation of a gelatin matrix were blocked by treatment with PI3K inhibitors or sequestration of D-3 phosphoinositides. Functional analyses revealed that among the PI3K family proteins, the class I PI3K catalytic subunit p110Î±, a frequently mutated gene product in human cancers, was selectively involved in invadopodia formation. The expression of p110Î± with cancerous mutations promoted invadopodia-mediated invasive activity. Furthermore, knockdown or inhibition of PDK1 and Akt, downstream effectors of PI3K signaling, suppressed invadopodia formation induced by p110Î± mutants. These data suggest that PI3K signaling via p110Î± regulates invadopodia-mediated invasion of breast cancer cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Degradation of ECM that is present in the basement membrane and tumor stroma is essential for local invasion and formation of metastatic sites by malignant cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessenbrock et al., 2010</xref>). Invadopodia, which were first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen (1989)</xref>, are ECM-degrading membrane protrusions formed on the ventral surface of invasive cancer cells and are thought to play a role in cancer cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamaguchi et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weaver, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buccione et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Madsen and Sahai, 2010</xref>). Invadopodia have been observed in a variety of invasive cancer cell lines, including mammary adenocarcinoma, colon carcinoma, melanoma, and glioma as well as in primary invasive tumor cells derived from glioblastoma and head and neck cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stylli et al., 2008</xref>). In the case of breast cancer cell lines, the ability to form invadopodia is closely related to their invasive and metastatic properties in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coopman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamaguchi et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009</xref>). Additionally, invadopodia-like protrusions in breast cancer cells have been observed during intravasation by intravital imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Condeelis and Segall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamaguchi et al., 2005b</xref>). A recent study showed that invasive cancer cells use invadopodia to breach the basement membrane and penetrate into the stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schoumacher et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckert et al. (2011)</xref> recently reported that Twist, an inducer of epithelialâmesenchymal transition, induces invadopodia formation to promote tumor metastasis and provided evidence of invadopodia formation in vivo in sections of invasive primary tumors.</p>
      <p>Many components of invadopodia, such as various proteins involved in actin polymerization, cell signaling, membrane trafficking, cellâECM adhesion, and ECM degradation, have been reported to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Linder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gimona et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caldieri and Buccione, 2010</xref>). We and other researchers previously reported that invadopodia formation is induced by stimulation with serum and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamaguchi et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mandal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckert et al., 2011</xref>). However, the signaling pathways that link these extracellular stimuli to invadopodia formation remain largely unknown.</p>
      <p>The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of lipid kinases that phosphorylate phosphoinositides at the D-3 position of the inositol headgroup and, thus, produce D-3 phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantley, 2002</xref>). PI3Ks mediate the signal transduction of extracellular stimuli and regulate diverse cellular events, such as mitogenesis, survival, membrane transport, and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engelman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cain and Ridley, 2009</xref>). PI3Ks are subdivided into three general classes (IâIII) in mammals on the basis of their enzyme domain structures and substrate specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fruman et al., 1998</xref>). Specifically, the class I subfamily consists of four catalytic subunits, including three class IA subunits (p110Î±, p110Î², and p110Î´) and a single class IB subunit (p110Î³). However, the class II PI3K group consists of three isoforms, PI3K-C2Î±, PI3K-C2Î², and PI3K-C2Î³. Finally, mammals have a single class III isoform, namely, Vps34, which is a homologue of the sole PI3K present in yeast.</p>
      <p>Uncontrolled activation of the PI3K signaling pathway leads to several pathological phenomena, including tumorigenesis and tumor malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantley, 2002</xref>). This is indicated by the finding that the expression and activity of several members of the PI3K signaling pathway are frequently altered in a variety of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuan and Cantley, 2008</xref>). For instance, the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene, which encodes the class IA PI3K catalytic subunit p110Î±, is one of the most frequently amplified and mutated genes identified in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuan and Cantley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhao and Vogt, 2008</xref>). Clinical studies involving human breast cancer patients revealed that mutations leading to the activation of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> are associated with the development of invasive and metastatic phenotypes and poor patient prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maruyama et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, a previous study has shown that introduction of the mutant <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene into a breast cancer cell line enhanced lung metastasis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pang et al., 2009</xref>). However, the detailed mechanisms by which the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene product p110Î± contributes to cancer invasion and metastasis are yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>It is established that 3-phosphoinositideâdependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that mediates PI3K signaling during various cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Toker and Newton, 2000</xref>). PDK1 is recruited to cell membranes upon PI3K activation, where it phosphorylates and activates Akt, the major mediator of the PI3K signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stephens et al., 1998</xref>). Both PDK1 and Akt are overexpressed in human breast cancers and are thought to be critical components of the oncogenic PI3K signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dillon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheng et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that PDK1 and Akt are involved in the invasive and metastatic phenotypes of human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dillon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheng et al., 2009</xref>). However, the roles of PDK1 and Akt in invadopodia formation remain unclear. In the present study, we investigate the role of PI3K signaling during invadopodia formation in invasive human breast cancer cells.</p>

        <title>PI3K activity is required for invadopodia formation in human breast cancer cells</title>
        <p>The formation of invadopodia in human cancer cells and podosomes, which are structures functionally similar to invadopodia, in Src-transformed fibroblasts requires the activity of PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakahara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mandal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oikawa et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, the role of PI3K in invadopodia formation was investigated in detail in the highly invasive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neve et al., 2006</xref>). MDA-MB-231 cells form invadopodia in vitro and have, therefore, been widely used in studies investigating various aspects of these invasive structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 1994</xref>). MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded onto fluorescent gelatin-coated coverslips in the presence or absence of each of two PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, and stained for two invadopodia markers, cortactin and F-actin. Invadopodia were observed as dotlike clusters of cortactin and F-actin on the ventral membrane of cells, which corresponded with the degradation sites on the gelatin matrix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201009126/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). To quantify the invadopodia-mediated degradation of the gelatin matrix for each treatment, we calculated the area of the degradation sites. Both LY294002 and wortmannin significantly inhibited the formation of invadopodia and gelatin degradation in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of 3.3 ÂµM and 3.6 nM for LY294002 and wortmannin, respectively (Fig. S1, BâD). Furthermore, the percentage of cells with invadopodia and the number of invadopodia per cell were also reduced in cells treated with either PI3K inhibitor (Fig. S1, E and F).</p>
        <p>We also examined the effect of PI3K inhibition on the stability of preformed invadopodia. MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GFP-actin were seeded onto plates coated with a gelatin matrix, and cells were observed using time-lapse microscopy upon treatment with LY294002. LY294002 treatment of cells exhibiting GFP-actinâpositive invadopodia resulted in the degradation of invadopodia within 1 min of treatment (Fig. S1 G and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201009126/DC1">Video 1</ext-link>). A similar result was obtained when cells expressing Venus-cortactin were analyzed in the same manner (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201009126/DC1">Video 2</ext-link>). Quantification of the intensity of GFP-actin signals at the invadopodia revealed that the actin core structures of invadopodia disassembled immediately after the addition of LY294002, whereas the invadopodia of cells treated with DMSO did not disassemble (Fig. S1 H). Collectively, these results indicate that PI3K activation is required for both the formation and stability of invadopodia in human breast cancer cells.</p>

        <title>D-3 phosphoinositides are required for invadopodia formation</title>
        <p>We next investigated the role of D-3 phosphoinositides synthesized by PI3Ks in invadopodia formation. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>), which are two major products of PI3K, and its overexpression results in the sequestration and inhibition of the function of these phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">VÃ¡rnai et al., 2005</xref>). In the present study, the PH domain of Akt was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 cells as a GFP fusion protein (GFP-Akt-PH). This construct, which localized to the plasma membrane, inhibited the formation of invadopodia, as measured by both the percentage of cells with invadopodia and the number of invadopodia per cell, and gelatin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, AâD</xref>). In contrast, a mutant form of the Akt PH domain (R25C), in which an essential amino acid for phosphoinositide binding is mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">VÃ¡rnai et al., 2005</xref>), did not localize to the plasma membrane or inhibit gelatin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Furthermore, to examine the localization of D-3 phosphoinositides at invadopodia sites, a cell line expressing the GFP-Akt-PH construct at an extremely low level, â¼13 times less than transient expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201009126/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>), was established, which allows the cells to retain invadopodia. In these cells, signals corresponding to GFP-Akt-PH were significantly concentrated at F-actinârich invadopodia and at the gelatin degradation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). This accumulation of GFP signals at invadopodia was not observed when cells expressing GFP alone were examined in the same manner (Fig. S2 B). These results indicate that PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and/or PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> produced as downstream effectors of PI3K have an essential role in invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation.</p>

        <title>The class I PI3K catalytic subunit p110Î± is an essential regulator of invadopodia formation</title>
        <p>Mammalian cells contain eight PI3K enzymes, which are further classified into classes I, II, and III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fruman et al., 1998</xref>). In the present study, the expression levels of the PI3K family of proteins were examined in MDA-MB-231 cells by real-time quantitative PCR and standard semiquantitative PCR analyses performed using different sets of primers specific for the PI3K isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201009126/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). The class I subunits p110Î±, p110Î², and p110Î´, the class II subunit C2Î±, and the class III subunit Vps34 were abundantly expressed in these cells. Furthermore, the expression of the class II subunit C2Î² was weak but detectable. However, these cells did not express the class I subunit p110Î³ or the class II subunit C2Î³.</p>

        <p>siRNA knockdown experiments were performed to determine the contribution of individual PI3K isoforms to invadopodia formation. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting each PI3K enzyme and subsequently examined for invadopodia formation and gelatin degradation. The efficiency and selectivity of the siRNAs in knocking down individual PI3K isoforms were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), and the knockdown of class I p110 enzymes was also confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Cells with reduced p110Î± levels showed a significant decrease in invadopodia formation and gelatin degradation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, DâG</xref>). Similar results were obtained with three other siRNAs targeting different regions of the p110Î± gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201009126/DC1">Fig. S4, A and B</ext-link>). However, cells transfected with siRNAs targeting other class I PI3K enzymes (i.e., p110Î² and p110Î´) did not show decreased invadopodia formation or gelatin degradation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of classes II and III PI3Ks, including C2Î±, C2Î², and Vps34, did not affect gelatin degradation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Examination of the localization of endogenous p110Î± by immunocytochemistry revealed the presence of strong signals corresponding to endogenous p110Î± at invadopodia that were enriched with F-actin and were associated with gelatin degradation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>). To ascertain whether invadopodia formation mediated by p110Î± reflects the invasiveness of cancer cells, an in vitro Matrigel invasion assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with p110Î± siRNA showed markedly reduced invasion through Matrigel in comparison to cells transfected with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that among the PI3K family proteins, p110Î± is specifically involved in invadopodia-mediated invasion of human breast cancer cells.</p>
        <p>The effect of p110Î± knockdown on invadopodia formation was assessed in other invasive breast cancer cell lines, namely BT-549 and Hs578T. BT-549 cells treated with two different p110Î± siRNAs showed a significant decrease in invadopodia-mediated gelatin degradation (Fig. S4, C and D). As Hs578T cells were sensitive to siRNA transfection under the present experimental conditions, a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the p110Î± gene was introduced into Hs578T cells by lentiviral transduction. Transduction of Hs578T cells with p110Î± shRNA resulted in a marked reduction of the expression of p110Î± and a concomitant decrease in gelatin degradation activity as compared with cells with control shRNA (Fig. S4, EâG).</p>
        <p>The PI3K signaling pathway activation status was determined by measuring the amount of phosphorylated Akt, a major downstream effector of the PI3K signaling pathway. Knockdown of p110Î± suppressed Akt phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 J</xref>), whereas knockdown of p110Î² or p110Î´ had almost no effect. Thus, p110Î± is likely the primary mediator of growth factorâstimulated PI3K signaling in this cell type. Importantly, EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK was not affected by p110Î± knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 J</xref>). This result suggests that p110Î± inhibition does not affect MAPK signaling, a pathway that has been implicated in invadopodia formation in human melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tague et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

        <title>Pharmacological inhibition of p110Î± blocks invadopodia formation</title>
        <p>To confirm that p110Î± is an essential regulator of invadopodia formation, the effect of selective inhibitors of class I PI3K isoforms was investigated. Cells were cultured on fluorescent gelatin-coated coverslips in the presence of PIK-75, TGX-221, or IC87114, which are selective inhibitors of p110Î±, Î², and Î´, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knight et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaussade et al., 2007</xref>). p110Î± inhibition by PIK-75 treatment significantly inhibited gelatin degradation in a dose-dependent manner, showing an IC<sub>50</sub> of 25.0 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, AâC</xref>), and suppressed invadopodia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). A similar inhibition of gelatin degradation was observed when BT-549 and Hs578T breast cancer cells were treated with PIK-75 (Fig. S4, H and I). However, neither TGX-221 nor IC87114 significantly affected gelatin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>) despite their use at concentrations well above the IC<sub>50</sub> values reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaussade et al., 2007</xref>).

        <title>Activating mutations in the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene promote invadopodia formation</title>
        <p>The <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene, which encodes p110Î±, is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human breast cancers, and mutations in this gene are associated with invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maruyama et al., 2007</xref>). Most of the mutations occur at two hot spots, namely E545K in the helical domain and H1047R in the catalytic domain. These mutations constitutively activate the PI3K signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Isakoff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, the effect of these <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations on invadopodia formation was investigated in MDA-MB-231 cells, which express wild-type (WT) p110Î± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hollestelle et al., 2007</xref>). MDA-MB-231 cell lines stably expressing WT, E545K, or H1047R p110Î± were generated. The expression levels of the ectopic proteins were â¼4â5 times higher than the expression level of the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The results showed an increase in EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation in cells expressing WT p110Î± and a further increase in cells expressing either E545K or H1047R p110Î± in comparison to control mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Furthermore, morphological analysis revealed that WT p110Î± cells tended to form more lamellipodia or membrane ruffles than control mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). An additional increase in the protrusive activities in E545K- and H1047R-expressing cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), which may reflect enhanced cell motility induced by these p110Î± mutants as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pang et al., 2009</xref>). Invadopodia formation and gelatin degradation activity were moderately increased in WT p110Î± cells and further enhanced in E545K- and H1047R-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, DâG</xref>). The enhanced gelatin degradation activity in E545K- and H1047R-expressing cells was still sensitive to PIK-75 treatment, indicating that the enzymatic activity is crucial for invadopodia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>). Similar to the behavior of the endogenous protein, the E545K and H1047R p110Î± mutants also accumulated at gelatin degradation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 I</xref>). In addition, E545K- and H1047R-expressing cells showed enhanced invasion through Matrigel compared with mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 J</xref>). These findings indicate that these activating mutations in the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene commonly present in human cancers promote the invadopodia-mediated invasive activity of breast cancer cells.</p>

The expression of all Akt isoforms (i.e., Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3) was detected in MDA-MB-231 cells by real-time quantitative PCR (Fig. S3 B). To avoid possible functional redundancy, all Akt isoforms were simultaneously knocked down. In cells transfected with two different sets of siRNAs, the expression of total Akt was efficiently suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Akt knockdown significantly decreased invadopodia formation and gelatin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, FâH</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of PDK1 or Akt markedly decreased invadopodia formation in both E545K and H1047R p110Î± cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 I</xref>). Examination of the localization of endogenous Akt and PDK1 proteins revealed that these proteins accumulated at invadopodia-mediated gelatin degradation sites in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 J</xref>) and BT549 cells (Fig. S4 J).

        <p>To further confirm the involvement of PDK1 and Akt, cells were treated with OSU-03012 and the Akt inhibitor VIII, which are inhibitors of PDK1 and Akt, respectively. Although its specificity may need better characterization, OSU-03012 was shown to potently inhibit PDK1 activity by competing with ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2004</xref>). The Akt inhibitor VIII is a PH domainâdependent specific Akt inhibitor and blocks activation of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2005</xref>). Treatment of cells with these inhibitors resulted in a decrease in the levels of phosphorylated Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>).

        <p>The effect of the ectopic expression of various Akt constructs was examined by generating MDA-MB-231 cell lines stably expressing WT, kinase dead (KD), or a membrane-targeted constitutively active form (myristoylated [Myr]) of Akt1. Akt phosphorylation increased in cells expressing WT Akt1 but decreased in cells expressing KD Akt1 in comparison to control mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Myr Akt1 expression robustly enhanced Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Invadopodia formation and gelatin degradation activity were increased in WT Akt1 cells but decreased in KD Akt1 cells, which is consistent with the changes in Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, BâE</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, cells expressing Myr Akt1 showed a marked decrease in invadopodia formation and gelatin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, BâE</xref>).

Although the expression of these Akt1 mutants markedly increased Akt phosphorylation, it abrogated invadopodia-mediated gelatin degradation activity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201009126/DC1">Fig. S5, A and B</ext-link>). Collectively, these results confirm the role of Akt in invadopodia formation and suggest that site-specific and proper activation of Akt is necessary for efficient assembly of invadopodia.</p>

      <p>In the present study, the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin were shown to effectively inhibit invadopodia formation in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. This result is consistent with the previous studies describing that the formation of invadopodia in human cancer cells and podosomes in Src transformed fibroblasts requires the activity of PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakahara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mandal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oikawa et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Overexpression of the Akt-PH domain, which sequesters the PI3K products PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, effectively blocked invadopodia formation. Although the predominant product of PI3K is PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, several evidence raise the possibility that PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> also plays a significant and redundant role in invadopodia formation in parallel with PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuang et al. (2004)</xref> reported that siRNA knockdown of synaptojanin-2, which generates PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> via dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, blocks invadopodia formation in glioma cells. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oikawa et al. (2008)</xref> reported that PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> regulates podosome formation by recruiting Tks5 and N-WASP, which are essential components of podosomes. Therefore, although further studies are required to precisely define the individual roles of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, our results indicate that these D3-phosphoinositides produced by PI3K activity play an essential role in invadopodia biogenesis.</p>

          <p><bold>A model of the function of PI3K signaling in invadopodia formation and cell invasion.</bold> p110Î± that is activated downstream of growth factor receptors produces the signaling lipid PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to regulate invadopodia formation and cancer cell invasion. PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> that is generated via dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> by synaptojanin-2 (SJ2) may regulate invadopodia formation through the Tks5/N-WASP axis in parallel with PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. PDK1 and Akt are activated by both PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and act as mediators of the PI3K signaling pathway for invadopodia formation.</p>

      <p>We and other researchers have previously reported that invadopodia formation is initiated with the assembly of actin core structures followed by the accumulation of matrix metalloproteinases for ECM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamaguchi et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artym et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oser et al., 2009</xref>). The finding that treatment of cells with PI3K inhibitors blocked the formation of F-actin and cortactin structures of invadopodia suggests that PI3K signaling is involved in the first step of invadopodia formation. In support of this hypothesis, PI3K inhibitors disassembled the F-actin structures of invadopodia, as shown by time-lapse analysis, and that PI3K products were enriched with F-actin at the invadopodia, as detected with the GFP-Akt PH construct. Consistent with these observations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mandal et al. (2008)</xref> recently reported that PI3K is required for the formation of F-actin cores of invadopodia induced by TGF-Î² stimulation.</p>
      <p>An important finding of the present study was that among the PI3K isoforms, the class I PI3K catalytic subunit p110Î± is specifically involved in invadopodia formation. We showed that pharmacological inhibition of p110Î± blocked invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation and invasion in human breast cancer cell lines. Several inhibitors that target PI3Ks are currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engelman, 2009</xref>). However, these broad-spectrum PI3K inhibitors can cause significant side effects caused by the multiple roles of the PI3K signaling pathway in basic cellular functions. Therefore, current research is extensively focused both on understanding the isoform-specific functions of PI3Ks and on developing isoform-specific inhibitors of the PI3K family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhao and Vogt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engelman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jia et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recent studies have delineated distinct functions of class I PI3K isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engelman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jia et al., 2009</xref>). The p110Î± subunit was shown to predominantly mediate PI3K signaling activity in receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction, whereas p110Î² responds to G proteinâcoupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guillermet-Guibert et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that immune system function is largely dependent on p110Î´ and p110Î³ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rommel et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, unlike <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, which encodes p110Î±, cancer-specific mutations have not been reported for genes encoding other class I PI3Ks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jia et al., 2009</xref>). Based on these findings and the specific role of p110Î± in invadopodia formation, we hypothesize that p110Î± is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer invasion and metastasis with minimal side effects.</p>
      <p>The <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations found in human cancers primarily occur at two hot spots: E545K in the helical domain and H1047R in the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuels and Ericson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhao and Vogt, 2008</xref>). These mutations are known to promote the catalytic activity of p110Î±, thereby leading to constitutive activation of the PI3K signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2005</xref>). We determined that the E545K and H1047R mutations in p110Î± enhanced invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation and invasion. This finding provides mechanistic insight into the role of p110Î± mutations in cancer invasion.</p>
      <p>Although we clearly showed that basal p110Î± activity is required for invadopodia formation, mutations of p110Î± are not sufficient to trigger invadopodia formation. In fact, several breast cancer cell lines that contain p110Î± mutations, such as MCF-7 and T47D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hollestelle et al., 2007</xref>), are unable to form invadopodia as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coopman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamaguchi et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that activation of other factors and/or signaling pathways trigger invadopodia formation, and the concurrent activation of p110Î± by mutations may act as a positive modulator in this process. This concept is supported by the fact that activating p110Î± mutations are preferentially observed in invasive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maruyama et al., 2007</xref>) and often associated with other alterations, such as ERBB2 overexpression and <italic>K-ras</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oda et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the present study, we demonstrated, for the first time, that PDK1 and Akt are involved in invadopodia formation. Importantly, knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of Akt or PDK1 abolished the enhanced invadopodia formation induced by E545K and H1047R p110Î±. Previous studies have shown that PDK1 and Akt are overexpressed and/or mutated in various human cancers and have implicated these proteins in cancer invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinner and Sahai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheng et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, our findings may provide a further rationale for targeting PDK1 and Akt in addition to p110Î± in the development of antiinvasion and antimetastasis strategies.</p>
      <p>Additional evidence that Akt is required for invadopodia formation was provided by the overexpression of WT and KD forms of Akt. Unexpectedly, however, overexpression of constitutively active forms of Akt markedly blocked invadopodia formation. Because we observed that Akt localized to invadopodia, site-specific and controlled activation of Akt by p110Î± and PDK1 may be required for proper invadopodia formation and cancer invasion. In agreement with this idea, the constitutively active form of Akt was shown to inhibit the invasion of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hutchinson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying the regulation of invadopodia formation by the p110Î±âPDK1âAkt pathway.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that the PI3K signaling pathway mediated by p110Î± is a critical regulator of invadopodia-mediated invasion of human breast cancer cells. These findings identified a new cellular function of the well-known oncogene product p110Î± and provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms of invadopodia formation and cancer cell invasion.</p>
