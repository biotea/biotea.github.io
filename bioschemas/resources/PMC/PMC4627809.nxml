      <abstract>
        <p>The two cytosolic/nuclear isoforms of the molecular chaperone HSP90, stress-inducible HSP90Î± and constitutively expressed HSP90Î², fold, assemble and maintain the three-dimensional structure of numerous client proteins. Because many HSP90 clients are important in cancer, several HSP90 inhibitors have been evaluated in the clinic. However, little is known concerning possible unique isoform or conformational preferences of either individual HSP90 clients or inhibitors. In this report, we compare the relative interaction strength of both HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² with the transcription factors HSF1 and HIF1Î±, the kinases ERBB2 and MET, the E3-ubiquitin ligases KEAP1 and RHOBTB2, and the HSP90 inhibitors geldanamycin and ganetespib. We observed unexpected differences in relative client and drug preferences for the two HSP90 isoforms, with HSP90Î± binding each client protein with greater apparent affinity compared to HSP90Î², while HSP90Î² bound each inhibitor with greater relative interaction strength compared to HSP90Î±. Stable HSP90 interaction was associated with reduced client activity. Using a defined set of HSP90 conformational mutants, we found that some clients interact strongly with a single, ATP-stabilized HSP90 conformation, only transiently populated during the dynamic HSP90 chaperone cycle, while other clients interact equally with multiple HSP90 conformations. These data suggest different functional requirements among HSP90 clientele that, for some clients, are likely to be ATP-independent. Lastly, the two inhibitors examined, although sharing the same binding site, were differentially able to access distinct HSP90 conformational states.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has been conserved throughout evolution, and functions primarily by coupling ATP hydrolysis to a cycle of structural rearrangements that drives the binding, folding and release of client proteins (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Encoded by two different genes, HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² are the result of a gene duplication event that occurred early in the evolution of eukaryotes [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HSP90Î± is encoded by the <italic>HSP90AA1</italic> gene on human chromosome 14q and is induced in response to proteotoxic stress, inflammation and other cellular stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. HSP90Î² is encoded by the <italic>HSP90AB1</italic> gene on human chromosome 6p and is constitutively expressed. The two isoforms have evolved distinct functions despite sharing over 85% sequence identity [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Numerous drug discovery efforts have targeted this ATP-fueled molecular machine [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. HSP90 inhibitors display preferential activity toward malignant or rapidly proliferating cells and have been found to concentrate and persist in tumor cells for an extended period, and these drugs have been extensively evaluated in the clinic [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the drug binding pockets in HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² are very similar and pharmacologic approaches to specifically inhibit one isoform and not the other have yet to be successful [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>

      <p>HSP90 is predicted to interact with 7% of the transcription factors (TFs) in the human genome [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The stress activated TFs heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and hypoxia inducible factor 1Î± (HIF1Î±) are HSP90 clients [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. HSF1 is a master regulator of stress-induced transcription and is often referred to as a guardian of the proteome. Unfortunately, HSF1 is also found to be over-expressed in a large number of cancers where it promotes a cancer-specific transcription program [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. HSP90 binding to HSF1 is understood to inhibit its transcriptional activity but the underlying mechanism remains undefined [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. HIF1Î± is a master regulator of hypoxia-induced transcription and is responsible for promoting angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming within oxygen-deprived tumor masses. HSP90 interacts with HIF1Î± to regulate interaction with its dimerization partner ARNT, a requirement for transcriptional activity [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>HSP90 is predicted to interact with as much as 60% of the protein kinases in the human genome. However, the affinity with which HSP90 interacts with each client kinase varies [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This variation in interaction strength is related to the structural stability of the kinase domain, with which HSP90 physically associates [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The tyrosine kinases ERBB2 and MET strongly interact with HSP90 and are well-established drivers of tumorigenesis and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>Work by Taipale et al predicts that HSP90 interacts with up to 30% of mammalian E3-ubiquitin ligases [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The HSP90 interactors KEAP1 and RHOBTB2/DBC2 act as tumor suppressors [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. KEAP1 functions primarily to regulate stability of the master anti-oxidant response transcription factor NFE2L2 [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The function of RHOBTB2 is less established although it is understood to promote CCND2 degradation while also maintaining expression of CXCL14 on normal epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
      <p>Using these six proteins, drawn from three distinct functional classes of HSP90-dependent clients, we compared relative binding preferences for each HSP90 isoform as well as preference to interact with a set of conformationally trapped chaperone mutants.</p>
      <p>Finally, we determined the interaction profiles of both HSP90 isoforms and their conformational mutants with geldanamycin and ganetespib [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Geldanamycin, an antibiotic derived from <italic>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</italic>, was the first identified HSP90 inhibitor [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>],while ganetespib is a synthetic HSP90 inhibitor currently in Phase 3 clinical trial in cancer patients [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our findings in this study identify unexpected diversity in both isoform and conformational binding preferences among these individual HSP90 clients and inhibitors.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>In addition to the wild-type (WT) proteins, we utilized a set of previously characterized point-mutants of Hsp90Î± and Î², where equivalent mutations in yeast Hsp90 do not to support growth (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). The âclosedâ N-domain dimerized conformational mutants E47A (HSP90Î±) and E42A (HSP90Î²) strongly bind ATP but lack ATPase activity [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In yeast, these mutants trap HSP90 in a conformation that tightly binds client proteins [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The âopenâ N-domain undimerized conformational mutants D93A (HSP90Î±) and D88A (HSP90Î²) do not bind ATP and are considered to interact only weakly with client proteins [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The Î²-sheet 8 mutants IL218/20AA (HSP90Î±) and IL213/5AA (HSP90Î²) lack the ability to form the proper intramolecular interactions upon ATP binding [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Each of these mutants is located within the N-terminal ATP-binding domain of HSP90. The last pair of mutants, R400A (HSP90Î±) and R392A (HSP90Î²), are located in the middle domain and are ATPase defective [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] These HSP90 WT and mutant proteins were expressed in cells and examined for their ability to bind client proteins by immunoprecipitation-western blot analysis. This was complemented by LUMIER (LUMinescence-based Mammalian IntERactome) [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] analysis that allowed us to compare the relative interaction strength of each WT HSP90 isoform for individual client proteins. Effects of each HSP90 isoform on kinase and transcription factor activity were also examined. Finally, the relative interaction strengths of the two inhibitors with each isoform and their respective conformational mutants were profiled.</p>

        <title>HSP90 isoform interactions with transcription factors HSF1 and HIF1Î±</title>
        <p>We transfected plasmids encoding FLAG-HSP90 WT and mutants along with HA-HSF1 or HA-HIF1Î± into HEK293 cells and allowed expression for 18 hours. Cells were then harvested and the interacting complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads followed by western blot analysis. The âclosed/ATP-boundâ E47A and E42A mutants of both HSP90 isoforms bound most avidly to HSF1.

        <p>We observed a different HSP90 interaction pattern for HIF1Î± compared to HSF1 (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). While HIF1Î± bound strongly to the âclosed/ATP-boundâ E47A and E42A mutants, it also bound to the âopenâ D93A and D88A mutants. HSP90Î± IL218/20AA also bound HIF1Î± while HSP90Î² IL213/5AA did not. All other HSP90 proteins, including both WT HSP90 isoforms, bound HIF1Î± poorly. These data suggest that HSP90 is capable of binding certain clients with equal avidity while occupying a variety of conformational states.</p>
        <p>We used LUMIER analysis to compare the relative interaction strengths of HSF1 and HIF1Î± with each WT HSP90 isoform. We observed that HSP90Î± bound HIF1Î± with greater relative interaction strength compared to HSF1, while HSP90Î² bound HSF1 with greater relative interaction strength compared to HIF1Î± (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). This was interesting, since HSF1 bound strongly only to the âclosed/ATP-boundâ conformational state of both HSP90 isoforms while HIF1Î± bound both the âclosed/ATP-boundâ and âopenâ mutants, suggesting that binding to more than one conformational state may increase overall apparent affinity for certain clients.</p>
        <p>We also found that HSP90Î± bound both TFs with greater relative interaction strength than did HSP90Î². The difference in relative interaction strength between HSP90 isoforms for HSF1 and HIF1Î± may lead to differential effects on TF activity. To test this possibility, we analyzed the stress-induced transcription activity of both HSF1 and HIF1Î± after co-expressing either HSP90 isoform. To examine HSF1 activity, cells were heat shocked for 30 minutes at 42Â°C, allowed to recover for 2 hours, harvested and analyzed for HSF1-driven gene transcription by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Heat shocked samples that overexpressed HSP90Î± consistently demonstrated reduced expression of the HSF1-driven genes <italic>HSPA1A</italic>, <italic>DNAJ1</italic> and <italic>STIP1</italic> compared to the pcDNA control. HSP90Î± repressed the expression of <italic>HSPA1A</italic> and <italic>DNAJ1</italic> to a greater degree than did HSP90Î², while both isoforms repressed the expression of <italic>STIP1</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
        <p>To compare the effects of HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² on HIF1Î±-driven transcription we transfected plasmids for each isoform together with HIF1Î± into HEK293 cells and allowed them to express for 18 hours. At that time, 100 Î¼M CoCl<sub>2</sub> was added to induce pseudo-hypoxia. The cells were harvested 2 hours later and analyzed for HIF1Î±-driven gene transcription by qPCR. Pseudo-hypoxic samples that overexpressed HSP90Î± showed greater reduction in transcription of the HIF1Î± target genes <italic>SLC2A1</italic> and <italic>VEGFA</italic> compared to samples that overexpressed HSP90Î² (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Our findings are consistent with a model in which HSP90Î±, unlike HSP90Î², may function in a negative feedback loop to regulate the activity of these stress-induced, HSP90-dependent TFs.</p>

        <title>HSP90 isoform interactions with tyrosine kinases ERBB2 and MET</title>
        <p>Similar to the methods used to study these TFs, we co-transfected plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged WT and mutant HSP90 together with ERBB2 or MET tyrosine kinases in HEK293 cells. After 18 hours, cells were harvested and the interacting complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG beads and analyzed by western blot. As was the case for HSF1, the HSP90 âclosed/ATP-boundâ E47A and E42A mutants interacted most strongly with ERBB2 (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). ERBB2 also bound both WT HSP90 constructs at detectable levels along with the ATPase defective R400A and R392A mutants. To determine the effects of the HSP90 mutants on ERBB2 kinase activity we blotted for pY1221/1222, an ERBB2 auto-phosphorylation site. We observed that ERBB2 was auto-phosphorylated in all lysate inputs except for those that were transfected with the tightly binding E47A and E42A mutants. These data indicate that ERBB2 interaction with HSP90 is specific to a defined and transient state within the HSP90 ATPase cycle. Moreover, HSP90 binding represses ERBB2 kinase activity. This is consistent with earlier reports demonstrating rapid but transient increases in kinase activity, including that of ERBB2 [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], following HSP90 inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>

        <p>Both WT HSP90 isoforms bound MET to some extent (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). MET was most strongly bound by the âclosedâ E47A and E42A mutants, the âopenâ D93A and D88A mutants and the IL218/20AA and IL213/5AA mutants. The R400A and R392A mutants bound MET less robustly. To determine the effects of the HSP90 mutants on bound MET kinase activity we blotted for pY1234/1235 in the pull-down samples. Here we observed that MET was clearly auto-phosphorylated in both WT HSP90 samples and in cells transfected with HSP90Î² D88A, HSP90Î± IL218/20AA and HSP90Î² IL213/5AA. In all other samples, MET activity was greatly reduced. We also blotted for pY1234/1235 in the input samples and observed that MET was phosphorylated to some degree in every lane but most heavily in the pcDNA controls and samples transfected with both WT HSP90 isoforms. This was also reflected in the mobility shift of MET in the input blots. The data indicate that MET associates with multiple HSP90 conformational states, in contrast to ERBB2. As was the case for ERBB2, MET interaction with HSP90 suppresses its kinase activity.</p>

However, this difference may be related to the unexpected finding that MET overexpression increased the overall expression of both HSP90 isoforms, thereby reducing the apparent relative interaction strength (see <xref rid="sec008" ref-type="sec">methods</xref> for calculation of relative interaction strength). This was also reflected in the immonoprecipitation-western blot band intensities for HSP90 in samples co-transfected with MET.

        <p>Lastly, we compared the relative interaction strength of each HSP90 isoform for two inhibitors, geldanamycin and ganetespib. These ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitors share the same N-domain binding site and functionally prevent nucleotide-dependent N-domain dimerization and ATP-dependent chaperone activity [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We quantified binding of each HSP90 isoform to either biotinylated-geldanamycin (biotin-GA) or biotinylated-ganetespib (STA-7346). In contrast to the client proteins, HSP90Î² bound each inhibitor with greater relative interaction strength than did HSP90Î± (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Both HSP90 isoforms bound STA7346 with markedly greater relative interaction strength compared to biotin-GA, consistent with the fact that ganetespib has a much lower Kd and IC<sub>50</sub> compared to geldanamycin [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Examination of the HSP90 N-domain mutants provided unexpected results (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). The âclosedâ mutants E47A and E42A bound both drugs with less relative interaction strength than did their respective WT counterparts, but STA-7346 binding was much less compromised compared to that of biotin-GA. In fact, given the overall difference in relative interaction strength between the two inhibitors, STA-7346 bound significantly better to the âclosedâ E47A and E42A mutants than did biotin-GA to WT HSP90. Consistent with previous reports, the non-ATP binding âopenâ mutants D93A and D88A displayed the least drug binding activity [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Additionally, both of the âstructurally defectiveâ N-domain mutants, IL218/20AA and IL213/5AA, bound STA-7346 and biotin-GA with low relative interaction strength. This was unexpected because Î²-sheet 8 does not directly contact the ATP-binding pocket, suggesting long-range conformation effects on drug binding. In contrast, the ATPase defective middle domain mutants R400A and R392A bound both drugs with slightly reduced relative interaction strength compared to WT constructs. These data indicate that each HSP90 isoform may be divergently sensitive to N-domain inhibitors, and that the less bulky synthetic inhibitor ganetespib (MW 364.4) may be able to access HSP90 conformational states not available to the natural product geldanamycin (MW 560.64) (<xref rid="pone.0141786.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Taken together, these data suggest that certain unappreciated dynamics govern client and drug HSP90 interaction preferences in a cellular context. HSP90Î± and HSP90Î² differ in relative preference for both clients and two N-domain inhibitors. HSP90Î± bound clients across three distinct functional classes with greater relative interaction strength compared to HSP90Î², while HSP90Î² bound inhibitors more strongly than did HSP90Î±. Remarkably, the less bulky synthetically derived inhibitor ganetespib was able to access HSP90 conformational states (e.g., the âclosedâ E47A and E42A states) previously considered inaccessible based on binding studies with natural product inhibitors. This ability, as well as superior binding affinity, may underlie the increased cellular potency of ganetespib and other 2<sup>nd</sup> generation synthetic inhibitors. However, given the preference of these drugs for HSP90Î² over HSP90Î±, our data suggest that development of isoform-specific HSP90 inhibitors remains of interest.</p>
      <p>Unexpectedly, we observed differences in client interaction preferences with a panel of conformationally restricted HSP90 mutants, even when the client proteins evaluated have similar biological functions. Conversely, we identified clients of different functional classes that share the ability to interact with similar HSP90 conformational states. For example, robust HSP90 interaction with HSF1 and ERBB2 appears to be ATP-dependent and likely occurs transiently under normal chaperone cycling conditions, while HSP90 interaction with HIF1Î±, MET, and the two E3-ubiquitin ligases is not as conformationally restricted. Although the biological significance of these findings is at present unclear, our data suggest that for some clients HSP90 may possess passive binding activity that is ATP-independent. Whether this reflects a previously proposed âholdaseâ or anti-aggregation function of HSP90 that may be inhibitor insensitive requires further investigation [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The ability of certain clients to interact with multiple HSP90 conformations, as well as a greater dependence of inherently unstable clients on HSP90 association (e.g., v-Src) may also explain the ease or difficulty in detecting dynamic HSP90/client interactions in cells [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Additionally, our data confirm that the biological function of some HSP90 clients may be suppressed by strong interaction with conformationally restricted HSP90 mutants or distinct HSP90 isoforms [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This was the case for ERBB2 and MET kinases and for the TFs HSF1 and HIF1Î±. For HSF1, these observations support a feedback model where HSF1-driven transcription of HSP90Î± may negatively regulate HSF1 activity. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that HSP90 may function more to attenuate HSF1 transcription activity than to suppress HSF1 activation under non-stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0141786.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although this needs to be confirmed in other cell types, our findings suggest that a re-examination of the role of HSP90 in modulating HSF1 activity, and the effect of inhibitors on this modulation, is necessary. In conclusion, the results of this study emphasize that detailed analysis of the conformational dependence of HSP90 interaction with its diverse clientele, and with inhibitors currently being evaluated in the clinic, is necessary to understand how best to target this molecular chaperone in cancer and other diseases.</p>

Plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged HSP90 mutant constructs were co-transfected with plasmids encoding each client protein and allowed to express for 18 hours. Cells were lysed with TGNET buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 5% Glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) complete with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche), then centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 minutes at 4Â°C. After BCA protein assay, 40 Î¼g of protein were used as input lysate. For immunoprecipitation, 700 Î¼g of protein from remaining lysates were added to 40 Î¼l of anti-FLAG Beads (Sigma-Aldrich, A2220) and incubated with rotation for 2 hours at 4Â°C. The pull-down beads were washed 4 times with TGNET buffer. The proteins were eluted with 30 Î¼l of 2X SDS sample buffer by boiling at 95Â°C for 5 min. Subsequently, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The following antibodies were used in this report: FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich, A8592), HA (Rockland, #600-401-974), ERBB2 (Thermo Scientific, MS-730-P1), pERBB2 (pY1221/pY1222) (Cell Signaling, #2249), MET (Cell Signaling, #3127), pMET (Tyr1234/1235) (Cell Signaling, #3077).</p>

        <p>LUminescence-based Mammalian IntERactome (LUMIER) assay was carried out by transfecting HEK293 cells in 96-well plates with plasmids that expressed each client protein fused to NanoLuc luciferase (Promega) along with 3XFLAG-tagged HSP90Î± and HSP90Î². After 18 hours, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with 100 Î¼l TGNET complete buffer, then centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 minutes at 4Â°C. The resulting lysates were transferred to an anti-FLAG antibody-coated plate (Sigma) and incubated at 4Â°C for 2 hours with gentle shaking. The plates were washed with TGNET. Nano-Glo reagent (Promega) was added and luciferase activity was quantified using a plate reader (Perkin-Elmer). To normalize for 3XFLAG-HSP90 levels, the plates were washed again with TGNET and anti-FLAG-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. The plates were once again incubated at 4Â°C, washed and assayed for HRP luminescence activity. The experimental relative interaction strength for each client protein interaction was determined by dividing the NanoLuc readout by the HRP readout value. Each sample was assayed 3 times with 3 replicates. Standard deviations are represented by error bars. A two-tailed T-test was used to determine statistical significance. All calculations were performed in Excel (Microsoft).</p>

        <p>To determine the strength of binding of each HSP90 WT and mutant paralog with biotinlyated-geldanamycin (biotin-GA) and STA-7346 (biotinlyated-STA-9090), HEK293 cells were transfected with each 3XFLAG-HSP90 and allowed to express for 18 hours. Streptavidin-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) were incubated with biotinylated-geldanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) or STA-7346 (Synta), blocked with TGNET+3% BSA and washed. Transfected cells were harvested with cold TGNET complete lysis buffer and an equal amount of fresh protein lysate was added simultaneously to a streptavidin plate and to anti-FLAG-coated plate (Sigma-Aldrich). Incubation was for 2 hours at 4Â°C. The plates were washed and anti-FLAG-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well. The plates were again incubated at 4Â°C for 2 hours and washed. Finally, the plates were washed and read on a plate reader using ECL to measure HRP luminescence activity (Pierce). The experimental relative interaction strength was determined by dividing the light values of the biotinlyated-drug plate by the normalizing anti-FLAG plate. Each assay was repeated 3 times with 4 replicates. Standard deviations are represented by error bars. A two-tailed T-test was used to determine statistical significance. All calculations were performed in Excel (Microsoft).</p>
