      <abstract>
        <p>The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein serves as a molecular platform recruiting and coordinating the activity of factors involved in multiple deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transactions. To avoid dangerous genome instability, it is necessary to prevent excessive retention of PCNA on chromatin. Although PCNA functions during DNA replication appear to be regulated by different post-translational modifications, the mechanism regulating PCNA removal and degradation after nucleotide excision repair (NER) is unknown. Here we report that CREB-binding protein (CBP), and less efficiently p300, acetylated PCNA at lysine (Lys) residues Lys13,14,77 and 80, to promote removal of chromatin-bound PCNA and its degradation during NER. Mutation of these residues resulted in impaired DNA replication and repair, enhanced the sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, and prevented proteolytic degradation of PCNA after DNA damage. Depletion of both CBP and p300, or failure to load PCNA on DNA in NER deficient cells, prevented PCNA acetylation and degradation, while proteasome inhibition resulted in accumulation of acetylated PCNA. These results define a CBP and p300-dependent mechanism for PCNA acetylation after DNA damage, linking DNA repair synthesis with removal of chromatin-bound PCNA and its degradation, to ensure genome stability.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a homotrimeric protein arranged to form a circular ring-shaped structure which may encircle deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), thereby acting as a molecular platform for DNA replication and repair enzymes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In addition, PCNA interacts with a large number of factors participating in transcription, chromatin remodeling, chromatid cohesion, as well as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4â7</xref>). PCNA plays a central role in these processes by coordinating the activity of multiple partners (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, mechanisms regulating PCNA function, such as post-translational modifications, have emerged only recently (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>Post-translational modifications of PCNA, such as ubiquitination and sumoylation, were the first to be unambiguously identified (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). PCNA monoubiquitination at lysine (Lys) 164 was shown to regulate DNA polymerase by switching interaction from DNA polymerase Î´ to DNA polymerase Î·, when the replication fork encounters a blocking lesion (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Lys107 ubiquitination was also described in response to DNA ligase I deficiency (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Polyubiquitination of PCNA has been also shown to play important roles in maintaining genome integrity (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15â19</xref>). PCNA monoubiquitination is also involved in somatic hypermutation, class switch recombination, and possibly in meiotic progression (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). PCNA sumoylation is thought to be required for preventing fork collapse into double strand breaks (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
      <p>Early studies suggested that PCNA was phosphorylated during DNA replication and repair (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23â25</xref>). Later, phosphorylation at tyrosine 211 (Tyr211) by epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and c-Abl tyrosine kinase (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) were shown to regulate PCNA stability during DNA replication (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The association with ERK8 kinase also influenced PCNA stability by regulating the interaction with MDM2, although no evidence that ERK8 could phosphorylate PCNA, was provided (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Finally, Tyr114 phosphorylation has been recently reported to control adipocytes generation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
      <p>PCNA acetylation was suggested to regulate interaction with DNA polymerase Î² and Î´ (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Acetylated lysines (Lys77, 80 and 248) were identified by mass spectrometry (MS) coupled to stable isotope labeling by amino acids in culture (SILAC) of mammalian cells (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Mutational studies indicated that PCNA acetylation at Lys14 promoted its degradation after ultraviolet (UV) damage to inhibit DNA replication (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, the mechanism controlling PCNA removal from chromatin and its degradation after UV-induced nucleotide excision repair is unknown. This is an important determinant for genome stability, since excessive retention of PCNA on chromatin may endanger genome stability (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Although PCNA may interact with the lysine (K) acetyl transferase (KAT) p300 (KAT3B), during DNA repair (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay suggested that PCNA was a poor substrate for this KAT (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Thus, the enzyme/s responsible for PCNA acetylation and the role of this modification in DNA repair, remain to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Here, we have investigated the molecular mechanism underlying PCNA acetylation by assessing the interaction of PCNA with CREB binding protein (known as CREBBP, CBP, KAT3A), which shares a high degree of homology with p300 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). PCNA acetylation by CBP and p300 have been compared <italic>in vitro</italic>, and acetylated lysine residues have been identified by MS/MS. Site-directed mutagenesis of these amino acids resulted in impaired DNA synthesis, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also provide evidence that lack of PCNA acetylation in these mutants, or after CBP and p300 depletion in normal cells, resulted in the accumulation of chromatin-bound PCNA and significant reduction of its degradation after UV-induced DNA damage. Finally, by biochemical and genetic evidence, we show that PCNA acetylation and degradation are dependent on the cell ability to load PCNA for DNA repair synthesis. Our results indicate that CBP and p300 are required for PCNA acetylation to link DNA repair synthesis functions of PCNA with its removal from chromatin for proteolytic degradation.</p>

        <title>Cell cultures, transfections, RNA interference and treatments</title>
        <p>LF-1 human embryonic fibroblasts (obtained from J.M. Sedivy, RI) and HeLa (ATCC) were grown in EMEM or in DMEM, respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS. XP20PV (XPA) and XP20BE (XPG) primary human fibroblasts were grown in HAM F10 and DMEM:HAM F10 (1:1) medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS.</p>
        <p>Transfection of HeLa cells was performed with Effectene reagent (Qiagen). In some experiments, Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP)-PCNA constructs were co-transfected with a plasmid for expression of GFP-H2B histone, to detect chromatin-bound proteins, or HA-p21 (live cell imaging), to facilitate detection of protein recruitment to DNA damage sites in non-S phase cells (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p>
        <p>RNAi was performed in LF1 fibroblasts by transfecting with INTERFERin<sup>TM</sup> reagent (PolyPlus), 20 nM of a pool of four different RNA oligos (ON-TARGETplus smart pool siRNA, Dharmacon, ThermoFisher) to p300, and CBP. Non-targeting control pool (D-001818â10), or targeting GFP, were used as control siRNA. Cell cultures were incubated in the presence of siRNAs for 48 h before UV irradiation. P300/CBP associated factor (PCAF) siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotech.) treatment was performed at 30 nM for 48 h (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p>
        <p>UV-C light exposure was performed with a TUV-9 lamp (Philips). Local DNA damage was induced using polycarbonate filters (Isopore, Millipore) with 3-Î¼m pore diameter, as described (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Cell viability after UV irradiation of HeLa transfected cells was determined by counting detached RFP-positive cells that were also positive to trypan blue staining.</p>
        <p>In some experiments, cells were treated before UV irradiation with 100 Î¼M curcumin (Sigma), to inhibit p300/CBP activity (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), or with 100 Î¼M aphidicolin (Millipore) plus 10 Î¼M arabinosyl cytosine (araC, Sigma), to inhibit DNA synthesis (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). For proteasomal inhibition, cells were pre-treated with 50 Î¼M MG132 (Sigma) for 30 min before irradiation, and maintained in the same medium for 30 min or 4 h. In experiments with other DNA damaging agents, LF-1 fibroblasts were treated for 30 min with 25 Î¼M N-methyl-Nâ²-nitro-N-nitroso guanidine (MNNG), or for 15 min with 0.1 mM potassium bromate (KBrO<sub>3</sub>), or with X-rays (10 Gy). Drugs were removed and cells were then incubated for 4 h, before analysis.</p>
        <p>For PCNA degradation experiments in LF-1 fibroblasts at 4 h time point, cycloheximide (CHX) was omitted (if not otherwise stated) because there was no significant difference in the extent of PCNA degradation, when it was present.</p>

        <p>The primers used are reported in Supplementary information. All purified constructs were sequenced by MWG/Operon (Germany) to confirm the correctness of mutation.</p>
        <p>PCNA wt and mutant complementary DNAs were isolated from hPCNA-RFP constructs with BamHI and XhoI enzymes, cloned in pET28 vector (Novagen) and transformed in BL21 (DE3) <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain. The proteins were purified with Ni-NTA His-bind Resin (Qiagen), as per manufacturer instructions. The fractions containing purified PCNA were dialyzed against 50 mM phosphate buffer-10% glycerol (pH 7.0), and loaded on centrifugal filters (Amicon 30 kDa, Millipore). Purified proteins were brought to 50% glycerol by dilution and stored at â80Â°C.</p>
        <p>Untagged PCNA and GST-p21C terminal peptide were produced as previously described (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p>
        <p>GST-CBP N-terminal region (1â1098), and C-terminal regions (1894â2221) and (2212â2441), were expressed in BL21(DE3) or (DE3)pLys <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, respectively, and purified by glutathione (GSH)-affinity chromatography. Bromo-domain and histone acetyl transferase (HAT) domain were obtained from Cayman and Sigma, respectively.</p>

        <title>PCNA is acetylated in response to DNA damage</title>
        <p>Acetylated forms of PCNA in proliferating cells were described by a mobility shift in 2D-gel electrophoresis (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We observed a slower migrating form of PCNA in S-phase synchronized fibroblasts, as compared to quiescent cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To establish whether acetylated PCNA was present in a specific pool of the protein (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), S-phase synchronized fibroblasts were fractionated in detergent-soluble and chromatin-bound extracts, and PCNA was pulled down with a GST-tagged p21C-terminal peptide (GST-p21C), which has a strong affinity for PCNA (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Half volume of each pull-down was then incubated with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to remove the acetyl groups. Acetylated PCNA was found in each fraction, but not when incubated with HDAC1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). A slower migrating form could be also detected in UV-irradiated quiescent fibroblasts, both by anti-PCNA and anti-acetyl lysine antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), and could be observed at higher UV fluences, and at least until 24 h from UV exposure (Supplementary Figures S1A and B). This form, distinct from monoubiquitinated PCNA was also detected after cell treatment with oxidizing, or alkylating agents (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). To verify that PCNA was acetylated after DNA damage, extracts from UV-irradiated quiescent fibroblasts or HeLa cells, were immunoprecipitated with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. PCNA could be detected in immunocomplexes of both cell types after 30 min from UV-irradiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), and up to 24 h after DNA damage (Supplementary Figure S1C). To identify the KAT involved in PCNA acetylation, p300 was immunoprecipitated from soluble and chromatin-bound fractions of UV-irradiated quiescent fibroblasts. Only chromatin-bound PCNA interacted with p300, and was acetylated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), suggesting that the reaction occurred with PCNA bound to DNA; however, acetylated forms of PCNA could be pulled-down by GST-p21C from both pools (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Based on densitometric quantification of the slower migrating form, about 15â20% of total PCNA was acetylated in UV-irradiated quiescent fibroblasts. The amount of chromatin-bound PCNA in these cells ranged from 30 to 50%, suggesting that this PCNA pool was not totally acetylated.</p>

        <title>PCNA is preferentially acetylated by CBP at residues contacting DNA</title>
        <p>To compare CBP versus p300 for the ability to acetylate PCNA, their KAT activity was assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> with recombinant proteins. Incubation of recombinant PCNA in the presence of acetyl-CoA, resulted in higher acetylation levels when PCNA was incubated with CBP, rather than with p300 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). To quantify this difference, the acetylation reaction was performed with <sup>3</sup>H-labeled acetyl-CoA, and incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting.

To identify the lysine residue/s acetylated by each enzyme, recombinant PCNA was incubated with CBP or p300, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

In cells expressing RFP-PCNA<sup>wt</sup>, more than 80% RFP- and GFP-labeled cells were BrdU-positive, whereas in 2KR or 5KR mutants only about 29 and 11% RFP- and GFP-labeled cells, were also BrdU-positive, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In agreement with previous results (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), the 2KA mutant was loaded onto DNA to very low levels (Supplementary Figure S4C), and showed about 2% of BrdU incorporation (Supplementary Figure S4D), as compared with RFP-PCNA<sup>wt</sup>. Inefficient DNA replication activated a DNA damage response, since cells expressing RFP-PCNA mutants were positive for Î³-H2AX labeling, to levels higher than cells expressing RFP-PCNA<sup>wt</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).</p>

        <p>To evaluate DNA repair efficiency in cells expressing RFP-PCNA mutants, UV-induced UDS was analyzed by evaluating <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation in RFP-positive, non-S phase cells (Supplementary Figure S4E). UDS was significantly impaired both in 2KR and in 5KR mutants, as compared to wt protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), and this result was not due to inability of RFP-PCNA mutants to be recruited to DNA damage sites (Supplementary Figure S4F). DNA repair deficiency was accompanied by a parallel loss in cell viability, as evaluated by the number of RFP-positive dead cells after DNA damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>).</p>
        <p>In the above experiments, PCNA trimers were likely composed by endogenous and exogenous subunits (wt or mutant) in different proportions (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). To better evaluate the influence of lysine mutations on DNA synthesis, an <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA replication assay was performed using recombinant his-tagged PCNA<sup>wt</sup> and PCNA<sup>5KR</sup> (Supplementary Figure S4G). In this system, uncompetent G1-phase HeLa nuclei are used as template, and DNA synthesis is dependent upon addition of an S-phase cell extract (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Upon PCNA depletion (below 5%) with GST-p21C (Supplementary Figure S4H), his-PCNA<sup>wt</sup>, or his-PCNA<sup>5KR</sup> mutant was added, together with depleted extract and biotin-labeled dUTP, to G1-phase nuclei.

To rule out that impaired DNA synthesis in the presence of PCNA<sup>5KR</sup> mutant was due to defective PCNA loading, as observed for KâA mutants (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), nuclei after reaction were washed and extracted to assess the presence of chromatin-bound PCNA. His-PCNA<sup>5KR</sup> mutant was loaded onto DNA to a comparable extent than wt protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>); we consistently noticed that both proteins migrated fastly after the incubation, suggesting some form of processing (Supplementary Figure S4I).</p>

        <title>Defective DNA synthesis in PCNA acetylation mutants is not due to impaired interaction with DNA polymerase nor with CBP/p300</title>

        <title>Failure to acetylate PCNA results in its deficient removal from chromatin and blocks its degradation after DNA damage</title>
        <p>Since PCNA acetylation on Lys14 was suggested to modulate its degradation after UV damage (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), we reasoned that if a correlation exists between PCNA acetylation and its removal from chromatin for degradation, this may be dependent on CBP/p300 activity. To test this hypothesis, LF-1 fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of not-targeting, or CBP/p300 siRNA to deplete their protein levels, locally UV-irradiated and collected after 30 min or 4 h. No significant effect on the recruitment of PCNA to DNA damage sites was found at 30 min after UV (Supplementary Figure S5A), while a retention of PCNA was observed after 4 h in CBP/p300 depleted fibroblasts, as compared with fibroblasts incubated with non-targeting siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). To further understand these results, the removal of PCNA from chromatin at late DNA repair times, was also analyzed in acetylation-deficient RFP-PCNA mutants. In cells expressing RFP-PCNA<sup>wt</sup> the protein was removed by about 50% after 24 h from UV exposure, while in cells expressing the 2KR or the 5KR mutant, the disassembly of PCNA from chromatin was much more delayed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). To further support these results, live cell imaging of RFP-PCNA recruitment and subsequent release, were analyzed after laser micro-irradiation. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> shows that the initial time course of RFP-PCNA recruitment after DNA damage was not significantly different between the wt and the mutant proteins. The intensity over time of each cell was fitted with a single exponential function and mean values for the half max accumulation time were calculated (wt: 74 Â± 23 s; 2KR: 117 Â± 75 s; 5KR: 55 Â± 22 s). The plateau of maximum accumulation was calculated from the same fit functions (wt: 2.1 Â± 0.5; 2KR: 2.6 Â± 0.9; 5KR: 1.7 Â± 0.5 fold accumulation). In contrast, the release at late times (up to 60 min) was delayed in cells expressing the mutant proteins. Exponential decay curves and corresponding half life times were calculated from the averaged release curves (wt: 166 min; 2KR: 250 min; 5KR: 333 min).</p>

        <p>Next, PCNA turnover was analyzed in LF-1 fibroblasts after UV-irradiation in the presence of CHX to prevent new protein synthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Chromatin-bound PCNA showed the typical accumulation for DNA repair synthesis (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), even in the presence of CHX. In contrast, PCNA levels in the soluble fraction underwent a significant reduction, with a half-time of â¼3 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Noticeably, PCNA degradation occurred even when DNA damage was induced either by an oxidizing, or alkylating agent, or by ionizing radiation (Supplementary Figure S5B). Analysis of PCNA levels in both detergent-soluble and chromatin-bound fractions showed that degradation of the soluble form was completely rescued, and its level was even increased after depleting both CBP and p300 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). A detectable increase (by about 1.5Ã) in the amount of soluble form of PCNA was observed in non irradiated cells after siRNA depletion of both CBP and p300, indicating that their activity could influence the stability of PCNA even in unperturbed conditions. In CBP/p300-depleted and UV-irradiated cells, the increase in the soluble form of PCNA was about twice the amount observed in untreated control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). The dependence of PCNA degradation on the activity of each enzyme was also investigated by incubating LF-1 fibroblasts with siRNA to either CBP or p300, before irradiation. The effect of the single depletion was not significantly different from that observed after co-depletion of both CBP and p300, although the lower levels of soluble PCNA after irradiation suggested that both activities were important for PCNA degradation. In contrast, depletion of PCAF (Supplementary Figure S5C) did not influence UV-induced PCNA degradation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref> and Supplementary Figure S5D). The dependence of PCNA degradation on the acetylation of specific lysine residues was also verified by monitoring levels of the soluble form of RFP-PCNA<sup>wt</sup> versus the mutant forms after UV irradiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). A significant resistance of RFP-PCNA<sup>2KR</sup> and RFP-PCNA<sup>5KR</sup> to proteolytic destruction was found after UV-irradiation, while RFP-PCNA<sup>wt</sup> was degraded (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>). To prove that acetylation was required for signaling PCNA degradation through ubiquitination, HeLa cells expressing RFP-PCNA<sup>wt</sup> or mutants were UV-irradiated in the presence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Immunoprecipitation of RFP-PCNA showed that ubiquitinated forms were accumulated in cells expressing RFP-PCNA<sup>wt</sup>, while they could not be observed in 2KR, or 5KR mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7G</xref>). These results suggest that CBP/p300-mediated acetylation is necessary to trigger PCNA proteasomal degradation.</p>

These inhibitors did not affect PCNA acetylation in LF-1 fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>), nor in HeLa cells, whereas curcumin, a specific inhibitor of CBP/p300, greatly reduced the amount of acetylated PCNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Acetylation of PCNA was previously reported in proliferating cells, and after UV damage (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>); however, its role in DNA repair has remained unknown. In addition, the molecular mechanism responsible for PCNA acetylation was not investigated, except for the interaction with p300 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we have found that also CBP interacts with PCNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the interaction increased after DNA damage. <italic>In vitro</italic>, we have mapped the interaction domain at the C-terminus of CBP, namely at two fragments encompassing amino acid residues 1894â2441, corresponding to the homologous region of p300 (aa 1893â2414) that was previously shown to interact with PCNA (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>
      <p>CBP acetylated PCNA more efficiently than p300 <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction, as also indicated by the number of lysine acetylated by each enzyme, detected by MS. Among acetylated residues (Lys13, 14, 77 and 80), only the last two were detected by MS in cell proteomic studies (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), while Lys14 acetylation was suggested by mutational analysis (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The discrepancy in the number of aceylated residues may be explained by the amount of protein necessary to detect this modification.</p>
      <p>The lysines involved in acetylation are located in Î±-helices facing the inner hole of PCNA, and are important for contacting DNA (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Single point mutations of lysines in this region reduced the PCNA stimulatory activity of DNA polymerase Î´ (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). This loss of activity was explained by defects in PCNA loading by Replication Factor C (RFC)Â (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). However, re-assessement of these PCNA mutants has outlined the importance of internal Lys residues not only for RFC loading, but also for DNA polymerase Î´ activity (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Importantly, those studies only investigated the effect of lysine to alanine substitution. Our results confirmed that K77,80A substitution impaired PCNA loading; however, 2KR and 5KR PCNA mutants (maintaining the positive charge) could be loaded onto DNA. Notably, these mutants showed an impairment of DNA synthesis (both replication and repair), even if PCNA trimers could be formed by mutant (exogenous) and wt (endogenous) subunits. In addition, they triggered a DNA damage response, and increased cell death after DNA damage. These results suggest that acetylation of these residues is important for DNA synthesis. In fact, gene knock-out and depletion of both CBP and p300 proteins are known to affect DNA replication (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), and DNA repair (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>).</p>
      <p>Being PCNA acetylation mutants able to interact and to co-localize with DNA polymerase Î´, our results suggest that impaired DNA synthesis might be due to slowing down or blocking PCNA sliding caused by misalignement of residues contacting DNA (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). In fact, depletion of both CBP and p300 resulted in an accumulation of chromatin-bound PCNA to DNA damage sites which might delay the coordinated hand-off of intermediates during DNA repair (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Since acetylation will abolish the charge of lysines contacting DNA (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), further structural studies are required to explain the impact of this PCNA modification on DNA synthesis.</p>
      <p>PCNA acetylation was reported to disengage the interaction with MTH2 protein in response to UV damage, and trigger PCNA proteasomal degradation; however, the mechanism of PCNA acetylation was not investigated (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our results have shown that both CBP and p300 are required for PCNA turnover because their depletion prevented PCNA acetylation with consequent accumulation of chromatin-bound PCNA and reduction of its proteasomal degradation. Consistently, 2KR and 5KR PCNA acetylation-deficient mutants were released from chromatin more slowly than the wt protein, and they were not significantly degraded after UV irradiation because they were not appreciably polyubiquitinated. These results indicate that CBP/p300-mediated acetylation is the signal necessary for removal of chromatin-bound PCNA, thereby promoting polyubiquitination and consequent degradation upon DNA damage.</p>
      <p>Since the interaction of PCNA with CBP/p300 was detectable only in the chromatin-bound pool after UV damage, this suggests that PCNA acetylation occurs after loading on DNA. Although sterically the reaction seems disadvantaged, the DNA contact with residues of a single PCNA monomer (see Figure 1 in (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>)) might help the KAT enzyme in contacting the relevant residues in the two other monomers. In addition, CBP/p300 depletion by RNAi resulted in the accumulation of PCNA at DNA damage sites, despite the evident reduction in PCNA acetylation. These findings were also supported by the evidence that proteasomal inhibition by MG132 induced an accumulation of the chromatin-bound pool, with an increase in acetylated forms of PCNA. On-going DNA synthesis was not required for PCNA acetylation, as indicated by results with DNA polymerase Î´ inhibitors. In contrast, PCNA loading onto DNA was a necessary step because PCNA was not acetylated, nor significantly degraded in XPA cells, whose NER defect prevents PCNA loading (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, these results suggest a model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) in which chromatin-bound PCNA is acetylated by CBP and p300. After DNA synthesis is completed, acetylated PCNA is unloaded from DNA, thus entering the soluble pool where it is degraded by the proteasome. Acetylation, by linking DNA synthesis function of chromatin-bound PCNA to its removal and degradation, provides a novel mechanism to avoid excessive retention of PCNA on chromatin, that is dangerous for genome stability (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34, 35</xref>).</p>
