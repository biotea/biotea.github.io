<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) pathogenesis is a complex process involving a diverse array of extracellular and cell wall components. ClfB, an MSCRAMM (Microbial Surface Components Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules) family surface protein, described as a fibrinogen-binding clumping factor, is a key determinant of <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal colonization, but the molecular basis for ClfB-ligand recognition remains unknown. In this study, we solved the crystal structures of apo-ClfB and its complexes with fibrinogen Î± (Fg Î±) and cytokeratin 10 (CK10) peptides. Structural comparison revealed a conserved glycine-serine-rich (GSR) ClfB binding motif (GSSGXGXXG) within the ligands, which was also found in other human proteins such as Engrailed protein, TCF20 and Dermokine proteins. Interaction between Dermokine and ClfB was confirmed by subsequent binding assays. The crystal structure of ClfB complexed with a 15-residue peptide derived from Dermokine revealed the same peptide binding mode of ClfB as identified in the crystal structures of ClfB-Fg Î± and ClfB-CK10. The results presented here highlight the multi-ligand binding property of ClfB, which is very distinct from other characterized MSCRAMMs to-date. The adherence of multiple peptides carrying the GSR motif into the same pocket in ClfB is reminiscent of MHC molecules. Our results provide a template for the identification of other molecules targeted by <italic>S. aureus</italic> during its colonization and infection. We propose that other MSCRAMMs like ClfA and SdrG also possess multi-ligand binding properties.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>
<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>), an important opportunistic pathogen, is a major threat to humans and animals, causing high morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is responsible for a variety of infections ranging from mild superficial infections to severe infections such as infective endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and sepsis. Such infections are of growing concern due to the increasing antibiotic resistance of <italic>S. aureu</italic>s. In order to understand the mechanism of the <italic>S. aureu</italic>s pathogenesis, we studied one of the bacterial surface proteins clumping factor B (ClfB) bound by the fibrinogen Î± (Fg Î±) and cytokeratin 10 (CK10). From analyses of the high resolution crystal structures we found that the ClfB-binding peptides harbor a stretch with consensus sequence (GSSGXGXXG) that is also conserved in Engrailed protein, TCF20 and Dermokines. The interaction between ClfB and a dermokine-derived peptide was demonstrated using binding assays. Consistent with a role of ClfB in the inflammatory responses induced by <italic>S. aureus</italic>, expression of dermokines is predominant in epithelial tissues and upregulated in inflammatory diseases. The data presented in this study raise a possibility that multiple human proteins are targeted by ClfB during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. The multi-ligand binding feature of ClfB would be valuable for developing new therapeutic strategies.</p>

      <p>
<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>), an important opportunistic pathogen, is a major threat to humans and animals causing high morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is responsible for a variety of infections ranging from mild superficial infections to severe infections such as infective endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and sepsis <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Lowy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Such infections are of growing concern because of the increasing antibiotic resistance of <italic>S. aureu</italic>s <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Mascari1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Cordwell1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Multiple sites within the body can be colonized, including the perineum and the axilla, but the most frequent site of the carriage is the moist squamous epithelium of the anterior nares. Moreover, the organism can be disseminated from a superficial site via the bloodstream to internal organs where it can set up a metastatic focus of infection. Approximately 80% of invasive <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections are autologous in that they are caused by strains carried in the patient's nose prior to illness <xref rid="ppat.1002751-vonEiff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Wertheim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The ability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to cause diseases has been generally attributed to two classes of virulence determinants: cell wall-associated proteins and extracellular protein toxins. The initial step in pathogenesis is often cell adhesion, mediated by surface adhesins called MSCRAMMs (Microbial Surface Components Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules) <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Gillaspy1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Patti1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. To date, <italic>S. aureus</italic> is known to express more than 20 different potential MSCRAMMs <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Navarre1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Speziale1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>SD-repeat-containing (Sdr) proteins are members of the MSCRAMM family, including clumping factor A (ClfA), ClfB, SdrC, SdrD and SdrE of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and SdrF and SdrG of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. The Sdr proteins are characterized by the presence of an R region composed largely of repeated SD dipeptides <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Josefsson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. They exhibit a comparable structural organization including an N-terminal secretory signal sequence followed by a ligand-binding A region and a dipeptide repeat region (R) composed mainly of aspartate and serine residues. The LPXTG cell wall-anchoring motif (W) immediately follows the SD-repeat region and is followed by a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain (M) and a short positively charged cytoplasmic tail (C). Despite their conserved structural organization, the Sdr proteins are not closely related in sequence, with only 20 to 30% identical amino acid residues in the ligand-binding A domain. This suggests that different Sdr proteins might play different roles in <italic>S. aureus</italic> pathogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Sabat1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ClfB is one of the best characterized surface proteins on <italic>S. aureus</italic> during the past decade <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Herrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The multi-functional characteristics are quite unique to this adhesin, unlike ClfA and SdrG that have been shown to bind only to fibrinogen <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Hartford1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ponnuraj1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. ClfB plays a key role in establishing human nasal colonization by binding to the human type I cytokeratin 10 (CK10) expressed on squamous epithelial cells <xref rid="ppat.1002751-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Candi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Wertheim2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Consistently, recent studies have shown that the immunization of mice with ClfB reduces nasal colonization <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Schaffer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. As a bifunctional MSCRAMM, ClfB also binds to fibrinogen Î± (Fg Î±), which is assumed to be significant in platelet activation and aggregation and has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of experimental endocarditis in rats <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Patti1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-OBrien2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Entenza1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Unlike ClfA, FnBPA and FnBPB, which bind to the Î³ chain of fibrinogen, ClfB binds to repeat 5 (NSGSSGTGSTGNQ) of the flexible region of its Î± chain <xref rid="ppat.1002751-NiEidhin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Perkins1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The repeat may form a loop, similar to the Tyr-(Gly/Ser)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> Î© loops present in the C-terminus of CK10, to which ClfB also binds <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Fg Î± and CK10 harbor the same or overlapping binding sites on ClfB <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, but the detailed mechanism of ClfB recognition of Fg Î± and CK10 is unclear.</p>
      <p>Structural studies suggest that ClfA and SdrG have different ligand binding characteristics and mechanisms <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ponnuraj1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, although the structural organizations of the adhesion domains of these two MSCRAMMs are very similar. A âdock, lock, and latchâ (DLL) model was proposed for SdrG-ligand recognition, where SdrG adopts an open conformation that allows the Fg ligand to access a binding trench between the N2 and N3 domains <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ponnuraj1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In ClfA, however, the cavity is preformed in a stabilized closed configuration, into which the C-terminal of the Î³ chain of fibrinogen threads. Therefore, the ClfA-Fg binding mechanism was proposed to be âLatch and Dockâ <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we solved the crystal structures of the apo-ClfB adhesive domain and its complexes with peptides derived from Fg Î± and CK10. Our structures showed that ClfB recognizes its ligands in a similar manner with the DLL model. A previous study on the structures of ClfB complexed with Fg Î± and CK10 peptides suggested that the conserved peptide-derived motif (GSSGXG) is required for their binding to ClfB <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The data presented in the present study, however, support a minimal nine amino acids Gly-Ser-Rich (GSR) motif that is necessary and sufficient for binding to ClfB. Human genome mining using the motif as a template identified several candidates including Engrailed protein, TCF20 and Dermokine as potential ClfB-binding proteins. Interaction of Dermokine with ClfB was confirmed by biochemical and structural studies, which demonstrate that nearly identical mechanisms are utilized by ClfB to recognize its binding partners. Our data not only provides insights into the ligand binding mechanism of ClfB but also raises the possibility that ClfB targets multiple substrates during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections. These results would be valuable for the development of new therapeutic strategies.</p>

        <title>Structure of apo-ClfB<sub>(197â542)</sub>

        <p>Previous studies indicated that a segment of ClfB containing N2 and N3 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) is sufficient for recognition of Fg Î± and CK10 <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We therefore cloned the segment encoding the two regions (amino acids 197 to 542) of the ClfB protein from <italic>S. aureus</italic> and purified the protein from <italic>E. coli</italic> for our structural studies. The structure of the ClfB<sub>(208â540)</sub>-Fg Î±<sub>(316â328)</sub> complex was solved by a Se-Met derived protein and was used as a starting model for determination of the other structures by the molecular replacement method (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002751-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>The apo-ClfB<sub>(197â534)</sub> structure was solved at 2.5 Ã resolution, consisting of residues Ser197-Ala534 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). No electron density was observed for the C-terminal eight residues in the apo-ClfB structure. The polypeptide chain of apo-ClfB<sub>(197â534)</sub> is composed of two distinct domains N2 and N3, as previously described for other MSCRAMMs in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Deivanayagam1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> . The N-terminal N2-domain contains 146 residues (amino acids 213â358) and the N3 domain 170 residues (amino acids 359â528). In the crystal structure, both N2 and N3 have two layers of Î²-sheets that pack tightly against each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, packing between the two domains is much looser, resulting in the formation of a large groove between them where presumably ligands bind. In N3 domain, strands A, B, E, and D form one of the two principal sheets, while strands Dâ², Dâ³, C, F, and G on the opposite face present the other. Similar to the structures of other Fg-binding MSCRAMMs <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ponnuraj1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Geoghegan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the structures of N2 and N3 display a typical Dev-IgG fold featured by the existence of the additional strands Dâ² and Dâ³ as compared to the C-type IgG fold <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Deivanayagam1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The structures of the N2 and N3 domains can be well superposed with an rms deviation of 0.98 Ã for all CÎ± atoms. One structural difference between them, however, is the three-stranded Î²-sheet (A, B and E) on one side of N2 in comparison with a four-stranded Î²-sheet (D, F, C and Gâ³) on its corresponding side in N3, as described in the structures of ClfA, SdrG and ClfB <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ponnuraj1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p>ClfB<sup>Ser197</sup> and ClfB<sup>Leu198</sup> or even a short N-terminally extended segment such as the unrelated His-tag were shown to be necessary to maintain the Fg binding activity of ClfB <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Perkins1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, though the mechanism of how the N-terminal segment of N2 participates in substrate binding is unclear. In the crystal structure of apo-ClfB, the N-terminus (Ser197-Ala201) of one ClfB<sub>(197â542)</sub> molecule binds to the N3 domain of a symmetry-related ClfB molecule, forming a Î²-sheet together with the strand G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002751.s001">Figure S1</xref>) mediated by 2 pairs of main-chain hydrogen bonds. Additional hydrogen bonds involving ClfB<sup>Gln235</sup> and ClfB<sup>Val200</sup> further contribute to the N-terminus-mediated interaction between ClfBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These interactions may act together to stabilize the G-strand of the N3 domain, thus maintaining its Dev-IgG fold and mimicking the transition state of ligand binding.</p>

        <p>Structural comparison of the apo-ClfB and the two complexes shows that the RMSDs of the CÎ± atoms in ClfB are 0.46 Ã and 0.49 Ã respectively, indicating that the overall ClfB remains unchanged upon binding of the ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Marked conformational changes, however, occur to the C-terminus of ClfB<sub>(499â512)</sub> in both complexes. In ClfB-Fg Î±<sub>(316â328)</sub>, the residues ClfB<sup>Arg529- Ser542</sup> that are disordered in the structure of apo-ClfB become well defined following Fg Î±<sub>(316â328)</sub> binding. The distal C-terminus of ClfB<sub>(197â542)</sub> forms a short Î²-strand Gâ², which forms a parallel Î²-sheet with the Î²-strand E from the N2 domain. The formation of the Î²-sheet is mediated by several main chain and side chain hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The ligand-induced stabilization of the C-terminal peptide of ClfB allows it to run across Fg Î±<sub>(316â328)</sub> on the top. This binding mode is consistent with the DLL model as demonstrated in SdrG-Fg Î² complex <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ponnuraj1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In contrast with Fg Î±<sub>(316â328)</sub>, the peptide CK10<sub>(499â512)</sub> did not induce formation of the Î²-strand Gâ² in ClfB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Nonetheless, the C-terminal portion of strand G that interacts with Fg Î±<sub>(316â328)</sub> also becomes well defined and caps on the CK10<sub>(499â512)</sub> peptide.</p>
        <p>While we were preparing this manuscript, the structures of apo- and ligand binding ClfB were reported by V.Ganesh et. al <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Interestingly, the structural features we observed here are noticeably distinct from those of Fg Î±/CK10-ClfB complexes solved by them <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In both of their structures, particularly in the Fg Î±-ClfB complex, although the peptide adopts a conserved conformation as that in our structure, the C-terminus of the G-strand exhibits a different orientation and is not inserted into the N2 domain to form an extra strand Gâ² with the strand E, and thus the peptide is not locked in the groove between N2 and N3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In this way, their structures do not support the DLL model proposed based on the SdrG protein structure <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ponnuraj1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In addition, on peptide binding no rearrangement occurs to the loop between D and Dâ² in N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Although the C-terminus of ClfB in the CK10-ClfB complexes has similar conformation as that in our structure, the D Dâ² loop in N2 domain shows no rearrangement, either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The differences in the peptide conformations observed between our and Ganesh et al. works, could be attributed to the methodologies adopted in crystallization. While we co-purified the ClfB with the peptides to form a complex prior to crystallization, Ganesh et al. reported that they soaked the peptides into the apo-ClfB crystals <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In their structures, the conformational changes observed in our study to accommodate the peptide and then to lock it in place could have been hindered by crystal packing within the crystals.</p>
        <p>In all, our structures strongly support the DLL model for ClfB-ligand binding. Briefly, âDockâ of the peptide triggers the rearrangement of the C-terminus of the N3 domain, allowing ClfB<sup>Arg529</sup> to form a hydrogen bond with the ClfB<sup>Asn238</sup> from N2 domain. This would result in âLockâ of the peptide into the substrate binding groove, whereas the strong interaction between Gâ² and the E strand of N2 can âLatchâ the peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

ClfA<sup>Tyr338</sup> that is conserved in the structures of SdrE and SdrD (data not shown), forms a hydrogen bond with the amino acid at the end of the G strand (Asn530 in ClfA), thus stabilizing the conformation of the Gâ² strand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002751.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

        <title>Mechanisms of specifically recognizing repeat 5 of Fg Î± (Fg Î±5) by ClfB</title>
        <p>The Fg Î± C-terminal domain (amino acids 221â610) of human Fg contains ten 13-residue tandem repeats, within which up to eight residues are glycines or serines <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Tsurupa1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Despite the similar sequences among the repeats, only Fg Î±5 was shown to be recognized by ClfB <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The reason for this was proposed to be the presence of proline or arginine residues in the center of the putative Î© loops in the other repeats though the precise underlying mechanism remains unknown <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The crystal structures presented here offer an explanation for this observation. Structural comparison of the two complexes revealed that interactions of the peptides with ClfB are primarily mediated through a conserved motif in the peptides: G-S-S-G-S/T-G-S-X-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Sequence alignment of the repeats indicates that Fg Î±5 differs from the other repeats at the 5<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The hydroxyl group of S/T at the 5<sup>th</sup> position is involved in hydrogen bonding interactions. On the other hand, the size of the residue at this position is limited by its neighboring residues. Thus, other residues except S/T at this position are expected to compromise the interactions between the repeat and ClfB either because of loss of hydrogen bonding interaction or generation of steric hindrance. The 7<sup>th</sup> position appears to play a role in maintaining the local conformation of the peptide by forming a Î³-turn with the 9<sup>th</sup> position. In the structure of CK10-ClfB complex solved by V.Ganesh et al., the 7<sup>th</sup> position was replaced with a histidine residue, suggesting that the residue at this position can be varied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002751.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The G<sub>9</sub> residue was headed to the end of the Î²-sheet D and the ClfB<sup>Met280</sup> and ClfB<sup>Pro281</sup> in N2 limit residues with any side chain which would generate clash against them. In addition, a turn at the G<sub>9</sub> is required to permit the peptide out of the tunnel, explaining why the repeat 2 with an alanine at this position cannot bind to ClfB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Importance of the GSR motif in recognition by ClfB</title>
        <p>After carefully analyzing the sequences and the peptide binding specificities of ClfB, we propose that a small motif G<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-S<sub>3</sub>-G<sub>4</sub>-G/S/T<sub>5</sub>-G<sub>6</sub>-X<sub>7</sub>-X<sub>8</sub>-G<sub>9</sub> is responsible for ligand binding to the ClfB adhesive domains. Taking the Fg Î±<sub>(316â328)</sub>-ClfB complex as an example, within this motif, the G<sub>1</sub> is limited by the side chain of ClfB<sup>W522</sup> with the limitation of the space and is also required for the Fg Î± peptide making a turn thus exiting the tunnel. The S<sub>2</sub> is the most critical residue because it not only forms two hydrogen bonds with the side chains of ClfB<sup>W522</sup> and ClfB<sup>Q377</sup> but also binds to the main chain of ClfB<sup>S376</sup>. Similar to the S<sub>2</sub>, the S<sub>3</sub> forms two hydrogen bonds with the side chain of ClfB<sup>Q235</sup> and ClfB<sup>S236</sup> in the N2 domain, which could be replaced by a smaller residue such as alanine. The following residues, especially the G<sub>4</sub>, G/S/T/<sub>5</sub> and G<sub>6</sub>, are necessary for the formation of the stable protein-peptide complex because they form hydrogen bonds with ClfB and the size of the Î²-sheet G covering tunnel does not accommodate residues with larger side chains. The S<sub>7</sub> might play a role in maintaining the local conformation of the peptide by forming a Î³-turn with the G<sub>9</sub>. The space for the S<sub>8</sub> appears to be enough for residues with larger side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002751.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Finally, the G<sub>9</sub> needs to form a turn to allow the peptide out of the tunnel. Thus, the somewhat soft binding trench of ClfB would be able to bind to a series of peptides with this feature.</p>
        <p>To further confirm our hypothesis regarding the importance of the nine-amino-acid GSR motif, we did the alanine scan using the SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) system with a synthetic 9-residue peptide derived from the GSR motif (GSSGSGSNG). The results are highly consistent with our structural observation and clearly show that the nine-amino-acid peptide is necessary and sufficient for binding to ClfB <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Dermokine is a potential ligand of ClfB</title>
        <p>Our results suggest that proteins carrying the GSR motif are able to bind to ClfB. To find other potential ligands of ClfB, we searched the NCBI protein database for additional proteins containing the sequence of G<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-S<sub>3</sub>-G<sub>4</sub>-G/S/T<sub>5</sub>-G<sub>6</sub>-X<sub>7</sub>-X<sub>8</sub>-G<sub>9</sub>. Three proteins, TCF20, Engrailed protein and Dermokine (Derm) were found to be the hits, out of which Dermokine was evaluated more in detail in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g005">Figures. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g006">6</xref>). Dermokine is expressed in many epithelial tissues, localized to intracellular or pericellular spaces and overexpressed in inflammatory diseases. The two major isoforms Î± and Î² are transcribed from different promoters at the same locus. Recently, additional transcript variants Î³, Î´ and Îµ have been identified <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Moffatt1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Firstly, Derm was tested for its interaction with ClfB. To this end, we synthesized a 15-amino-acid-peptide (250â264; GQSGSSGSGSNGDNN, designated as Derm15 hereafter) derived from Derm and then characterized its binding to ClfB using the SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) assay. In the assay, ClfB bound to the peptide with a dissociation constant of 2.37 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Interestingly, the results also showed that the Derm peptide interacted with ClfB with slow kinetics, further supporting the DLL model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). To understand the molecular mechanism underlying this interaction, we solved the crystal structure of ClfB<sub>(208â542)</sub> bound to the peptide at 2.5 Ã resolution. As expected, Derm15 interacts with ClfB in a nearly identical manner with Fg Î±<sub>(316â328)</sub> and CK10<sub>(499â512)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g007">Figure 7 B</xref>). The ClfB<sup>Arg529</sup> forms a hydrogen bond with ClfB<sup>Asn328</sup> and the C-terminus of N3 forms an extra strand, which is similar as that in the ClfB-Fg Î±<sub>(316â328)</sub> and ClfB-CK10<sub>(499â512)</sub> complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g007">Figure 7 C</xref>). Mutagenesis studies were conducted to further verify the binding of Derm15 to ClfB. We replaced the residues ClfB<sup>S236, W522</sup> that participate in interactions with the peptide with alanine respectively. The mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity and tested for their interaction with the Derm peptide using SPR. While the wild type ClfB bound tightly to Derm15, the mutant proteins ClfB<sub>(197â542)</sub> S236A or W522A exhibited much lower binding affinities with the peptide in mM range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002751.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Interestingly, besides the low binding affinities, both mutant proteins exhibited rapid association and dissociation behaviors in the experiments, as compared to the slow association and scarcely any dissociation behaviors observed for the wild type protein. These results indicated that the residues ClfB<sup>S236, W522</sup> are not only involved in the binding with ClfB, but also participate in stabilizing or âlockingâ the peptide in place. Collectively, our results strongly support the interaction between ClfB and Derm <italic>in vitro</italic> and suggest that Derm may involve in the infection process and pathogenesis caused by <italic>S. aureus in vivo</italic>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The colonization of the host nares by the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>S. aureus</italic> is mediated by a family of cell surface proteins which promote its adhesion to the extracellular matrix, that is, the MSCRAMMs <xref rid="ppat.1002751-McDevitt1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. ClfB, as a component of this family protein, has been studied for the past decade and was unique in its multi-functional characteristics, as compared to ClfA and SdrG that only bind to fibrinogens <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Hartford1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ponnuraj1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Consistent with the studies of the SdrG-fibrinogen complex <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ponnuraj1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, data from this study support the DLL binding mechanism of ClfB with the Fg Î±/CK10-derived peptides, but not the mechanism suggested in the previous study by V. Ganesh et al. <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In their work, due to the absence of the âLatchâ procedure observed in the crystal structure, the binding mechanism was ascribed to the âDLâ model. However, the structures of ClfB-peptide complexes solved in this study, together with the SPR data, indicate that the DLL model should be the mechanism utilized by ClfB to bind to its ligands. Our results also indicate that the DLL model may be the principal mechanism of MSCRAMM-ligand complexes.</p>
      <p>In V. Ganesh et al.'s studies of the ClfB complexes, they proposed a common GSSGXG motif constituting the ClfB binding site <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Ganesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, which is inconsistent with the previous studies on ClfB. For example, within the ten tandem Fg Î± repeats, repeat 2, 3, 4 and 5 all contain the GSSGXG motif but only the repeat 5 can bind to ClfB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Our structural and the alanine screening analyses demonstrate that a 9-residue peptide G<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-S<sub>3</sub>-G<sub>4</sub>-G/S/T<sub>5</sub>-G<sub>6</sub>-X<sub>7</sub>-X<sub>8</sub>-G<sub>9</sub> is necessary and sufficient for binding to ClfB <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is therefore predicted that a protein incorporating such a motif is able to interact with ClfB. Indeed, our biochemical assays showed that a Dermokine-derived peptide containing the ClfB binding motif interacted with ClfB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g007">Figures 7B, 7C</xref>). Further supporting this prediction, our structural studies revealed that the binding mode of the Dermokine-derived peptide to ClfB is nearly identical with that of the Fg Î±/CK10-derived peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002751-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Collectively, these findings raise a provocative possibility that ClfB might act on multiple targets during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections. Given the fact that ClfB acts as a key determinant of <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal colonization, this may not be totally surprising.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Dermokine was first identified as a gene expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, and more recently, other isoforms of this gene besides its Î± and Î² isoforms have also been found. This gene is expressed in various cells and epithelial tissues and over-expressed in inflammatory conditions <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Moffatt1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, suggesting that Dermokine might play a role in inflammatory processes since the over-expression of the mediators in immune cell activation characterizes many inflammatory diseases. ClfB is involved not only in the <italic>S. aureus</italic>'s colonization of human nares but also in the diseases caused by this bacterium. Additionally, <italic>S. aureus</italic> has also been implicated in several inflammation processes including corneal inflammation. ClfB's binding to Dermokine raises the possibility that ClfB might play a role in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> caused inflammation and the Dermokine gene's over-expression might serve as biological markers whose products could bind to ClfB and participate in this process. Obviously more investigations are needed to verify ClfB-Dermokine interaction during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections as well as the biological significance of the interaction.</p>
      <p>The characterization of ClfB as a multi-ligand binding protein will be meaningful for the identification of putative substrates and for furthering our understanding of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection pathway. Our findings also provide important leads towards the development of new therapeutic agents capable of eradicating <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriage in individuals and efficiently interfering with staphylococcal infection. This is particularly important since new antibacterial strategies are in urgent need to combat the drug resistant bacteria that continuing to emerge <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Navarre2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002751-Sinha1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p>
