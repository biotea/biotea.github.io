        <p>Î²-ureidopropionase (Î²UP) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by N-carbamyl-Î²-amino aciduria. To date, only 16 genetically confirmed patients with Î²UP deficiency have been reported. Here, we report on the clinical, biochemical and molecular findings of 13 Japanese Î²UP deficient patients. In this group of patients, three novel missense mutations (p.G31S, p.E271K, and p.I286T) and a recently described mutation (p.R326Q) were identified. The p.R326Q mutation was detected in all 13 patients with eight patients being homozygous for this mutation. Screening for the p.R326Q mutation in 110 Japanese individuals showed an allele frequency of 0.9Â %. Transient expression of mutant Î²UP enzymes in HEK293 cells showed that the p.E271K and p.R326Q mutations cause profound decreases in activity (â¤ 1.3Â %). Conversely, Î²UP enzymes containing the p.G31S and p.I286T mutations possess residual activities of 50 and 70Â %, respectively, suggesting we cannot exclude the presence of additional mutations in the non-coding region of the <italic>UPB1</italic> gene. Analysis of a human Î²UP homology model revealed that the effects of the mutations (p.G31S, p.E271K, and p.R326Q) on enzyme activity are most likely linked to improper oligomer assembly. Highly variable phenotypes ranging from neurological involvement (including convulsions and autism) to asymptomatic, were observed in diagnosed patients. High prevalence of p.R326Q in the normal Japanese population indicates that Î²UP deficiency is not as rare as generally considered and screening for Î²UP deficiency should be included in diagnosis of patients with unexplained neurological abnormalities.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pyrimidine nucleotides play an important role in various biological processes, including synthesis of RNA, DNA, phospholipids, uridine diphosphate glucose and glycogen. Intracellular pools of pyrimidines are produced de novo through salvage and catabolic pathways (Huang and Graves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2003</xref>; Traut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1994</xref>), and in humans, the pyrimidine bases uracil and thymine, are degraded via three enzymatic steps (Wasternack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1980</xref>). Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, EC 1.3.1.2) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme, catalyzing uracil and thymine reduction to 5,6-dihydrouracil and 5,6-dihydrothymine, respectively. The second enzyme, dihydropyrimidinase (DHP, EC 3.5.2.2), catalyzes the hydrolytic ring opening of the dihydropyrimidines. The third step, catalyzed by Î²-ureidopropionase (Î²UP) (EC 3.5.1.6), results in conversion of N-carbamyl-Î²-alanine and N-carbamyl-Î²-aminoisobutyric acid into Î²-alanine and Î²-aminoisobutyric acid, respectively, with concomitant production of ammonia and carbon dioxide.</p>
      <p>Higher eukaryotic Î²UP belong to the nitrilase superfamily of enzymes (Pace and Brenner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2001</xref>). The closest known structural relative of human Î²UP is found in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (DmÎ²UP) (Lundgren et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>), sharing 63Â % amino acid sequence identity. In solution, DmÎ²UP exists as a mixture of oligomers but crystallizes as a homooctamer. It has a helical-turn like structure that is consecutively built up from dimeric units. This is in contrast to other members of the nitrilase superfamily that assemble their homotetrameric or homohexameric native states in a markedly different fashion, and is most likely because of an N-terminal â¼65 amino acid extension unique to Î²UPs.</p>
      <p>Î²UP deficiency (MIM 606673) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the Î²UP gene, <italic>UPB1</italic>. The <italic>UPB1</italic> gene maps to chromosome 22q11.2, and consists of ten exons spanning approximately 20Â kb of genomic DNA (Vreken et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1999</xref>). To date, only 16 genetically confirmed patients with Î²UP deficiency have been reported (van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). The clinical phenotype of these patients is highly variable, but tends to center around neurological problems (van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). However, in Japan, four asymptomatic individuals have been detected through newborn screening by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and the prevalence of Î²UP deficiency in Japan has been estimated to be one in 6000 (Kuhara et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>). Thus, the clinical presentation and biochemical and genetic spectrum of patients with Î²UP deficiency are still largely unknown.</p>
      <p>In this study, we report genetic and biochemical analysis, and clinical follow-up findings, of 13 Japanese patients (including seven newly identified individuals) with Î²UP deficiency. Functional and structural consequences of the mutations at the protein level were analysed using a eukaryotic expression system and a homology model generated based on the crystal structure of recombinant DmÎ²UP.</p>

        <title>Patients</title>
        <p>Patients 1, 2 and 3, who presented with neurological abnormalities during early childhood were detected through a high-risk urine screening for general metabolic disorders performed at Kanazawa Medical University (Ohse et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>). In general patients are tested for metabolic disorders if patients presented with developmental delay, hyperammonemia, metabolic acidosis and neurological manifestations such as convulsions, autism and related disorders. Patients 4â7 and 8â13 were from two different areas in Japan, detected in a pilot study screening for inborn errors of metabolism by GC/MS in newborn urine samples, and conducted at Kanazawa Medical University (Kuhara et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>) (patients 4â7) and Kurume University (patients 8â13). After informed consent was obtained from their parents, urine and blood samples from all patients were sent to the Laboratory for Genetic Metabolic Diseases in Amsterdam, the Netherlands for further analysis.</p>

        <title>Quantitative pyrimidine analysis</title>
        <p>On the basis of a gross elevation of N-carbamyl-Ã-alanine and N-carbamyl-Ã-aminoisobutyric acid in urine screening for inborn errors of metabolism by GCMS (Ohse et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>), Ã-ureidopropionase deficiency was suspected. Subsequently, quantitation of relevant pyrimidines and its metabolites was performed by HPLC tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of uracil, thymine, dihydrouracil, dihydrothymine, N-carbamyl-Î²-alanine and N-carbamyl-Î²-aminoisobutyric acid, in urine-soaked filter paper strips, were determined using reversed-phase HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) (van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004c</xref>; van Lenthe et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2000</xref>).</p>

Compatible primers (TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1S</xref>, Supplementary data) were designed for use with the QuikChangeâ¢ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Life technologies). PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturerâs recommended protocol.

        <title>Clinical evaluation</title>
        <p>All patients were born to healthy non-consanguineous Japanese parents. Patient 1 was a girl born at full term following an uneventful delivery. At the age of two months, she was irritable and had occasional jerky eye movements, with impairment of visual contact noticed. A week later she presented with infantile spasms, and head-nodding three to four times a day. Cortical dysplasia was suspected from head MRI, and EEGs showed hypsarrhythmia. She was diagnosed with West syndrome. Biochemical investigation of urine obtained during her first admission revealed significantly increased levels of N-carbamyl-Î²-alanine and N-carbamyl-Î²-aminoisobutyric acid (Kuhara et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>). The infantile spasms and abnormal EEGs did not respond to zonisamide, therefore adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) therapy was started at three months of age, and subsequently, the seizures disappeared and EEG abnormalities subsided. At the age of 5 years, she had partial seizures occasionally but her development was within the normal range.</p>
        <p>Patient 2 was a 3-year old boy who presented with autism and mild mental retardation. At the age of 18 months, his parents noticed social communication impairments, including eye-to-eye gazing, facial expression, and language understanding. At the age of 3.5Â years, he was diagnosed with autism. When he was 8 years old, he developed a sleep disorder and melatonin treatment was started. The Wechsler Intelligence Score for Children test, performed at 11 years of age, revealed a full scale IQ of 71, verbal IQ of 66, and performance IQ of 83. He now attends a special-needs school.</p>
        <p>Patient 3 was a 12-month old boy who presented with mild hypotonia and motor developmental delay. The family history found a 15-year old male cousin from the paternal side suffers from epilepsy and autism related disorder. At the follow-up age of 2.8Â years, his motor development caught up to the normal range but he has developed mild mental retardation, particularly in speech development.</p>
        <p>Patients 4â7 were detected through neonatal screening performed from 1996 to 2009 in Kanazawa (Kuhara et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>). Since screening, they have been followed regularly by an attending paediatrician. Patient 4 is a boy who developed neurological symptoms during the follow-up period. At the age of 12 months, he had an attack of sudden-onset consciousness impairment, a blank stare, and unresponsiveness which lasted for 2â3Â min. A year after this episode, he developed febrile seizures that occurred four times. One of the attacks lasted over 30 min and was not easily controlled. The laboratory investigation at admission showed no abnormalities. His fever abated the following day and he regained consciousness. Further investigations by head MRI and EEG were normal. He has had no seizures since 3 years of age, owing to the use of diazepam suppositories during fevers. At 5 years of age, he has normal growth and development.</p>
        <p>Patients 5 and 6 are twin sisters, born at 36 weeks gestation with birth weights of 2042Â g and 2378Â g, respectively. During a follow-up period of 5 years, patient 6 showed no physical examination abnormalities. Patient 5 has a height within the 3â10 percentile range and has developed hypermetropia. Patient 7 is a 10-year-old boy with an unremarkable history and no clinical manifestations during follow-up. Patients 8â13 were detected from newborn screening performed in Kurume during a period from February 2010 to January 2012. None of them showed abnormal developmental milestones at follow-up evaluation.</p>

        <title>Pyrimidine bases and degradation metabolites in urine</title>
        <p>Urinary quantitative analysis of relevant pyrimidines and metabolites was performed by HPLC-MS/MS. Urinary concentrations of the 13 patients are shown as subdivided genotype groups (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). All urine samples from the patients showed strongly elevated levels of N-carbamyl-Î²-alanine and N-carbamyl-Î²-aminoisobutyric acid, and moderately elevated levels of dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine. Mean concentrations of uracil (25.5âÂ±â11.4Â Î¼mol/mmol creatinine), thymine (3.6âÂ±â1.9Â Î¼mol/mmol creatinine), dihydrouracil (57âÂ±â27Â Î¼mol/mmol creatinine), and dihydrothymine (127âÂ±â65Â Î¼mol/mmol creatinine), were 2-, 7-, 9-, and 41âfold, respectively, higher compared with mean concentrations observed in controls. Additionally, mean concentrations of N-carbamyl-Î²-alanine (648âÂ±â208Â Î¼mol/mmol creatinine) and N-carbamyl-Î²-aminoisobutyric acid (504âÂ±â297Â Î¼mol/mmol creatinine) were 59-and 276-fold, respectively, higher compared to mean concentrations observed in controls. The observed N-carbamyl-Î²-amino aciduria in these patients strongly suggests Î²UP deficiency.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Pyrimidine and metabolite concentrations in urine of Î²UP deficient patients and controls.

No endogenous Î²UP activity (&lt; 0.7Â nmol/mg/h) was detected in HEK293 cells. Activity of wild-type Î²UP protein was 1976âÂ±â416Â nmol/mg/h (nâ=â9). Recombinant Î²UP enzymes carrying mutations p.E271K and p.R326Q, exhibited 0.7 and 1.3Â %, respectively, of wild-type activity, whereas Î²UP enzymes containing mutations p.G31S and p.I286T, possessed residual activities of 51.6 and 69.8Â %, respectively (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Immunoblot analysis of expression levels of Î²UP mutant proteins in soluble extracts from transfected HEK293 cells, showed mutant proteins were expressed in comparable amounts as wild-type protein (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).</p>
        <p>Western blotting of blue native gels detected various high molecular weight oligomeric forms of wild-type Î²UP, comparable or identical to that observed for Î²UP enzymes containing p.G31S and p.I286T mutations. In contrast, no distinct sharp bands of high molecular weight were observed for Î²UP enzymes containing p.E271K and p.R326Q mutations, although bands of lower molecular weights were present, corresponding to lower oligomeric states (from monomers to octamers) of Î²UP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). These lower molecular weight species were also observed in extracts from wild-type, p.G31S and p.I286T expressing cells, albeit with evidently lower intensity. This indicates that p.E271K and p.R326Q proteins have a dramatically reduced ability to form larger oligomers, and thus, their potential equilibrium of oligomerization status was shifted towards lower molecular weight species.</p>

        <title>Population study of Î²UP deficiency and the p.R326Q mutation</title>
        <p>Three patients with Î²UP deficiency were identified out of 4500 patients of a high-risk screening group demonstrating that the prevalence of Î²UP deficiency in a high-risk screening group is one in 1500. PCR-RFLP analysis of the c.977Gâ&gt;âA (p.R326Q) mutation was performed in 110 Japanese healthy controls. We identified two individuals heterozygous for the p.R326Q mutation, and no homozygous individuals, resulting in a frequency of heterozygotes in the Japanese population of 1.8Â % (an allele frequency of 0.91Â %). Analysis of publically available databases showed that the c.977Gâ&gt;âA mutation was not detected in &gt;8.000 European and &gt;4.000 African American alleles whereas the mutation was detected with an allele frequency of 2.6Â % in 286 individuals of East Asian ancestry.</p>

        <title>Analysis of the structural effects of <italic>UPB1</italic> mutations by homology modelling</title>
        <p>A homology model of human Î²UP was generated to predict the effect of the <italic>UPB1</italic> mutations on enzyme structure. High sequence similarity between homologous enzymes at mutation sites (with G31 and E271 being strictly conserved in deposited Î²UP sequences, and I286 replaced by leucine in rodent enzymes only) suggests the mutations occur within structurally conserved regions.</p>
        <p>I286 is located in the subunit core, approximately at 10Â Ã distance from the active site (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). It is surrounded by hydrophobic and polar residues (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The increase in side chain polarity upon mutation to threonine may therefore be tolerated, and structural adjustments limited to orientation of the hydroxyl group towards polar neighbours and re-optimization of side chain packing, with minor effects on active site geometry and enzymatic activity. This correlates well with the measured residual activity, and unaltered behaviour of the mutant protein in native gel analysis.</p>
        <p>G31 is located directly downstream of a helix involved in dimer interface formation in DmÎ²UP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) (Lundgren et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>). Mutation to serine requires structural rearrangement as the close proximity of S325 leaves little space for a side chain. Taking into account that several previously identified deleterious mutations also cluster at oligomerization surfaces (van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>), the significant loss in enzyme activity is most likely linked to disturbance of subunit interactions. Interestingly, native gel electrophoresis showed that only formation of larger assemblies (those exceeding the size of octamers) is hampered.</p>
        <p>In DmÎ²UP, the glutamate corresponding to E271 interacts with two basic residues that are both conserved in the human enzyme (H237, R236) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). For the E271K mutant, clashes of lysine 271 with nearby residues, and placement of its positively charged head group in a hydrophobic (L267, I277 and F356) or similarly charged environment (H237 and R236), will have severely destabilizing effects, further amplified by the proximity of corresponding mutation sites of two subunits at the dimer interface (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Structural changes to accommodate the altered side chain are likely to affect oligomerization, as confirmed by native gel electrophoresis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). As the helix carrying E271 is placed beside the one harbouring C233, any shifts in its position may also directly influence active site geometry and cause the observed dramatic loss of enzymatic activity.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Î²UP deficiency is described as exhibiting variable phenotypic presentation, ranging from early infantile onset with severe neurological involvement, to mild developmental delay and learning disabilities, to asymptomatic individuals (van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). Despite large variation in clinical presentation, the majority of previously identified patients (85Â %) present with MRI abnormalities (van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). In the present study, only three of the 13 patients had neurological problems during infancy, and underwent biochemical urine analysis as part of diagnostic examinations. Ten of the patients were identified through newborn screening programs. Follow-up clinical investigation revealed that one of these patients had suffered from an episode of unconsciousness, and later developed febrile seizures. To date, the nine other individuals have remained asymptomatic. As the follow-up period of some patients (specifically, patients 8â13) is relatively short, being only one to two years, it is conceivable that more patients may present with a clinical phenotype in due course.</p>
      <p>The clinical phenotype of patients with DHP and DPD deficiencies, the other two biochemical defects occurring within the pyrimidine degradation pathway, is highly variable, ranging from severely (neurologically) affected to symptomless. The underlying pathogenesis of these variable clinical manifestations of pyrimidine degradation disorders remains, as yet, unknown. However, similarities between clinical phenotypes of patients with Î²UP deficiency, and DHP and DPD deficiencies, suggests loss of physiological function of the absent pathway metabolites, rather than toxicity of the accumulated metabolite, is the underlying cause. In this respect, patients with pyrimidine degradation defects show normal to slightly decreased Î²-alanine levels in plasma and normal levels in CSF, whereas Î²-aminoisobutyric acid concentrations are strongly reduced in plasma and CSF (van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>). Î²-Aminoisobutyric acid is not only a partial agonist of the glycine receptor (Schmieden and Betz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1995</xref>), but has also been demonstrated to enhance leptin secretion in adipose cells (Begriche et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>). Leptin and its receptors are widespread within the central nervous system, and leptin has been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect in damaged brain regions (Signore et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>). Therefore, altered Î²-aminoisobutyric acid homeostasis in patients with pyrimidine degradation defects may contribute to neurological abnormalities. Treatment of a ÃUP-deficient patient with Ã-alanine for over 1.5Â years did not result in a clinical improvement (Assmann et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>). So far, the clinical effect of Ã-aminoisobutyric acid supplementation has not been investigated in ÃUP-deficient patients. Considering the pivotal role of Î²UP in Î²-alanine and Î²-aminoisobutyric acid synthesis, we suspect it is unlikely that Î²UP deficiency is not related at all to the neurological presentation observed in some of our patients. However, our observation that patients with Î²UP deficiency can present without any clinical abnormalities suggests additional factors are involved in the clinical outcome. These additional factors likely include alterations in other genes and/or environmental factors.</p>
      <p>Until now, eight missense and three splice site mutations in <italic>UPB1</italic> have been identified in patients with Î²UP deficiency (van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). In this study, we identified three novel missense mutations and one recently reported mutation, p.R326Q, in 13 patients from 12 unrelated Japanese families. It is noteworthy that homozygosity of the p.R326Q mutation is observed in 62Â % (8/13) of Japanese patients, and all 13 patients carried this mutation on one or both alleles, resulting in an allele frequency of 81Â % (21/26) in Japanese patients with Î²UP deficiency. Based on the fact that 1.8Â % of the Japanese population is heterozygous for the p.R326Q mutation, we estimate that one individual per 12,500 will be homozygous for the p.R326Q mutation. Thus, compared with other frequently occurring inborn errors of metabolism, such as phenylketonuria (1:70,000 in Japan), the expected prevalence of Î²UP deficiency is not as rare as generally considered.</p>
      <p>The fact that none of the patients identified through newborn screening had lasting neurological problems, in combination with the high estimated prevalence in Japan and variable features in diagnosed patients, may indicate that the disease has low penetrance and is a risk factor. However, it may be too early to conclude that penetrance is low as we cannot exclude the possibility that these patients will develop symptoms later on in life. In addition, the prevalence of Ã-ureidopropionase deficiency in a high-risk group is four-times higher (1:1500) than that observed in a control population (1:6000) (Kuhara et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>). Thisãobservation suggests that Ã-ureidopropionase deficiency might be involved in the onset of a clinical phenotype.</p>
      <p>Expression of mutant Î²UPs showed that p.E271K and p.R326Q mutants exhibit significantly decreased residual activity, whereas p.G31S and p.I286T mutants have more than 50Â % residual activity of wild type. This result is to some extent in agreement with the finding that the two patients heterozygous for p.G31S present with relatively low urinary N-carbamyl-Î²-aminoisobutyric acid concentrations, although this was not apparent in two siblings heterozygous for p.I286T (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In combination with the blue native gel analysis, there is no convincing evidence that the p.G31S or p.I286T mutations are pathogenic. Since no DNA of the parents was available, carriership analysis of the mutations could not be performed. Therefore, it is conceivable that c.91G &gt; A (p.G31S) and c.857Â T &gt; C (p.I286T) are in <italic>cis</italic> with c.977G &gt; A (p.R326Q). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional mutations may be present within non-coding regions of <italic>UPB1</italic> in patients carrying p.G31S or p.I286T mutations.</p>
      <p>Recently, heterologous expression of p.R326Q mutant Î²UP in <italic>E.coli</italic> was shown to result in mutant enzyme with no residual activity (van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). Similarly, in the present study, expression of p.R326Q mutant enzyme in HEK293 cells caused a dramatic decrease in residual activity. The wide-ranging urinary levels of N-carbamyl-Î²-alanine and N-carbamyl-Î²-aminoisobutyric acid observed in patients homozygous for the p.R326Q mutation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggest there is no clear correlation between urinary biochemical phenotype and genotype in this group of patients. In addition, identification of the p.R326Q mutation in both neurologically affected patients and unaffected individuals indicates the severity of Î²UP deficiency is not determined exclusively by <italic>UPB1</italic> mutant alleles alone, and other (epi)genetic factors modulate the effect of the final functional enzyme (Dipple and McCabe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>; Sriram et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Analysis of the homology model of human Î²UP, revealed that none of the mutation sites are found in or very near the active site. Instead, the two exchanges most deleterious to enzymatic activity occur at subunit surfaces that are buried upon dimerization. As a similar observation was made for previously reported point mutations of the human <italic>UPB1</italic> gene, it appears that proper subunit association of dimers or larger oligomers is required for full functionality of the encoded enzyme. This can most simply be explained in terms of enzyme stability. Alternatively, human Î²UP activity may be affected by ligand-induced changes in the oligomerization state, as described for the rat liver enzyme and bacterial homologues (Matthews et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1992</xref>; Thuku et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>; Stevenson et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1992</xref>; Nagasawa et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>). However, such potential regulatory properties of human Î²UP remain to be further investigated.</p>
      <p>The pyrimidine degradation pathway is also responsible for degradation of the chemotherapeutic drug, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). It is well known that patients with either complete or partial DPD deficiency can show severe toxicity after 5-FU administration (van Kuilenburg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2004</xref>; van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2000</xref>). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patients with partial DHP deficiency are prone to develop severe 5-FU toxicity (van Kuilenburg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2003</xref>), and heterozygous mutations in the <italic>UPB1</italic> gene may impair uracil catabolism (Fidlerova et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>; Thomas et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>). Therefore, risk of developing 5-FU toxicity is not limited to DPD deficiency, and patients with Î²UP deficiency may also be at risk of developing severe 5-FU toxicity.</p>
      <p>Our study shows that even though the clinical manifestation of Î²UP deficient patients varies considerably from symptomless to severely neurologically affected, high frequency of the p.R326Q mutation in Japanese patients, and relatively high prevalence of the p.R326Q mutation in the Japanese population, suggests there may be additional undiagnosed patients with Î²UP deficiency. Thus, pyrimidine degradation defects should be included in differential diagnosis of unexplained neurological abnormalities, such as convulsions, developmental delay, autism and related disorders.</p>
