      <abstract>
        <p>Brachydactyly type A1 is an autosomal dominant disorder primarily characterized by hypoplasia/aplasia of the middle phalanges of digits 2â5. Human and mouse genetic perturbations in the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway have been associated with many brachymesophalangies, including BDA1, as causative mutations in <italic>IHH</italic> and <italic>GDF5</italic> have been previously identified. GDF5 interacts directly as the preferred ligand for the BMP type-1 receptor BMPR1B and is important for both chondrogenesis and digit formation. We report pathogenic variants in <italic>BMPR1B</italic> that are associated with complex BDA1. A c.975A&gt;C (p.(Lys325Asn)) was identified in the first patient displaying absent middle phalanges and shortened distal phalanges of the toes in addition to the significant shortening of middle phalanges in digits 2, 3 and 5 of the hands. The second patient displayed a combination of brachydactyly and arachnodactyly. The sequencing of <italic>BMPR1B</italic> in this individual revealed a novel c.447-1G&gt;A at a canonical acceptor splice site of exon 8, which is predicted to create a novel acceptor site, thus leading to a translational reading frameshift. Both mutations are most likely to act in a dominant-negative manner, similar to the effects observed in <italic>BMPR1B</italic> mutations that cause BDA2. These findings demonstrate that <italic>BMPR1B</italic> is another gene involved with the pathogenesis of BDA1 and illustrates the continuum of phenotypes between BDA1 and BDA2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The brachydactylies constitute a collection of human digit phenotypes characterized by varying patterns of bone hypoplasia and malformed interphalangeal joints, which leads to shortened or absent tubular bones in the hands and/or feet. Genetic studies in humans and mice have revealed that most brachydactylies are attributed to perturbations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, specifically targeting the ligands, their antagonists and cognate receptors at the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Brachydactyly type A1 (BDA1, MIM #112500) is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder and is primarily characterized by hypoplasia/aplasia of the middle phalanges of digits 2â5. Indian hedgehog (<italic>IHH</italic>) was the first gene associated with BDA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> and the mutations cluster in the central region of the N-terminal signaling fragment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Although the brachydactylies are isolated traits, there is considerable overlap in the pattern of the affected bones. For example, Ploger <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> described a BDA2 (MIM #112600) family where some of its affected members displayed shortened middle phalanges of digit 2, a classic BDA2 feature, along with various degrees of shortening of the middle phalanges of digits 3 and 4. Seemann <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> described another variation where in some patients the shortening of the middle phalange of digit 2, and, to a lesser extent digit 5, resembled Temtamy-type BDA4 (MIM %112800).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> The phenotypic overlap is suggestive of a common genetic pathway in phalangeal and metacarpal bone development. Work performed by Byrnes <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> and Degenkolbe <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> illustrated this point through the discovery of missense mutations in the growth differentiation factor 5 gene (<italic>GDF5</italic>) in patients diagnosed with BDA1. Dominant mutations in <italic>GDF5</italic> were previously associated with four human conditions: that is, angel-shaped phalango-epihyseal dysplasia (ASPED; MIM 105835),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> BDA2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> BDC (MIM #113100),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> multiple synostosis (SYNS2; MIM #610017)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> and symphalangism proximal 1B (SYM1B; MIM #615298),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> whereas severe chondrodysplasias of the HunterâThomson (MIM #201250),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Grebe (MIM #200700),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> and Du Pan (MIM #228900)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> types were attributed to homozygous loss-of-function mutations.</p>
      <p>The GDFs belong to the TGF-<italic>Î²</italic> superfamily of secretory signaling molecules that have diverse biological functions such as embryonic development and patterning, tissue homeostasis, immune response, reproduction and skeletal formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> GDF5 is a well-established osteo- and chondroinductive cytokine that preferentially binds with higher affinity to BMP receptor type-1B (BMPR1B) than to receptor type-1A (BMPR1A).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> These transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors belong to the TGF-<italic>Î²</italic> receptor superfamily. The mammalian BMP receptors are subclassified into 7 BMP type-1 receptors and 5 BMP type-2 receptors. BMPR1A and BMPR1B closely resemble the amino-acid composition of the activin receptor class 1 (ACVR1/ALK2), the gene responsible for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Phylogenetic analyses of the BMP type-1 receptor family suggest that both BMPR1B and BMPR1A co-evolved and are derived from the drosophila thickveins receptor (TKV),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> a receptor essential for visceral mesoderm patterning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup></p>
      <p><italic>Bmpr1a</italic> null mice are not viable, but mice carrying the inactivated <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> allele in chondrocytes exhibit hypoplasia of the long bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> In contrast, the skeletal defects of <italic>Bmpr1b</italic> null mice are restricted to the phalanges that display brachydactyly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> similar to the <italic>GDF5</italic> null mutant brachypodism mouse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Bmpr1b is the major transducer of BMP signals in early limb mesenchymal condensations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> On ligand binding, heterotetrameric formation of BMP type-1 and BMP type-2 receptors occurs at the cell surface. This event triggers the intracellular transphosphorylation of the BMP type-1 receptor, which results in the phosphorylation of intracellular receptor-regulated SMADS causing it to translocate to the nucleus where it regulates transcriptional targets. Dominant mutations in the <italic>BMPR1B</italic> gene are associated with BDA2, BDC/SYM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> whereas homozygous loss-of-function mutations cause acromesomelic chondrodysplasia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup></p>
      <p>We have a collection of BDA1 probands that do not carry mutations in either <italic>IHH</italic> or <italic>GDF5</italic> and have been excluded for linkage to the <italic>BDA1</italic> locus at chromosome 5p13.3 (BDA1B; MIM %607004). As GDF5 interacts directly with BMPR1B, we tested whether a subset of the probands in our cohort had mutations in the <italic>BMPR1B</italic> gene. We report the identification of two novel sequence variants in <italic>BMPR1B</italic> that are associated with BDA1.</p>

        <p>Individuals presenting with BDA1 features and who were previously found not to have BDA1-causing mutations in <italic>IHH</italic> and <italic>GDF5</italic> were assessed for BDA1-causing mutations in the candidate gene <italic>BMPR1B</italic>. Metacarpophalangeal pattern profiles (MCPP) were performed on standardized hand radiographs by SN. The length of each hand bone, excluding the wrist bones, was measured using the software ANTRO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> and adjusted for age and sex as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Tubular hand bones with a SDâ¤â2 were classified as being disproportionately short, whereas those with a SDâ¥+2 indicated disproportionately long bones.</p>

        <p>Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted and column purified from whole blood using QIA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Purified gDNA was amplified with primer pairs specific to each exon of <italic>BMPR1B</italic>. Each primer pair was designed by ExonPrimer to flank at least 50 bases from each intronâexon boundary as listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. PCR of each primer pair was performed in a 50-<italic>Î¼</italic>l reaction as follows: 50âng template, 10â<italic>Î¼</italic><sc>M</sc> forward and reverse primer, 10âm<sc>M</sc> dNTPs, 2.0âm<sc>M</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Ã PCR buffer and 1U r<italic>Taq</italic> (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Cycling conditions were set at 95âÂ°C 5âmin initial denaturation, followed by 30 cycles of 95âÂ°C 45âs denaturation, 55âÂ°C 30âs annealing, 72âÂ°C 30âs extension and a final extension at 72âÂ°C for 10âmin. PCR aliquots were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel and stained with 5âmg/ml EtBr before purification with AMPure XP (Agencourt, Beverly, MA, USA) on a Biomek FX automated workstation (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Samples were prepared for BigDyeV3.1 terminator sequencing on an AB 3730<italic>xl</italic> genetic analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> with the exception of the removal of unincorporated label by CleanSeq SPRI magnetic beads (Agencourt).</p>

        <title><italic>In-silico</italic> analyses</title>
        <p>Each sequence was aligned to the human reference HG19 using BLAT to identify any sequence mismatches. Novel sequence variants were defined as having passed the filtering process through dbSNP138, Genome Variants, HGMD and EVS. Sequence variants meeting this criterion were evaluated for pathogenicity using PolyPhen-2 V2.2.2 and SIFT. Sequence variants that aligned within annotated splice sites were evaluated with online web services Human Splice Finder V2.4.1, SplicePort and Alternative Splice Site Prediction. RefSeq NM_001203.2 was used as input sequence for all of the prediction services. Sequence variants were deposited at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://databases.LOVD.nl/">http://databases.LOVD.nl/</ext-link>. Multiple sequence alignment of BMPR1B from human (AAH47773.1), mouse (AAH65106.1), cow (NP_001098798.1), sheep (NP_001009431.1), chicken (NP_990463.1), frog (NP_001072633.1), zebrafish (NP_571532.1) and drosophila TKV (AAA53243.1) was performed using ClustalOmega with default settings. Cn3D v4.3 was used to visualize the location of <italic>BMPR1B</italic> mutations on the crystal structure of BMPR1B (PDB ID: 3MDY_A). VAST was used to align structure neighbors (PDB IDs: 4C02_A and 1B6C_B).</p>

Transfection mixtures were prepared in FuGENE6 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with a 1:3 ratio of Sox responsive <italic>Col2-Luc</italic> reporter (+ phRL) to expression vector (control pKS, BMPR1B<sup>WT</sup> or BMPR1B<sup>K325N</sup>). One half-volume of transfection mixture was added to one volume of cells resuspended at a density of 2 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml, and 10 microliters of this mixture was used to establish a micromass colony in the well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. One day post cultures, select wells were treated with BMP4 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to a final concentration of 20âng/ml. Cell lysates were harvested 48âh post-transfection, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize for transfection efficiency across samples.</p>

        <title>Family-1</title>
        <p>The proband was a well, developmentally normal 16-month-old Caucasian female, the first child born to a pair of healthy and unrelated parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). No complications were noted during the pregnancy and she was born at term with a birth weight of 3410â<italic>g</italic> and length of 52âcm. Both parents appeared normal and did not exhibit any hand or foot anomalies. The proband's stature was average (height 75th %ile, head circumference 50th%ile), but her index fingers were very short and the fifth fingers were slightly short with ulnar curvature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). The palmar creases were normal but digital creases were reduced at the distal interphalangeal joints. Examination of the feet revealed shortened big toes. The second toes were very long with moderate syndactyly between toes 2 and 3. Hand radiographs showed a slightly reduced size of the terminal phalanx of the thumbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The index fingers lacked middle phalanges and the fifth digits had tiny middle phalanges. The MCPP revealed the presence of a short distal and proximal phalange of both thumbs, a shortening of the terminal and middle phalanges of digit 3, severe shortening of the middle phalanges of digit 2 and a slight shortening of the middle phalanges of digit 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The bones that make up digit 4 appeared to be normal. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal karyotype.</p>

        <title>Family-2</title>
        <p>The proband who was of African descent, born to healthy and unrelated parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) was initially seen at 11 months of age. The child sat, unsupported at 7 months, stood with supports at 11 months and walked at 14 months of age. Mild developmental delay was noted with speech and toileting delay, poor motor coordination and brachydactyly of the hands. All fingernails were present and there was no facial dysmorphology. A younger brother who had normal hands and feet also had speech delay. By age 9 years, the proband was doing well at school with extra support, had good hand function and was not dysmorphic. A hand radiograph taken from the proband displayed small cube-shaped middle phalanges of digit 2 and small trapezoid-shaped middle phalanges of digit 5 in both hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The middle phalange of digit 2 displayed a socket-like groove for the epiphysis of the proximal phalange. Clinodactyly in both the fifth digit and the right thumb was observed in the proband. There were no remarkable hand bone features in the parents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). The MCPP from both hands revealed moderate shortening of the distal phalanges of digits 1 and 2, shortened proximal phalange of digit 1 and severe shortening of the middle phalanges of digits 2 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The proband had a normal karyotype and was excluded for Fragile X.</p>

        <title>Molecular analyses</title>
        <p>The 16-month-old female patient in Family 1 did not carry a mutation in either <italic>IHH</italic> or <italic>GDF5.</italic> Sequencing of the <italic>BMPR1B</italic> gene revealed a novel heterozygous c.975A&gt;C p.(Lys325Asn) in her (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), but the variant was not found in the mother. The biological father was reported to have no hand or feet anomalies, but was unavailable to study. The sequence variant was not identified in any of the public variant databases including dbSNP138, Personal Genomes HGMD and Exome Variant Server. Moreover, we sequenced 100 controls and did not identify this variant in exon 10 of <italic>BMPR1B</italic>. The asparagine substitution at residue position 325 was predicted by both SIFT (score=0) and PolyPhen-2 (score=1) to be pathogenic. A ClustalOmega multiple alignment of the peptide sequence of BMPR1B from human, mouse, chicken and sheep positioned Lys325 within a highly conserved region of the cytoplasmic protein kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also report on an individual of African descent with a mix BDA1-arachnodactyly condition. All three family members did not have a mutation in either <italic>IHH</italic> or <italic>GDF5</italic>. The sequencing of <italic>BMPR1B</italic> revealed a heterozygous c.447-1G&gt;A (HG19 NC000004.11:g.96046133G&gt;A) in the proband (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and mother. The variant was not observed in 100 sequenced controls nor in any public variant databases. The nucleotide substitution occurred in a constitutive acceptor splice site for exon 8 of <italic>BMPR1B</italic> where the first two nucleotides <bold>AG</bold> are highly conserved in the consensus acceptor splice site sequence YYTT(Y)<sub>6</sub>NC<bold>AG</bold>âG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> The G to A transition was predicted to abolish the 3â² splice site and to create a novel 3â² site just one nucleotide upstream at position c.447 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). This would result in a translational frameshift of one nucleotide that in turn produced a truncated peptide of 162 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).The two novel sequence variants in <italic>BMPR1B</italic> were deposited at the LOVD database with LOVD ID numbers 0000053136 (c.9775A&gt;C) and 00029686 (c.447-1G&gt;A)</p>

        <title>Mutation distribution of BMPR1B</title>
        <p><italic>BMPR1B</italic> encodes for a 502 amino-acid protein with three main functional domains: namely, an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular protein kinase domain. We found that the majority of mutations in <italic>BMPR1B</italic> resided within the protein kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The superimposition of missense mutations onto the 3D model of BMPR1B suggests that mutations that are associated with BDA1 and BDA2 are found on the outer edges of the cytoplasmic region of BMPR1B, whereas the mutation that is associated with IPAH is buried within four alpha helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In addition, a VAST structure alignment of closely related cytoplasmic peptide chains revealed a conserved stretch of 23 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), which corresponded to an outward facing beta strand where the predicted p.(Lys325Asn) happens to be located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>

        <title>BMPR1B<sup>Lys325Asn</sup> acts as a dominant-negative mutation</title>
        <p>To assess the impact of c.975A&gt;C p.(Lys325Asn) on BMPR1B activity, we measured the activity of this construct in comparison with wild-type BMPR1B in a BMP-responsive chondrogenic cell assay. Primary limb mesenchymal cells are highly responsive to BMP4 and other BMPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Under these conditions, addition of BMP2 or 4, or heterologous expression of constitutively activated BMPR1A or B receptors leads to pronounced induction of a chondrogenic-responsive reporter gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> In this assay, expression of BMPR1B<sup>Lys325Asn</sup> led to an ~50% reduction in reporter gene activity when compared with wild-type BMPR1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, we observed an ~60% reduction in reporter activity in response to BMP4, a BMPR1B ligand and an inducer of chondrogenesis.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mutations in either <italic>IHH</italic> or <italic>GDF5</italic> have been previously shown to be associated with BDA1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> In this study we describe two novel sequence variants in the human <italic>BMPR1B</italic> gene that are associated with BDA1-like conditions in two unrelated individuals. In the first BDA1 case, a c.975A&gt;C is predicted to cause a p.(Lys325Asn) substitution next to the serine-threonine kinase active site in the C-terminal domain of BMPR1B. While c.975A&gt;C was predicted to be pathogenic, the expressed mutant demonstrated a significant reduction of reporter activity in the presence of BMP4. It is possible that the exchange of a positively charged amino acid like lysine for an uncharged asparagine residue could result in a loss of BMPR1B kinase activity, similar to the effect observed in the study describing the BDA2 mutation p.Ile200Lys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> However, in the same study a recombinant chicken Bmpr1b construct containing the BDA2 mutation p.Arg486Trp was found to have normal kinase activity despite its strong inhibitory effect on chondrogenesis in micromass cultures. The serine-threonine domain of BMP type-1 receptors serves two purposes in establishing the proper intracellular response on ligand binding: (1) phosphorylation of the R-SMADs, and (2) proper complex formation between type-1 and type-2 receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Thus, an alternative pathogenic mechanism to consider is the disruption of the heterotetrameric complex. The BDA1-associated variant c.975A&gt;C (p.(Lys325Asn)) was located in a highly conserved structural motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), which could be involved with receptor complex formation. The proper formation of the complex has been shown to affect the avidity for ligands,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> and it is possible that p.(Lys325Asn) could disrupt the strength of ligand binding to BMPR1B and BMPR1A. Recently, it has been shown that <italic>in vitro</italic> SMAD reporter assays of BDA1 mutations in GDF5, p.Arg399Cys and p.Trp414Arg, displayed a more severe reduction in BMPR1A signal as compared with BMPR1B.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> The authors suggested that a disruptive BMPR1A signaling could be the key pathogenic feature involved with causing BDA1. An evaluation of the effects of p.(Lys325Asn) in SMAD signaling could further support their model.</p>
      <p>The second BDA1 case carried a novel heterozygous c.447-1G&gt;A within a canonical acceptor splice site of exon 8 of <italic>BMPR1B</italic>. Mutations within acceptor splice sites have been previously shown to cause exon skipping and intron retention, which could translate into a truncated peptide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> The predicted consequence of c.447-1G&gt;A on the splicing of <italic>BMPR1B</italic> pre-mRNA would be the creation of an adjacent acceptor splice site at c.447. As the resulting transcript contains 13 additional codons before premature termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), it could be subjected to nonsense mediated decay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> If this is the case, then the BDA1 condition of the proband would be a result of haploinsufficiency of BMPR1B. Alternatively c.447-1G&gt;A could act as a hypomorphic allele similar to what was described in a mouse mutant Ali30 carrying a T&gt;G transversion in the splice donor site of exon 10 of <italic>Bmpr1b</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> These mutant mice exhibited brachydactyly in addition to retinopathy. Although the mother carried the c.447-1G&gt;A variant, she did not exhibit the brachydactyly features observed in her son, indicative of reduced penetrance. It is possible that the environment and/or genes other than <italic>IHH</italic> and <italic>GDF5</italic> could have modified the expression. Interestingly, the proband of family 2 exhibited restricted arachnodactyly features. Contractual arachnodactyly combined with brachydactyly and sensoneural hearing loss with no known mutation has been reported in a case study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> Our patient's hearing was unremarkable, and there were no indications of visual impairment as seen in the mouse mutant Ali30. It is unclear if the splice sequence variant in this family is contributing to the disproportionate lengthening of digits 3 and 4. Further functional characterization is needed to address this concern.</p>
      <p>We did note the remarkable similarity in MCPP of both probands. There are also phenotypic similarities between our patient and the ones described with BDA2-causing mutations in <italic>BMPR1B</italic>. Our patient with the c.975A&gt;C has a similar missing middle phalange of digit 2 as does the BDA2 patient with the p.Ile200Lys mutation. Unlike the reported BDA2 cases, both of our patients displayed the shortening of the proximal and distal phalange of the thumb, which is also distinct from BDC. These differences could be attributed to the position of the mutations within <italic>BMPR1B</italic>, similar to what has been observed in <italic>GDF5</italic> for BDA1, BDA1/SYNS2 and BDA2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In summary, we identified two novel sequence variants in <italic>BMPR1B</italic>, which are associated with BDA1-like phenotypes. Their effects are predicted to disrupt SMAD signaling either in a dominant-negative manner (c.975A&gt;C) or by haploinsufficiency (c.447-1G&gt;A). Hence, our study further supports the role of the BMP-SMAD pathway in brachymesophalangies and partially reveals the nature of structurally conserved domains of BMPR1B.</p>
