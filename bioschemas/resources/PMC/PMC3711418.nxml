        <p>During replication, DNA damage can challenge replication fork progression and cell viability. Homologous Recombination (HR) and Translesion Synthesis (TLS) pathways appear as major players involved in the resumption and completion of DNA replication. How both pathways are coordinated in human cells to maintain genome stability is unclear. Numerous helicases are involved in HR regulation. Among them, the helicase FBH1 accumulates at sites of DNA damage and potentially constrains HR <italic>via</italic> its anti-recombinase activity. However, little is known about its regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we report a mechanism that controls the degradation of FBH1 after DNA damage. Firstly, we found that the sliding clamp Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is critical for FBH1 recruitment to replication factories or DNA damage sites. We then showed the anti-recombinase activity of FBH1 is partially dependent on its interaction with PCNA. Intriguingly, after its re-localization, FBH1 is targeted for degradation by the Cullin-ring ligase 4-Cdt2 (CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup>)âPCNA pathway <italic>via</italic> a PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) degron. Importantly, expression of non-degradable FBH1 mutant impairs the recruitment of the TLS polymerase eta to chromatin in UV-irradiated cells. Thus, we propose that after DNA damage, FBH1 might be required to restrict HR and then degraded by the Cdt2âproteasome pathway to facilitate TLS pathway.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotes, Homologous Recombination (HR) mechanism plays a key role in repair of various DNA damages including double-strand breaks (DSB), DNA gaps, stalled or collapsed replication forks (<xref rid="gkt397-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). By contrast, inappropriate recombination events can cause genomic instability by inducing unscheduled genome rearrangements and/or accumulation of toxic recombination intermediates. Several helicases have been described to play a critical role in HR regulation (<xref rid="gkt397-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Among them, Srs2 limits recombination events in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> by dismantling the Rad51 nucleofilament (<xref rid="gkt397-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Recently, the human F-box DNA helicase FBH1 has been proposed to act as a functional homologue of Srs2 in human cells by sharing its anti-recombinase activity (<xref rid="gkt397-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Similar to Srs2, FBH1 belongs to the UvrD family of helicases and contains also an F-box, which makes it able to form a Skp1âCul1âF-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex (<xref rid="gkt397-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Genetic studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> show that FBH1 partially compensate for the loss of Srs2 and orthologues of FBH1 in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and chicken DT40 cells would limit Rad51-mediated recombination at replication fork (<xref rid="gkt397-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In human, FBH1 accumulates as nuclear foci at sites of DNA damage and replication stress. Its knock-down leads to elevated numbers of Rad51 foci in S phase, and an increase in the rate of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) whereas its over-expression impairs Rad51 recruitment and reduces the level of I-SceI-induced HR (<xref rid="gkt397-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Taken together, these observations lead to the idea that FBH1 has an anti-recombinogenic activity, which has to be tightly controlled to maintain genome integrity. However, the regulation of the helicase FBH1 in human cells is unknown.</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Srs2 is recruited at replication forks by direct interaction with the SUMOylated form of the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) to perform its anti-recombinase function (<xref rid="gkt397-B10" ref-type="bibr">10â12</xref>). The homotrimeric ring PCNA plays a major role in coordinating DNA replication, DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways. It mediates the recruitment of various proteins involved in the DNA damage response (<xref rid="gkt397-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Among them, translesion polymerase Î· (PolÎ·) is recruited by the mono-ubiquinated form of PCNA at stalled replication forks to bypass UV-induced DNA lesions (<xref rid="gkt397-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Interaction between PCNA and its partners is most often mediated by the PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP)-box. Recently, a novel motif termed AlkB homologue 2 PCNA-interacting motif (APIM) was found in a number of proteins interacting with PCNA including hABH2, Rad51B and hTFIIS-L (<xref rid="gkt397-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>PCNA was also proposed to stimulate the degradation of several proteins. Indeed, following UV irradiation, as well as in S phase of the cell cycle, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-ring ligase 4-Cdt2 (CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup>) promotes the ubiquitination and the degradation of numerous proteins including Cdt1, p21 or Set8 to prevent genomic instability [for review, see (<xref rid="gkt397-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)]. Importantly, this destruction is dependent on their binding to PCNA through a specialized PIP-box named PIP degron. Therefore, it appears that PCNA is not only at the crossroad of multiple pathways but can also regulate the levels of key proteins in human cells.</p><p>Here, we addressed the question of FBH1 regulation in human cells by examining its spatiotemporal dynamics during DNA replication and after UV irradiation. We report that FBH1 recruitment to replication factories or to sites of DNA damage is mediated by PCNA, through its PIP and APIM motifs. Importantly, we show that FBH1 stability is greatly decreased after DNA damage. We demonstrate that FBH1 is ubiquitinated and degraded in a PCNA- Cdt2- and PIP degron-dependent manner. Finally, we show that FBH1 degradation is critical for Pol Î· proper recruitment at stalled replication forks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>Human MRC5-V1 (named MRC5 in the text) cells were grown in Minimal Eagle Medium (MEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Âµg/ml streptomycin under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Control experiments were performed with peptide solutions injected into buffer. Thermodynamic parameters ÎH, N, and Ka were obtained by non-linear least-squares fitting of the experimental data using the single set of independent binding sites model of the Origin software provided with the instrument. The free energy of binding (ÎG) and the entropy (ÎS) were determined using the classical thermodynamic formulas: ÎG = âRT ln(Ka) and ÎG = ÎH â TÎS. All binding experiments were performed at 6Â°C in 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol.

To investigate further the regulation of the subcellular localization of FBH1, we examined its distribution in normally cycling cells or following UV irradiation. In absence of exogenous DNA damage, FBH1 is uniformly distributed in the nucleoplasm in most cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F1">Figure 1</xref>A). However, 20â25% of cells displayed FBH1 foci, which colocalized with the DNA sliding clamp PCNA known to form replication foci in S-phase. To visualize cells in S-phase, fibroblasts were incubated with the nucleoside analogue 5-ethynyl-2â²-deoxyuridine (EdU). Using click chemistry, we found that most cells displaying FBH1 foci were also EdU positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F1">Figure 1</xref>A). These results indicate that FBH1 accumulates at sites of DNA replication during the S-phase of unperturbed cells. In addition, in response to local UV irradiation, FBH1 is able to accumulate at sites of DNA damage within 1 h where it co-localizes with PCNA and persists at least 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F1">Figure 1</xref>B). This cellular distribution was also observed by expressing untagged or GFP-tagged FBH1 demonstrating that this localization is specific to the helicase and not of the tag used (data not shown).

To address this, we used a fibroblastic cell line bearing an integrated homologous recombination reporter composed of two differentially mutated GFP genes oriented as direct repeats. In this assay, HR is measured as the ability of cells to repair an I-SceI-induced double-strand break in the inactive GFP construct, which becomes functional only through HR-mediated repair, the control condition. The expression of the functional GFP was assessed by flow cytometry. Co-transfection of I-SceI-expressing plasmid with an empty HA vector served as reference for the maximal HR efficiency. We obtained 2.6% of GFP-positive cells, and this control condition was arbitrary fixed to 100% of HR efficiency. In agreement with previous study, exogenous HA-FBH1wt strongly decreased HR efficiency (14.4% versus 100%). Interestingly, the mutation of both PCNA interaction motifs PIP and APIM partially restores this efficiency (39.9%) whereas each of the single mutants has moderate or no effect on HR frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F2">Figure 2</xref>C). The ratio between I-SceI and HA-FBH1 expression levels was similar for the different FBH1 constructs, suggesting that the differences in transfection efficiencies do not explain the differential effects of FBH1 mutants on HR efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F2">Figure 2</xref>D). To get closer to endogenous FBH1 levels, FBH1 overexpression was reduced by siRNA knock-down; non-targeting siRNA (siNT) was used as control (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1G</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">H</ext-link>). As reference for the maximal HR efficiency, we co-transfected I-SceI-expressing plasmid with an empty HA vector 24 h after transfection with siNT or siFBH1. In these control conditions, 4.7 and 3.9% of GFP-positive cells were quantified respectively and arbitrary fixed to 100% of HR efficiency. Although the inhibitory effect of HA-FBH1 wt on HR was reduced after its knock-down, HR efficiency is still decreased (74.5%), and this decrease fully depends on the interaction between FBH1 and PCNA through both PIP and APIM motifs (106.4%), suggesting that when FBH1 is moderately overexpressed, its interaction with PCNA is indispensable for its anti-recombinogenic function. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PCNA mediates FBH1 recruitment to replication foci and UV-induced DNA damage through direct interaction via the PIP and APIM motifs and none of two is dispensable. Furthermore, the anti-recombinogenic role of FBH1 partially depends on its interaction with PCNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteasome-mediated degradation of FBH1 is enhanced after UV irradiation</title><p>To further investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of FBH1 after UV damage and during replication, we performed confocal videomicroscopy on individual living cells expressing Halo-tagged PCNA and GFP-tagged FBH1. Cells were either mock treated or locally irradiated with UV, and imaged at fixed intervals. As expected, FBH1 recruitment to irradiated sites became visible within 1 h post-UV and reached highest foci intensity at about 1 h 30 min after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F3">Figure 3</xref>A, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2A</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Movies S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">S2</ext-link>). Afterward, FBH1 levels progressively decreased and became barely visible 5 h post-UV while PCNA staining remained rather constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Similarly, in normally cycling cells, recruitment of FBH1 at sites of DNA replication is followed by a drastic decrease of FBH1 levels in comparison with non S phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F3">Figure 3</xref>B, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2B</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">C</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Movies S3</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">S4</ext-link>).

Moreover, incubation of cells with MG132 alone leads to the accumulation of slower migrating forms of FBH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F3">Figure 3</xref>D), which seem to be poly-ubiquitin chains. Altogether, these results suggest that the decrease of FBH1 levels in cells is due to its degradation by the proteasome after poly-ubiquitination.</p><p>We reasoned that the protein levels of transiently over-expressed FBH1 is highly superior to endogenous FBH1 and could be overtaken by the proteasome to maintain protein levels close to the endogenous level. We then explored the regulation of endogenous FBH1 in HeLa cells. In contrast to overexpressed FBH1 in MRC5 cells, we were unable to detect a decrease of endogenous FBH1 level in the absence of exogenous DNA damage in HeLa cells. In contrast, we observed a massive reduction of the FBH1 half-life after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F3">Figure 3</xref>E). Moreover, we observed that 4 h post-irradiation, endogenous FBH1 levels were inversely related to increasing doses of UV, and these decreases were prevented by addition of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F3">Figure 3</xref>F). Intriguingly, we noticed that early after irradiation, endogenous FBH1 levels remain rather stable, contrary to Cdt1, which is also degraded by the proteasome in response to UV irradiation (<xref rid="gkt397-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). FBH1 became unstable only within 3â5 h, due to proteasome-mediated degradation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2E</ext-link>).

This PIP degron mediates the recruitment of Cdt2 through a basic residue four amino acids downstream of the PIP-box, while a threonine and an aspartic acid (TD) at position 5 and 6 confer high affinity to chromatin-bound PCNA. Interestingly, FBH1 PIP-box displays a basic residue at +4, but not the TD motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F4">Figure 4</xref>A). To test whether the CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup>âPCNA pathway could be involved in the regulation of FBH1 stability <italic>via</italic> its putative PIP degron, we reduced the expression of the CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> complex by siRNA in MRC5 cell populations stably expressing wild-type HA-FBH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The knock-down of DDB1, Cul4 and PCNA increased the stability of Cdt1, whereas the effect of Cdt2 knock-down was negligible in the absence of genotoxic treatment. Interestingly, CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup>âPCNA knock-down also resulted in wild-type FBH1 stabilization. These data suggest that CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> and PCNA modulate FBH1 stability through its PIP degron. In agreement with these results, we found that (i) FBH1 was stabilized independently of the CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup>âPCNA knock-down when it was mutated in PIP motif (FBH1 PIPdeg6A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F4">Figure 4</xref>B), and (ii) Cdt2 interacts more strongly with the wt than the PIP degron mutant FBH1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Figures S3A</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">B</ext-link>). Furthermore, Ni<sup>2+</sup> pull-down in 293 T cells over-expressing FBH1 and His-ubiquitin (His-Ub) showed that the wild-type FBH1 is efficiently poly-ubiquitinated after MG132 treatment while the level of poly-ubiquitination for the PIP-degron mutant (PIPdeg3A) is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F4">Figure 4</xref>C, lanes 4 and 8). These results suggest that the ubiquitination and degradation of FBH1 are dependent of its PIP degron, although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that FBH1 poly-ubiquitination is restricted to the overexpressed proteins. We next asked whether CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> was involved in UV-induced degradation of FBH1 by investigating HA-FBH1 protein levels after UV irradiation, in presence of cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F4">Figure 4</xref>D). When cells were transfected with non-specific siRNA, wild-type HA-FBH1 levels greatly decreased after UV irradiation. In contrast, the knock-down of Cdt2 alleviated UV-induced FBH1 degradation, very similarly to Cdt1. To demonstrate that CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> also targeted FBH1 PIP degron in response to UV-damage, we examined the effect of UV irradiation on the levels of chromatin-bound FBH1. While the level of wild-type FBH1 decreased after UV irradiation, mutations in PIP degron greatly reduce the UV-induced degradation of FBH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F4">Figure 4</xref>E). Altogether, our results strongly suggest that FBH1 is ubiquitinated and degraded in a PCNA-Cdt2- and non canonical PIP degron-dependent manner, and this degradation is enhanced after UV irradiation.

It is well documented that UV-induced DNA damage blocks replication fork progression during DNA synthesis and induces the mono-ubiquitination of PCNA. The TLS polymerase PolÎ· specifically binds to mono-ubiquitinated PCNA <italic>via</italic> both its PCNA-binding and ubiquitin-binding motifs to facilitate the bypass of blocking lesions thereby rescuing DNA replication and preventing replication fork collapse (<xref rid="gkt397-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Given the critical role of PolÎ· during translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and its common partner with FBH1 i.e. PCNA, we tested whether forced FBH1 expression could compete with PolÎ· for PCNA-induced recruitment to damaged DNA. For that, we examined the impact of HA-FBH1 overexpression on the localization of GFP-PolÎ· into UV-induced replication foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). It has previously been demonstrated that GFP-PolÎ· complements XP-V cells indicating that the GFP tag does not affect the biological function of PolÎ· (<xref rid="gkt397-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).When cells were co-transfected with the HA vector alone, 60% of them displayed PolÎ· foci 3 h after UV irradiation. Strikingly, expression of HA-FBH1 at high levels significantly interfered with the recruitment of PolÎ· into UV-induced nuclear foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). Single mutation in PIP-box or APIM partially restores PolÎ· recruitment, whereas the double mutant fully restores it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B).

As expected, when co-expressed with HA, PolÎ· recruitment to the chromatin (Chr) increased 3 and 6 h after UV irradiation, together with mono-ubiquitinated PCNA. In agreement with the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F5">Figure 5</xref>B, we found that exogenous wt HA-FBH1 reduced the binding of PolÎ· to the chromatin, especially 3 h post-UV while the mutant, which is unable to bind PCNA, has no impact on PolÎ· recruitment. These results prompted us to investigate whether this mis-recruitment of PolÎ· could be further enhanced by inhibiting FBH1 degradation. To assess this, we monitored the effect of a non-degradable FBH1 mutant (PIPdegK + 4A), which is not impaired for its interaction with PCNA and thus localizes into replication foci and UV-induced DNA damage as the wild-type helicase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt397-T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F5">Figures 5</xref>D, and data not shown). We found that it inhibited PolÎ· recruitment to a greater extent than the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F5">Figure 5</xref>E and F). Conversely, we observed that the down-regulation of FBH1 using specific siRNA facilitated the PolÎ· foci formation after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F5">Figure 5</xref>G). Altogether, this results support the notion that CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup>âPCNA-dependant degradation of FBH1 is required for PolÎ· proper recruitment to UV lesions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have emphasized the importance of PCNA in FBH1 recruitment to sites of replication and DNA damage probably to restrict inappropriate recombination events in human cells. This recruitment is mediated by two motifs: a PIP-box and an APIM motif. More importantly, we discovered that soon after its re-localization, FBH1 is targeted for degradation by the CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup>âPCNA pathway <italic>via</italic> its PIP degron. Furthermore, forced expression of FBH1 or failure to degrade FBH1 via CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup>âPCNA pathway impairs PolÎ· recruitment on chromatin following UV irradiation. Collectively, our findings highlighted a subtle way to regulate translesion synthesis, at the expense of homologous recombination, during the S-phase of the cell cycle and after genotoxic stress in human cells.</p><sec><title>Interaction between FBH1 and PCNA: characteristics of the APIM and PIP motifs</title><p>We have identified two PCNA-interacting motifs in FBH1 (a classical PIP-box and an APIM motif) and demonstrated that they mediate the recruitment of FBH1 to sites of replication and DNA damage. Individual mutation of each motif severely affects the re-localization of FBH1, whereas mutations on both motifs completely abrogate its recruitment. The thermodynamic study of APIM binding to PCNA also shows for the first time that this motif binds directly to PCNA. In addition, competition experiments between p21 PIP-box and FBH1 APIM demonstrate that both motifs bind to the same region of PCNA, i.e. the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL), or at least to close subdomains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1D</ext-link>). Given the fact that the PIP-box and the APIM motif do not compensate for each other loss <italic>in vivo</italic>, our data suggest that they act cooperatively in mediating FBH1 recruitment. In line with this, PIP and APIM motifs are positioned at each terminus of FBH1 amino acids sequence. Because the homotrimeric structure of PCNA enables the binding of three different peptides to PCNA IDCL, we hypothesize that FBH1 may robustly interact with two PCNA monomers <italic>via</italic> its PIP and APIM motifs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>). Crystallographic study of FBH1 binding to PCNA is required to investigate this hypothesis and define more precisely the binding region of the APIM motif.</p></sec><sec><title>FBH1 as a novel target for PCNAâCRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> degradation pathway</title><p>We have revealed that the levels of FBH1 protein are regulated at least by the CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes the degradation of FBH1, especially after UV irradiation. As mentioned above, CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> substrates display a specialized PIP-box named PIP degron, which usually contains two important elements: residues TD at position 5 and 6 in the PIP-box that confer high affinity binding to chromatin-bound PCNA and a positively charged residue, at +4 from the PIP-box, which is required for the recruitment of Cdt2. While this latter critical residue is present in FBH1 protein, the TD motif is not conserved (PE instead of TD). However, the high affinity binding with PCNA could be strengthened by the APIM motif. Interestingly, a FBH1 mutant deficient in PIP degron (FBH1-PIPdeg3A) is less efficiently ubiquitinated than wild-type FBH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F4">Figure 4</xref>C) in non-irradiated cells demonstrating that this motif is critical for the <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination of FBH1.</p><p>However, PIP degron-independent polyubiquitination and degradation of FBH1 is still detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt397-F4">Figure 4</xref>C and E), suggesting that an additional pathway regulates FBH1 stability. Indeed, we and others have observed that the mutation of FBH1 F-box motif, which is involved in the formation of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, increases the stability of the helicase [(<xref rid="gkt397-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and data not shown], suggesting that FBH1 could also be auto-regulated via its F-box.</p></sec><sec><title>FBH1 as a âmolecular switchâ to prevent HR events and promote TLS pathway in human cells?</title><p>Our results show that PCNA has a dual role in FBH1 regulation: it both mediates its recruitment to DNA damage and replication foci, and coordinates its destruction. In contrast to most CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> substrates, including p21, Cdt1 and Set8 (<xref rid="gkt397-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), FBH1 is not rapidly degraded upon S-phase entry or after UV-induced DNA damage. Indeed, we observed that soon after UV irradiation (&lt;3 h), FBH1 remains stable and accumulates at sites of DNA damage, while 3 to 5 h post-UV, FBH1 is degraded in PCNAâCRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup>-dependent manner. This temporal regulation seems to indicate a mode of âaction/degradationâ of FBH1 in human cells after DNA damage. It was previously suggested that FBH1 acts as an anti-recombinase by displacing Rad51 from chromatin (<xref rid="gkt397-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and its <italic>S. pombe</italic> orthologue inhibits Rad51-dependent recombination at replication forks (<xref rid="gkt397-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Our study suggests that the anti-recombinogenic role of FBH1 partially depends on its interaction with PCNA through the PIP-box and the APIM motif. Altogether, these results imply a novel PCNA-dependent regulation pathway for HR in human cells, in which PCNA recruits an anti-recombinase and subsequently promotes its degradation.</p><p>The role of PCNA in HR regulation is well documented in yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="gkt397-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). yPCNA can be modified by the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO during unperturbed S-phase or in response to a lethal dose of DNA damage. This PCNA modification promotes the recruitment of the anti-recombinase Srs2, which disrupts Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments limiting the unscheduled recombination events (<xref rid="gkt397-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Therefore, SUMOâPCNA has an inhibitory effect on HR in budding yeast. In higher eukaryotes, the role of PCNA in HR regulation remains to be clarified. Numerous helicases that are implicated in HR regulation, including Wrn and Blm, interact with PCNA. Very recently, the PCNA-interacting protein PARI has been shown to restrict HR events by interfering with Rad51 (<xref rid="gkt397-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In addition, PARI is able to bind SUMOâPCNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that it can modulate the recombination events in human cells. However, the question of the regulation of PARIâs activity along the cell cycle and in response to DNA damage was not fully addressed.</p><p>In this article, we provide evidence for a PCNA-dependant temporal regulation of the helicase FBH1 in human cells. It will be of high interest to further investigate how these different PCNA-interacting helicases are coordinated in human cells to limit inappropriate HR events.</p><p>Very recently, two different studies have shown that FBH1 induces DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis in response to replication stress (<xref rid="gkt397-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). During this process, FBH1 helicase activity is required for DNAâPK-dependent phosphorylation of RPA2 on Serine 4 and 8 while its PIP-box motif is not necessary (<xref rid="gkt397-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), partly ruling out the role PCNA-dependent recruitment has in this new aspect of FBH1 function in mammalian cells. Because the role of the APIM motif was not addressed, it would be of interest to investigate whether this PCNA interacting motif is required in FBH1-induced double-strand breakage and cell death.</p><sec><title>What could be the biological relevance of UV-induced FBH1 degradation?</title><p>We have found that the degradation of FBH1 is required to enable efficient recruitment of PolÎ· to chromatin after UV irradiation. Indeed, forced expression of FBH1 impairs the formation of UV-induced PolÎ· foci. This effect is even more severe when FBH1 cannot be degraded by the CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> pathway. This competitive relationship between PolÎ· and a PIP degron containing protein was previously described for p21 (<xref rid="gkt397-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The inhibitory effect of FBH1 depends on its PCNA-interacting motifs (PIP and APIM), indicating that FBH1 should compete with PolÎ· for PCNA binding. Following UV irradiation, PolÎ· directly interacts with mono-ubiquitinated PCNA <italic>via</italic> its non canonical PIP-box and a Ubiquitin-Binding Domain (UBZ) (<xref rid="gkt397-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="gkt397-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Given the affinity of FBH1 to PCNA, we assume that in response to UV, its degradation is critical for optimal recruitment of PolÎ· and efficient bypass at stalled replication forks.</p><p>In conclusion, our data together with previous studies put forward the position of PCNA at the crossroads of HR and TLS pathways in mammalian cells. In our model, we propose that PCNA first restricts HR through the recruitment of FBH1 to sites of replication and DNA damage. Afterward, PCNA would stimulate TLS <italic>via</italic> the destruction of FBH1 and subsequent recruitment of PolÎ· (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>). It is noteworthy that CRL4<sup>cdt2</sup> could simultaneously degrade FBH1 and facilitate the mono-ubiquitination of PCNA (<xref rid="gkt397-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), which in turn would promote the recruitment of PolÎ·.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt397/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Figures 1â5 and Supplementary Movies 1â4.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>MinistÃ¨re de l'Enseignement SupÃ©rieur et de la Recherche</funding-source> and the <funding-source>Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</funding-source> [<award-id>DOC20110603022</award-id> to A.B.].
