      <abstract>
        <p>Mutations in <italic>PKD1</italic>, the gene encoding for the receptor Polycystin-1 (PC-1), cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The cytoplasmic C-terminus of PC-1 contains a coiled-coil domain that mediates an interaction with the <italic>PKD2</italic> gene product, Polycystin-2 (PC-2). Here we identify a novel domain in the PC-1 C-terminal tail, a polyproline motif mediating an interaction with Src homology domain 3 (SH3). A screen for interactions using the PC-1 C-terminal tail identified the SH3 domain of nephrocystin-1 (NPHP1) as a potential binding partner of PC-1. NPHP1 is the product of a gene that is mutated in a different form of renal cystic disease, nephronophthisis (NPHP). We show that <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assays and NMR structural studies confirmed the interaction between the PC-1 polyproline motif and the NPHP1 SH3 domain. Furthermore, the two full-length proteins interact through these domains; using a recently generated model system allowing us to track endogenous PC-1, we confirm the interaction between the endogenous proteins. Finally, we show that NPHP1 trafficking to cilia does not require PC-1 and that PC-1 may require NPHP1 to regulate resistance to apoptosis, but not to regulate cell cycle progression. In line with this, we find high levels of apoptosis in renal specimens of NPHP patients. Our data uncover a link between two different ciliopathies, ADPKD and NPHP, supporting the notion that common pathogenetic defects, possibly involving de-regulated apoptosis, underlie renal cyst formation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a frequent genetic disease affecting 1/1000 people characterized by renal cyst formation. Mutations in two genes can cause ADPKD: <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>PKD2</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0012719-Torres1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The first is mutated in the majority of the cases (85%), and it encodes a large (â¼520 kDa) plasma membrane receptor, Polycystin-1 (PC-1).</p>
      <p>PC-1 has a very large extracellular domain comprised of a novel combination of protein-protein interaction domains, 11 transmembrane domains and a short intracellular C-terminus containing a coiled-coil motif that mediates an interaction with the <italic>PKD2</italic> gene product, Polycystin-2 (PC-2) <xref rid="pone.0012719-Qian1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0012719-Boletta1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The precise function of the PC-1/2 complex is largely unclear <xref rid="pone.0012719-Boletta2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The complex localizes to cell-cell junctions <xref rid="pone.0012719-Roitbak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, focal adhesions <xref rid="pone.0012719-Joly1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and the primary cilia in renal epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0012719-Yoder1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we report that the C-terminus of PC-1 contains at least one polyproline domain that is able to mediate an interaction with Src-homology 3 domains (SH3). We show that PC-1 interacts with the SH3 domain of Nephrocystin-1 (NPHP1), the product of the <italic>NPHP1</italic> gene mutated in nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a small cyst formation at the corticomedullary junction of the kidney <xref rid="pone.0012719-Saunier1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012719-Saunier2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0012719-HildebrandtFZhou1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>NPHP1 is a cytoplasmic adaptor molecule containing a putative coiled-coil domain and an SH3 domain whose function is still unknown. Similar to PC-1, NPHP1 localizes to cell-cell junctions, cilia and cell-matrix adhesion sites <xref rid="pone.0012719-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0012719-Benzing1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0012719-Fliegauf1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We provide evidence of a physical and functional interaction between the products of these two genes, which are mutated in two distinct renal ciliopathies, polycystic kidney disease and nephronophthisis, supporting the notion that the molecular mechanism underlying cyst formation shares common pathogenetic dysfunctions in different diseases.</p>

        <title>A polyproline motif in the PC-1 C-tail interacts with the SH3 domain of NPHP1</title>
        <p>Bioinformatic analysis of the PC-1 sequence, using two public web sites (2009) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scansite.mit.edu">http://scansite.mit.edu</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbm.bio.uniroma2.it/SH3-Hunter">http://cbm.bio.uniroma2.it/SH3-Hunter</ext-link>), identified two putative SH3-interacting polyproline domains in its C-terminus, PP1 (K<sub>4169</sub>VSPDVP<sub>4175</sub>) and PP2 (P<sub>4267</sub>ALPSR<sub>4272</sub>). The last had been previously noted in the murine sequence, but its role was never investigated <xref rid="pone.0012719-Parnell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. PP1, corresponding to the classical type I consensus sequence (R/Kxx<underline>P</underline>xxP), had a very low prediction score (â¼0.3), whereas PP2, corresponding to the type II (Pxx<underline>P</underline>xR/K) consensus, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012719-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), had a high prediction score (0.97) <xref rid="pone.0012719-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>

The residues of the polyproline consensus motif are in red. <bold>B.</bold> The C-terminal tail of PC-1 fused to poly-HIS tag (HIS-PC-1-CT) and expressed in bacteria was incubated in the presence of membranes containing several SH3-domains fused to GST and spotted in duplicate (TranSignalâ¢ SH3 Domains, Panomics). Î±-HIS antibodies were used to detect HIS-PC-1-CT that interacted with GST-SH3 domains. Quantification of the intensities (bottom histograms) showed an association with NPHP1, Nck2 and cSrc, but not with NCF1 nor GST. <bold>C.</bold> Full-length Myc-NPHP1 was co-expressed in HEK293 cells with full-length PC-1-HA or full-length PC-1-Myc. Immunoprecipitation using Î±-HA antibodies resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of NPHP1-Myc specifically in the presence of PC-1 immunoprecipitation. <bold>D</bold>. MEFs derived from a recently described mouse model expressing tagged-endogenous PC-1 <xref rid="pone.0012719-Wodarczyk1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> were used to immunoprecipitate endogenous HA-tagged PC-1. Cells expressing the wild-type untagged PC-1 (<italic>Pkd1</italic>

Cell lysates from parental MDCK cells (+Ctrl) or NPHP1âsilenced cells (-Ctrl) <xref rid="pone.0012719-Delous1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> served as a control for NPHP1 western blot.

        <p>To test if the C-terminus of PC-1 (aa 4132-4302) is able to interact with SH3 domains, we performed a screen using an overlay assay system (TranSignalâ¢ SH3 Domains, Panomics) that allows for the simultaneous screening of 152 SH3 domains for possible interactions. We identified several potential binding partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012719-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) suggesting that the C-terminal tail of PC-1 is able to interact with SH3 domains. Notably, the SH3 domain of NPHP1 (NPHP1-SH3) was identified.</p>
        <p>PC-1 and NPHP1 localize to identical subcellular compartments and cause diseases that share common features. However, these two proteins were never reported to associate in a complex. We used a series of novel tools generated in our lab to investigate their possible interaction.</p>
        <p>First, vectors expressing Myc-tagged NPHP1 and HA-tagged full-length PC-1 were transiently co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation with Î±-HA antibodies revealed a specific association of the two proteins when overexpressed in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012719-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis revealed a partial co-localization of the two molecules in intracellular patches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0012719.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because overexpression of molecules might force interactions that do not typically exist, we next tested if the endogenous PC-1 and NPHP1 are indeed able to form a complex in physiological conditions. To this end, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from a recently described mouse model in which a tag was inserted into the <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene resulting in the expression of a tagged endogenous PC-1 (<italic>Pkd1</italic>
<sup>HA/HA</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0012719-Wodarczyk1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These cells express normal levels of fully-functional PC-1, of which detection is greatly enhanced by the addition of a tag. This feature allowed us to use wild-type (<italic>Pkd1</italic>
<sup>+/+</sup>) cells as an optimal control. Immunoprecipitation of the endogenous tagged PC-1 from two independent cell lines resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous NPHP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012719-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), while no NPHP1 pull-down could be detected in wild-type (<italic>Pkd1</italic>

Similar values were obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0012719.s003">Figure S3A</xref>).

No shifts were observed upon addition of peptPP1 or peptPL1 (in which the central proline of PP1 was mutated into leucine), implying that PP1 is not able to interact with NPHP1-SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012719-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0012719.s002">S2A</xref>).

Most importantly, co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293 cells of wt-NPHP1 with the P4270L mutant full-length PC-1 showed that this single amino acid change completely abrogates the interaction between the two full-length molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012719-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

Scrambled shRNAs served as a control (ct) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012719-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, top).

However, while PC-1 overexpression results in resistance to apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0012719-Boletta3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, silencing of NPHP1 resulted in reduced cell viability in response to apoptotic stimuli such as TNFÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012719-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom) and increased apoptosis as assayed by TUNEL and cleaved-caspase-3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012719-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we provide evidence for the first time of the existence of a functional polyproline domain within the C-tail of PC-1 able to interact with SH3 domains. In particular, we show that this motif mediates interaction with the SH3 domain of NPHP1 to assemble into a novel, previously unrecognized complex. NMR and ITC experiments supplement this observation, narrowing down the identification of the binding site to the second putative polyproline motif (PP2), which is comprised of residues 4267-4272. The interaction shows a canonical interface between a type II polyproline motif and an SH3 domain, although this relationship is at the low-range strength of interactions.</p>
      <p>GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation studies, however, show that the two proteins assemble specifically into a complex both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is possible that the isolated peptides of PC-1 have a lower affinity for the SH3 domain of NPHP1 than they have when embedded in the whole intracellular C-tail. One additional possibility is that other molecules assemble in the complex and help stabilize the interaction. Both PC-1 and NPHP1 exist in multiprotein complexes within cells <xref rid="pone.0012719-Boletta1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0012719-Saunier1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional protein-protein interactions (with other partners of the respective complexes) might contribute to stabilizing the complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. One final possibility is that low affinity might be desirable under certain circumstances. Most signaling proteins are expressed in very low amounts in the cell. However, their concentration can be increased when segregated into a local compartment of the cell <xref rid="pone.0012719-Kaneko1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0012719-Ohlson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In addition, although the interaction is relatively weak, our data clearly demonstrate that abrogation of the polyproline domain/SH3 domain interaction is sufficient to abolish the PC-1/NPHP1 interaction, since mutating the central proline within the polyproline helix (peptPL2) impairs this binding both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the mutation P203L, located in the hydrophobic interaction pocket of NPHP1 SH3 domain, does not affect the domain folding, but totally abrogates the interaction with peptPP2.</p>
      <p>Our studies also indicate that a proline to leucine mutation into PP1 (P4172L) decreases the binding of PC-1 C-tail to the SH3 domain of NPHP1, although the isolated peptide containing PP1 (peptPP1) did not cause any peak displacement in 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR assays. Since the last is a very sensitive and reliable method, these data might suggest that the tertiary structure of the C-tail of PC-1 might be affected by mutations into PP1, which eventually affects the PP2 capability to interact with the SH3 domain of NPHP1. In line with this interpretation, the P4270L mutation is able to completely abrogate the interaction with NPHP1-SH3 both in GST pull-down assays and in the co-immunoprecipitation studies. These results along with the NMR studies with the isolated PP2 and PL2 peptides, strongly suggest that PP2 is indeed the polyproline motif responsible for the interaction. However, we cannot exclude that PP1 can interact with other SH3 domains, even though the low sequence conservation suggests a minor functional role for this motif. Collectively, our results are in perfect agreement with the HUNTER prediction, which showed a very high score for PP2 and a low score for PP1.</p>
      <p>Besides the identification of the molecular determinants of this interaction, we believe that our data have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of renal cystic diseases. In recent years, the ciliary hypothesis of cystogenesis has acquired increasing attention, providing an exciting explanation for why so many different diseases can all result in renal cyst formation <xref rid="pone.0012719-Yoder2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, it remains to be elucidated whether all of the ciliary proteins, whose gene mutations are known to cause renal cystic diseases, function in a common complex/pathway or whether they independently influence similar cellular functions. A physical and functional interaction was previously reported between genes involved in the two forms of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) (autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive) <xref rid="pone.0012719-GarciaGonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0012719-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Our results show that PC-1, the product of the gene mutated in the most common form of PKD, interacts with NPHP1, the gene product of the <italic>NPHP1</italic> gene, which is mutated in an unrelated cystic kidney disease, nephronophthisis (NPHP). In agreement with our findings, studies performed in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> had suggested that the two proteins might be functionally linked since downregulation of the <italic>PKD1</italic> orthologue <italic>lov-1</italic> or of the <italic>NPHP1</italic> orthologue <italic>nphp1</italic> result in a similar phenotype in this invertebrate model system <xref rid="pone.0012719-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, inactivation of different genes whose products are implicated in ciliary function are indeed expected to generate similar phenotypes, without necessarily implying the association of the proteins involved. Our data uncover the possibility of the existence of a macromolecular complex comprised of several different proteins whose genes are mutated in cystic kidney diseases and warrant future studies on common functions, likely important for preventing renal cystogenesis.</p>
      <p>In this study we have shown that one such common function might be the apoptotic response. One intriguing observation that emerges from our data is that PC-1 and NPHP1 cooperate to achieve apoptosis resistance, but do not jointly regulate the cell cycle. PC-1 had been shown to be essential to prevent apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice carrying mutations in the <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0012719-Boletta2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, increased apoptosis had also been reported in the cystic kidneys of ADPKD patients <xref rid="pone.0012719-Woo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Apoptosis of photoreceptor cells occurs in mice invalidated for <italic>Nphp1</italic>, however no kidney phenotype was associated with the retinal degeneration in those mice <xref rid="pone.0012719-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In this study we show that increased apoptosis appears to be a feature of NPHP as well, since analysis of renal specimens from 4 different patients carrying mutations in the <italic>NPHP1</italic> gene revealed the presence of apoptosis in the renal tubules of these tissues. Our data collectively might suggest that the two proteins are functionally linked in renal epithelial cells to protect the renal tubule from apoptosis. How and if this common feature shared by the two diseases might be related to renal cyst formation and/or ciliary function remain to be investigated.</p>
