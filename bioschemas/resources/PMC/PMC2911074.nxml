          <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
          <p>Most knowledge on human Î²-cell cycle control derives from immunoblots of whole human islets, mixtures of Î²-cells and non-Î²-cells. We explored the presence, subcellular localization, and function of five early G1/S phase moleculesâcyclins D1â3 and cdk 4 and 6âin the adult human Î²-cell.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
          <p>Immunocytochemistry for the five molecules and their relative abilities to drive human Î²-cell replication were examined. Human Î²-cell replication, cell death, and islet function in vivo were studied in the diabetic NOD-SCID mouse.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>RESULTS</title>
          <p>Human Î²-cells contain easily detectable cdks 4 and 6 and cyclin D3 but variable cyclin D1. Cyclin D2 was only marginally detectable. All five were principally cytoplasmic, not nuclear. Overexpression of the five, alone or in combination, led to variable increases in human Î²-cell replication, with the cdk6/cyclin D3 combination being the most robust (15% versus 0.3% in control Î²-cells). A single molecule, cdk6, proved to be capable of driving human Î²-cell replication in vitro and enhancing human islet engraftment/proliferation in vivo, superior to normal islets and as effectively as the combination of cdk6 plus a D-cyclin.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
          <p>Human Î²-cells contain abundant cdk4, cdk6, and cyclin D3, but variable amounts of cyclin D1. In contrast to rodent Î²-cells, they contain little or no detectable cyclin D2. They are primarily cytoplasmic and likely ineffective in basal Î²-cell replication. Unexpectedly, cyclin D3 and cdk6 overexpression drives human Î²-cell replication most effectively. Most importantly, a single molecule, cdk6, supports robust human Î²-cell proliferation and function in vivo.</p>

  <body><p>While broadly similar, human pancreatic Î²- cells differ from their rodent counterparts in many ways. For example, rodent Î²-cells can be induced to replicate using many strategies, including partial pancreatectomy, induction of obesity and insulin resistance, infusion of glucose, administration of growth factors, and activation of signaling pathways downstream of these growth factors and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"/>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In contrast, while evidence suggests that human fetal and early neonatal Î²-cells are able to replicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), no investigator has been able to demonstrate or induce robust rates of proliferation in adult human Î²-cells using the same growth factors, nutrients, signaling pathways, and maneuvers that have been effective in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"/>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). For example, unlike events in rodents, obesity or type 2 diabetes in human adults is not associated with accelerated Î²-cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and even partial pancreatectomy does not induce Î²-cell replication or regeneration in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This inability to induce substantial human Î²-cell replication is problematic, for it is now clear that Î²-cell replacement therapy for diabetes will require large numbers of human or xenogeneic Î²-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>While much has been learned from mouse genetic models regarding the molecular control of Î²-cell replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"/>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), little is known regarding the molecules that regulate the G1/S transition in the human adult Î²-cell. We have begun to explore these molecules in adult human islets, mapping the members of the G1/S proteome that are present in human cadaveric islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Human islets are believed to contain most of the key molecules that govern the G1/S transition in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). These include the three members of the pocket protein family (pRb, p107, and p130); cyclins D1 and D3; cdks 1, 2, 4, and 6; the four members of the INK4 family (p15, p16, p18, and p19); the three members of the KIP/CIP family (p21, p27, and p57); several E2F family members; and p53 and its E3 ligase, HDM2 (supplementary Fig 1, available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/db09-1776/DC1">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/db09-1776/DC1</ext-link>). Upstream of these G1/S molecules are other regulatory molecules such as skp2, menin, FoxM1, bmi1, and ezh2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"/>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). We and others have also shown that human islets differ from their rodent counterparts in that they express cdk6, a cdk that is not detectable in mouse islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We have also shown that overexpression of cdk6 in association with a D-cyclin, cyclin D1, markedly increases the replication of adult human Î²-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and it does so in a way that does not lead to dedifferentiation or accelerated Î²-cell death but instead leads to enhanced engraftment and function of adult human cadaveric islets in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). We also have shown that cdk4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and cdk6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) in conjunction with cyclin D1 can enhance pRb phosphorylation and replication in human Î²-cells. Despite these advances, it is important to underscore that, of the 30+ molecules that regulate the human Î²-cell G1/S transition (supplementary Fig. 1), the therapeutic potential has been explored for only three: cdk4, cdk6, and cyclin D1. For example, nothing is known about the efficacy of the other two D-cyclins, cyclins D2 and D3, in driving proliferation of human Î²-cells.</p><p>Another difference between human and rodent islets may involve cyclin D2. In mice, excellent evidence indicates that cyclin D2 is indispensible for Î²-cell growth and islet development and function: animals that lack cyclin D2 develop islet hypoplasia, hypoinsulinemia, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In contrast to mouse studies, in humans, cyclin D2 has been reported to be difficult to detect or undetectable, despite the use of multiple antisera from multiple vendors and appropriate positive controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>Here, we asked four questions. <italic>1</italic>) Which D-cyclins are definitively present in human islets? <italic>2</italic>) Which of the three D-cyclins might be the optimal partner for cdk4 or cdk6 for enhancing adult human Î²-cell replication? <italic>3</italic>) Are cdk4, cdk6, and the three D-cyclins actually present in Î²-cells [in contrast to immunoblot studies of whole islet extracts described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>)], and if so, in which subcellular compartment? <italic>4</italic>) From a therapeutic standpoint, is it essential to deliver <italic>both</italic> a D-cyclin <italic>and</italic> a cdk4/6 family member to enhance human islet engraftment, or can this be simplified by using only a <italic>single member</italic> of the cdk4/6âD-cyclin complex?</p><p>We report here that <italic>1</italic>) cyclin D1 is variably present, D2 is only marginally detectable, and D3 is readily detectable in human islets; <italic>2</italic>) cyclin D3 appears to be surprisingly effective in inducing human Î²-cell proliferation and, in combination with cdk6, may be the most effective in driving human Î²-cell replication; <italic>3</italic>) cdks 4 and 6, and cyclins D1 and D3, are located principally in the cytoplasm and not the nucleus; and <italic>4</italic>) a single cdk, cdk6, is surprisingly as effective in driving human islet engraftment as the previously reported combination of cdk6 plus cyclin D1.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>All of the methods and procedures have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"/>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Supplementary detailed methods are available in an online appendix. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved in advance both receipt of, and work with, human islets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Human islets contain easily detectable cyclin D3, but only variable and marginal quantities of cyclins D1 and D2.</title><p>The cyclin D family includes three D-cyclins, shown schematically in supplementary Fig. 2<italic>A</italic>. As shown in supplementary Fig. 3 (available in an online appendix), mRNA encoding each of the three D-cyclins is present in human islets, as assessed by conventional PCR as well as by quantitative PCR.</p><p>Immunoblots were performed for each cyclin in adult human islets and were compared with the expression of the putative D-cyclin to expression in the same human islet preps transduced with adenoviruses encoding the corresponding D-cyclin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Human islets contain measurable but variable amounts of cyclin D1, which was present in 7 of 12 human islet extracts. This band was confirmed as being cyclin D1 because it was enhanced by overexpression of cyclin D1. Importantly, no cross-reactivity of this antibody was observed when cyclins D2 and D3 were overexpressed. These results were obtained using antibody #2,926 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and are comparable to results described by Lavine et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Cyclin D1 was also present in several human cell lines (HK2, SaOS2, and HKC8) and at higher levels than in human islets in two of these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIG. 1.</label><caption><p>D-cyclins in the human islet and Î²-cell. <italic>A</italic>: Western blot for cyclin D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, and D<sub>3</sub> in human islets.

Again, the band was specific, because it was intensified by overexpression of cyclin D3, and because overexpression of the other D-cyclins did not alter the intensity of the band. This blot was performed using antiserum #ab28283 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Cyclin D3 was also easily detectable in each of the three human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p><p>In contrast to immunoblots for cyclins D1 and D3, and in contrast to results observed in PCR experiments, cyclin D2 was barely detectable using multiple cyclin D2 antisera in 3 of 6 human islet extracts and undetectable in 3 others, with 1 example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic> using antiserum #C7339 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cyclin D2 also was difficult to detect in SaOS2 and HKC8 human cell lines, but readily apparent in HK2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Again, the antiserum was specific, for it detected cyclin D2 when overexpressed but not cyclins D1 or D3. These results suggest that cyclins D1 and D3 are present in human islets, but that cyclin D2, if present, is present at very low abundance. Further, because transcripts encoding cyclin D2 are present in human islets, the apparent lack of cyclin D2 protein may reflect inhibition of translation or accelerated degradation of cyclin D2 in human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cyclins D1, D2, and D3 are predominantly cytoplasmic in human Î²-cells.</title><p>To confirm the immunoblot observations, to determine the cell type within the islet that expresses the D-cyclins, and to determine the subcellular locations of the D-cyclins, we performed immunofluorescent laser confocal microscopy of single-cell suspensions of adult human cadaveric islets.

First, we find that multiple cdk4/6 and D-cyclin combinations can robustly stimulate human Î²-cell replication in vitro. Surprisingly, among all of the possible cdk4/6âD-cyclin combinations, cyclin D3 appeared to be a particularly effective partner for cdk6 and cdk4. Second, we demonstrate that, although cyclin D2 is a very effective partner for both cdk4 and cdk6 in stimulating human Î²-cell replication, and despite its being both present and essential for rodent Î²-cell replication and function, it is only marginally detectable in human Î²-cells. Third, we observe that the D-cyclins and cdks 4 and 6 are principally cytosolic proteins in the human Î²-cell. Fourth, we report that a single member of the cdk4/6 D-cyclin complex, cdk6, is able to enhance human Î²-cell transplantation in vivo. Fifth, we demonstrate that human Î²-cell replication can be sustained in vivo for at least four weeks using cdk6.</p><p>The rapid proliferation induced by the D3 combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) was unanticipated. Of the three D-cyclins, cyclin D2 has repeatedly been demonstrated to be essential for mouse islet development and function, because its loss results in early-onset diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Combined loss of both cyclins D1 and D2 accelerates this Î²-cell failure and diabetes, suggesting an additional or complimentary role for cyclin D1 in the Î²-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In human insulinoma, cyclin D1 overexpression has been implicated etiologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In contrast, loss of cyclin D3 in mice has no apparent effect on Î²-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), and no prior reports suggest a role for cyclin D3 in human Î²-cell physiology or therapy. Analogously, whereas cdk4 is well known to be essential in the rodent islet where its loss leads to diabetes and Î²-cell failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), genetic loss of cdk6 has no evident effect on the Î²-cell in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Indeed, normal mouse islets <italic>are</italic> essentially cdk6 deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Thus, one might have anticipated from mouse studies that cdk4 and cyclins D1 and D2 might have been most effective in driving human Î²-cell replication and engraftment. These observations should be interpreted with some caution, however, for no attempt was made to document that the actual concentrations of the several D-cyclins and cdk4/6 were identical when overexpressed, experiments which would be particularly challenging to perform. Thus, while we cannot definitively conclude that cyclin D3 is the optimal D-cyclin partner for cdks 4 and 6 in driving human Î²-cell replication, the cyclin D3âcdk6 combination is particularly attractive for future transplant studies.</p><p>Cyclin D2 is marginally detectable or nondetectable in human islets by immunoblot and barely detectable in human Î²-cells by immunofluorescence. These results corroborate those by Lavine et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and were confirmed by using appropriate controls (cyclin D2 was easily observed by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry in human islets transduced with cyclin D2 adenovirus and was also easily observed in at least one human cell line) and multiple different antisera. This observation is interesting for at least three reasons. First, the apparent indispensability of cyclin D2 in rodent islets, in combination with its apparent ability to markedly stimulate human Î²-cell replication, raises the possibility that the failure of adult Î²-cells to generate cyclin D2 may be relevant to their inability to replicate. Second, cyclin D2 is undetectable in human islets despite their containing easily measurable mRNA encoding cyclin D2. Together, these findings may indicate that lack of cyclin D2 could play an essential role in restraining human beta replication and suggest that cyclin D2 and its regulation warrant further investigation in human Î²-cell replication, particularly at the level of protein stability as suggested by Kushner and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). For example, it would be interesting to examine whether cyclin D2 is present in Î²-cells in late embryonic or early neonatal human life when Î²-cells are actively replicating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Finally, they underscore the point that mouse islet studies do not predict with complete fidelity events that transpire in human Î²-cells. Other well documented examples are the far lower percentage of Î²-cells in the human islet as compared with the rodent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), the absence of an endocrine cell mantle and more heterogeneous distribution of cell types in human islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), the use of different principal glucose transporters (Glut2 in the rodent, Glut1 in the human Î²-cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44"/>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), the lack of proliferative responses to obesity or partial pancreatectomy in the human Î²-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and the refractoriness of adult human Î²-cells to proliferative mitogens and growth factors that readily induce rodent Î²-cell replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"/>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>The immunohistochemical subcellular localization studies were important for several reasons. First, they provide methodology for studying cdks 4 and 6 and the D-cyclins in human Î²-cells. Second, they confirm that this family, which had been described in immunoblots of whole islets previously, is present in adult human Î²-cells. Third, they show that all five of these molecules are principally located in the cytoplasm, a result that was confirmed by subfractionation studies. This is surprising, because these are generally thought to be in nuclear kinase complexes that function by phosphorylating nuclear substrates such as pRb. Of course, in contrast to human cancers and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which are rapidly replicating cell types and which inform most studies on this class of molecules, adult human Î²-cells are typically quiescent, failing to enter the cell cycle. That the cdkâD-cyclin family is cytoplasmic in human Î²-cells may provide an explanation for this quiescence: their low abundance and inability to translocate to the nuclear compartment may be rate-limiting for adult human Î²-cell replication. Recently, in accord with these findings, He et al. have reported that cyclin D2, the key D-cyclin in the mouse Î²-cell, is also cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). It is widely believed that cdk4/6âD-cyclins, which lack nuclear localization signals, require cytoplasmic preassembly or chaperoning by p21 and p27, which do contain nuclear localization signals, and are required for nuclear transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), such that inadequate quantities of p21 or p27 could prevent nuclear access for cdk4/6âD-cyclins. It is also possible that the Cip/Kip or INK4 family could sequester the D-cyclinâcdk4/6 complexes in the cytoplasm, preventing them from entering the nucleus and driving proliferation. Moreover, evidence suggests that GSK3Î² not only phosphorylates and targets D-cyclins for degradation, it also may prevent nuclear access of D-cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Thus, it is also possible that this or other signaling events or lack thereof, unrelated to cell cycle inhibitors, could prevent nuclear access for cdk4/6âD-cyclin complexes in the Î²-cell. Equally importantly, it is clear that, when overexpressed, cdk6 can enter the nucleus and that cooverexpression of cyclin D1 can facilitate or enhance this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>). Clearly, the questions as to how and why cdks4/6 and D-cyclins appear to remain stranded in the cytoplasm, where they are presumably unable to phosphorylate pRb, and what regulates their trafficking into the nucleus of the human Î²-cell provide fertile ground for future study.</p><p>The in vivo transplant studies make at least two additional important and novel points. First, human Î²-cells that overexpress only a single G1/S molecule, in this case, cdk6, replicate and function better than normal control human Î²-cells. Indeed, they also function as well as islets that overexpress both cdk6 and cyclin D1. Second, they replicate in vivo at high rates after transplantation, and this replication continues for at least four weeks. This is unaccompanied by increases in cell death and is accompanied by euglycemia and normal glucose tolerance, suggesting that Î²-cell differentiation is maintained despite the marked induction of proliferation. One incompletely addressed question is âwhat proportion of the rapid and sustained reduction in blood glucose in the cdk6-transduced islets, and in the cdk6+cyclin D1-transduced islets in our prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), is due to proliferation and increased islet mass, versus enhanced Î²-cell function (glucose-sensing and insulin secretion) versus enhanced survival?â So far, we know that proliferation is elevated at days 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and 28 (herein). We also know that overexpression of cdk6 in human islets for 3 and 10 days resulted in full retention of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). We also know that cdk6 overexpression was not associated with increases in cell death at day 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) or days 1 or 28 posttransplant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). We also know that cdk6 differs from most cdks in that it appears to have differentiating activities in osteoblasts and prostate cells, mediated by direct binding to differentiating transcription factors such as Runx2 and the androgen receptor, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Nonetheless, it remains possible that enhanced survival, for example, at 6â12 h after transplant, may be contributing to enhanced islet graft function. In addition, it is important to point out that no attempt was made to quantify Î²-cell mass in this model. Thus, it is unknown at present precisely how cdk6 alone or in combination enhances human islet engraftment. These observations make cdk6 a particularly attractive target for future longer studies in vitro and in vivo aimed at enhancing human Î²-cell proliferation, mass, and function, as well as at better understanding the mechanisms through which it acts.</p><p>These studies have limitations and raise additional new questions for future study. For example, as noted above, they are not quantitative with regard to the absolute levels of expression of the different D-cyclins and cdks: they reflect the affinity and specificity of available antisera, which were not directly compared in strict quantitative terms.</p><p>As another example, while we demonstrate that cdk6 is particularly effective in vivo, we did not examine all of the other possible cdk4/6âD-cyclin combinations: there are some 25 potential single, double, and/or triple cdk4/6âD-cyclin combinations that we might have explored in the in vivo NOD-SCID diabetes model. Examining all of these possibilities would be prohibitive with regard to time, expense, and availability of human islets. Because we were limited with regard to experimental transplant paradigms, we elected to approach the human Î²-cell proliferation/engraftment issue with an eye toward simplification, selecting a head-to-head comparison of cdk6 versus cyclin D1. To our surprise, cdk6 alone proved to be as effective as the combination and superior to cyclin D1 alone. Thus, proliferation rates induced in vitro do not necessarily predict transplant efficacy in vivo: although we found previously that combined overexpression of cdk6 plus cyclin D1 in vitro produces far higher proliferation than either alone, we found here that cdk6 alone produced graft function that was comparable to the combination. This observation was unanticipated, for during cell cycle progression, cdks remain constant, awaiting a D-cyclin partner to activate their kinase activity. Thus, we had assumed that cyclin D1 might have been rate-limiting and that cdk6 overexpression alone might have had limited effects, but we observed the opposite. These observations raise a number of questions, such as âwhat is the D-cyclin partner that binds to cdk6 in Î²-cells when it alone is overexpressed and activates proliferation?â Also, as noted above, âis cdk6 regulation a normal checkpoint in human Î²-cell replication?â Another question is, âwhat exact cell in islet is the target of the adenoviral cdk6?â Because cdk6 delivery was driven by the CMV promoter, it is anticipated that many cell types in addition to the Î²-cell would be induced to proliferate, a prediction that is supported by our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These cells do not appear to be endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), but may be endothelial, ductal stromal, mesenchymal, progenitor, or other cells. Thus, it will be important to learn whether cdk6 overexpression using a Î²-cell-specific promoter leads to the same enhancement of engraftment and function. From a therapeutic standpoint, the implications are unequivocal: cdk6 is a particularly attractive agent, both as a therapeutic molecule for enhancing Î²-cell replication and also as a âdruggableâ target for small-molecule therapeutics that might enhance human Î²-cell regulation. As noted, these findings also suggest that cdk6/cyclin D3 might also be a particularly useful combination therapeutically.</p><p>We demonstrate that adenoviral cdk6 can drive human Î²-cell replication for at least 28 days in vivo. This raises additional questions as well. For example, âhow long will/can Î²-cell proliferation continue in this in vivo model?â For another example, âis sustained proliferation a good thing, or will it eventually lead to hypoglycemia or oncogenic transformation in Î²-cells?â Another question is, âhow long is cdk6 expression required to ensure sustained Î²-cell engraftment?â âWill cdk6 be required indefinitely, or can transient proliferation during the critical period of engraftment suffice to ensure long-term engraftment?â A related question is, âcan either regulated or sustained delivery of cdk6 produce sustained human Î²-cell replication in vitro, in a way that will permit expansion of human Î²-cells ex vivo with retention of differentiation?â These are questions that should be examined in future studies in which cdk6 is delivered using regulatable promoters.</p><p>With regard to the oncogenicity question, it is important to recall that the G1/S family is also likely responsible for normal human Î²-cell proliferation in embryonic and neonatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and that they are not necessarily oncogenes. Having said this, it would seem likely that unregulated, long-term expression of cdk6 might have oncogenic consequences. This concern of course applies not only to G1/S cell cycle-activating molecules such as the cdks and D-cyclins, but also to most mitogenic signaling pathways, from receptors (e.g., EGF receptor, G-protein receptors, etc.) to signaling pathways (PI3 kinase, MAP kinase, Ras/Raf, JAK-STAT pathways, etc.) as well. Thus, one principal goal of these studies would be to use these strategies to identify key cellular molecules and pathways that could be targets for small-molecule agonists. For example, now that it is clear that cdk6 is effective individually in driving human Î²-cell expansion, it would be reasonable to screen small-molecule libraries to identify molecules that activate cdk6 in human Î²-cells. An additional goal might be to develop tools that would permit regulated expression of G1/S molecules such as cdk6 and D-cyclins such that they can be transiently activated to drive Î²-cell expansion for a few days or weeks and then inactivated to avoid sustained Î²-cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the G1/S transition is regulated by many proteins in addition to the five studied here, as described in the Introduction and supplementary Fig. 1. Each of these merits future study as both a normal and a potential therapeutic regulator of human Î²-cell replication. The efficacy of these, alone or in combination, and whether they may prove to be as or more effective than cdk6 as a therapeutic target for ex vivo Î²-cell expansion or in vivo Î²-cell engraftment, warrants additional study. Finally, these studies emphasize that, while broadly similar, human and rodent Î²-cells display differences in G1/S repertoires. These studies provide experimental models and multiple targets exploiting human Î²-cell replication, replacement, and engraftment in patients with diabetes.</p></sec>
