      <abstract>
        <p>The insulin gene mutation c.137G&gt;A (R46Q), which changes an arginine at the B22 position of the mature hormone to glutamine, causes the monogenic diabetes variant maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). In MODY patients, this mutation is heterozygous, and both mutant and wild-type (WT) human insulin are produced simultaneously. However, the patients often depend on administration of exogenous insulin. In this study, we chemically synthesized the MODY mutant [GlnB22]-insulin and characterized its biological and structural properties. The chemical synthesis of this insulin analogue revealed that its folding ability is severely impaired. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> tests showed that its binding affinity and biological activity are reduced (both approximately 20% that of human insulin). Comparison of the solution structure of [GlnB22]-insulin with the solution structure of native human insulin revealed that the most significant structural effect of the mutation is distortion of the B20-B23 Î²-turn, leading to liberation of the B chain C-terminus from the protein core. The distortion of the B20-B23 Î²-turn is caused by the extended conformational freedom of the GlnB22 side chain, which is no longer anchored in a hydrogen bonding network like the native ArgB22. The partially disordered [GlnB22]-insulin structure appears to be one reason for the reduced binding potency of this mutant and may also be responsible for its low folding efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic>. The altered orientation and flexibility of the B20-B23 Î²-turn may interfere with the formation of disulfide bonds in proinsulin bearing the R46Q (GlnB22) mutation. This may also have a negative effect on the WT proinsulin simultaneously biosynthesized in Î²-cells and therefore play a major role in the development of MODY in patients producing [GlnB22]-insulin.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In 2012, about 350 million people worldwide were affected by diabetes mellitus. Type 2, or non-insulin dependent, diabetes comprises more than 90% of diabetes cases. This metabolic disease is correlated with obesity, excessive caloric intake, and increasing age. In contrast, type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease primarily caused by dysfunction of insulin-producing Langerhans Î²-cells in the pancreas. Thus, type 1 diabetics are fully dependent on administration of exogenous insulin. In addition to these two main (and a few minor) types of diabetes, there is an inherited, monogenic type of diabetes caused by single-gene mutations in the insulin gene. There are two major classes of monogenic diabetes: neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) <xref rid="pone.0112883-Steck1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. While NDM develops within 6 months after birth, the clinical diagnosis of MODY is based on a few criteria, such as a family history of diabetes, nonketotic diabetes, and onset before 25 years of age <xref rid="pone.0112883-Fajans1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Insulin is a small, 51-amino-acid globular protein consisting of two chains, A-chain (21 amino acids) and B-chain (30 amino acids), linked by two invariant disulfide bridges (A7-B7, A20-B19). A-chain contains an additional disulfide bridge (A6-A11) <xref rid="pone.0112883-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Insulin is derived from an immediate precursor, proinsulin, in which A and B chains are linked by the C-peptide, a connecting peptide with variable sequences and lengths among species. The initial translation product of insulin mRNA is preproinsulin, which contains a 24-amino-acid N-terminal signal sequence attached to proinsulin, allowing the entry of this polypeptide into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The conversion of preproinsulin to proinsulin occurs in the rough ER, and proinsulin is then transported into the ER lumen for disulfide pairing. Successfully folded proinsulin is subsequently transported to the Golgi apparatus, where it is packaged into immature secretory granules. During formation and maturation of the granules, proinsulin is cleaved to liberate insulin and the C-peptide <xref rid="pone.0112883-Steiner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Misfolded proinsulin is retained in the ER lumen and destroyed, as the accumulation of misfolded prohormone in the lumen may lead to severe ER stress, followed by progressive dysfunction and death of the Î²-cells <xref rid="pone.0112883-Nishi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Characterization of insulin analogues <xref rid="pone.0112883-Jiracek1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0112883-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, including systematic mutational analysis <xref rid="pone.0112883-Kristensen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; the occurrence of natural insulin mutants <xref rid="pone.0112883-Edghill1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0112883-Tager1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>; and insights into the insulin-insulin receptor (IR) complex <xref rid="pone.0112883-Menting1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0112883-Menting2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> have revealed the importance and contribution of insulin regions and individual amino acids for aggregation, folding, stability, and interaction with IR. A specific mutation in insulin or its precursors may affect both the biological and physicochemical properties of the protein. The sites of naturally occurring insulin mutations determine the age of onset and clinical severity of diabetes, which may range from a mild, accidentally diagnosed hyperglycemia to seriously advanced metabolic disorder. The most deleterious insulin mutations are alterations of cysteines or other amino acids important for the interactions with IR <xref rid="pone.0112883-Edghill1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Stoy2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>; these usually lead to NDM. Mutations at less âimportantâ positions can affect the folding of (pro)hormones, their ability to aggregate and form fibrils, and the efficiency of excision of the C-peptide. In these cases, the onset of diabetes may occur anytime during childhood or adulthood with a wide spectrum of clinical consequences.</p>
      <p>The insulin gene mutation c.137G&gt;A (R46Q), in which arginine at position B22 is replaced by glutamine, causes MODY, and has been identified to date in one Czech family and one Norwegian family <xref rid="pone.0112883-Molven1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Boesgaard1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. MODY patients have a heterozygous mutation, and both the mutant and WT insulin are produced simultaneously. Both families carrying this gene mutation have experienced similar symptoms. All patients were diagnosed with diabetes during youth or adolescence (13â24 years), and they have been treated with insulin, oral hypoglycaemic agents, and in some cases solely with diet <xref rid="pone.0112883-Molven1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Boesgaard1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we have characterized a naturally occurring insulin analogue bearing the ArgB22âGln mutation implicated in MODY. This is the first study of the synthesis, purification, and biological and structural characterization of a naturally occurring MODY-causing mutant. To understand the impact of this mutation on insulin structure and functionality, we prepared the [GlnB22]-insulin analogue using total chemical synthesis, followed by A and B chain combination. We also characterized its <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> biological activities and determined the solution NMR structure. Our results increase understanding of the structural consequences of this naturally occurring mutation and their impact on the functionality of R46Q insulin in MODY.</p>

        <p>All experiments followed the ethical guidelines for animal experiments described in law 246/1992 of the Czech Republic and were approved by the committee for experiments with laboratory animals of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. Inbred C57BL/6 male mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) were housed at 23Â°C under a daily cycle of 12 h of light and dark (light from 6:00 AM) with free access to water and a standard chow diet that contained 25% calories from protein, 9% from fat, and 66% from carbohydrate. The energy content of the diet (St-1; MlÃ½n Kocanda, Jesenice, Czech Republic) was 3.4 kcal/g.</p>

        <title>Insulin tolerance test in mice</title>
        <p>Twelve-week-old mice (weighing 23â29 g) were randomly divided into three groups of ten mice each. Prior to the test, the mice were placed into separate cages for 3 days, with free access to water and food pellets. The food was taken away 6 h before the start of the test. Mice from the first and the second groups were injected subcutaneously with human insulin or [GlnB22]-insulin at a dose of 0.75 U/kg (calculated for average weight). One unit (U) of insulin or analogue is defined as 6 nmol of the polypeptide (â¼34 Âµg). The compounds were dissolved in a 15â¶1 mixture of saline and 0.1% acetic acid. The third group of mice was injected with saline alone. Blood glucose was measured with a glucometer (Arkray, Kyoto, Japan) in a drop of blood obtained from the tail vein before the application of human insulin, [GlnB22]-insulin, or saline to determine a basal glucose level. This was followed by glucose measurements at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 150 min after injection of compounds or saline. The animals were given free access to food immediately after the experiment. The test was repeated after 14 days using the same protocol. The animals were randomly divided during this process, with none receiving the same compound twice. The decrease in molar concentration of blood glucose in mmol/l (Î c<sub>M</sub>) was adjusted for the impact of conditions during testing (represented by the application of saline). The data were analysed in GraphPad Prism 5.0 (San Diego, USA) and are presented as mean Â±S.E.M. The significance of the changes induced by treatment was calculated using two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test for independent samples.</p>

        <title>NMR spectroscopy</title>
        <p>NMR spectra were acquired from a 0.35 ml sample of 0.2 mM [GlnB22]-insulin and 4 mM WT insulin in 20% d<sub>4</sub>-acetic acid (pH 1.9). All NMR data were collected at 25Â°C on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance (<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>1</sup>H) cryoprobe. A series of homonuclear spectra were recorded to determine sequence-specific resonance assignments for both proteins: 2D TOCSY with 60 ms mixing time, 2D DQF-COSY, and 2D NOESY, which was acquired with an NOE mixing time of 200 ms. Residues involved in forming stable backbone hydrogen bonds were identified by monitoring the rate of backbone amide exchange in 2D TOCSY spectra of [GlnB22]-insulin dissolved in 20% d<sub>4</sub>-acetic acid/80% D<sub>2</sub>O. In addition, the higher concentration of WT insulin allowed for acquisition of heteronuclear <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectra and further extension of the assignments for the <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N resonances. The families of converged structures for both [GlnB22]-insulin and WT insulin were initially calculated using Cyana 2.1 <xref rid="pone.0112883-Herrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A combined automated NOE assignment and structure determination protocol was used to automatically assign the NOE cross-peaks identified in the 2D NOESY spectrum and to produce preliminary structures. Backbone torsion angle constraints for WT insulin were generated from assigned chemical shifts using the program TALOS+ <xref rid="pone.0112883-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Subsequently, five cycles of simulated annealing combined with redundant dihedral angle constraints (Redac) <xref rid="pone.0112883-Guntert1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> were used to produce sets of converged structures with no significant restraint violations (distance and van der Waals violations &lt;0.2 Ã and dihedral angle constraint violation &lt;5Â°), which were further refined in explicit solvent using the YASARA software with the YASARA forcefield <xref rid="pone.0112883-Harjes1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The structures with the lowest total energy were selected. Analysis of the family of structures obtained was carried out using the programs Molmol, iCING <xref rid="pone.0112883-Koradi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Doreleijers1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and PyMol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">www.pymol.org</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>Synthesis of [GlnB22]-insulin by chain combination</title>
        <p>We prepared the [GlnB22]-insulin analogue by total chemical synthesis and chain combination. Individual GlnB22 A- and B-chains in a 2â¶1 molar excess, protected by S-sulfonate groups, were combined by oxidative recombination after reduction of S-sulfonates with a nearly stoichiometric amount of dithiothreitol. Oxidized reaction mixtures were desalted, analyzed, and purified by RP-HPLC. The molecular weight of all resulting analogues was confirmed by HR-MS. The starting amount of B chain-S-sulfonate was a limiting factor in the chain recombination reaction, and the yield of [GlnB22]-insulin was approximately 2%. In comparison, the average recombination yields of human insulin in our laboratory are in the â¼8â12% range (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Insulin tolerance test in mice</title>
        <p>[GlnB22]-insulin was administered subcutaneously to mice. [GlnB22]-insulin caused a statistically significant decrease in blood glucose levels, but its effect was shallower and shorter than that of human insulin. Nevertheless, both WT insulin and [GlnB22]-insulin have a similar time-dependent effect on blood glucose concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The <italic>in vivo</italic> potency of the analogue is similar to its IR binding affinity (ca. 20% that of human insulin, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112883-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Solution structures of [GlnB22]-insulin and WT insulin</title>
        <p>The overall good quality of NMR spectra suggested that both [GlnB22]-insulin and WT insulin are monomeric in 20% d<sub>4</sub>-acetic acid (pH 1.9). We achieved essentially complete sequence-specific assignment of <sup>1</sup>H NMR resonances for both molecules using a combination of homonuclear 2D TOCSY, NOESY, and DQF-COSY experiments. The assignment of WT-human insulin was further extended to the <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C resonances using heteronuclear correlation spectra. In particular, &gt;98% of all proton resonances were assigned in [GlnB22]-insulin and WT insulin, with the exception of the chemical exchange broadened amide proton signals from SerA9 and CysA11 in [GlnB22]-insulin, the unresolved H<sup>Î¶</sup> signal of PheB24, and missing H<sup>Î±</sup> and H<sup>Î²</sup> signals of CysA11 in both proteins. The <sup>1</sup>H resonance assignments obtained for [GlnB22]-insulin and WT insulin were used for automated assignment of the NOEs identified in 2D NOESY spectra implemented in Cyana <xref rid="pone.0112883-Herrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, yielding unique assignments for 98% of the NOE peaks observed. The 40 satisfactorily converged [GlnB22]-insulin and 50 WT insulin structures obtained from 100 random starting conformations using NMR-derived structural constraints, including distance restraints for hydrogen and disulfide bonds and additional dihedral angle restraints for WT-human insulin, were further refined in explicit water using YASARA <xref rid="pone.0112883-Harjes1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

        <p>Our structure of WT human insulin is well-defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g003">3A</xref>); it preserves all typical structural features present in a crystalline T6 hexamer <xref rid="pone.0112883-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and is highly similar to the previously published NMR structure of human insulin determined under acidic conditions <xref rid="pone.0112883-Hua1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, there are minor differences between the structures in the close contacts between the N-terminus of the A-chain (IleA2 and ValA3) and the C-terminus of the B-chain (TyrB26, ThrB27, ProB28), where we identified no substantial NOE crosspeaks between protons in the 2D NOESY spectrum. More importantly, the family of 50 converged structures of WT insulin, accomplished by a simulated annealing calculation in explicit water using NMR-derived constraints, allowed for a more representative view of the polar contacts established between the positively charged side chain of ArgB22 and the rest of the molecule in solution. ArgB22 participates in a network of hydrogen bonds that includes the main chain of ValB18 and CysB19 and the side chains of GluA17 and AsnA21, which contribute to the stabilization of the B20âB23 Î²-turn in a well-ordered conformation, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g003">Figure 3B</xref>.</p>
        <p>The most important structural features observed in [GlnB22]-insulin are the distortion of the B20âB23 Î²-turn and altered orientation of the C-terminal part of the B-chain in comparison with WT insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The extended conformational freedom of the GlnB22 side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which is no longer anchored in a network of hydrogen bonds like the native ArgB22, leads to the disappearance of a stabilizing B20CO-B23NH hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), and the subsequent liberation of the C-terminus from the protein core. This likely decreases the stability of the B20âB23 Î²-turn, which is shifted from its original position in WT insulin by â¼4-5 Ã (the distance between the CÎ± atoms of GlnB22 and ArgB22). The destabilization of the B20âB23 Î²-turn subsequently affects the B24âB30 region of [GlnB22]-insulin, the conformation of which is different than in other analogues with partial detachment of the B24âB30 chain <xref rid="pone.0112883-Jiracek1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zakova4" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Although the B21âB30 backbone of [GlnB22]-insulin departs from the WT-like direction by an angle of â¼75Â°, PheB24 still occupies its hydrophobic pocket, although it approaches the cavity from a different direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The amino acids B25âB30 are disordered; the movement of ThrB30CÎ± within all 40 structures covers a range of â¼20 Ã.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we investigated the biological and structural relationship of the naturally occurring insulin mutant [GlnB22]-insulin, which is responsible for development of MODY.</p>
      <p>We found that [GlnB22]-insulin has reduced binding affinity (approximately 20% of WT) for IR, which corresponds to its lower and shorter <italic>in vivo</italic> effect in an insulin tolerance test in mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112883-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The biological potency of this mutant matches the biological potencies of other known B22-modified analogues. Interestingly, although ArgB22 is evolutionarily conserved (except in guinea pig and porcupine insulins, which have an Asp in the B22 position <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zimmerman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Horuk1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>), the B22 site seems to be tolerant to a wide range of substitutions without detrimental effects on biological potency. For example, insulins in which the positively charged B22 arginine is replaced with aspartic or glutamic acid retain about 50% of the WT biological potency <xref rid="pone.0112883-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, similar to the LysB22 mutant <xref rid="pone.0112883-Katsoyannis1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Even the introduction of a structurally constraining Î±-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) at B22 results in 8% of WT binding affinity <xref rid="pone.0112883-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, whereas incorporation of Aib at other structurally important regions of insulin have negative effects on its IR binding affinity <xref rid="pone.0112883-Kosinova1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Mirmira2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Studies with despentapeptide(B25âB30)-insulins (DPIs) revealed reduced, but not damaging, biological activities of various B22-substituted DPI analogues <xref rid="pone.0112883-Weitzel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The only exception among all B22-substituted insulin analogues is the [AlaB22]-insulin mutant, which has 4-fold higher IR binding affinity (405%) than WT insulin <xref rid="pone.0112883-Kristensen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The high affinity of this mutant is puzzling, especially in the context of a 4-fold reduction in the biological potency of [AlaB22]-DPI compared with [ArgB22]-DPI <xref rid="pone.0112883-Weitzel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In general, the binding affinities for most B22 insulin mutants indicate that ArgB22 is not crucial for the biological activity of this hormone.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a central issue is whether the 20% binding affinity (and similar biological potency) of [GlnB22]-insulin is sufficient for efficient control of glucose homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Some answer results from biological responses to clinically administered insulin degludec <xref rid="pone.0112883-Jonassen1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, which has comparable (or even lower) affinity for IR as [GlnB22]-insulin <xref rid="pone.0112883-Kalra1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Other studies also show a divergence between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> potency. Some analogues with IR binding affinity higher than that of human insulin show lower or equipotent <italic>in vivo</italic> biological activity. There also are examples of analogues with IR binding affinity lower than that of human insulin but with equipotent <italic>in vivo</italic> effects <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zakova2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Marki1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Ribel1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Explanations for this phenomenon could lie in different internalization or higher blood concentration of the analogues, which compensates for their lower affinity. Based on these findings, we expect that effective biosynthesis of the [GlnB22]-insulin mutant by pancreatic Î²-cells would preserve normal glucose homeostasis, especially because patients with this heterozygous mutation also produce endogenous WT insulin. Perhaps the âtroublemakerâ role of [GlnB22]-insulin during development of MODY does not result primarily from its limited biological potency.</p>
      <p>Some explanation for [GlnB22]-insulin's role in MODY may be found in the reduced folding properties of this form of the hormone. Its folding yield during chain-combination reactions was 5-fold lower than that of WT insulin, and even less in comparison with other insulin analogues prepared in our laboratory <xref rid="pone.0112883-Kosinova1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Similar decreased yields during preparation of recombinant or synthetic B22-modified analogues have been reported previously <xref rid="pone.0112883-Kristensen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Furthermore, Liu <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0112883-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> showed that misfolding of a R46Q proinsulin mutant (i.e., ArgB22âGlnB22) blocked secretion of the co-expressed WT proinsulin. This resulted in accumulation of misfolded prohormones in the ER, induction of ER stress, ER stress-mediated progressive death of pancreatic Î²-cells, and finally the onset of MODY. Thus, it is probable that the development of MODY in [GlnB22]-insulin-producing patients has two different, but related and overlapping, causes. First, the amount of properly folded [GlnB22]-insulin produced in the Î²-cells will be low. Second, this misfolded mutant may have an unfavorable effect on the simultaneously biosynthesized WT insulin, leading to the cellular consequences described by Liu <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0112883-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Altogether, it seems that the most important implication of the mutation of arginine to glutamine at the B22 site is the mutant's impaired folding ability due to a loss of typical intra-protein interactions during folding. It has not yet been determined whether [GlnB22]-insulin is secreted into the circulation in patients with MODY. However, if it does, its concentration would be much lower than that of WT insulin in healthy subjects, and thus [GlnB22]-insulin insufficiency will be potentiated further by its lowered biological activity.</p>
      <p>We set out to investigate the structural origins of the impaired binding affinity and foldability of [GlnB22]-insulin. In the crystal structure of WT insulin, arginine B22 is part of the B20-B23 Î²-turn; its side chain resides on the surface of the molecule and participates in a network of non-covalent interactions with AsnA21, CysB19, ValB18, and GluA17 <xref rid="pone.0112883-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. To see whether these features are conserved in [GlnB22]-insulin, we attempted to solve the structure of the mutant. The analogue resisted crystallization efforts, so we determined its solution structure by NMR spectroscopy. We also determined the NMR structure of WT insulin under acidic conditions for direct comparison. The published set of WT human insulin NMR structures is limited to ten conformers <xref rid="pone.0112883-Hua1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and our efforts resulted in a more comprehensive set of converged structures, which allowed a more accurate explanation of the [GlnB22]-insulin structure-activity relationship.</p>
      <p>As expected, our acidic NMR solution structure of WT insulin is generally well-ordered and similar to the structure of insulin monomer known from T6 hexamers <xref rid="pone.0112883-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Main chain NHArgB22-COCysB19 and side chain NH1ArgB22-OEGluA17 hydrogen bonds are maintained in our solution structure of WT insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, these interactions are not present in our [GlnB22]-insulin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Compared with ArgB22 in WT insulin, GlnB22 in the mutant has greater conformational freedom and disorder. The loss of crucial hydrogen bonding interactions, especially with the C-terminus of the A chain, strongly affects the B chain arrangement, causing distortion of the B20âB23 Î²-turn in the [GlnB22]-insulin mutant. Reorganization of the B20âB23 Î²-turn affects the conformation of the B24âB30 terminus, which points away from the core of insulin and is rather disordered, which may help explain the negative outcome of our crystallization experiments. However, although the position of the B25âB30 backbone, and to some extent of PheB24 CÎ±, is very different from the position of their equivalents in the WT insulin B-chain, the side chain of PheB24 remains in the B24 hydrophobic pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112883-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This confirms our recent finding regarding the intrinsic structural integrity of the PheB24 site <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zakova3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Moreover, results of from a computational alanine-scanning study of various insulin monomers revealing the crucial importance of ArgB22 for proper stability of the insulin molecule are in agreement with our solution structure of [GlnB22]-insulin <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zoete1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of [AlaB22]-insulin also showed destabilization of the B20âB23 turn and of the C-terminal part of the B chain.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the altered and partially disordered structure of the [GlnB22]-insulin B-chain C-terminus appears to be the most likely reason for the low foldability of this mutant. The structure and orientation of the B20âB23 Î²-turn may play an important role in this process, potentially tampering with the formation of the correct disulfide bonds in R46Q (GlnB22) proinsulin in the ER. This hypothesis is supported by the enhanced thermodynamic stability and conserved binding affinity of the structurally locked B20 and B23 D-Ala-substituted analogues, which possess a stable, native-like orientation of the B20âB23 turn <xref rid="pone.0112883-Menting2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>However, it is difficult to provide an unambiguous explanation for the [GlnB22]-insulin mutant's lower IR binding affinity. Its overall 3-D structure does not offer an obvious answer. For example, the structure of highly active D-HisB24-insulin shows some similar structural features: enhanced flexibility, partial detachment of the C-terminal Î²-strand, and conserved position of PheB24. Therefore, it appears that one of the most probable reasons for the lower binding affinity of GlnB22-insulin lies in the destabilization and distortion of the B20âB23 Î²-turn. Although direct contacts between the ArgB22 side chain and the L1 domain of IR are not expected <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zakova4" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Menting2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, the possibility that ArgB22 may be involved in some important IR contacts (e.g., IR Site 2) that cannot be fulfilled by GlnB22 cannot be excluded. However, this possibility is contradicted by the high binding affinity (405% of WT) of AlaB22-insulin <xref rid="pone.0112883-Kristensen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. As MD simulations of this analogue indicated the destabilization of its B20âB23 turn <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zoete1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, the argument for a detrimental effect of âhigh-entropyâ of the B20â30 chain on hormone: IR association is doubtful. An experimentally determined 3D structure of [AlaB22]-insulin may shed some light on this paradox.</p>
      <p>Our NMR measurements indicated that [GlnB22]-insulin exists as a monomer in solution. This may result from the distortion of the B20âB23 Î²-turn and the altered direction of the C-terminus of the B-chain <xref rid="pone.0112883-Kurapkat1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. However, the effect of 20% acetic acid <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zakova3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> cannot be excluded, as demonstrated by the monomeric behavior of WT human insulin (this study and <xref rid="pone.0112883-Hua1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>) or insulin analogues <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zakova3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Ludvigsen1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> under these conditions. However, the weak self-association properties of B22-analogues have been observed in monomeric guinea pig and porcupine insulins (with AspB22) <xref rid="pone.0112883-Zimmerman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112883-Horuk1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and in synthetic [GluB22]-des-B30 insulin <xref rid="pone.0112883-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. It is possible that monomeric behavior of [GlnB22]-insulin during expression, processing, and storage may play a negative role in its correct function in the cells. The inability of this mutant to associate into dimers and hexamers may also affect processing of R46Q proinsulin to [GlnB22]-insulin. Although crystallization screening cannot be considered a reliable insight into protein conformation, it is worth noting that [GlnB22]-insulin did not form any dimeric/hexameric crystals under all known dimer/hexamer crystallization conditions.</p>
      <p>In summary, the present study provides some insight into the structural and functional aspects of the ArgâGln swap at the B22 position of insulin, a naturally occurring mutation (R46Q) that causes MODY. Chemical synthesis of [GlnB22]-insulin revealed its impaired folding ability, and <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> tests showed its reduced binding affinity and biological activity. The solution structure of this analogue shed some light onto the impact of GlnB22-induced structural distortion of the hormone molecule on its behavior <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, it also further underlined the molecular and biological complexity of insulin, in which a multifaceted role of each side chain presents a formidable obstacle to a clear delineation of its structural and functional purpose.</p>
