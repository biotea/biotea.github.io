      <abstract>
        <p>Congenital macrothrombocytopenia is a family of rare diseases, of which a significant fraction remains to be genetically characterized. To analyze cases of unexplained thrombocytopenia, 27 individuals from a patient cohort of the Bleeding and Thrombosis Exploration Center of the University Hospital of Marseille were recruited for a high-throughput gene sequencing study. This strategy led to the identification of two novel <italic>FLI1</italic> variants (c.1010G&gt;A and c.1033A&gt;G) responsible for macrothrombocytopenia. The <italic>FLI1</italic> variant carriersâ platelets exhibited a defect in aggregation induced by low-dose adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), a defect in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) secretion, a reduced mepacrine uptake and release and a reduced CD63 expression upon TRAP stimulation. Precise ultrastructural analysis of platelet content was performed using transmission electron microscopy and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Remarkably, dense granules were nearly absent in the carriersâ platelets, presumably due to a biogenesis defect. Additionally, 25â29% of the platelets displayed giant Î±-granules, while a smaller proportion displayed vacuoles (7â9%) and autophagosome-like structures (0â3%). <italic>In vitro</italic> study of megakaryocytes derived from circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> cells of the carriers revealed a maturation defect and reduced proplatelet formation potential. The study of the <italic>FLI1</italic> variants revealed a significant reduction in protein nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity properties. Intraplatelet flow cytometry efficiently detected the biomarker MYH10 in <italic>FLI1</italic> variant carriers. Overall, this study provides new insights into the phenotype, pathophysiology and diagnosis of <italic>FLI1</italic> variant-associated thrombocytopenia.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Congenital reduced platelet count or impaired platelet function lead to a family of diseases, which are increasingly recognized as a significant cause of bleeding in children and adults.<sup><xref rid="b1-1021006" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Congenital macrothrombocytopenias (CMTPs) constitute a large subgroup of inherited thrombocytopenia characterized by enlarged platelets. Several genetic variants have been associated with CMTP, of which the most frequent alter genes that encode platelet surface proteins and megakaryocyte (MK) cytoskeletal proteins.<sup><xref rid="b2-1021006" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>However, mounting evidence has shown that several forms of CMTP are caused by variants in genes encoding hematopoietic transcription factors, which lead to altered downstream expression of genes that regulate platelet formation and function.<sup><xref rid="b3-1021006" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="b10-1021006" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In 2013, Stockley <italic>et al</italic>. used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze 13 unrelated patients suspected of having an inherited qualitative platelet defect in the UK Genotyping and Phenotyping of Platelets (UK-GAPP) study.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021006" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The group reported two substitutions and a 4-bp frameshift deletion in the transcription factor gene <italic>FLI1</italic>. Two of the index cases also had mild thrombocytopenia, and one of them exhibited enlarged platelets. These findings highlight the role of FLI1 in megakaryopoiesis and platelet function.</p>
      <p>To analyze cases of unexplained thrombocytopenia, 27 individuals from the patient cohort of the Bleeding and Thrombosis Exploration Center of the University Hospital of Marseille were recruited for a high-throughput gene sequencing investigation. In the study herein, we report the discovery of two novel <italic>FLI1</italic> dominant variants linked to CMTP in two unrelated pedigrees. We investigated the pathogenesis of <italic>FLI1</italic>-associated thrombocytopenia by analyzing subcellular FLI1 localization and MK differentiation from hematopoietic progenitors derived from patients. We characterized the genotype-phenotype relationship and described the intraplatelet flow cytometry-based quantification of MYH10, a biomarker of <italic>FLI1</italic> and <italic>RUNX1</italic> alterations. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) is an imaging approach based on the serial sectioning of entire platelets, which allows a 3D representation of the granules with respect to their shape, content and number. Using this method, we showed a severe dense granule deficiency in platelets of the <italic>FLI1</italic> variant carriers.</p>

        <p>PRP was fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Next, the fixed PRP was centrifuged at 1000 G for five min. The platelet pellet was suspended in permeabilization buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 2mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) PBS) and labeled with rabbit anti-MYH10 antibody (Cell Signaling; #3404) for one hour. After a washing step, the platelets were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa-488-labeled secondary antibody (Abcam; ab150077) for 30 min in permeabilization buffer. After another washing step, the data were acquired using Navios Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).</p>

        <p>For ultrastructural analysis, platelets in citrated PRP were diluted and fixed in PBS pH 7.2 containing 1.25% glutaraldehyde for one hour. After centrifugation and two PBS washings, they were post-fixed in 150 mM cacodylate-hydrochloric acid (HCl) buffer containing 1% osmium tetroxide pH 7.4 for 30 min at 4Â°C. After dehydration in a graded alcohol, embedding in EPON was performed by polymerization at 60Â°C for 72 hours. Ultrathin sections (~70 nm thick) were mounted on 200 mesh copper grids, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a JEOL JEM1400 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Orius 600 camera and Digital Micrograph software (Lyon Bio Image, Centre dâImagerie Quantitative de Lyon Est, France). Morphometric measurements were done using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, USA). Preparations of platelet whole mounts were obtained after brief contact of formvar coated grids on small drops of PRP. Then, grids were rinsed rapidly with distilled water, dried with the edge of a filter paper, waved in the air and examined under the transmission electron microscope. Dense granules were identified and counted as previously described.<sup><xref rid="b11-1021006" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> FIB-SEM samples were processed as for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and examined using a Helios NanoLab microscope (FEI).

        <title>Identification of two novel <italic>FLI1</italic> variants</title>
        <p>Two high-throughput sequencing methods were used to identify candidate variants in 27 patients with suspected congenital thrombocytopenia. DNA samples from 12 individuals (three members of four unrelated families) with unexplained autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia were analyzed <italic>via</italic> whole-exome sequencing. In one family (Family F1), this analysis revealed a heterozygous single nucleotide change in <italic>FLI1</italic>. This missense variant, c.1010G&gt;A, encodes an arginine to glutamine change (p.R337Q) in the highly conserved E twenty-six (ETS) DNA-binding domain of FLI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1021006">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The presence of the variant was confirmed using capillary sequencing. There was a segregation between the <italic>FLI1</italic> variant and a history of thrombocytopenia in all cases for which DNA samples were available. In the three other families, no candidate variant was detected. Next, 15 additional individuals from 14 unrelated families were screened using a 308 gene panel NGS strategy. This screening led to the genetic diagnosis of four patients with macrothrombocytopenia. Aside from the identification of <italic>MYH9, ACTN1</italic> and <italic>GP1BA</italic> variants in three unrelated individuals, one patient carried c.1033A&gt;G heterozygous <italic>FLI1</italic> variant, yielding p.K345E substitution (Family F2). In this family, the clinical and genetic status of the probandâs father (F2-I1) was unknown and the probandâs mother (F2-I2) displayed a normal platelet count, but the <italic>FLI1</italic> gene was not sequenced. This second <italic>FLI1</italic> variant also affected the ETS domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1021006">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Sequence alignment of FLI1 orthologs and paralogs demonstrated that both variants affected amino acid residues in a highly conserved sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1021006">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>As these variants were located in the ETS domain, a simulation of the protein-DNA interactions was performed. Regarding the p.R337Q variant, glutamine 337 retained the ability to interact with DNA; however, the putative hydrogen (H)-bonds should be weaker than those established with the positively charged arginine guanidinium moiety. In the p.K345E variant, glutamic acid 345 is negatively charged and likely has a repelling effect on DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1021006">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

        <p>Western blot analysis did not reveal an alteration in FLI1 protein expression in the platelets of affected members compared with healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1021006">Figure 4A</xref>). Accordingly, protein expression of wild-type (WT) and both FLI1 variants in transfected cells were equivalent, thereby suggesting that these variants do not influence protein expression or stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1021006">Figure 4B</xref>). To investigate the effect of the p.R337Q and p.K345E variants on FLI1 transcriptional activity, we investigated the ability of the recombinant FLI1 variants to regulate transcriptional activity using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Co-transfection of the reporter plasmid containing the ETS-binding site and a plasmid encoding WT FLI1 resulted in almost 70% inhibition of luciferase activity. There was a loss in the ability of the p.R337Q and p.K345E variants to repress luciferase activity compared with that of WT FLI1 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1021006">Figure 4C</xref>).

The mean Î±-granule number per Î¼m<sup>2</sup> of platelet section was slightly reduced in the FLI1 p.R337Q variant carrier but not in the p.K345E variant carrier. We quantified the platelet surface on sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-1021006">Figure 6C</xref>), which confirmed the increased platelet size associated with <italic>FLI1</italic> variants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-1021006">Table 1</xref>).

Precise platelet content analysis and 3D reconstruction of the Î±- and dense granules within platelets was performed using the FIB-SEM technique.

Empty dense granule membrane structures were rarely detected (3 Â± 0.5, 1 Â± 0.3 and 0.5 Â± 0.2 copies for F1-II2, F2-II4 and control platelets, respectively; n=12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-1021006">Figure 6C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we identified two novel <italic>FLI1</italic> variants in patients from two unrelated families displaying CMTP with marked bleeding diathesis in one of them. The reported <italic>FLI1</italic> variants were associated with impaired megakaryocytic differentiation and PPT formation <italic>in vitro</italic> and with a defect in the protein subcellular localization, thereby providing further insights into the pathophysiology of <italic>FLI1</italic>-associated thrombocytopenia. Remarkably, we demonstrated that dense granules were nearly absent in the carriersâ platelets. In addition, we showed that intraplatelet flow cytometry efficiently detected the biomarker MYH10 in <italic>FLI1</italic> variant carriers.</p>
      <p>FLI1 belongs to the ETS-domain transcription factor family, in which members bind a specific DNA consensus sequence to control the expression of genes that are essential in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and programmed cell death.<sup><xref rid="b13-1021006" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> FLI1 is mainly expressed in hematopoietic and vascular endothelial cells and plays a role in the regulation of essential MK genes.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021006" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1021006" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b14-1021006" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="b23-1021006" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In humans, a role for FLI1 in megakaryopoiesis was highlighted by studies of Paris-Trousseau syndrome (PTS)<sup><xref rid="b24-1021006" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="b26-1021006" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> in which the <italic>FLI1</italic> locus is hemizygously deleted, and more recently by two articles reporting <italic>FLI1</italic> variants associated with congenital thrombocytopenia.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021006" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1021006" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The affected members carried heterozygous variants, with a dominant mode of inheritance in the F1 family. The thrombocytopenia associated with the <italic>FLI1</italic> variants reported by Stockley <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021006" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and the PTS<sup><xref rid="b24-1021006" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-1021006" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> were also shown to be transmitted in a dominant manner. Inversely, Stevenson <italic>et al</italic>. have described a family displaying inherited thrombocytopenia caused by a recessive <italic>FLI1</italic> variant.<sup><xref rid="b8-1021006" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> We hypothesize that the mode of inheritance could rely on the degree of the protein functional impairment, as suggested by the moderately reduced transcriptional activity of the p.R324W variant, associated with the recessive inheritance pattern. Intriguingly, in mouse models of a targeted null <italic>Fli1</italic> variant, the mice carrying a heterozygous deletion of <italic>Fli1</italic> are phenotypically indistinguishable from the WT mice. We hypothesize that these mouse models do not undergo silencing of one <italic>FLI1</italic> allele during the early stages of megakaryopoiesis, contrary to that observed in humans.<sup><xref rid="b26-1021006" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The bleeding phenotype of F2-II4 was much more severe than that of the affected members of the family F1 (ISTH BAT score 16 <italic>vs</italic>. 1). An additional bleeding disorder (affecting coagulation, von Willebrand factor or fibrinolysis) was ruled out. A combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors may interfere in the genotype-phenotype relationship. This difference is not likely to be directly related to platelet count or patient age; however, this could be explained in part by the sex of the patient. Indeed, the individual with a high bleeding score (F2-II4) predominantly suffered from gynecological and obstetrical bleeding. This may reflect the limitation of the ISTH BAT score to evaluate the bleeding risk in males who have not been challenged enough as compared to females.</p>
      <p>In PTS, the platelet count seems to be as low as 20 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/l early in life and subsequently increases to near or low normal levels.<sup><xref rid="b25-1021006" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b27-1021006" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Similar to that shown in a previous report of <italic>FLI1</italic> variant carriers,<sup><xref rid="b7-1021006" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> the older patient in the F1 family exhibited a higher platelet count than the younger one. The platelet counts and the increased MPV of the affected members were consistent with that observed in most PTS cases and <italic>FLI1</italic> variant-associated thrombocytopenia patients.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021006" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b25-1021006" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> As noted in some PTS patients, the bleeding phenotype of patient F2-II4 was more severe than that expected with a mild thrombocytopenia, thereby suggesting associated abnormal platelet function.<sup><xref rid="b25-1021006" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b27-1021006" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In the present study, the affected members exhibited an aggregation defect upon low dose ADP, collagen, and TRAP-6 stimulation, which is a hallmark of dense granule storage pool deficiency. Data concerning aggregation assays has varied widely in the literature. Breton-Gorius <italic>et al</italic>. have reported normal aggregation curves in PTS patients.<sup><xref rid="b24-1021006" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Regarding <italic>FLI1</italic> variant-associated thrombocytopenia, Stevenson <italic>et al</italic>. have reported reduced aggregation to collagen and ADP.<sup><xref rid="b8-1021006" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Finally, in a murine model expressing a C-terminal truncated Fli1 protein, aggregation tests revealed reduced ADP- and thrombin-induced aggregation.<sup><xref rid="b28-1021006" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> These discrepancies could be in part due to differences regarding agonist concentrations or sources. Furthermore, storage pool diseases are known to be associated with variable aggregation profiles.<sup><xref rid="b29-1021006" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In the study herein, NGS-based techniques led to the identification of the <italic>FLI1</italic> variants. These strategies require careful interpretation as they lead to the identification of a high number of non-pathogenic variants. However, clinical phenotype and screening laboratory tests are not specific and often fail to yield a specific diagnosis. Identifying biomarkers could facilitate the diagnostic process of inherited platelet disorders. In this regard, platelet-specific expression of MYH10, whose silencing is required for the switch from mitosis to endomitosis during MK maturation,<sup><xref rid="b30-1021006" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> has been shown to constitute a biomarker for the inherited platelet disorders associated with <italic>FLI1</italic> and <italic>RUNX1</italic> alterations.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021006" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1021006" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b12-1021006" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Platelet MYH10 expression is usually detected <italic>via</italic> western blot. This assay is complex and time-consuming, and the results must be carefully interpreted as control platelets exhibit low expression of MYH10. In this study, we developed a quantitative assay to detect MYH10 overexpression in <italic>FLI1</italic> variant carriersâ platelets using intracellular flow cytometry. This test enabled rapid and accurate discrimination between the affected members and controls using only a small volume of PRP or whole blood.</p>
      <p>Î±- and dense granule defects were identified as the main platelet defect in the affected members. It is important to study the mechanisms of this functional impairment, as bleeding diathesis may still occur in <italic>FLI1</italic>-associated thrombocytopenia patients with subnormal or normal platelet counts.<sup><xref rid="b27-1021006" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> We report that up to 29% of the patientsâ platelets displayed giant Î±-granules, which is a characteristic feature of PTS<sup><xref rid="b24-1021006" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-1021006" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and have been previously reported in <italic>FLI1</italic> variant-associated thrombocytopenia,<sup><xref rid="b8-1021006" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> albeit in a much smaller proportion of platelets (4â15%). This discrepancy can be attributed to differences in the analysis methods. Contrary to classic TEM, FIB-SEM enables evaluation of the whole granule content of a platelet. In the present study, normal or even increased serum PAI-1 levels suggest normal Î±-granule content and release.<sup><xref rid="b31-1021006" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Taken together, these results indicate that the vesicle trafficking or the Î±-granule proteins packaging but not the storage mechanisms may be impaired. Regarding dense granules, we demonstrated for the first time using electron microscopy (notably FIB-SEM), ATP secretion, mepacrine uptake and release, CD63 expression upon stimulation and serotonin measurement, that dense granules were nearly absent in the carriersâ platelets and that empty dense granule membrane structures were rarely detected. This suggests that the platelet dense granule deficiency is due to an impaired biogenesis. A previous study on Jacobsen syndrome, a variant of PTS, has reported a dense granule storage pool deficiency in six patients<sup><xref rid="b32-1021006" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> using whole mount electron microscopy, which only allows the evaluation of the electron opaque dense granules content. More recently, Stockley <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the platelet of <italic>FLI1</italic> variants carriers exhibited an ATP secretion defect<sup><xref rid="b7-1021006" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> but have not evaluated the dense granule content. Interestingly, in a recent study reporting ChIP-seq data in murine MK,<sup><xref rid="b33-1021006" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> FLI1 was shown to interact with <italic>HPS4</italic> and <italic>RAB27B</italic> genes, which are known regulators of dense granules biogenesis.<sup><xref rid="b34-1021006" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="b35-1021006" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Autophagosome-like structures were noted in 3% of platelets from one affected member. Autophagy is known to be important in both megakary-opoiesis<sup><xref rid="b36-1021006" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and platelet function.<sup><xref rid="b37-1021006" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> This observation thus suggests that autophagy may play a role in the pathophysiology of <italic>FLI1</italic>-associated thrombocytopenia. Glycogen accumulations were noted in the platelets of most of the affected members. The significance of this abnormal feature is unclear, although it may suggest that FLI1 plays a role in the regulation of platelet intracellular metabolic processes.</p>
      <p>The p.R337Q and p.K345E variants are located within the ETS-domain, similar to the previously reported variants.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021006" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1021006" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The pathogenic effect of these novel <italic>FLI1</italic> variants was confirmed by the significant reduction in transcriptional activity, as with all other <italic>FLI1</italic> variants reported in the literature.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021006" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1021006" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, we show that both p.R337Q and p.K345E variants displayed significantly altered cellular localization with a reduced nuclear accumulation. In a previous study based on directed mutagenesis, these residues were found to be important for the DNA-bound conformation of FLI1 and its nuclear accumulation.<sup><xref rid="b38-1021006" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Additionally, the p.R337A variant abolished ETS DNA-binding activity.<sup><xref rid="b38-1021006" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Overall, these results suggest that both nuclear accumulation and DNA-binding capacity could interfere with FLI1 regulation of MK-specific genes. Other mechanisms may also cause this impairment, such as abnormal recruitment of co-regulators or altered activation of histone deacetylases or acetylases.<sup><xref rid="b39-1021006" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p>
      <p><italic>In vitro</italic>, we noted a marked diminution of mature CD41<sup>hi</sup>CD42a<sup>hi</sup> MKs, along with an increase in CD41<sup>low</sup>CD42a<sup>â</sup> and CD41<sup>â</sup>CD42<sup>â</sup> cells among <italic>FLI1</italic> variant carriers. Even if we cannot formally exclude an impaired expression of CD41 and CD42a by FLI1 variants, the reduced percentage of high-ploidy cells (â¥8n) confirmed the MK differentiation defect. Furthermore, the platelet from the <italic>FLI1</italic> variant carriers displayed normal expression of CD42a (<italic>data not shown</italic>) and CD41. Consistent with our findings, data from PTS patients has shown that the MK transition from CD42a<sup>â</sup> to CD42a<sup>+</sup> was especially sensitive to a reduction in FLI1 dosage.<sup><xref rid="b26-1021006" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In a murine model with complete Fli1 deficiency, the authors reported that megakaryocytic progenitors displayed an early blockage in MK differentiation.<sup><xref rid="b40-1021006" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Additionally, in a murine model expressing a truncated Fli1 protein lacking the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain, bone marrow cell analysis revealed a 2-fold increase in CD34<sup>+</sup>CD41<sup>+</sup>CD42<sup>â</sup> cells.<sup><xref rid="b28-1021006" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The study herein provides new insights into the mechanisms that drive <italic>FLI1</italic>-associated thrombocytopenia and highlights its function in normal and pathologic megakaryopoiesis and in platelet granule biogenesis. TEM and FIB-SEM enabled a more detailed description of the ultrastructural features associated with this disease, demonstrating that dense granules were nearly absent in the carriersâ platelets. This work also shows that the increased expression of MYH10 in the platelets of <italic>FLI1</italic> variant carriers was efficiently detected by flow cytometry.</p>
