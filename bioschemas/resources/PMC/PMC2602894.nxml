        <p>Platelets play an essential role in wound healing by forming thrombi that
 plug holes in the walls of damaged blood vessels. To achieve this, platelets
 express a diverse array of cell surface receptors and signaling proteins that
 induce rapid platelet activation. In this study we show that two platelet
 glycoprotein receptors that signal via an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
 activation motif (ITAM) or an ITAM-like domain, namely the collagen receptor
 complex glycoprotein VI (GPVI)-FcR Î³-chain and the C-type lectin-like
 receptor 2 (CLEC-2), respectively, support constitutive (<italic>i.e.</italic>
 agonist-independent) signaling in a cell line model using a nuclear factor of
 activated T-cells (NFAT) transcriptional reporter assay that can detect low
 level activation of phospholipase CÎ³ (PLCÎ³). Constitutive and
 agonist signaling by both receptors is dependent on Src and Syk family
 kinases, and is inhibited by G6b-B, a platelet immunoglobulin receptor that
 has two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in its cytosolic tail.
 Mutation of the conserved tyrosines in the two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
 inhibitory motifs prevents the inhibitory action of G6b-B. Interestingly, the
 inhibitory activity of G6b-B is independent of the Src homology 2 (SH2)-domain
 containing tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, and the inositol
 5â²-phosphatase, SHIP. Constitutive signaling via Src and Syk tyrosine
 kinases is observed in platelets and is associated with tyrosine
 phosphorylation of GPVI-FcR Î³-chain and CLEC-2. We speculate that
 inhibition of constitutive signaling through Src and Syk tyrosine kinases by
 G6b-B may help to prevent unwanted platelet activation.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The GPVI-FcR Î³-chain complex is the major signaling receptor for
 collagen on platelets and megakaryocytes
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Cross-linking of GPVI leads
 to Src-dependent phosphorylation of a tandem Y<italic>XX</italic>L sequence on the FcR
 Î³-chain known as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif
 (ITAM).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">4</xref> In turn, this
 leads to recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk through its
 tandem SH2 domains. Syk initiates a signaling cascade that generates a linker
 for activation of T (LAT) cell-dependent signalosome, which mediates
 activation of phospholipase CÎ³2 (PLCÎ³-2)
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). This pathway initiates a
 rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activation of protein kinase C
 leading to platelet aggregation.</p>
    <p>CLEC-2 is a 32-kDa C-type lectin-like receptor that functions as a platelet
 receptor for the snake venom toxin rhodocytin and the lymphatic endothelial
 marker, podoplanin
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>).
 Like glycoprotein (GP) VI, CLEC-2 signals via sequential activation of Src and
 Syk tyrosine kinases leading to activation of PLCÎ³2
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). The regulation of
 PLCÎ³2 by CLEC-2 is distinct from that of GPVI in that it uses a single
 Y<italic>XX</italic>L sequence and is only partially dependent on the adapter SLP-76
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p>
    <p>G6b is a recently identified member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that
 exists in several splice variants
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). G6b-B is the only one of
 these variants to contain both a transmembrane region and two immunoreceptor
 tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that support binding to the two SH2
 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). ITIMs are defined by the
 consensus sequence (L/I/V/S)-<italic>X</italic>-Y-<italic>X</italic>-<italic>X</italic>-(L/V) and are
 commonly found in pairs separated by 15 to 30 amino acid residues
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). The second ITIM in G6b-B
 is located â¼20 amino acids downstream of the first ITIM and has a slightly
 different sequence to the above, T<italic>X</italic>Y<italic>XX</italic>V. G6b-B is the third
 ITIM-containing protein to be identified on platelets
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). The other two platelet
 ITIM receptors are platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and
 TREM-like transcript-1
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>).</p>
    <p>ITIM-containing receptors were originally identified by their ability to
 inhibit signaling by ITAM receptors, as demonstrated by the selective
 inhibition of the B-cell receptor when cross-linked by surface immunoglobulin
 to FcÎ³ receptor IIb (FcÎ³RIIb)
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). However, it is now
 recognized that ITIM-containing receptors can also generate stimulatory
 signals or inhibit activation by G protein-coupled receptors. For example,
 PECAM-1 has been reported to induce integrin activation in T cells
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), whereas it causes mild
 inhibition of platelet activation by the ITAM and ITAM-like receptors, GPVI
 and CLEC-2, and by the G protein-coupled receptor agonist, thrombin
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>).
 The latter action is similar to that of G6b-B, which upon cross-linking by a
 specific antibody inhibits activation of platelets by the GPVI-specific
 agonist, collagen-related peptide, and the G protein-coupled receptor agonist
 ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). In contrast, the
 ITIM receptor, TREM-1, which is present on platelet intracellular granules, is
 translocated to the surface of activated platelets and reinforces platelet
 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this study we have used a sensitive NFAT reporter assay that monitors
 activation of PLCÎ³ in DT40 B cells to investigate the effect of G6b-B on
 signaling by the GPVI-FcR Î³-chain complex and CLEC-2. The NFAT reporter
 assay monitors weak, sustained signaling events and gives robust detection of
 activation of GPVI by collagen and of CLEC-2 by rhodocytin and podoplanin
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). The availability of
 variants of the DT40 cell line deficient in key signaling proteins allows
 dissection of the signaling pathways used by the above receptors.</p>
    <p>Here we show that expression of the GPVI-FcR Î³-chain complex and
 CLEC-2 in DT40 cells leads to the generation of both constitutive and
 agonist-induced signals that are inhibited by G6b-B. This effect is dependent
 on the two ITIMs in the cytosolic tail of G6b-B, although it is independent of
 the two SH2-domain containing tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, and of the
 inositol lipid 5â²-phosphatase, SHIP. Significantly, we also provide
 evidence for constitutive signaling through Src and Syk-dependent kinases in
 platelets, thereby raising the possibility that inhibition of this by G6b-B
 could help to prevent unwanted platelet activation in the vasculature.</p>

      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p><italic>Constitutive Signaling of GPVI-FcR</italic> Î³<italic>-Chain in DT40
 Cells</italic>âWe set out to extend our previous characterization of the
 GPVI-FcR Î³-chain signaling pathway in the DT40 B cell line
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>) by testing whether
 activation of GPVI by collagen is dependent on its associated FcR
 Î³-chain. Activation was monitored in the absence and presence of
 collagen and compared with mock-transfected cells that had been allowed to
 settle on fibronectin using a NFAT-luciferase reporter assay. Adhesion to
 fibronectin alone did not induce NFAT activation (not shown). As anticipated,
 collagen stimulated NFAT activation in DT40 cells expressing both GPVI and an
 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal Myc-tagged version of FcR Î³-chain, whereas it
 had no effect when either subunit was transfected on its own
 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref> and not
 shown). The Myc-tagged version of FcR Î³-chain supports a similar level
 of activation to that of the wild-type protein (not shown) and has the
 advantage that it can be used to monitor surface expression by flow cytometry,
 which is not altered by expression of GPVI
 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref><italic>, panel
 ii</italic>). In contrast, GPVI was not expressed on the surface of DT40 cells in
 the absence of the FcR Î³-chain (not shown), as is the case for platelets
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). These results are
 consistent with a model in which cross-linking of GPVI by collagen leads to
 tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR Î³-chain and activation of the
 tyrosine kinase Syk.</p>
      <p>These studies further revealed the unexpected observation that expression
 of the Myc-tagged or wild-type FcR Î³-chain caused a significant increase
 in luciferase activity that approached almost 10% of the response to collagen
 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>A, panel i</italic> and <italic>B,
 panel i</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the constitutive signal from the FcR
 Î³-chain was not altered by co-expression with GPVI
 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref><italic>, panel
 i</italic>). Thus the increase in luciferase activity that was observed in the
 absence of a stimulatory agonist reflects signaling by the ITAM-containing
 protein.</p>
      <p>To investigate constitutive signaling in further detail, DT40 cells were
 transfected with varying concentrations of the FcR Î³-chain plasmid and
 the level of NFAT activation monitored. Increasing levels of transfection of
 FcR Î³-chain led to a corresponding increase in both NFAT activation
 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref><italic>, panel
 i</italic>) and FcR Î³-chain expression as shown by Western blotting
 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref><italic>, panel
 ii</italic>). Furthermore, Western blotting of GPVI-FcR Î³-chain-transfected
 cells demonstrated an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a band of 72 kDa
 that comigrates with Syk, along with constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of
 FcR Î³-chain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.
 1<italic>C</italic></xref><italic>, panel i</italic>). Confirmation that the 72-kDa
 protein corresponds to Syk was confirmed using a phosphospecific antibody
 (phospho-Syk Tyr<sup>525/526</sup>) that binds to the activated tyrosine
 kinase (not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and FcR Î³-chain were
 inhibited in the presence of the Src family kinase inhibitor PD0173952
 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref><italic>, panel
 i</italic>, and not shown). These results demonstrate that the FcR Î³-chain
 generates constitutive signals in DT40 cells that lead to tyrosine
 phosphorylation of Syk and NFAT activation. Stimulation of GPVI-FcR
 Î³-chain-transfected cells with collagen leads to a further increase in
 tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.
 1<italic>C</italic></xref><italic>, panel ii</italic>), consistent with the activation of
 Syk by the collagen receptor complex, as described in earlier studies.</p>
      <p><italic>Constitutive Signaling of CLEC-2 in DT40 Cells</italic>âThe above
 studies were extended to CLEC-2, which is a recently identified platelet
 glycoprotein receptor that mediates activation through a single Y<italic>XX</italic>L
 motif in its cytosolic tail. CLEC-2 is a receptor for the snake venom toxin,
 rhodocytin, and the lymphatic marker podoplanin. Both agonists induce
 activation of CLEC-2-transfected DT40 cells, with the response being dependent
 on the conserved tyrosine in the cytoplasmic Y<italic>XX</italic>L motif
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the present study, we have confirmed that rhodocytin stimulates NFAT
 activation in CLEC-2-transfected DT40 cells, with the level of response
 increasing with the level of surface expression of CLEC-2
 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref><italic>, panels
 i</italic> and <italic>ii</italic>). Moreover, as is the case with the FcR Î³-chain,
 expression of CLEC-2 was sufficient to increase NFAT activity in the absence
 of agonist stimulation, with the level of response increasing in parallel with
 that of CLEC-2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.
 2<italic>A</italic></xref><italic>, panels i</italic> and <italic>ii</italic>). The level of
 constitutive activity approached between 10 and 20% the response to
 rhodocytin. Constitutive signaling by CLEC-2 is abolished following mutation
 of the tyrosine in the CLEC-2 Y<italic>XX</italic>L sequence to a phenylalanine (Y7F)
 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref><italic>, panel
 i</italic>), as is the case for stimulation by rhodocytin
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Flow cytometry confirmed a
 similar level of expression of wild-type and the Y7F mutant of CLEC-2 in these
 studies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref><italic>,
 panel ii</italic>). These results demonstrate that constitutive and
 agonist-induced signaling by CLEC-2 is dependent on the Y<italic>XX</italic>L
 motif.</p>

      <p><italic>Constitutive Signaling by GPVI-FcR</italic> Î³<italic>-Chain and CLEC-2 Is
 Mediated by Src and Syk Tyrosine Kinases</italic>âWe and others have
 previously reported that collagen stimulates phosphorylation of the FcR
 Î³-chain ITAM in platelets through the Src kinases, Fyn and Lyn, leading
 to recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>).
 Similarly, phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and Syk by rhodocytin in platelets is
 mediated through a Src kinase pathway, although the identity of the Src kinase
 is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Consistent
 with this, we observed constitutive and collagen-stimulated tyrosine
 phosphorylation of Syk in GPVI-FcR Î³-chain-transfected DT40 cells
 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). In
 comparison, we have not been able to detect constitutive phosphorylation of
 CLEC-2 in our studies, possibly because of a lower level of expression
 relative to that of FcR Î³-chain, as shown using a Myc-tagged version of
 both proteins (supplemental Fig. S1), and because the C-type lectin receptor
 has a single Y<italic>XX</italic>L motif. However, we have observed a small increase
 in constitutive phosphorylation of Syk in DT40 cells expressing CLEC-2, which
 was further increased in the presence of rhodocytin (not shown).</p>
      <p>Experiments were designed to investigate whether NFAT signaling by the
 GPVI-FcR Î³-chain complex and CLEC-2 in transfected DT40 cells is
 mediated through Src and Syk kinases. As shown in
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>, constitutive
 and agonist-induced NFAT activation by both receptors is blocked in the
 presence of the Src family kinase inhibitor PD0173952. Furthermore,
 constitutive and agonist-induced signaling by the two receptors was also
 markedly inhibited in the absence of Syk
 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref> and data not
 shown). Thus, these results demonstrate that constitutive and agonist-induced
 signaling by GPVI-FcR Î³-chain and CLEC-2 are both dependent on Src
 family and Syk tyrosine kinases.</p>
      <p><italic>G6b-B Inhibits Constitutive and Agonist-induced Signaling by
 GPVI-FcR</italic> Î³<italic>-Chain and CLEC-2 through Its Two ITIMs</italic>âA
 series of experiments were undertaken to investigate the possible regulation
 of constitutive and agonist-induced signaling through the GPVI-FcR
 Î³-chain complex and CLEC-2 by the platelet immunoglobulin receptor
 G6b-B, which contains two ITIMs in its cytosolic tail
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). xpression of G6b-B
 significantly inhibited constitutive signaling by both receptors by more than
 60% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>panel i</italic>),
 as well as inhibiting the response to collagen and rhodocytin by â¼35 and
 60%, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>,
 <italic>panel</italic> ii). The greater degree of inhibition of the response to
 rhodocytin may reflect the lower level of expression of CLEC-2 relative to
 GPVI-FcR Î³-chain (supplemental Fig. S1). Expression of G6b-B had no
 effect on the level of expression of either CLEC-2 or GPVI (supplemental Fig.
 S2). Expression of G6b-B also partially inhibited collagen-induced tyrosine
 phosphorylation of Syk (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.
 1<italic>C</italic></xref><italic>, panel ii</italic>), demonstrating a molecular basis
 for its inhibitory action. These results demonstrate that G6b-B inhibits
 constitutive and agonist-induced signaling induced by GPVI-FcR Î³-chain
 and CLEC-2.</p>

      <p>G6b-B contains two ITIMs in its cytosolic tail, which independently mediate
 binding to SHP1 and SHP2 following incubation with the protein-tyrosine
 phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Mutation of the two
 conserved tyrosines at positions 211 and 237 to phenylalanine inhibits
 association with the two SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). To investigate whether
 either or both of the ITIMs mediate the inhibitory effect of G6b-B, the
 Y211F/Y237F double mutant was expressed in DT40 cells together with the
 GPVI-FcR Î³-chain complex and CLEC-2. Flow cytometry was used to confirm
 similar levels of expression of the G6b-B mutant, GPVI and CLEC-2 in the
 transfected cell lines to that in cells transfected with wild-type G6b-B and
 the two Y<italic>XX</italic>L-containing receptors (supplemental Fig. S2).</p>
      <p>Mutation of the two conserved tyrosines in the G6b-B ITIMs abolished the
 inhibitory effect of G6b-B against constitutive and agonist-induced activation
 of NFAT induced by GPVI-FcR Î³-chain and CLEC-2
 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), whereas mutation of
 either of the two tyrosines alone had a partial or neglible effect (not
 shown). In line with this, we were able to detect weak tyrosine
 phosphorylation of G6b-B in the DT40-transfected cells (not shown). These
 results demonstrate that G6b-B inhibits constitutive and agonist-induced
 signaling through the conserved tyrosines at positions 211 and 237.</p>
      <p>The ability of G6b-B to inhibit constitutive and agonist-induced responses
 mediated through GPVI-FcR Î³-chain and CLEC-2 was further investigated in
 the combined absence of the two SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases,
 SHP1 and SHP2, or in the absence of the 5â²-inositol phosphatase, SHIP.
 Unexpectedly, the absence of the two protein-tyrosine phosphatases led to an
 increase in the level of constitutive and agonist-induced NFAT activation
 through GPVI-FcR Î³-chain and CLEC-2, suggesting that both receptors are
 under dynamic inhibitory feedback through the two tyrosine phosphatases
 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>).
 Nevertheless, G6b-B was still able to inhibit constitutive and agonist-induced
 signaling through GPVI-FcR Î³-chain and CLEC-2 in the absence of SHP-1
 and SHP-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>).
 Indeed, the inhibitory action against rhodocytin was enhanced in the combined
 absence of SHP1 and SHP2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.
 5<italic>A</italic></xref>), although this may reflect the increased response to
 rhodocytin that is observed in the absence of the two protein-tyrosine
 phosphatases. G6b-B also inhibits constitutive and agonist-induced NFAT
 activation by GPVI-FcR Î³-chain and CLEC-2 in DT40 cells deficient in the
 SH2-domain-containing inositol 5â²-phosphatase (SHIP)
 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Indeed the
 inhibitory action of G6b-B against CLEC-2 was also enhanced by the absence of
 the 5â²-inositol phosphatase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.
 5<italic>B</italic></xref>), as was the case in the absence of SHP1 and SHP2.
 These results demonstrate that G6b-B inhibits GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling in
 DT40 cells by a SHP1/SHP2-independent and SHIP-independent mechanism.</p>

      <p><italic>Src and Syk Kinase-dependent Constitutive Signaling in
 Platelets</italic>âExperiments were designed to investigate whether there is
 evidence for constitutive signaling through Src and Syk kinases in platelets.
 In this context, it is important to emphasize that platelets express several
 classes of receptor that signal through Src and Syk tyrosine kinases,
 including the major platelet integrin, Î±IIbÎ²3, and the GPIb-IX-V
 complex, the levels of which are over 1 order of magnitude greater than that
 of GPVI-FcR Î³-chain and CLEC-2.</p>
      <p>We first asked the question as to whether the tyrosine phosphorylation that
 is seen in the absence of agonist stimulation in platelets is regulated by Src
 or Syk tyrosine kinases. Western blotting for phosphotyrosine using the
 monoclonal antibody 4G10 reveals the presence of a broad band of proteins in
 non-stimulated platelets of between 50 and 60 kDa
 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>), which
 covers the region of migration of Src family kinases. This region includes Src
 kinases, which are constitutively phosphorylated in resting platelets by the
 Src kinase-regulatory protein, Csk, at an inhibitory site that promotes
 intramolecular binding to the SH2 domain. In addition, several other proteins,
 which have been shown to be constitutively phosphorylated in nonstimulated
 platelets, migrate in this region, including Dok-2
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). Additional
 phosphorylation bands that lie outside of this region can also be seen in
 non-stimulated platelets in longer exposures, as illustrated in
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>. Tyrosine
 phosphorylation of the majority of these bands is markedly inhibited in the
 presence of the Src family kinase inhibitors, PP1 and PP2, and the Syk family
 kinase inhibitor, R406 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>),
 with the exception of the broad band of proteins that runs at 50â60 kDa,
 which is only partially reduced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.
 6<italic>A</italic></xref> and not shown). The residual phosphorylation that is
 seen in this region is likely to reflect phosphorylation of Src kinases on
 their inhibitory site by Csk. Significantly, Csk is not known to be regulated
 downstream of Src and Syk kinases. The reduction in phosphorylation in this
 region is presumably due to loss of phosphorylation of proteins such as Dok-2,
 as discussed above. The similar pattern of reduction in tyrosine
 phosphorylation that is induced by R406 to that of PP2 cannot be due to direct
 inhibition of Src kinases, as R406 does not inhibit collagen-stimulated
 tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR
 Î³-chain,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">5</xref> which
 is mediated through Src kinase activation. These results demonstrate that
 constitutive signaling by Src and Syk family kinases underlies tyrosine
 phosphorylation of the majority of proteins in non-stimulated platelets,
 thereby providing evidence of constitutive signaling by Src and Syk
 kinases.</p>
      <p>We used the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate, to further
 investigate the contribution of Src and Syk family kinases to constitutive
 tyrosine phosphorylation in human and mouse platelets, on the grounds that
 this would potentiate protein tyrosine phosphorylation by constitutively
 active tyrosine kinases. Results are shown for mouse platelets
 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>), with
 similar observations made for human platelets (not shown). As previously
 reported
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>),
 pervanadate induces a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a large
 number of proteins in platelets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.
 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Strikingly, protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced
 by pervanadate was dramatically inhibited in the presence of the Src kinase
 inhibitor, PP2, confirming that Src family kinases are the major family of
 kinases that contribute to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets.
 A small number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are seen in longer
 exposures of pervanadate-treated platelets in the presence of PP2, including a
 band of 72 kDa (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.
 6<italic>B</italic></xref>) that was identified as Syk by immunoprecipitation of
 the kinase and Western blotting for phosphotyrosine
 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). These data
 confirm that Src kinases are constitutively active in nonstimulated platelets
 and demonstrate that they underlie the major increase in tyrosine
 phosphorylation that is induced in the presence of protein-tyrosine
 phosphatase inhibition.</p>
      <p>Further experiments were designed to investigate the possible dependence of
 constitutive signaling through Src and Syk family kinases on the GPVI-FcR
 Î³-chain complex. For these experiments, Syk was immunoprecipitated from
 resting human platelets and Western blotted for phosphotyrosine in the absence
 and presence of the Src family kinase inhibitor, PD0173952. The results in
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref> demonstrate
 association of constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated Syk and constitutively
 tyrosine-phosphorylated FcR Î³-chain, which is dramatically reduced in
 the presence of the Src kinase inhibitor PD0173952. On the other hand,
 treatment of FcR Î³-chain-deficient mouse platelets with pervanadate
 revealed that constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation in mouse platelets is
 minimally altered in platelets deficient in the ITAM-containing protein
 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>),
 demonstrating that the GPVI-FcR Î³-chain complex makes a relatively minor
 contribution to the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation.</p>
      <p>Constitutive phosphorylation of CLEC-2 is observed in human platelets and
 is reduced in the presence of the Src kinase inhibitor, PP2
 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>). The
 contribution of CLEC-2 to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation in mouse
 platelets cannot be assessed, as mice lacking the C-type lectin receptor have
 not been made.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The present study demonstrates that the GPVI-FcR Î³-chain complex and
 CLEC-2 generate constitutive signals in transfected DT40 cells leading to NFAT
 activation with the degree of signaling corresponding to the level of
 expression. Furthermore, the dependence on Src and Syk family kinases provides
 strong evidence that constitutive signaling by both receptors is mediated
 through the same pathway as used by agonists to mediate activation. In line
 with this, constitutive signaling by CLEC-2 is inhibited by mutation of the
 conserved tyrosine in the Y<italic>XX</italic>L sequence in its cytosolic tail.
 Furthermore, the response to the GPVI-FcR Î³-chain complex is mediated by
 FcR Î³-chain, and is independent of GPVI, consistent with it being
 generated through the tandem Y<italic>XX</italic>L sequence of the FcR
 Î³-chain.</p>
      <p>Constitutive and agonist-induced signaling through GPVI-FcR Î³-chain
 and CLEC-2 is reduced by co-expression of the ITIM-containing platelet
 protein, G6b-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). The
 inhibitory effect of G6b-B is dependent on the conserved tyrosines in its two
 ITIMs, as shown by abolition of the inhibitory response upon mutation of the
 ITIM tyrosines to phenylalanine. However, unexpectedly, this inhibitory effect
 is retained in DT40 cells in the combined absence of the SH2 domain-containing
 tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, which have been shown to bind to G6b-B
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). The inhibitory effect of
 G6b-B is also retained in the absence of the SH2 domain-containing inositol
 phosphatase, SHIP, which has been shown to inhibit B cell receptor signaling
 through association with the FcÎ³RIIb ITIM
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). An alternative pathway of
 inhibition could be through recruitment of the SH2 domain-containing inhibitor
 of Src kinases, Csk, to the two ITIMs in G6b-B. Such a mechanism has been
 proposed to underlie the inhibition of FcÎµRI signaling by the
 ITIM-containing transmembrane protein, LAIR-1, in rat Rbl mast cells
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). However, we were unable
 to demonstrate association of Csk with G6b-B in transfected DT40 cells (not
 shown), possibly because of the low level of constitutive phosphorylation of
 the ITIM-containing protein. Access to Csk-deficient DT40 cells is required to
 directly test the role of the Src kinase regulatory protein in mediating the
 inhibitory effect of G6b-B. It is also possible that the inhibitory effect of
 G6b-B is mediated by association with several proteins, including a
 combination of SHP1, SHP2, SHIP, and Csk, such that loss of any one is
 compensated by expression of the others. Such a mechanism would explain why
 G6b-B is still able to mediate inhibition in DT40 cells deficient in SHP1 and
 SHP2, which have both been shown to bind to its cytosolic ITIMs.
 Interestingly, we observed a small reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of
 Syk by G6b-B in DT40 cells stimulated by collagen, suggesting that this
 underlies the inhibitory effect of the ITIM-containing protein.</p>
      <p>The observation that the FcR Î³-chain and CLEC-2 generate constitutive
 signals is in line with reports that ITAM receptors generate weak,
 constitutive signals in other hematopoietic cells. For example, in mouse
 thymocytes and peripheral T cells, there is limited constitutive
 phosphorylation of TCRÎ¶ chains leading to association with the
 Syk-related tyrosine kinase ZAP-70
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). This gives rise to
 constitutive signaling in resting mouse thymocyte and Jurkat T cell lines, as
 shown by suppression of <italic>RAG</italic> gene expression via extracellular
 signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Abl kinases, and prevention of further
 recombination of T cell receptor genes
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). The B cell antigen
 receptor also signals independently of ligand engagement and this provides
 functionally relevant signals in immature B lymphocytes
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>) and in diffuse large
 B-cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>).
 Significantly, this constitutive signaling is mediated through the B cell
 receptor ITAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>). Thus, constitutive
 signaling appears to be a common feature of Y<italic>XX</italic>L-containing
 receptors.</p>
      <p>Evidence of constitutive signaling through Src and Syk tyrosine kinases in
 platelets has been demonstrated in the present study in association with a low
 level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR Î³-chain and CLEC-2. Studies
 in mice deficient in the FcR Î³-chain demonstrate that the GPVI receptor
 complex makes only a minimal contribution to this phosphorylation, most likely
 because of the association of Src kinases with other surface receptors,
 including the Î±IIbÎ²3 complex that is expressed at over 20 times the
 level of GPVI.</p>
      <p>The demonstration of constitutive signaling via Src and Syk kinases in
 platelets emphasizes the need for inhibitory signals to oppose activation
 occurring in healthy vessels. We speculate that this function may be mediated,
 at least in part, by the ITIM receptor, G6b-B, which is markedly
 phosphorylated in resting platelets
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). The ligand for G6b-B is
 not known, but if this is expressed on platelets, it is possible that this may
 account for the high level of constitutive phosphorylation of G6b-B through a
 cis-interaction.</p>
      <p>A similar function to that of G6b-B may be mediated in platelets by the
 ITIM-containing receptor, PECAM-1. This is in line with studies that have
 reported inhibition of agonist-induced platelet activation by the
 immunoglobulin receptor
 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>).
 However, unexpectedly, we were unable to observe inhibition of constitutive
 and agonist-induced signaling by PECAM-1 in the DT40 cell line, possibly
 because of too low a level of expression.</p>
      <p>In summary, the present study reports that both FcR Î³-chain and
 CLEC-2 generate weak, sustained constitutive signals that are inhibited by
 co-expression with G6b-B. We speculate that this could represent an important
 physiological role of G6b-B and other platelet ITIM proteins in helping to
 prevent platelet activation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
