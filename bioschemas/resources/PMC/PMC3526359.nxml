        <p>Homozygous missense mutations in <italic>POLE1</italic> caused an inherited disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, immunodeficiency, livedo, and short stature.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>DNA polymerase Îµ (PolÎµ) is a large, four-subunit polymerase that is conserved throughout the eukaryotes. Its primary function is to synthesize DNA at the leading strand during replication. It is also involved in a wide variety of fundamental cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and DNA repair/recombination. Here, we report that a homozygous single base pair substitution in <italic>POLE1</italic> (<italic>polymerase Îµ 1</italic>), encoding the catalytic subunit of PolÎµ, caused facial dysmorphism, immunodeficiency, livedo, and short stature (âFILS syndromeâ) in a large, consanguineous family. The mutation resulted in alternative splicing in the conserved region of intron 34, which strongly decreased protein expression of PolÎµ1 and also to a lesser extent the PolÎµ2 subunit. We observed impairment in proliferation and G1- to S-phase progression in patientsâ T lymphocytes. PolÎµ1 depletion also impaired G1- to S-phase progression in B lymphocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. Our results evidence the developmental impact of a PolÎµ catalytic subunit deficiency in humans and its causal relationship with a newly recognized, inherited disorder.</p>

  <body><p>DNA polymerases are required for DNA synthesis. Mutations in DNA polymerases or changes in their expression could be manifested by alterations in DNA replication, in cell cycle progression, and most prominently, in mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Loeb and Monnat, 2008</xref>). Several different human diseases might present opportunities to identify disease-associated polymerase mutations and clarify their specific role and mechanisms. Mutations that have a strong effect on function of the canonical DNA polymerases would probably lead to early embryonal or fetal lethality. In contrast, partial loss of function or haploinsufficiency might lead to either multisystem, organ-specific, or cell lineageâspecific developmental defects or to the early exhaustion of continuously replicating cell lineages.</p><p>In this study, we describe a large, consanguineous family in which mild facial dysmorphism, immunodeficiency, livedo, and short stature were associated in 11 affected subjects with genomic mutation in <italic>POLE1</italic> (<italic>polymerase Îµ 1</italic>), resulting in haploinsufficiency. Of note, patients did not exhibit cancer susceptibility. The findings indicate that PolÎµ is primarily required for cell proliferation and early phase of cell cycle progression.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>FILS syndrome manifestations</title><p>11 members of a large, consanguineous French kindred displayed mild facial dysmorphism, immunodeficiency, livedo, and short stature (referred to by us as âFILS syndromeâ). Three additional members displayed two or three of these four features. The pedigree and clinical features of the family members investigated in the present study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20121303/DC1" id="supp1">Table S1</ext-link>. One affected individual (VI-11) has four children and so the syndrome is not associated with (male) infertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The patients had mild facial dysmorphism with malar hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and a high forehead. Livedo on the cheeks, forearms, and/or legs was present in all but one patient and noticed since birth in numbers of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). There was no ulceration. With increasing age, telangiectasia was observed on the cheeks. Patients were born at term with a normal gestational weight and length. Growth impairment was observed during early childhood and resulted in shortness of height in adulthood, though to varying degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The mean height of the unaffected siblings was around the 50th percentile. Growth hormone production and response were tested in three patients and found to be normal. The head circumference was normal in all but one patient (VI-3), and thus the FILS patients had a relative macrocephaly. Patients VI-3, VI-11, and VI-29 had bone dysplasia and suffered from pain in the extremities; lacunar bone lesions, cortical thickening, and modeling defects at the long bone diaphyses were found in the three patients, whereas striae in the metaphyses were observed in patient VI-3 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Pedigree and clinical manifestations in patients with the FILS phenotype.</bold> (A) Pedigree of the family with FILS.

Patient J* died during a pulmonary infection at the age of 2 yr. Immunological experiments of the patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; and Table S1) showed decreased IgM and IgG2 levels, reduced isohemagglutinin titers, and a predominant lack of antibodies to polysaccharide antigens. Patients had low memory (CD27<sup>+</sup>) B cell counts, but the proportion of switched B cells (Î¼-Î´-) and nonswitched memory B cells were equally affected. The IgM, IgG, and IgA B cell repertoires in blood lymphocytes performed in one patient (VII-1) showed a normal distribution of VH family usage (not depicted). B cell proliferation and switch to IgE production were normal upon stimulation with IL-4 and CD40 ligand in vitro (not depicted). In addition, several patients had low naive T cell counts and decreased T cell proliferation (Table S1). Immunoscope analysis of T cells in one patient (VII-1) showed a normally diversified TCR VÎ² repertoire (not depicted). Allergies, autoimmunity, opportunistic infections, and malignancies were not observed in these patients.

Exome sequencing in one of the patients (VI-28) also identified this substitution and showed that <italic>POLE1</italic> was the only mutated gene within the defined genetic linkage region on chromosome 12q. All tested parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The mutation was absent from control populations, in-house exome sequencing data, and all publically available databases (including the dbSNP129 and 1000 Genomes datasets).

Using primers located in exons 32 and 37 (which thus flanked intron 34), two PCR products were separated on agarose gels from homozygous and heterozygous individuals (six patients and three parents), whereas a single band was found in control individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Sequencing of the smaller PCR product (predominant in the patients) identified a <italic>POLE1</italic> species lacking exon 34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Sequencing of the larger PCR product identified WT <italic>POLE1</italic> sequence in control samples and the parentsâ samples and a mixed sequence in the patientsâ samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). After amplifying and cloning the upper band from two patients (VI-39 and VII-1), we found (a) a WT sequence in 63% of 46 clones and (b) deletion of exon 34 in 30% of them. Two other clones had different frame-shifted insertions and deletions. Thus, individuals with the g.G4444+3 A&gt;G substitution have two major <italic>POLE1</italic> transcripts: WT and exon 34 deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The proportion of the WT <italic>POLE1</italic> transcript in T lymphoblasts was significantly lower in patients (by around 90%) than in control individuals, whereas the total overall amount of <italic>POLE1</italic> transcripts did not differ significantly as determined by quantitative PCR. These data confirm that the major transcript in FILS patients was exon 34 del <italic>POLE1</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Impaired expression of POLÎµ1 and POLÎµ2</title><p>The 49 coding exons of <italic>POLE1</italic> are translated into a 2,286-residue protein. It comprises a large N-terminal catalytic domain with exonuclease and polymerase motifs and a C-terminal domain containing binding sites for the small subunits of the PolÎµ holoenzyme. Deletion of <italic>POLE1</italic> exon 34 would lead to a subsequent frame shift (from S1483V onwards) and a premature stop codon at position 1561 in the new protein, which would thus lack the C-terminal half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). However, we could not detect any truncated protein in lymphocyte samples (from five patients and three heterozygous individuals). In contrast, severely decreased expression of full-length PolÎµ1 was found in the patients and, to a lesser extent, in the heterozygous individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). In addition to PolÎµ1, the PolÎµ holoenzyme comprises three additional subunits: PolÎµ2, PolÎµ3, and PolÎµ4. It has been assumed that PolÎµ2 stabilizes the catalytic PolÎµ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 1997</xref>). PolÎµ2, PolÎµ3, and PolÎµ4 also interact with other proteins and with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dua et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Shikata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bermudez et al., 2011</xref>) and are thus likely to influence the holoenzymeâs functional state. We therefore investigated the expression of the other three PolÎµ subunits. There were no significant differences between patients and controls in terms of the transcript levels of <italic>POLE2</italic>, <italic>POLE3</italic>, and <italic>POLE4</italic> (not depicted). In contrast, protein expression of PolÎµ2 was found to be abnormally low, supporting a role in turn of the catalytic subunit in stabilizing PolÎµ2 (not depicted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 1997</xref>). Protein expression of PolÎµ3 was normal (not depicted). Protein expression of PolÎµ2 was also subnormal in heterozygous individuals but was not as low as in the patients (not depicted).</p></sec><sec><title>Impaired proliferation and cell cycle progression of PolÎµ-deficient cells</title><p>In eukaryotes, DNA polymerases Î±, Î´, and Îµ jointly enable DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hubscher et al., 2002</xref>). DNA replication is initiated by the PolÎ±âprimase complex, which synthesizes short, primed templates. Next, PolÎµ and PolÎ´ tether to primed templates and are thought to replicate the leading and lagging strands, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Loeb and Monnat, 2008</xref>). To assess the <italic>POLE1</italic> mutationâs cellular consequences, we used a sequential CFSE dilution assay to analyze the T lymphocytesâ ability to proliferate in response to anti-CD3 and IL-2 stimulation. In contrast, to control lymphocytes, a significant proportion of the patientsâ T lymphocytes had not divided at day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). This was not a consequence of defective cell activation or elevated cell death because the proportion of CD25- and annexin-Vâpositive cells, respectively, were similar in cell samples from patients and controls (not depicted). We next looked at whether low PolÎµ1 levels modified the cell cycle progression. A cell cycle distribution analysis was performed using propidium iodide and 5-ethyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling in primary T lymphoblasts from seven patients and in a lymphoblastoid B cell line (LBL) from patient VI-29. We observed a strikingly higher proportion of Gap 1 (G1)âphase nuclei in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes from the patients and a corresponding lower proportion of synthesis (S)-phase nuclei, when compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the patient VI-29 LBL, whereas LBL from a heterozygous subject (V-9) displayed an intermediate phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). This phenotype was dramatically exacerbated when the residual level of PolÎµ1 protein expressed in VI-29 LBL cells was reduced further by <italic>POLE1</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). Thus, the observed phenotype correlated with the extent of <italic>POLE1</italic> transcript depletion. Given the short stature displayed by the patients affected by FILS syndrome and the bone anomalies observed in some of the individuals, we also looked at whether <italic>POLE1</italic> depletion also affected cell cycle progression in chondrocyte and osteoblast cell lines. Indeed, a similar impairment in the G1- to S-phase transition was observed in both cell lines after PolÎµ1 depletion with a specific shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref> and not depicted). To determine whether <italic>POLE1</italic> was sufficient to explain the patientsâ functional defects, we reconstituted <italic>POLE1</italic> expression by lentiviral transduction of patient LBLs. WT <italic>POLE1</italic> expression in the patient LBLs restored S-phase progression to a level similar to the one observed in control LBLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>).

We investigated the distribution of <italic>POLE1</italic> and <italic>POLD</italic> transcript expression in various human cell types and found that the relative expression of <italic>POLE1</italic> to <italic>POLD</italic> was higher in PBMCs, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, B cells, and testis cells than in the other cell types analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 H</xref>). This differential expression may contribute to the tissue-specific consequences of the low PolÎµ1 levels found in affected individuals. Of note, <italic>POLE1</italic> is much higher expressed in B lymphocytes than in T lymphocytes, which may account for the more sever B cell than T cell defect that characterized the patientsâ phenotype.

The splice mutation observed here was associated with residual expression of â¼10% of normal protein levels. Affected family members do not exhibit cancer susceptibility. Nonetheless, FILS patients had congenital abnormalities, including mild facial dysmorphic features, immunodeficiency, livedo, and short stature. Decreased expression of PolÎµ1 primarily results in alteration of the cell cycle kinetics, with a prolonged G1 phase, delayed S-phase entry, and thus restricted cell proliferation. This phenotype was observed in all cell types tested, including the T and B lymphocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts that strongly express PolÎµ1 and are relevant to the manifestations in FILS syndrome. We found that PolÎµ1 promotes S-phase entry in these cells, rather than S-phase progression as previously reported in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bermudez et al., 2011</xref>). Although residual PolÎµ1 protein expression and the potential redundancy with PolÎ´ function may explain the partially preserved cell growth, a partial PolÎµ1 deficiency appears to have important developmental consequences. Further studies are needed to provide details of the mechanisms by which lymphocytes, mostly B lymphocytes, cartilage, and bone cells (chondrocytes and osteoblasts) and possibly endothelial cells are affected by low PolÎµ1 protein levels. These findings suggest that patients with a FILS phenotype could be usefully screened for mutations in the genes encoding PolÎµ1 and the other subunits of the PolÎµ complex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>SNP linkage analysis and sequence analysis.</title><p>Genomic DNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction.
