        <p>The FERM domainâcontaining protein Lulu2 and p114RhoGEF function at epithelial cellâcell junctions to regulate the actomyosin belt that determines cell shape.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Myosin IIâdriven mechanical forces control epithelial cell shape and morphogenesis. In particular, the circumferential actomyosin belt, which is located along apical cellâcell junctions, regulates many cellular processes. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms regulating the belt are not fully understood. In this paper, we characterize Lulu2, a FERM (4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domainâcontaining molecule homologous to <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Yurt, as an important regulator. In epithelial cells, Lulu2 is localized along apical cellâcell boundaries, and Lulu2 depletion by ribonucleic acid interference results in disorganization of the circumferential actomyosin belt. In its regulation of the belt, Lulu2 interacts with and activates p114RhoGEF, a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchanging factor (GEF), at apical cellâcell junctions. This interaction is negatively regulated via phosphorylation events in the FERM-adjacent domain of Lulu2 catalyzed by atypical protein kinase C. We further found that Patj, an apical cell polarity regulator, recruits p114RhoGEF to apical cellâcell boundaries via PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domainâmediated interaction. These findings therefore reveal a novel molecular system regulating the circumferential actomyosin belt in epithelial cells.</p>

The forces themselves are mainly generated by an F-actinâmyosin II bundle called the circumferential actomyosin belt, which is positioned in the apical portion of the cells as a ringlike structure along apical cellâcell junctions (tight and adherens junctions in vertebrates; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Owaribe et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamazaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>). Recent studies identified some molecular pathways regulating this: for example, the RhoâRock and Rap1 pathways were reported to be responsible for proper organization of myosin II isoforms along apical cellâcell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>). As another example, shroom3 was reported to regulate myosin II activity by recruiting Rock to apical cellâcell junctions, thereby inducing apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008</xref>). E-cadherin, an adherens junctional component, is required for proper organization of the circumferential actomyosin belt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yano et al., 2011</xref>). ZO-1 and ZO-2, tight junctional components, are also required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamazaki et al., 2008</xref>); however, the detailed molecular network regulating the circumferential actomyosin belt is not completely understood.</p><p>Our previous study demonstrated that Lulu1 and 2 (also known as Epb41l5 and Epb41l4b/Ehm2, respectively) are potent activators of cortical myosin II contractile forces in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakajima and Tanoue, 2010</xref>). They commonly have a FERM (4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin) and a FERM-adjacent (FA) domain, although other portions beyond these domains do not resemble each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shimizu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hirano et al., 2008</xref>). From sequence similarity, Lulus are thought to be mammalian counterparts of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Yurt, which was reported to be a negative regulator of apical membrane size in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hoover and Bryant, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Laprise et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2009</xref>). This Yurt activity was attributed to its negative regulation of Crumbs, which are apical membrane regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Laprise et al., 2006</xref>). Zebrafish Moe, the sole Lulu molecule in the species, participates in layering of the retina and inflation of the brain ventricles as well as restricting the photoreceptor apical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jensen and Westerfield, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hsu et al., 2006</xref>). Moe also interacts with and negatively regulates Crumbs, thereby restricting apical membrane size in epithelial structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hsu et al., 2006</xref>). Mammalian Lulus, however, regulate myosin II activity rather than Crumbs activity: overexpression of Lulu1 or 2 in epithelial cells resulted in strong accumulation of F-actin and myosin II along apical cellâcell junctions, thereby inducing apical constriction in the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakajima and Tanoue, 2010</xref>). This activity of Lulu2 is much higher than that of Lulu1; therefore, Lulu2 is a good candidate molecule regulating the circumferential actomyosin belt. However, we did not explore the detailed molecular mechanisms of Lulu2 activity in the previous study, and here, we further study Lulu2 from cellular and molecular aspects.</p><p>We report that Lulu2 is a regulator of the circumferential actomyosin belt in epithelial cells. Lulu2 accumulates along apical cellâcell boundaries, overlapping ZO-1, and its depletion results in disorganization of the circumferential actomyosin belt. Lulu2 interacts with and activates the catalytic activity of p114RhoGEF, a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchanging factor (GEF), at apical cellâcell boundaries, thereby regulating the integrity of the circumferential actomyosin belt. In addition, Lulu2 is negatively regulated in terms of its binding ability to p114RhoGEF by phosphorylation in the FA domain, which is catalyzed by atypical PKC (aPKC). We further show that p114RhoGEF is recruited to apical cellâcell boundaries by Patj, an apicobasal cell polarity regulator. We thus propose that this Lulu2-p114RhoGEF system regulates the circumferential actomyosin belt in epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Lulu2 accumulates along apical cellâcell boundaries overlapping ZO-1 and regulates the circumferential actomyosin belt in epithelial cells</title><p>We began by examining the localization of endogenous Lulu2 in DLD-1 cells, which exhibit the characteristic morphology of polarized epithelial cells with a well-developed circumferential actomyosin belt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201104118/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1</ext-link>), and found that Lulu2 accumulated along apical cellâcell boundaries, overlapping ZO-1, a tight junctional marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201104118/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2, AâD</ext-link>, for the specificity of the antibody). Lulu2 was also detected in the cytoplasm as dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), which we did not characterize further in this study. In addition, as DLD-1 cells mainly express the short form of Lulu2 (unpublished data), it was used in this study.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Lulu2 accumulates along apical cellâcell boundaries and regulates the circumferential actomyosin belt.</bold> (A) DLD-1 cells doubly immunostained for Lulu2 and ZO-1.

Throughout this study, we routinely confirmed the results of all the RNAi experiments by using two different siRNAs targeting each molecule, although we present the data of one siRNA for one molecule to avoid redundancy. Control RNAi cells exhibited a well-developed circumferential actomyosin belt, indicated by staining for F-actin and myosin IIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In Lulu2-depleted cells, in contrast, it became significantly thin with concomitant loss of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) from cellâcell boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These Lulu2-depleted cells, however, retained an apparently normal tight junction marked by ZO-1 staining, although cellâcell borders located by the staining became overly bent and less strained in Lulu2-depleted cells than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). This might have been caused by loss of apical tension generated by the circumferential actomyosin belt in Lulu2-depleted cells. In addition, other tight junctional molecules, including ZO-2, cingulin, Par3, and Patj, also apparently accumulated normally along cellâcell boundaries, further suggesting that Lulu2 might not regulate the localization of tight junctional molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and not depicted). In accordance with other studies that state the circumferential actomyosin belt regulates adherens junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ivanov et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shewan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miyake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>), in Lulu2-depleted cells, Î²-catenin, a component of adherens junction, became discontinuously localized at the level of zonula adherens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). These results indicate that Lulu2 accumulates along apical cellâcell boundaries and regulates the circumferential actomyosin belt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Lulu2 interacts with p114RhoGEF</title><p>To understand the molecular mechanism downstream of Lulu2, we screened for interacting molecules by a GST pull-down assay using a GST-fused Lulu2 FERM-FA followed by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, FERM-FA). Adaptin Î´, HSP70, ribosomal protein L4, CWC22 splicing factor, heterogeneous nuclear riboprotein U, and p114RhoGEF were identified by MS/MS (unpublished data). Among them, we focused on p114RhoGEF, as it is a Rho-specific Dbl family RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nagata and Inagaki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsuji et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terry et al., 2011</xref>), a good candidate molecule downstream of Lulu2. We first confirmed this MS/MS result by immunoblotting using a specific antibody for p114RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201104118/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S3, AâD</ext-link>, for the specificity of the antibody). By narrowing down the region of Lulu2 for binding to p114RhoGEF, we identified the FERM domain to be necessary and sufficient for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201104118/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S4 B</ext-link>). In this study, we mainly used MDCK cells to examine interactions of exogenously expressed molecules because MDCK cells are more efficiently transfected with plasmids than DLD-1 cells, and MDCK cells are expected to have components for Lulu2 to function because Lulu2 induces strong apical constriction in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakajima and Tanoue, 2010</xref>). The interaction between Myc-tagged full-length Lulu2 and Flag-tagged full-length p114RhoGEF was also detected by a coexpression and coimmunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous p114RhoGEF was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Lulu2 in DLD-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and Fig. S2, E and F). Recently, it was reported that p114RhoGEF regulates RhoA activity at apical cellâcell junctions in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terry et al., 2011</xref>). We then examined the localization of p114RhoGEF in DLD-1 cells and found it to be well colocalized with Lulu2 along apical cellâcell boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). We further tested the interaction between endogenous Lulu2 and p114RhoGEF along cellâcell boundaries by an in situ proximity ligation assay. The ligation signals were detected at cellâcell boundaries overlapping ZO-1, suggesting that Lulu2 might interact with p114RhoGEF there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). These results combined indicate that Lulu2 might interact with p114RhoGEF along apical cellâcell boundaries in epithelial cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Lulu2 interacts with p114RhoGEF.</bold> (A, top schematic) Lulu2 has a FERM and a FERM adjacent (FA) domain.

From sequence similarity, p114RhoGEF and three other Dbl RhoGEFs, p190 RhoGEF, AKAP13/Lbc, and GEF-H1, form a subfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt and Hall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">GarcÃ­a-Mata and Burridge, 2007</xref>). To narrow down the region of p114RhoGEF interacting with Lulu2, we tested various truncated mutants of p114RhoGEF for binding to Lulu2 by GST pull-down assays using GST-FERM and identified that the region C terminal to the coiled-coil region without the PBM (C4ÎPBM) was necessary and sufficient for interacting with Lulu2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

In p114RhoGEF-depleted DLD-1 cells, the circumferential actomyosin belt was severely disorganized because accumulation of F-actin, myosin IIA, and phospho-MRLC along apical cellâcell junctions was markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). ZO-1 accumulation was not affected by p114RhoGEF depletion, although cellâcell borders became overly bent and less strained as was the case with Lulu2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>). These results indicate that p114RhoGEF is a regulator of the circumferential actomyosin belt. As p114RhoGEF is a Rho-specific GEF, we postulated that it might be regulated by Lulu2.</p></sec><sec><title>Catalytic activity of p114RhoGEF is up-regulated by Lulu2 in vitro</title><p>The next question was therefore how Lulu2 regulates p114RhoGEF. Because Lulu2 depletion by RNAi in DLD-1 cells did not markedly reduce the accumulation of p114RhoGEF at cellâcell boundaries (unpublished data), Lulu2 might not target it there. We thus hypothesized that Lulu2 might enhance the catalytic activity of p114RhoGEF. To test this idea, we measured the catalytic activity of p114RhoGEF in the presence or absence of Lulu2 in vitro. As both full-length Lulu2 and p114RhoGEF proteins were hardly obtained in bacteria, we prepared full-length proteins from lysates of MDCK cells expressing Myc-Lulu2 or Flag-p114RhoGEF by immunoprecipitation with antibodies for the tags followed by elution with peptides for the tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>).

When p114RhoGEF was mixed with Lulu2 in the assay, its GEF activity was up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>), suggesting that Lulu2 activates p114RhoGEF. Although further structural studies, such as determination of the three-dimensional structures of both molecules in a complex, are needed, we can speculate here that the binding of Lulu2 might cause some conformational change in p114RhoGEF to enhance its catalytic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>The PBM of p114RhoGEF is required for targeting of p114RhoGEF to apical cellâcell boundaries</title><p>Because Lulu2 does not recruit p114RhoGEF to apical cellâcell boundaries, we next investigated the targeting mechanism of p114RhoGEF there. We first roughly mapped the region of p114RhoGEF required for its localization at apical cellâcell boundaries in DLD-1 cells. The full-length and C-terminal portion were recruited to apical cellâcell boundaries marked by ZO-1 staining, whereas the N-terminal portion was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). We thus considered that a potential PBM in its C-terminal tail might be responsible for its targeting and tested this possibility. It was found that the mutant form of p114RhoGEF that lacks the potential PBM was not recruited to apical cellâcell boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>).

Among them, it was found that Patj and Par3, well-known apical cell polarity regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki and Ohno, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Goldstein and Macara, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AssÃ©mat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martin-Belmonte and Mostov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pieczynski and Margolis, 2011</xref>), bound to the C2 fragment (Fig. S4 A). The former has 10 PDZ domains, and the latter has three PDZ domains. Both Myc-tagged Patj and Par3 expressed in the cells efficiently bound to the C2 fragment of p114RhoGEF, and these interactions depended on the putative PBM of p114RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref> and Fig. S4 B). To know which molecule actually targets p114RhoGEF in the cells, we examined the relationship among p114RhoGEF, Patj, and Par3 in terms of their localization. As previously reported in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lemmers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2009</xref>), in DLD-1 cells, both Patj and Par3 overlap ZO-1 (unpublished data). In Patj-depleted cells, continuous ZO-1 staining was not affected, whereas it became partially fragmented in Par3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref> and Fig. S3, F, G, I, and J, RNAi). In both Par3- and Patj-depleted cells, p114RhoGEF mostly disappeared from cellâcell boundaries marked by ZO-1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). In Patj-depleted cells, Par3 localization was not altered: Par3 still overlaps ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). However, in Par3-depleted cells, Patj disappeared from cellâcell boundaries where ZO-1 accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). These results suggest that Par3 is upstream of Patj, and Patj is upstream of p114RhoGEF in terms of accumulation at cellâcell boundaries. In addition, the total expression level of p114RhoGEF protein was not affected by Patj depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>), indicating that the delocalization of p114RhoGEF in Patj-depleted cells is not caused by down-regulation of the total protein level of p114RhoGEF. The interaction between GFP-tagged full-length p114RhoGEF and Myc-tagged full-length Patj was detected in a coimmunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 F</xref>). This interaction, as expected, required the C-terminal PBM of p114RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 F</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous p114RhoGEF was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Patj (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 G</xref>).

One of the main findings of our present study is that Lulu2 interacts with and activates p114RhoGEF in its regulation of the circumferential actomyosin belt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). p114RhoGEF was recently shown to be an essential regulator of RhoA at apical junctions: it activates RhoA at apical junctions, thereby regulating the circumferential actomyosin belt and participating in tight junction formation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terry et al., 2011</xref>). Our results here also confirm the importance of p114RhoGEF in organization of the circumferential actomyosin belt. Its role in tight junction organization, however, might be cell-type dependent: without Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch, p114RhoGEF depletion resulted in disruption of tight junctions in human corneal epithelial cells but not in Caco2 and DLD-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terry et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of Lulu2 involvement in regulation of the circumferential actomyosin belt.</bold> Lulu2 activates p114RhoGEF, thereby regulating the circumferential actomyosin belt.

Recently, it was also reported that p114RhoGEF forms a complex with cingulin, myosin II, and Rock II and regulates RhoA activity at apical cellâcell junctions in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terry et al., 2011</xref>). Of note, cingulin interacts with the PH domain of p114RhoGEF at apical cellâcell boundaries in epithelial cells, and its depletion resulted in delocalization of p114RhoGEF from there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terry et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, our results show that p114RhoGEF might be recruited to apical cellâcell boundaries by Patj via PDZ domainâmediated interaction; therefore, Patj and cingulin might cooperatively recruit p114RhoGEF to apical cellâcell boundaries in an as yet unknown fashion. Other known p114RhoGEF-interacting molecules also could interact with and regulate p114RhoGEF at apical cellâcell boundaries in epithelial cells, although these possibilities have not been tested yet. Furthermore, Patj, which has 10 PDZ domains, also has several interacting molecules, including Pals1, angiomotin, JAM1, ZO-3, nectins, and Par6, at apical cellâcell boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lemmers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hurd et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Michel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wells et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Massey-Harroche et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sugihara-Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2009</xref>). We can thus speculate that there might exist a large molecular complex containing p114RhoGEF at apical cellâcell boundaries and that the components of the complex might cooperatively regulate p114RhoGEF depending on cellular conditions. Our results here show that Lulu2 up-regulates the activity of p114RhoGEF by binding to it. Considering the aforementioned possible complex regulation of p114RhoGEF in the cells, Lulu2, however, might not only activate p114RhoGEF through the simple interaction shown here but also cooperatively regulate it with other unidentified regulators. Therefore, comprehensive identification and characterization of the possible large molecular machinery containing p114RhoGEF and Patj are needed in our future study to fully understand the molecular mechanisms regulating the circumferential actomyosin belt.</p><p>FERM domainâcontaining molecules are also generally thought to play multiple roles and have several interacting molecules according to the cellular processes in which they participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tepass, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Fehon et al., 2010</xref>). Lulu2 might also participate in other cellular processes besides the regulation of the circumferential actomyosin belt. Supporting this notion, Lulu2 is detected not only along apical cellâcell boundaries but also in the cytoplasm as dots, and our screening for interacting molecules of Lulu2 also identified several molecules besides p114RhoGEF, although we did not confirm these interactions in this study. Lulu2 could regulate or be regulated by these molecules in as yet unidentified cellular processes. Although we cannot therefore exclude from our results the possibility that other unidentified binding partners of Lulu2 in addition to p114RhoGEF could also participate in the regulation of the circumferential actomyosin belt, we can conclude that p114RhoGEF is the major downstream target of Lulu2 in the regulation of the circumferential actomyosin belt.</p><p>At apical cellâcell boundaries, Lulu2 interacts with p114RhoGEF and p114RhoGEF interacts with Patj. However, Lulu2 is not likely to form such a tight molecular complex with p114RhoGEF that regulates the localization of Lulu2: p114RhoGEF depletion did not alter Lulu2 localization and vice versa. Lulu2 therefore might be recruited to apical cellâcell boundaries by an as yet unidentified molecule/mechanism and associate with, but not be anchored by, p114RhoGEF at apical cellâcell boundaries.</p><p>The circumferential actomyosin belt is positioned along the apical cellâcell boundaries, close to both the zonula adherens and tight junction, although the majority of the actomyosin fibers are localized near the zonula adherens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ivanov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamazaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>). Our results show that Patj and aPKC, both known to accumulate at the level of the tight junction, not the zonula adherens, regulate the circumferential actomyosin belt. It was also reported that ZO-1 and ZO-2, scaffolding molecules at the tight junction, are required for proper organization of the circumferential actomyosin belt and the zonula adherens as well as the tight junction itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamazaki et al., 2008</xref>). It could thus be speculated that molecules associated with the tight junction might regulate the proper organization of the circumferential actomyosin belt. On the other hand, E-cadherin, the main component of the zonula adherens, also regulates the circumferential actomyosin belt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shewan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, the circumferential actomyosin belt also regulates proper organization of the zonula adherens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shewan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ivanov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the formation and maintenance of these three structures, the tight junction, zonula adherens, and the circumferential actomyosin belt, are obviously mutually dependent. Temporal and spatial fine regulations thus should exist to properly regulate their organization. Studying the Lulu2-p114RhoGEF system in more detail might contribute to understanding the regulation of these pivotal architectures in polarized epithelial cells.</p><p>The circumferential actomyosin belt serves as a major generator of mechanical force during animal morphogenesis. Accordingly, it should not be a static structure but rather dynamic and flexible. Several signaling pathways might regulate it at an appropriate time and place. From this viewpoint, our findings concerning phosphorylation-mediated Lulu2 regulation might be of importance. We found that aPKC, an apicobasal cell polarity regulator, phosphorylates and negatively regulates Lulu2. In accordance with our results, it was also reported that aPKC antagonizes myosin II activity of the circumferential actomyosin belt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mashukova et al., 2011</xref>). To establish the epithelial cell structure, regulation of the circumferential actomyosin belt and apicobasal cell polarity might not be independent but interdependent events. The aPKCâLulu2 pathway might thus be one of the connections between these two cellular processes. In the regulation of myosin II activity of the belt, Lulu2 is obviously not a sole target of aPKC. It was recently reported that aPKC phosphorylates and inhibits Rock1 from accumulating to the apical junctions, thereby negatively regulating myosin II activity of the belt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ishiuchi and Takeichi, 2011</xref>). How these two systems, aPKCâLulu2-p114RhoGEF and aPKC-Rock1, are spatiotemporally regulated might be an interesting future problem to be addressed. In addition, we found that conventional PKC and PKA also phosphorylate the FA domain of Lulu2, although we did not explore the functional relevance of these phosphorylations in this study. Because both kinases are downstream of several extracellular stimuli, it would be important to identify the stimuli that lead to the phosphorylation of Lulu2 by these kinases in future studies.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated here that the Lulu2-p114RhoGEF system is a regulator of the circumferential actomyosin belt. We further showed that aPKC and Patj, apical cell polarity regulators, regulate the circumferential actomyosin belt through the Lulu2-p114RhoGEF system, at least in part. Elucidating the more detailed mechanisms regulating the Lulu2-p114RhoGEF system is a future important challenge to understand epithelial cell shape regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and immunostaining</title><p>MDCK cells (Tet-Off; Takara Bio Inc.) and DLD-1 cells, human colon epithelial cells, were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DME and Hamâs F12 medium (Wako Chemicals USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

The guanine nucleotide exchange reaction was monitored as an increase in fluorescence, which is indicative of the binding of <italic>N</italic>-methylanthraniloylâGTP to GST-RhoA.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>P-values were calculated by Studentâs <italic>t</italic> test using Excel (Microsoft).</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows that DLD-1 cells exhibit the characteristic morphology of polarized epithelial cells with a well-developed circumferential actomyosin belt. Fig. S2 shows the characterization of the anti-Lulu2 antibodies and the efficiency of Lulu2 RNAi. Fig. S3 shows the characterization of the anti-p114RhoGEF antibody and the efficiencies of the p114RhoGEF, Patj, Par3, and aPKC RNAi. Fig. S4 shows the CBB images of the bacterially expressed proteins and that Patj and Par3 bound to the C2 region among several PDZ molecules, p114RhoGEF C4ÎPBM bound to Lulu2 FERM in vitro, and PKA and PKC-Î±, but not CKI-Îµ, also phosphorylated Lulu2. Fig. S5 shows that exogenously expressed wild-type Lulu2 and Lulu2 4A accumulated along apical cellâcell boundaries, whereas Lulu2 4E did not.
