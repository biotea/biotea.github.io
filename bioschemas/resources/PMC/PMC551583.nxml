      <abstract>
        <p>Using differential display RT-PCR, we identified a gene of
2750âbp from human adult testis, named <italic>H-Lse</italic>, which
encoded a putative protein of 523 amino acids and molecular
weight of 58âkd with structural characteristics similar to
that of mouse lysosome sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase.
Northern blot analysis showed a widespread distribution of H-Lse
in various human tissues with high expression in the testis,
prostate, and colon. In situ hybridization results showed that
while H-Lse was not detected in embryonic testis, positive
signals were found in spermatocytes but not spermatogonia in
adult testis of human. The subcellular localization of H-Lse was
visualized by green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the amino
terminus of H-Lse, showing compartmentalization of H-Lse in large
dense-core vesicles, presumably lysosomes, in the cytoplasm. The
developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage-specific
expression of H-Lse suggests its possible involvement in the
development of the testis and/or differentiation of germ cells.</p>

    <sec sec-type="INTRODUCTION">
      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Sialic acids are a diverse family of acidic nine-carbon sugars
that are frequently found as terminal units of oligosaccharide
chains on different glycoconjugates in higher invertebrates and
vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As a part of determinants in many
glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], sialic acids play an important role in
intercellular and/or intermolecular recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The
9-O-acetylation and de-O-acetylation are the most common
modifications of sialic acids found in mammalian cell surface
sialoglycoconjugates, which can alter its size, hydrophobicity,
net charge, and antigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These modifications can
regulate a variety of biological phenomena, including endogenous
lectin recognition, tumor antigenicity, virus binding, and
complement activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>Enzymes specifically capable of removing O-acetyl esters from the
9-position of sialic acids are sialic-acid-specific
9-O-acetylesterase. The enzymes in mammals have two forms, one is
cytosolic sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase (Cse) in the
cytosolic fraction and another is lysosome sialic-acid-specific
9-O-acetylesterase (Lse) in the lysosomal/endosomal compartment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Lse is likely to participate in the terminal lysosomal
degradation of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates, while Cse is
likely to salvage any 9-O-acetylated molecules that escape the
initial action of the Lse enzyme. The process of de-O-acetylation
of sialic acid, which is catalyzed by sialic-acid-specific
9-O-acetylesterase, has been implicated in organogenesis and
cellular differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Spermatogenesis is a complicated process of germ cell
differentiation in adult testis, which is established during
testicular development. There are five types of germ cells, each
at a specific developmental stage, found in the seminiferous
tubules: spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary
spermatocytes, spermatids and sperms. They can be divided into
three groups according to their DNA content: 4N DNA content cells
(4C cells), 2N DNA content cells (2C cells), and 1N DNA content
cells (1C cells). The separation of these cells enables
researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying
testicular development and/or spermatogenesis. In the present
study, we separated the 2C and 4C cells of seminiferous tubules
in human adult testis by flow cytometry, and identified human
H-Lse by differential display RT-PCR. The expression pattern of
H-Lse was found to be developmentally regulated and
stage-specific, indicating its possible role in testicular
development and/or germ cell differentiation.</p>

        <p>To examine a possible role of H-Lse in testicular development
and/or spermatogenesis, in situ hybridization experiments were
conducted to compare H-Lse expression in human embryonic and

results showed that no signal was detected in the embryonic
testis, while positive signals were detected in spermatocytes but
not spermatogonia in the seminiferous tubules of adult testis.
Signals were associated with germ cells but not other somatic
cells in the testis, that is, Sertoli and Leydig cells. Negative

    <sec sec-type="DISCUSSION">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Spermatogenesis is a developmental program that occurs in
mitotic, meiotic, and postmeiotic phases. In the mitotic phase,
spermatogonia proliferate to expand the quantity of germ cells;
in the meiotic phase, spermatocytes accomplish chromosomal
synapsis and genetic recombination before two meiotic divisions;
and in the postmeiotic phase, haploid spermatids are remodeled
into spermatozoa by the processes of acrosome formation, nuclear
condensation, flagellar development, and loss of the majority of
cytoplasm. Under the control of intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
spermatogenesis is characterized by the expression of a spectrum
of genes that are cell-type-specific or stage-specific. They are
thought to play an essential role in spermatogenesis at
particular stages. For example, <italic>MutS homologue 5</italic> is

      <p>In the present study, we have identified a gene, <italic>H-Lse</italic>,
from human adult testis with high
homology to mouse <italic>Lse</italic>. The subcellular localization of
GFP-H-Lse fusion protein showed that H-Lse is concentrated in
vesicle-like structures in the cytoplasm, presumably the
lysosomes, indicating that H-Lse is likely to be the lysosome
form of sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase. However, our
northern blot analysis shows transcripts of different sizes with
different tissue distributions. They may be the tissue-specific
transcripts of H-Lse since others have reported that there are
multiple transcripts of mouse sialic-acid-specific
9-O-acetylesterase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The wide distribution of the
 expected transcript of H-Lse, approximately
2.7âkbp,  in all tissues examined suggests an
essential role of H-Lse in cellular functions.</p>
      <p>As the most common modification  of sialic acids found in
mammalian cell surface sialoglycoconjugates, 9-O-acetylation and
de-O-acetylation play an important role in the transition of
antigenicity and transformation of intercellular cross-talk.
9-O-acetylation of sialic acids can mask some epitopes. For
example, natural ligands of the B-cell adhesion molecule CD22
beta can be masked by 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].
Similarly, it can inhibit binding of sialoadhesin, a
macrophage-restricted and sialic-acid-dependent adhesion molecule
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. On the other hand, 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids can
form novel epitopes. Influenza virus C haemagglutinin
specifically requires 9-O-acetylated sialic acids for binding to
host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Incubation of red blood cells with sialate
9-O-acetylesterase rendered the erythrocytes resistant against
agglutination by influenza C virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. O-acetylation of
disialoganglioside GD3 by human melanoma cells has been reported
to create a unique antigenic determinant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Modifications
of sialic acids may be an important mechanism underlying the
interaction/cross-talk between different types of cells. The
essential role of sialic acids modification in cellular
communications may explain the presently observed wide
distribution of H-Lse in all examined tissues.</p>
      <p>The present study suggests that the expression of H-Lse is
developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage-specific. The
evidence for this includes: (1) lack of expression in embryonic
testis; (2) association of high level of mRNA detected by
DD-RT-PCR with the 4C but not 2C cells in adult testes; and (3)
detection of in situ hybridization signal in spermatocytes but
not spermatogonia or other somatic cells. In the absence of
spermatogenesis, embryonic testis contains only two distinct cell
types, spermatogonia and Sertoli cells, while the seminiferous
epithelium of adult testis consists of germ cells at different
stages of spermatogensis. The 4C cells found in adult testis
include the primary spermatocytes and spermatogonia of G<sub>2</sub>/M
stage, while 2C cells include spermatogonia of G0/G1 stage,
secondary spermatocytes, and Sertoli cells. The absence of H-Lse
mRNA in embryonic testis and the high level of its mRNA in the 4C
cells of adult testis suggest that its expression is restricted
to spermatocytes, particularly the primary spermatocytes.
Together with the in situ hybridization results showing mRNA of
H-Lse restricted to spermatocytes, but not spermatogonia, Sertoli
cells or interstitial cells, these data suggest that
H-Lse is likely to be involved in the process of spermatogenesis,
although its role in testicular development cannot be entirely
ruled out. Unfortunately, due to the deformation of the available
human testes, we were not able to make further distinction
between primary and secondary spermatocytes. What has been
clearly shown by the present data is that H-Lse is only present
at a stage beyond spermatogonia, suggesting its possible role in
the differentiation of germ cells.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the processes of 9-O-acetylation and
de-O-acetylation of sialic acid have been implicated in
organogenesis and cellular differentiation, since alteration of
these processes could lead to interruption of cellular
development such as embryogenesis. Transgenic mice constitutively
overexpressed the 9-O-acetyl-sialic-acid-specific esterase of
influenza C that has been found to arrest embryo development at the
two-cells stage. It has also been reported that in vitro
development of embryonic stem cells shows that the expression
level of Lse is low at the initiation of the development, and
followed by an increase at later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In transgenic
mice with selective expression of 9-O-acetyl-sialic-acid-specific
esterase in retina and the adrenal gland, these organs showed
various abnormalities in organization, while all other tissues
appeared normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Lse has also been considered to play a
key role in the differentiation of B lymphocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], since
it is expressed in late but not early B lymphocyte. The presently
observed development-dependent pattern of H-Lse expression is
consistent with that found in other cell types: absence or low
expression at early stage of differentiation but high at later
stages. Taken together, 9-O-acetyl esters in sialic acids appear
to be important for development or cellular differentiation.</p>
      <p>Spermatogenesis is a multiple-staged continuous progress of
cellular differentiation. It has been reported that some cell
surface glycoconjugates are modified during the early steps of
spermatogenesis, and influence the differentiation of
spermatogenic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. As nine-carbon sugars commonly found in
many glycoproteins of spermatogenic cells, sialic acids represent
a target for cell surface modification,  that is, removal of
9-O-acetyl esters by enzymes such as Lse.  Modification of sialic
acids may result in alteration in cell-cell communication,  that is,
Sertoli cells and germ cells interaction, thereby influencing the
differentiation of spermatogenic cells. Thus, future studies on
the presently identified H-Lse may provide insight into molecular
mechanisms underlying testicular development and/or germ cell
differentiation during spermatogenesis in humans.</p>
