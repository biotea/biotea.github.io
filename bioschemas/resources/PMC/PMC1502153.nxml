          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The
<italic>JAK2V617F</italic> allele has recently been identified in patients with polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MF). Subsequent analysis has shown that constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is an important pathogenetic event in these patients, and that enzymatic inhibition of JAK2V617F may be of therapeutic benefit in this context. However, a significant proportion of patients with ET or MF are
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative. We hypothesized that activation of the JAK-STAT pathway might also occur as a consequence of activating mutations in certain hematopoietic-specific cytokine receptors, including the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), or the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR).

          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>DNA sequence analysis of the exons encoding the transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains of EPOR, MPL, and GCSFR, and comparison with germline DNA derived from buccal swabs, identified a somatic activating mutation in the transmembrane domain of MPL (W515L) in 9% (4/45) of
<italic>JAKV617F-</italic>negative MF. Expression of MPLW515L in 32D, UT7, or Ba/F3 cells conferred cytokine-independent growth and thrombopoietin hypersensitivity, and resulted in constitutive phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5, AKT, and ERK. Furthermore, a small molecule JAK kinase inhibitor inhibited MPLW515L-mediated proliferation and JAK-STAT signaling in vitro. In a murine bone marrow transplant assay, expression of MPLW515L, but not wild-type MPL, resulted in a fully penetrant myeloproliferative disorder characterized by marked thrombocytosis (Plt count 1.9â4.0 Ã 10
<sup>12</sup>/L), marked splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, and increased reticulin fibrosis.

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Activation of JAK-STAT signaling via MPLW515L is an important pathogenetic event in patients with
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative MF. The bone marrow transplant model of MPLW515L-mediated myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) exhibits certain features of human MF, including extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly, and megakaryocytic proliferation. Further analysis of positive and negative regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway is warranted in

        <title>Editors' Summary</title>
        <sec id="sb1a">
          <title>Background.</title>
          <p>Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MF) is one of a group of chronic blood disorders, known as chronic myeloproliferative disorders. These disorders sometimes turn into acute leukemia. The main abnormality in myelofibrosis is for the bone marrow to become filled with fibrous (scar) tissue (hence the name myelofibrosis), which stops it from producing normal blood cells efficiently. In addition, the white blood cells that remain are abnormal (that is, metaplastic). The clinical effect of these abnormalities are that patients are anemic (they have low numbers of red cells), are more likely to get infections because of the abnormal white cells which cannot fight infections normally, and may bleed more easily because of a lack of the platelets that help the blood to clot. Scientists who study this disorder believe that the disease starts from just one abnormal cell, which divides to replace all the other cellsâthat is, all the abnormal cells are part of one clone.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1b">
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>In two similar diseases, polycythemia vera (in which the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells) and essential thrombocytosis (in which the bone marrow produces too many platelets), and in some patients with MF, scientists have found genetic changes which seem to trigger these diseases. However, there are some patients with MF in which no abnormal gene has been found. The scientists here wanted to look at other genes to see if they could find any changes that might trigger MF.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1c">
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>They decoded the DNA sequence of three genes that are known to be involved in how blood cells develop for 45 patients with MF. They looked at DNA from white blood cells, and also from normal cheek cells for comparison. They found that in four of the 45 patients the DNA in the bone marrow, but not the cheek, carried a mutation in a gene for the thrombopoietin receptor (also called
<italic>MPL</italic>). This gene is necessary for the cells that make platelets to grow correctly. The mutation was not present in any samples from patients with diseases related to MF, nor in 270 normal samples. The mutation that was identified was at position 515 in the
<italic>MPL</italic> gene sequence, hence the name MPLW515Lâthe W and the L are the shorthand way of indicating exactly which change occurred. The change meant that the gene became abnormally active. The researchers tested the effect of the abnormal gene by putting it into cells grown in culture in the laboratory; they found that it made the cells grow more than was normal. In addition, when cells with the abnormal gene were put into mice, the mice developed a blood disorder similar to that seen in humans with MF.
</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1d">
          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>It seems likely that the genetic change that has been identified here is responsible for the MF that develops in some patients. The
<italic>MPL</italic> gene is known to be part of a pathway of genes that control how certain blood cells develop. However, it is not yet clear exactly how the genetic change found here causes the blood cells to grow abnormally, or how it causes the other clinical effects of MF. Further work will also need to be done to see if it is possible to develop drugs that can act on this gene mutation, or on the other genes that it affects so as to return the cells to normal.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The BCR-ABL negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MF) [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although clonal hematopoiesis was observed in these disorders more than three decades ago, the molecular etiology of these disorders was not known until recently when several groups reported a somatic mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (
<italic>JAK2V617F</italic>) in most patients with PV and in a subset of patients with ET and MF [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recent estimates using high sensitivity mutation detection techniques indicate that
<italic>JAK2V617F</italic> is present in Ë95â100% of PV, 60%â70% of ET, and 50% of MF [

<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. JAK2V617F is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] that activates downstream signal transduction pathways and transforms hematopoietic cells to cytokine-independent growth [

<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and these cells are sensitive to a small molecule JAK Inhibitor [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, expression of JAK2V617F in a murine bone marrow transplant assay results in a MPD most similar to PV [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These data indicate that constitutive activation of JAK-STAT signaling by the mutant JAK2V617F kinase plays a central role in the pathogenesis of
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>positive PV, ET, and MF.

      <p>Despite the recent discovery of the
<italic>JAK2V617F</italic> allele, questions remain regarding the molecular pathogenesis of PV, ET, and MF. In particular, the mutation(s) responsible for
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative ET and MF remain to be identified. Although more sensitive techniques can identify
<italic>JAK2V617F</italic> mutations in a small proportion of clonal cells, we recently demonstrated that the majority of
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative ET and MF patients have clonal granulocytes [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], suggesting that alternative mutation(s) result in clonal granulopoiesis in this subset of patients.
</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative patients with MPD might have mutations involving other components of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway that include cytokine receptors, other JAK family members, or STAT family members. Screens for additional mutations in other JAK-STAT signaling intermediates in this clinical context including
<italic>JAK1</italic>,
<italic>JAK3</italic>,
<italic>TYK2</italic>,
<italic>STAT3</italic>, or
<italic>STAT5</italic> have been negative [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
</p>
      <p>We have recently shown that expression of a homodimeric type I cytokine receptor, such as the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), or the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR), is required for JAK2V617F-mediated transformation of hematopoietic cells and for activation of downstream signaling [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These data suggested the possibility that mutations in the regions of these cytokine receptors that are critical for receptor dimerization (transmembrane domain) and for JAK2 binding (juxtamembrane domain) might lead to activation of JAK-STAT signaling in
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative MPD. Indeed, such mutations in the context of
<italic>EPOR</italic> have been identified in rare familial cases of polycythemia, though these have not been reported in acquired MPD. Heretofore,
<italic>MPL</italic> has been sequenced in a small cohort of patients with MF and ET, but no mutations were identified [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and multiple groups have reported the absence of
<italic>EPOR</italic> mutations in small numbers of patients with PV [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. High throughput DNA sequence analysis and the collection of a large number of MPD patient samples [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] has enabled evaluation of a larger series of patients for mutations in candidate genes, including cytokine receptors. We therefore investigated patients with
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative MPD for somatic activating mutations in
<italic>EPOR, MPL,</italic> or
<italic>GCSFR</italic>.

Peripheral blood smear (B) (600Ã, Wright-Giemsa) of a representative MPLWT animal displays an unremarkable white blood cell and platelet count. In contrast, peripheral blood smear (A) (600Ã, Wright-Giemsa) of a representative MPLW515L mutant animal reveals marked thrombocytosis and leukocytosis comprising a predominant population of maturing myeloid cells as well as frequent nucleated erythroid forms. Bone marrow images from MPLWT animals display preserved marrow architecture with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis (D) (600Ã, hematoxylin and eosin [H&amp;E]). Comparatively, bone marrow sections from MPLW515L mutant animals demonstrate marrow elements comprising a prominent population of maturing myeloid cells with increased numbers of megakaryocytes including atypical and dysplastic forms occurring in frequent clusters (C) (600Ã, H&amp;E) and showing emperipolesis of neutrophils in megakaryocyte cytoplasm. Spleen sections from MPLW515L mice display complete effacement of normal splenic architecture (E) (40Ã, H&amp;E) with a marked expansion of red pulp that is composed of an admixture of maturing myeloid and erythroid elements and numerous numbers of atypical megakaryocytes (G) (600Ã, H&amp;E) compared with MPLWT spleens (F and H) (40Ã and 600Ã, H&amp;E), which display a relative preservation of normal spleen architecture and the presence of only maturing erythroid forms in the red pulp. Liver images from MPLW515L mice illustrate evidence of extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis in a perivascular and sinusoidal distribution (I) (100Ã, H&amp;E) composed predominantly of a population of maturing erythroid elements with frequent large atypical megakaryocytes and occasional admixed myeloid forms (K) (600Ã, H&amp;E). In comparison, only small, focal areas of nucleated erythroid cells were observed in livers from MPLWT animals (J and L) (100Ã and 600Ã, H&amp;E).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this report we describe a somatic mutation in the transmembrane region of
<italic>MPL</italic> (
<italic>MPLW515L</italic>) in a subset of
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative MF. Expression of MPLW515L transforms hematopoietic cells to cytokine-independent proliferation, and results in constitutive activation of JAK-STAT signaling. The relevance of this mutation is underscored by its effect in the murine bone marrow transplant assay, as expression of MPLW515L induces myeloproliferation characterized by splenomegaly, leukocytosis, marked thrombocytosis, extramedullary hematopoeisis, and myelofibrosis. In addition, a small-molecule JAK kinase inhibitor inhibits proliferation of MPLW515L-transformed cells, suggesting that targeted inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling may be an effective therapy for both
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>positive and
<italic>MPLW515L-</italic>positive MPD.
</p>
      <p>Although the constitutively active JAK2V617F mutant kinase is present in many patients with MPD, there are a significant proportion of MF and ET patients who are
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative. We hypothesized that activation of JAKâSTAT signaling in these patients might result from activating mutations in cytokine receptors, which led to the discovery of a novel mutation in
<italic>MPL</italic> (
<italic>MPLW515L</italic>) in patients with
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative MF. The mutation is present in granulocytes but not in non-hematopoietic germline DNA, demonstrating that
<italic>MPLW515L</italic> is a somatic mutation present in clonally derived hematopoietic cells. Moreover, the
<italic>MPLW515L</italic> allele was not observed in a panel of normal individuals, demonstrating that it is not a common single nucleotide polymorphism. These data provide genetic evidence that
<italic>MPLW515L</italic> is a pathogenetic mutation in this subset of
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative MF.
</p>
      <p>In contrast to previous reports [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we have identified a mutant MPL receptor that results in constitutive activation of downstream signal transduction pathways. MPL signals via its association with JAK2 and TYK2, resulting in phosphorylation of both MPL and JAK2/TYK2 and consequent activation of the STAT3, STAT5, ERK/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. MPLW515L activates JAK-STAT signal transduction independently of ligand binding, and, in contrast with MPLWT, confers cytokine-independent growth to 32D, Ba/F3, and UT7 cells. Moreover, Western blot analysis shows ligand-independent phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins, which may effect both proliferation and differentiation. Finally, hematopoietic cells that express MPLW515L are hypersensitive to stimulation with TPO as assessed by cell proliferation and Western blot analysis, suggesting MPLW515L-positive hematopoietic progenitors may have a selective proliferative advantage as compared with wild-type progenitors in MF patients.
</p>
      <p>The discovery of this mutation provides a novel mechanism for activation of signal transduction in hematopoietic malignancies. Somatic mutations in MPL have not previously been described, though previous genetic and biochemical data suggest that the cytoplasmic-transmembrane junction (which includes W515) is important in its activation. These data include the germline S505N allele in
<italic>MPL</italic> associated with familial ET [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the W515S mutation that has been reported as a spontaneous mutation in Ba/F3 cells stably transduced with MPL[
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and the observation that in vitro deletion of the RWQFP domain that includes W515 results in MPL activation [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The mechanism of activation of MPL by these alleles is not fully understood, and it will be of value to obtain structural insight into the role of the cytoplasmic transmembraneâjunction region in the regulation of MPL signal transduction.
</p>
      <p>Expression of MPLW515L in murine bone marrow recapitulated many of the phenotypic characteristics of MF in humans, including atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia, splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, and thrombocytosis that may be attenuated in humans by splenic sequestration [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This is in contrast to murine bone marrow transplant experiments with constitutively activated tyrosine kinase alleles evaluated in our laboratory and by others, including TEL-JAK2, FLT3-ITD, and FIP1L1-PDGFRA [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], that each result in a neutrophilic MPD without involvement of the megakaryocyte lineage. It is of interest that JAK2V617F, which is associated with ET and MF in humans, results in polycythemia and leukocytosis, but not thrombocytosis, in the same murine BMT model [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Of note, absolute leukocytosis in both the JAK2V617F and the MPLW515L-mediated BMT models is higher than is typically observed in human PV and MF, respectively. Also, MPLW515L mice develop rapidly fatal disease. These differences between the murine model and the human phenotype are likely accounted for by the retroviral transduction model of disease, and is similar to what has been observed for the rapidly fatal BCR-ABL-mediated disease in the murine BMT model as compared with human CML [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].
</p>
      <p>MPLW515L-expressing bone marrow and spleen cells exhibit cytokine-independent colony formation, another feature of clinical ET and MF. In addition, the MPLW515L murine bone marrow transplant model shares some phenotypic characteristics with other murine models of MF, including that induced by overexpression of thrombopoietin, either in transgenic [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or in bone marrow transplant models [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and in the transgenic
GATA-1
<sup>low</sup> mouse [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], though the severity and chronicity of the MF phenotype varies in these different models, which, unlike the current model, are not based on somatic disease alleles observed in human MF.
</p>
      <p>MPLW515L is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention with small molecule inhibitors. Current treatments for MF include empiric therapies such as hydroxyurea or interferon, and splenectomy for symptomatic splenomegaly [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a viable option for some patients with MF, but most patients are diagnosed at an advanced age and are not candidates for stem cell transplantation. Recent clinical trials with thalidomide demonstrated modest efficacy in MF, largely by slowing the rate of fibrosis in these patients rather than by reversal of fibrosis [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Allogeneic BMT data does indicate that eradication of the malignant hematopoietic clone in MF does result in complete reversal of fibrosis [
<xref rid="pmed-0030270-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and suggests that drugs that target mutant alleles such as MPLW515L may be effective disease-remitting agents. JAK2 inhibitor development is well under way as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating MPD patients with the
<italic>JAK2V617F</italic> allele. Data presented here indicate that the subset of
<italic>JAK2V617F-</italic>negative MF patients with the
<italic>MPLW515L</italic> mutation will also be sensitive to inhibition with small molecule JAK2 inhibitors. These findings also suggest that a more expansive genomic screen for involvement of other components of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is warranted in MPD patients.
