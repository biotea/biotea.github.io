        <p>Here we demonstrate association of variants in the mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase <italic>NARS2</italic> with human hearing loss and Leigh syndrome. A homozygous missense mutation ([c.637G&gt;T; p.Val213Phe]) is the underlying cause of nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB94) and compound heterozygous mutations ([c.969T&gt;A; p.Tyr323*] + [c.1142A&gt;G; p.Asn381Ser]) result in mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency and Leigh syndrome, which is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by symmetric, bilateral lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem. The severity of the genetic lesions and their effects on NARS2 protein structure cosegregate with the phenotype. A hypothetical truncated NARS2 protein, secondary to the Leigh syndrome mutation p.Tyr323* is not detectable and p.Asn381Ser further decreases NARS2 protein levels in patient fibroblasts. p.Asn381Ser also disrupts dimerization of NARS2, while the hearing loss p.Val213Phe variant has no effect on NARS2 oligomerization. Additionally we demonstrate decreased steady-state levels of mt-tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> in fibroblasts from the Leigh syndrome patients. In these cells we show that a decrease in oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and electron transport chain (ETC) activity can be rescued by overexpression of wild type <italic>NARS2</italic>. However, overexpression of the hearing loss associated p.Val213Phe mutant protein in these fibroblasts cannot complement the OCR and ETC defects. Our findings establish lesions in <italic>NARS2</italic> as a new cause for nonsyndromic hearing loss and Leigh syndrome.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) disease represents a large and heterogeneous group of energy deficiency disorders. Here we report three mutations in NARS2, a mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, associated with non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) and Leigh syndrome in two independent families. Located in the predicted catalytic domain of the protein, missense mutation p.(Val213Phe) results in NSHL (DFNB94) while compound heterozygous mutation (p.Tyr323*; p.Asn381Ser) is leading to Leigh syndrome with auditory neuropathy. <italic>In viv</italic>o analysis deemed p.Tyr323* mutant protein to be unstable. Co-immunoprecipitation assays show that p.Asn381Ser mutant disrupts the dimerization ability of NARS2. Leigh syndrome patient fibroblasts exhibit a decreased steady-state level of mt-tRNA<sup>Asn</sup>. In addition, in these cells, the mitochondrial respiratory chain is deficient, including significantly decreased oxygen consumption rates and electron transport chain activities. These functions can be partially restored with over-expression of wild-type NARS2 but not with p.Val213Phe mutant protein. Our study provides new insights into the genes that are necessary for the function of brain and inner ear sensory cells in humans.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) disease represents a large and heterogeneous group of energy deficiency disorders [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A significant percentage of MRC disorders is caused by both nuclear and mitochondrial encoded genetic variants that impact molecules of the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among these genes, those coding for the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-aaRSs) have emerged as being frequently associated with human disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The primary function of mt-aaRSs is to charge mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) molecules with their cognate amino acids [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Scheper and co-authors first linked mutations in <italic>DARS2</italic>, encoding the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, to leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation in brain (LBSL; MIM: 611105) [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since then, mutations of 14 other mt-aaRSs have been associated with mitochondrial disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], including <italic>NARS2</italic>, which has recently been linked to intellectual disability, epilepsy and myopathy [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The significant tissue specificity and phenotypic heterogeneity of mutated mt-aaRSs was unexpected, considering that a deficiency in these ubiquitously expressed enzymes should affect all tissue types [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The delineation of the underlying cellular mechanisms is subject to intensive investigation for cytoplasmic as well as mitochondrial aaRS [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Mutations of five (mt) aaRS genes cause syndromic forms of deafness, including Perrault syndrome (<italic>LARS2</italic>, <italic>HARS2</italic>), Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 2N (<italic>AARS</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 (<italic>RARS2</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Homozygous mutations in <italic>KARS</italic>, an aaRS which functions in the cytoplasm as well as the mitochondria, have been shown to cause nonsyndromic hearing impairment (DFNB89) [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The gene shows similar pleiotropism as it is demonstrated for <italic>NARS2</italic> in this study since in addition to DFNB89, compound heterozygous <italic>KARS</italic> mutations have been shown to cause Charcot Marie Tooth disease and developmental delay as well as severe infantile disease with microcephaly and white matter abnormalities, seizures and vision loss [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>Mutations in <italic>EARS2</italic> and <italic>FARS2</italic> have been shown to cause fatal epileptic mitochondrial encephalopathy and/or Alpers syndrome [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and mutations in <italic>IARS2</italic> have previously been associated with Leigh Syndrome or Leigh-like disease. Our report therefore adds <italic>NARS2</italic> to the list of mt-aaRS associated fatal epileptic mitochondrial encephalopathy and represents the second Leigh syndrome associated mt-aaRS [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Leigh syndrome is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in symmetric, bilateral lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Leigh syndrome is the most common clinical finding associated with mitochondrial disease of childhood and displays significant genetic heterogeneity [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To date there are over 60 genes associated with Leigh syndrome, and a large proportion is caused by defects in molecules involved in the mitochondrial translational machinery [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In two families, we report phenotypic variability associated with different mutations of the same mt-aaRSs, NARS2. One family is segregating nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB94) and another with Leigh syndrome.</p>

          <p>Subject II.1, from family LS06, (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) was born to unrelated healthy Caucasian parents without contributory family history. He was considered normal at birth but then failed the post-natal hearing screen. Follow up testing at 1 month of age showed absent Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) with preserved cochlear microphonics, diagnostic of bilateral auditory neuropathy. Pure tone otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) testing at 11 weeks showed absent transient evoked emissions. Early developmental milestones were normal. Myoclonic movements started at 3 months of age, rapidly worsened, eventually involving all four extremities and complex partial seizures were recorded. A CT scan and MRI of the head were normal. Extensive laboratory studies for metabolic disease showed abnormal urine organic acids with elevations in multiple TCA cycle metabolites (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). CSF lactate was elevated at 3.9 mmol/L (Normal &lt;2.0 mmol/L) and 5.4 mmol/L by 5 months of age, while plasma lactate was normal.</p>

              <p>(A) Pedigree of the LS06 family. Filled symbols represent affected individuals and small circles represent carrier individual. The pedigree shows autosomal recessive inheritance of compound heterozygous NARS2 variants [c.969T&gt;A; p.Tyr323*] and [c.1142A&gt;G; p.Asn381Ser]. (B) SDS PAGE and Western blot of control and patient II.1 muscle homogenates (10Î¼g and 20Î¼g of protein), samples were probed for mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes via MitoProfile total OXPHOS human WB antibody cocktail. The result showed significantly decreased amounts of mitochondrial respiratory complex I and IV. (C) SDS PAGE and Western blot of fibroblast lysates from both affected probands (II.1, II.3), their parents (I.1, I.2) and controls using anti-NARS2 antibody and anti-GAPDH antibody as loading control. The expected position of a truncated NARS2 protein product (Î154aa) stemming from the p.Tyr323* allele is indicated with a black arrow. (D) Pedigree of the PKDF406 family. Filled symbols represent affected individuals, and a double horizontal line represents a consanguineous marriage. Alleles forming the risk haplotypes are boxed. The short tandem repeat (STR) markers, their relative map positions (Mb) according to UCSC Genome Bioinformatics build GRCh37 (hg19), and their genetic positions (cM) based on the Marshfield genetic map are shown next to the pedigree. A haplotype analysis revealed a linkage region delimited by a proximal meiotic recombination at marker D11S911 in individual IV:4 (arrowhead) and distal recombination at marker D11S4082 in individuals IV:8 and IV:9 (arrowhead).</p>

          <p>Follow up MRI showed multiple areas of hyperintensive T2-weighted and Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal within periventricular white matter and posterior corona radiata with extension into the posterior limbs of the internal capsule.There was also a hyperintensive signal in the thalami and dentate nuclei. Electroencephalography (EEG) was abnormal, consistent with status epilepticus. Anti-seizure medications were tried including Topamax, Dilantin and Klonopin, but were not effective. By 10 months of age, he had developed laryngomalacia with pharyngeal hypotonia, his condition progressed and he died of respiratory failure at 15 months of age. Post mortem examination of the brain showed cortical atrophy with laminar necrosis, atrophy of the corpus callosum, significant white matter oligodendroglial loss. Neuronal gray matter loss was widespread with gliosis. Multifocal prominent hypervascularity, as well as, symmetrical lesions in the brainstem and thalamus were characteristic of Leigh syndrome.</p>
          <p>A muscle sample was obtained post-mortem within the acceptable time frame for preservation of mitochondrial enzyme activities. Histology, including mitochondrial stains and electron microscopy, was normal. ETC studies showed absent activity of NADH cytochrome C reductase (COI/III), indicating a block in electron flow from the membrane bound arm of mitochondrial complex I (COI) to mitochondrial complex III (COIII) and a milder reduction in complex IV (COIV) activity. Mitochondrial ferricyanide reductase activity probing the matrix arm of COI, which is thought to contain mainly nuclear encoded subunits, was normal (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
          <p>Additionally SDS PAGE and Western blot for muscle and fibroblast lysates from proband II.1 were performed with a standard protocol (29). Consistent with the ETC results, Western blot on muscle lysates showed significantly decreased levels for mitochondrial complex I (NDUFB8â18kD) and moderate decrease for mitochondrial complex IV (MTCOII-22kD) (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, Western blot performed with anti-GRIM19 antibody for mitochondrial complex I (GRIM19 corresponds to the mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFA13) in fibroblast lysates was normal (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>).</p>
          <p>The familyâs third child, a male who was born after an uneventful pregnancy via spontaneous vaginal delivery (II.3, <xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) also failed the new born hearing screen but was otherwise normal. ABR and OAE testing at 1 month of age showed comparable bilateral auditory neuropathy with normal middle ear function. He first presented with myoclonic movements of the right arm at three months of age, accompanied by lethargy and decreased feedings, which necessitated the placement of a gastrostomy tube. The MRI showed restricted diffusion in the left basal ganglia, and external capsule junction as well as the left frontal lobe in cortical distribution. EEG showed continuous left hemispheric focal seizures. Laboratory testing for organic acids revealed mild elevation in TCA cycle metabolites, fumaric, malic, and 2-keto-glutaric acids; suggestive of mitochondrial disease. Plasma amino acids, as well as, lactic acid in blood were within normal range. A muscle biopsy at three months of age was normal for coenzyme Q levels and histology, while ETC studies (CIDEM) showed complex I/III deficiencies similar to his deceased brother. Individual II.3 passed away at 6 months of age. Autopsy also showed severe encephalopathy and prominent basal ganglia involvement consistent with Leigh syndrome. There were fewer vaso-proliferative lesions than in proband II.1. The striate cortex showed severe degeneration, which correlated with the patientâs cortical blindness. Microscopically there was widespread gliosis and prominent diffuse metabolic astrocytosis.</p>

          <title>Family PKDF406</title>
          <p>We ascertained family PKDF406 from Punjab province of Pakistan. The pedigree suggested that deafness was segregating in this family as an autosomal recessive trait (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Pure-tone audiometric evaluations of the affected individuals from the PKDF406 family revealed pre-lingual, profound, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (HL) (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005097.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). We found no evidence of co-segregation of vestibular dysfunction, retinitis pigmentosa or an obvious cognitive disability with HL in the PKDF406 family (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

          <p>mtDNA studies for patient II.1 from family LS06, identified a heteroplasmic variant in the mitochondrial tRNA cysteine (mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup>) at position A5793G while all other studies were normal (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Segregation analysis showed the variant to be homoplasmic in the unaffected sister and could therefore not have been the underlying cause of the phenotype (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>). Since the variant could cause suboptimal translation of mtDNA encoded respiratory chain subunits we performed transmitochondrial cybrid studies. The variant did not affect mitochondrial complex I levels when introduced into a neutral nuclear background (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Therefore, to identify the disease-causing gene, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) for probands II.1 and II.3 and their father (I.1). This analysis revealed compound heterozygous variants in the <italic>NARS2</italic> gene (NM_024678, MIM: 612803), encoding mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (mt-AsnRS or NARS2), at positions [c.969T&gt;A; p.Tyr323*] and [c.1142A&gt;G; p.

          <p>In family PKDF406, linkage analysis was undertaken using short tandem repeat (STR) markers for many of the reported recessive nonsyndromic deafness loci. PKDF406 family was found to be segregating deafness linked to markers for <italic>DFNB2</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) on chromosome 11q13.5 [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that mutant alleles of <italic>MYO7A</italic> are responsible for the DFNB2 phenotype in humans [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Using the NGS-based mutation screening test OtoSeq [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we sequenced the affected individual IV:8 (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) from the PKDF406 family and did not find any pathogenic variants in all of the coding and non-coding exons of <italic>MYO7A</italic>. Furthermore, refined mapping and haplotype analyses using additional PKDF406 family members excluded the <italic>MYO7A</italic> gene from the linkage interval on chromosome 11q13.4-q14.1. Therefore, the HUGO nomenclature committee assigned the designation <italic>DFNB94</italic> to the locus defined by the PKDF406 family. A maximum two-point LOD score of 5.10 (Î¸ = 0) was obtained for marker <italic>D11S937</italic>.</p>
          <p>Next, genomic DNA from individual IV:8 of family PKDF406 was processed for WES. All the variants found in the WES data are summarized in <xref rid="pgen.1005097.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>. Since there was significant evidence of linkage of deafness segregating in family PKDF406 to STR markers on chromosome 11q13.4-q14.1, we focused only on the variants present in the <italic>DFNB94</italic> linkage interval. We found a c.637G&gt;T transversion variant in <italic>NARS2</italic>. Using Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>), we confirmed the segregation of the c.637G&gt;T allele with hearing loss in the PKDF406 family. Sanger sequencing of all the coding and non-coding exons of <italic>NARS2</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>) did not reveal any other changes besides c.637G&gt;T in family PKDF406.

        <title>Mutations located in exons encoding the predicted catalytic domain of NARS2</title>
        <p>
<italic>NARS2</italic> is composed of 14 exons that encode a protein of 477 amino acids (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). <italic>NARS2</italic> was first described in yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and belongs to the class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a classification based on three consensus sequence motifs in the catalytic subunit [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Generally, aaRS are comprised of an anticodon binding domain and a catalytic domain. Some aaRSs have an additional domain with editing functions to prevent the insertion of inappropriate amino acids during protein synthesis. However, InterProScan [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and SWISS-MODEL [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] molecular modeling softwares predicted that NARS2 does not contain this additional domain (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). All mutations observed in our families are located in the predicted catalytic domain (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The Leigh syndrome associated p.Tyr323* variant results in a premature termination codon and is therefore considered damaging. The stop codon occurs instead of the tyrosine residue which is conserved through yeast (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and hypothetically results in a truncated protein of 323 amino acids. The second Leigh syndrome variant p.Asn381Ser substitutes Serine for a highly conserved Asparagine with a GERP score of 4.59 (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). This variant is predicted highly pathogenic by all ten interrogated pathogenicity prediction programs (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>). The hearing loss p.Val213Phe variant is moderately conserved with a GERP score of 3.89. It is deemed highly damaging by 5 out of the 10 interrogated pathogenicity algorithms [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
        <p>The 3D structure of human NARS2 has not been resolved. However, there is 30.5% identity and 50.1% similarity between NARS2 and <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> AsnRS, which allowed us to use the crystal structure of <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> AsnRS [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to model the effect of the human missense mutations of NARS2. Human NARS2 p.Val213 residue corresponds to the p.Lys181 residue in <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii (</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). Molecular modeling data suggests that the p.Lys181 residue is present on the surface of the molecule (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The substitution of this valine residue with phenylalanine in humans is predicted to create a sticky patch on the surface that could affect the protein-protein interactions of NARS2. Since a dimeric protein form has been described for mt-AsnRS of <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> (Protein Data Bank access # 3M4Q), we used it as backbone for <italic>in silico</italic> modeling. The p.Glu187 and p.Val355 of <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> mt-AsnRS correspond to p.Val231 and p.Asn381 residues in human NARS2 (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Molecular modeling data suggest that p.Asn381 is not directly involved in the dimer interphase. However, the variant could affect the dimerization by propagation of a structural perturbation. Conversely, the p.Val213 residue is located within the dimer interphase. We therefore functionally interrogated a potential NARS2 oligomerization defect.</p>

We therefore wanted to assess whether NARS2, like its cytosolic counterpart would form homodimers.

Western Blot analysis and quantification, after normalizing against the GAPDH expression level, revealed no significant difference in the steady state levels of the p.Val213Phe or p.Asn381Ser mutant proteins compared with wild type NARS2 protein (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6D Fig</xref>).</p>

        <p>In order to assess <italic>in vivo</italic> protein stability due to <italic>NARS2</italic> variants in the LS06 family, we performed SDS PAGE and Western blot analysis on whole fibroblast cell lysates from both parents and the probands (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). A truncated NARS2 protein product (Î154aa) stemming from the p.Tyr323* allele was not observed (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, black arrow). Both probands had significantly reduced NARS2 levels when compared to controls (C1 and C2; <xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Since the probandsâ full-length NARS2 bands represented translation solely from the paternal allele, Western blot results deemed the p.Asn381Ser <italic>NARS2</italic> variant as unstable at the RNA or protein level. This is further demonstrated by a 50% reduction in NARS2 levels for the paternal sample (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Defective MRC is associated with mutations in <italic>NARS2</italic>
</title>
        <p>To test whether the <italic>NARS2</italic> mutations in family LS06 are directly correlated with MRC (Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain) dysfunction, we reasoned that the reintroduction of wild type <italic>NARS2</italic> would correct a hypothetical defect in mtDNA encoded mitochondrial protein translation. Therefore, we overexpressed wild type <italic>NARS2</italic> in patient fibroblasts. We also reasoned if p.Val213Phe is a pathogenic mutation associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB94), it would not rescue the MRC defects observed in family LS06. To test these hypotheses, stable <italic>NARS2</italic> over-expression cell lines were generated by lentiviral transduction of patient II.1 fibroblasts with cDNA constructs encoding human wild type or p.Val213Phe mutant <italic>NARS2</italic> cloned into a pLVX-IRES-tdTomato lentiviral plasmid. Transduced cells were sorted by flow cytometry, and tdTomato-positive cells were selected for NARS2 overexpression. The overexpression of NARS2 proteins was confirmed by SDS PAGE and Western blot (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>To examine if overexpression of NARS2 rescued the respiratory deficiencies caused by the <italic>NARS2</italic> mutations (p.Tyr323*, p.Asn381Ser), O<sub>2</sub> consumption of transfectants and their parental cell lines II.1 were measured by using a Seahorse XF24 Analyzer (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>) and the manufacturer supplied âMitostressâ kit. The kit uses sequential addition of substrates and inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. After measuring basal respiration, oligomycin is added to block the mitochondrial ATP synthase. The reduction in oxygen consumption reflects the ATP need of the cell, while the remaining respiration reflects the proton leak. Next the mitochondria are uncoupled with FCCP which causes an increase in electron flux, as the mitochondria attempt to restore the loss of the proton gradient. After addition of FCCP, rotenone and antimycin A are added to inhibit complexes I and III, which then stop all mitochondrial respiration. This allows calculation of respiration due to non mitochondrial oxygen consumption. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was significantly higher in the cell line expressing wild type <italic>NARS2</italic> although rescue was not complete (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). These data suggest that the overexpression of <italic>NARS2</italic> can enhance the rate of respiration in the patient cell line carrying the <italic>NARS2</italic> mutations. Furthermore, the transduction with mutant <italic>NARS2</italic> did not rescue the OCR function, which supports the pathogenic nature of the p.Val213Phe allele (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Oxygen consumption in intact patient cells with NARS2 overexpression. Oxygen consumption in NARS2 overexpressing cells was analyzed using the Seahorse XF24 analyzer. 2 Î¼M oligomycin, 4 Î¼M FCCP and 2 Î¼M rotenone/antimycin were added at the indicated points. (B) Oxygen consumption rates from fibroblast mitochondria of the indicated genotypes. âNullâ corresponds to fibroblasts from patient II.1 of LS06 family. Overexpression of the p.Val213Phe NARS2 construct failed to improve the oxygen consumption rate, but the wild type NARS2 construct significantly rescued it (wild type NARS2: OCR ratio = 0.650 Â±0.103, p.Val213Phe NARS2: OCR ratio = 0.459 Â±0.027, n = 3, p = 0.003). (C) Enzymatic activity of the individual respiratory chain complexes from fibroblast mitochondria of the indicated genotypes. Complex II activity was unaffected in all genotypes. Overexpression of the wild type NARS2 construct significantly improved the activities of complexes I, III and IV (p = 0.002, p = 0.032 and p = 0.004, respectively), and expression of the p.Val213Phe NARS2 construct had no effect.

        <p>Next, we measured the activity of mitochondrial complexes I to IV. The null cell line derived from patient II.1 has decreased activity in complexes I, III and IV. No significant difference was observed in the activity of complex II, which does not have mtDNA encoded subunits. The overexpression of wild type and p.Val213Phe mutant NARS2 did not affect the activity of complex II (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), but the overexpression of wild type NARS2 significantly rescued the activity of complexes I, III and IV in the null fibroblasts (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Rescue was not complete for mitochondrial complexes I and IV. Contrary to WT construct, the over-expression of the p.Val213Phe mutant NARS2 in null fibroblasts did not rescue the activity of complexes I, II and IV (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Together with the OCR measurements, the results from these functional studies revealed that Leigh syndrome and DFNB94 associated alleles impair the mitochondrial function of NARS2.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Two brothers diagnosed with Leigh syndrome defined by symmetrical lesions in the brain stem and thalamus, had similar clinical courses including congenital auditory neuropathy followed by myoclonus, intractable seizures and early demise. CSF lactic acid was elevated, suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction. ETC studies confirmed this suspicion, revealing abnormal complex I/III activity. WES uncovered compound heterozygous mutations in the <italic>NARS2</italic> gene. Compound heterozygous mutations resulted in decreased levels of the tRNA<sup>Asn</sup>, impaired the activities of mitochondrial complexes I, III and IV and negatively affected the oxygen consumption rate in patient fibroblasts. Electron transport through mitochondrial complex II was not enhanced, which is consistent with the fact that the architecture of mitochondrial complex II is completely nuclear encoded. Introduction of wild type NARS2 protein significantly improved OCR and activity of mitochondrial complexes I, III and IV but rescue was incomplete. There could be many reasons for incomplete rescue, including the altered spatiotemporal expression of NARS2, tissue specificity, non-repairable damage to mitochondrial proteins due to endogenous mutant NARS2, cellular health, and genetic modifiers. We have identified a heteroplasmic mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> variant at position A5793G, located in the tRNAâs acceptor stem. This variant was found once before in a family with epileptic seizures and visual disturbances (personal communication with Dr T. Dorn). However, unaffected maternal relatives in that family also carried the variant. We cannot rule out the possibility that mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> variant might add to the translational defect and hence resulted in incomplete rescue by overexpression of wild type NARS2.</p>
      <p>In the Pakistani family PKDF406, we identified a novel homozygous missense mutation in <italic>NARS2</italic>, which co-segregates with nonsyndromic congenital hearing loss DFNB94. In contrast to wild type NARS2, over-expression of p.Val213Phe NARS2 did not restore OCR or mitochondrial electron transport chain function in fibroblast cells derived from family LS06. Recently, mutations in mt-aaRS (ARS2) and cytoplasmic aaRS (ARS) have been associated with human diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Perrault syndrome (<italic>LARS2</italic>, <italic>HARS2</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, all of which include sensorineural hearing impairment (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The available clinical data indicate that the hearing impairment in the PKDF406 family is nonsyndromic (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Clinical studies ruled out Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and pontocerebellar hypoplasia. However, definitively ruling out Perrault syndrome, a disorder of hearing impairment and premature ovarian failure, in affected individuals from family PKDF06 is clinically challenging. Only two females in our family were homozygous for the p.Val213Phe missense mutation and had hearing loss (IV:4 and IV:8; <xref rid="pgen.1005097.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). At the time of examination, family members IV:4 and IV:8 were 40 and 45 years old, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005097.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), were both post-menopausal, and had no children. The average age for menopause in Pakistan is estimated to be 49.3 years [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], suggesting that these two affected females may have experienced early menopause. The degree of ovarian insufficiency in Perrault syndrome is highly variable and early menopause would be consistent with a diagnosis of Perrault syndrome. We also Sanger-sequenced <italic>NARS2</italic> in 14 unrelated Perrault syndrome probands to assess whether mutations in NARS2 are a common finding in this patient population, but did not find any pathogenic variants.</p>

      <p>Pleiotropism is a common phenomenon in ARS associated disease. In our study, comparative mutation and resulting functional deficit analyses for both families may explain the syndromic versus nonsyndromic phenotype. The nonsense Leigh syndrome mutation did not result in a truncated NARS2 protein product in patient fibroblast, which is indicative of nonsense mediated <italic>NARS2</italic> mRNA decay [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The remaining NARS2 protein product, expressed from the missense allele, showed additional instability. We were unable to assess stability of p.Val213Phe mutant protein <italic>in vivo</italic> since no patient tissue is available, but the protein was stable <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore the secondary structure of NARS2 harbouring p.Asn381Ser must be significantly affected since the NARS2 p.Asn381Ser protein product has reduced dimerization with wild type NARS2 protein. In contrast, the <italic>DFNB94</italic> allele (p.Val213Phe) did not alter NARS2 protein stability, or the ability to dimerize with wild type protein <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
      <p>During the course of our work, two siblings with variable clinical manifestation and c.822G&gt;C (p.Gln274His) mutation in <italic>NARS2</italic> were reported by Vanlander and coauthors [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. One affected individual displays mild intellectual disability and epilepsy, while another sibling has severe myopathy, fatigability and ptosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Neither sibling has a hearing loss. The.822G&lt;C allele also results in abnormal splicing of intron 7 in patient lymphoblastoid cell lines. In the patient cell lines, NARS2 protein level is somewhat decreased, but is completely absent in muscle from both affected siblings suggesting additional instability of the abnormal splice product in that tissue. To explain the mild phenotype, particularly of the sibling without myopathy, the authors suggest the presence of normally spliced NARS2 protein product below the detection level in muscle and a low threshold for essential NARS2 enzymatic activity. An ETC assay, performed in skeletal muscle homogenate as well as isolated mitochondria shows significantly reduced COI activity. The different methodology makes a direct comparison with our study difficult, but absence of COI/COIII activity in muscle homogenate of the Leigh syndrome patients is striking and suggests a more severe COI defect than what was observed by Vanlander and co-authors. We also observed decreased mt-tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> levels in our patient fibroblasts, which may have further increased severity of the mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in CNS tissue. The decreased levels of mt-tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> may be suggestive either of a regulatory role of NARS2 in the expression of its cognate tRNA or of a decrease in stability of the tRNA by poor interaction with the mutant NARS2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Fluctuations in mitochondrial tRNA levels have significant influence on disease expression. The best example is reversible infantile respiratory chain deficiency (RIRCD) due to a homoplasmic mutation in the mt-tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>. The mutation may cause lethality in infancy and is associated with low levels of mt-tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>. However, as mt-tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> levels increase surviving infants spontaneously recover, with good prognosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

Intriguingly, recent studies have shown that overexpression of cognate and non-cognate ARS2 can rescue mitochondrial dysfunction secondary to mt-tRNA mutations [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], further reinforcing the importance of the interaction between ARS2 and their cognate mt-tRNAs.</p>
      <p>The absence of hearing deficit in the family studied by Vanlander and co-authors, while the two families described in our study exhibit hearing loss, is an additional example of the pleiotropism of ARS2 associated disease. Interestingly mutations in <italic>KARS</italic> show phenotypic variability to an extent comparable to our findings associated with <italic>NARS2</italic> defects. In three independent studies, different mutations in <italic>KARS</italic> lead to Charcot Marie Tooth disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], non syndromic hearing impairment DFNB89 [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and more recently visual impairment and progressive microencephaly [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The link between ARS mutations and phenotypes still need to be unraveled and require a better understanding of the symptoms as well as the involved molecular mechanisms [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
      <p>The phenotypic diversity can also be explained by tissue specificity. Consistent with defects in other mitochondrial disorders [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and more particularly with other ARS2 disorders (for review [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]), our patients display significant tissue specificity with prominent central nervous system and/or inner ear pathogenicity, despite an ubiquitous expression. Molecular mechanisms underlying this tissue specificity are poorly characterized. Mitochondrial translation might be sufficiently supported by residual ARS2 activity in most of the tissues but may have reached threshold in affected tissue(s) and may depend on the availability of mitochondrial chaperone proteins, in a tissue specific manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Differential expression of other molecules of the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery in response to the altered steady state levels of the mutated protein was also shown to be tissue dependent [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Significant tissue specific variation of protein stability has previously been reported in fatal mitochondrial hepatopathy due to mutations in the mitochondrial translation elongation factor <italic>GFM1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. While <italic>GFM1</italic> is ubiquitously expressed, the effect of the mutations on GFM1 protein levels was shown to vary from no protein in liver, to 60% of normal protein levels in heart. This finding was consistent with absence of cardiac findings in the patient. Differential expression of other molecules of the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery in response to the altered steady state levels of GFM1 protein was also tissue specific [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The <italic>NARS2</italic> mutations described in this report may therefore affect NARS2 protein stability compensatory gene expression in a tissue specific manner. Several studies have, recently, highlighted the influence of modifying factors and more particularly factors that would modulate the mitochondrial translation [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Additional function(s) of ARS2 proteins, yet to be described, may be restricted to specific cell types or to specific developmental stages. The fact that in many mt-aaRS related disorders even severe mutations do not display an aminoacylation defect has prompted further studies which have highlighted the importance of the aminoacylation process [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], protein folding [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and refolding [<xref rid="pgen.1005097.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore the NARS2 mutations described in this study may disrupt protein refolding in the mitochondrial matrix in a tissue-specific manner.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our findings implicate mutant alleles of <italic>NARS2</italic> as another cause of Leigh syndrome as well as DFNB94 hearing loss in humans. Animal models are needed to elucidate the crucial functional roles that NARS2 play in the inner ear and central nervous system as well as in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Future studies will explore the mechanistic differences in tissue-specific phenotypic expression of <italic>NARS2</italic> mutations causing Leigh syndrome, hearing loss, epilepsy and intellectual disability.</p>

          <p>(A) Wild type NARS2-GFP (green) was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and Mito Tracker Red FM was used to stain mitochondria. Co-localization of the fluorescent signals indicates the mitochondrial targeting of wild type NARS2. (B) p.Val213Phe NARS2-GFP (green) and (C) p.Asn381Ser NARS2-GFP (green) were also targeted to mitochondria, indicating that these disease-causing mutations do not affect NARS2 localization.

HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the same quantity of wild type or mutant <italic>NARS2</italic> constructs. Protein extracts from the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-GFP antibody. The expected size of both GFP-fused proteins is 81 kDa.
