        <p id="P1">Interactions between SH2 domains and phosphotyrosine sites regulate tyrosine kinase signaling networks. Selective perturbation of these interactions is challenging due to the high homology among the 120 human SH2 domains. Using an improved phage-display selection system, we generated a small antibody-mimic or âmonobodyâ, termed HA4, that bound to the Abl kinase SH2 domain with low nanomolar affinity. SH2 protein microarray analysis and mass spectrometry of intracellular HA4 interactors demonstrated HA4's exquisite specificity, and a crystal structure revealed how this specificity is achieved. HA4 disrupted intramolecular interactions of Abl involving the SH2 domain and potently activated the kinase <italic>in vitro</italic>. Within cells, HA4 inhibited processive phosphorylation activity of Abl and also STAT5 activation. This work provides a design guideline for highly specific and potent inhibitors of a protein interaction domain and demonstrates their utility in mechanistic and cellular investigations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Protein interaction domains (PIDs) are molecular recognition modules that mediate interactions with a broad array of biological ligands.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> PIDs play central roles in the spatiotemporal activation of individual proteins and in the organization of cellular protein networks responsible for complex biological processes. Because signaling proteins often contain multiple PIDs, each of which can serve as an interaction node, defining the function of each PID is critically important for our understanding of cellular networks. Such knowledge will also be of use in the identification and validation of PID targets for the development of novel therapeutics.</p>
      <p id="P3">Large-scale interactome studies have identified many potential interactions involving PIDs,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but their functional importance is difficult to evaluate. This is due, in part, to the technical challenge of specifically disrupting the function of an individual PID without perturbing the function of the rest of the protein. Gene knockout and RNA interference eliminate the entire protein, and directed mutagenesis requires modification of the host genome and often affects gene expression level. Moreover, genetic perturbations can result in a phenotype that differs considerably from the phenotype caused by a reagent that binds to the same protein.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Characterization of PID function, therefore, would benefit greatly from the development of minimally invasive tools to selectively inhibit an individual PID within the cell, but this represents a considerable challenge. PIDs often comprise large families containing many structurally conserved members.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A specific PID inhibitor would have to distinguish among the many members of a PID family within a given genome, all of which utilize a conserved interaction interface to recognize similar ligands.</p>
      <p id="P4">In order to assess the feasibility of selective PID inhibition, we have chosen the SH2 domain family, which recognizes phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing peptide ligands, as our model system. The SH2 domain family has all of the features that hinder the development of specific inhibitors. The phosphopeptide binding pocket is highly conserved among the 120 human SH2 domains.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Moreover, because roughly one-half of total phosphopeptide binding energy is derived from the pY moiety,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> individual SH2 domains often recognize generic pY-peptides with only slightly weaker affinity than optimal pY-peptides, making it difficult to achieve high specificity using pY-based compounds.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Indeed, there is substantial skepticism as to whether it is possible to discriminate one SH2 domain from the others through interactions limited to the phosphopeptide-binding interface.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Although a few high-affinity SH2 domain inhibitors, most of which are small phosphopeptide mimics, have been developed, no rigorous analyses of their specificity toward SH2 targets have been reported.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
      <p id="P5">Protein-based inhibitors are a promising but unproven alternative to small molecule- or phosphopeptide-mediated inhibition of SH2âphosphopeptide interactions. Because protein-protein interactions generally involve larger interfaces than protein-small molecule or protein-peptide interactions, protein-based inhibitors could promote specificity through interactions outside of the conserved phosphopeptide-binding interface. Currently, antibodies are the most common protein-based inhibitors<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, but as large, multi-chain, disulfide-stabilized proteins, they are not likely to fold into the functional form in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm. An attractive alternative are engineered single-domain binding proteins. One of the best established systems is based on the tenth human fibronectin type III domain (FN3), a small (10 kDa), highly stable Î²âsandwich protein with surface loops tolerant to extensive mutations.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These surface loops form a binding interface analogous to that presented by the complementarity determining regions of antibodies (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). FN3-based binding proteins, called âmonobodies,â do not contain disulfides and are thus functional in both oxidizing and reducing environments, making them amenable to <italic>in vitro</italic> and cellular studies. Moreover, because monobodies tend to recognize binding âhot spotsâ of the target protein, they often act as competitive inhibitors.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
      <p id="P6">In this work, we chose the SH2 domain of human Abl kinase as our model target. Abl kinase is involved in a wide array of physiological processes and its oncogenic counterpart, the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, causes chronic myelogenous leukemia.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Moreover, structure-function studies have established the importance of the SH2 domain in Abl kinase regulation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Using an improved phage-display platform, we generated a high-affinity and remarkably specific monobody inhibitor, HA4, to the Abl SH2 domain. The crystal structure of the HA4/Abl SH2 complex reveals how HA4 achieves such high degrees of affinity and specificity, thereby providing a guide to the development of PID inhibitors. We also assessed the consequences of the binding of HA4 to the SH2 domain within full-length Abl <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells. Together, our results demonstrate the feasibility of highly specific PID inhibition, and illustrate the utility of monobody inhibitors as tools to precisely define the <italic>in vitro</italic> and cellular functions of an individual PID.</p>

        <title>Selection of FN3 monobodies to the Abl SH2 domain</title>
        <p id="P7">We have made improvements to vector design and phage preparation methods (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data</xref>), that markedly enhanced the level of FN3 monobody displayed on the phage surface, resulting in a greater success rate in monobody selection. We constructed a new library in which FN3 loops were diversified with highly biased amino acid mixtures (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) and selected FN3 monobodies to the SH2 domain of Abl. Although we initially obtained a large number of monobodies, their affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &gt;500 nM) was only slightly higher than typical peptide ligands for SH2 domains. Subsequent affinity maturation using a single cycle of âloop shufflingâ<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> resulted in several monobodies with higher affinity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The most frequently recovered clone, dubbed HA4, was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a soluble protein, and its binding properties were analyzed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). HA4 bound to the Abl SH2 domain with 7 nM <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), regardless of the presence of inorganic phosphate in solution, an affinity level similar to that of antibodies and 500â1000 times higher than that of physiological ligands of the Abl SH2.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>

        <title>HA4 inhibits Abl SH2âphosphopeptide interactions</title>
        <p id="P8">Because FN3 monobodies tend to bind to hot spots of protein-protein interactions even in the absence of a tailored selection strategy, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> we tested whether this was the case for HA4. The addition of HA4 to GST-Abl SH2 bound to a fluorescently labeled phosphopeptide led to a dose-dependent decrease in fluorescence polarization, indicating displacement of SH2-bound peptide by HA4. A non-binding HA4 mutant (HA4<sub>Y87A</sub>; see below under âInterface Energeticsâ for its design) had no effect (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Because of the low affinity of the peptide ligand, a high concentration of Abl SH2 (10 Î¼M) was required to achieve substantial polarization change of the peptide fluorescence, a prerequisite for inhibition assays. Consequently, high concentrations of HA4 were also required to detect inhibition in this assay. The decrease in polarization caused by HA4 was nearly stoichiometric, indicating that HA4 is a high-affinity competitive inhibitor of Abl SH2-phosphopeptide interactions.</p>

      <sec id="S5">
        <title>Protein microarray demonstrates that HA4 is highly specific</title>
        <p id="P9">We sought to rigorously characterize the specificity of HA4 using SH2 domain protein microarrays.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Critically, these protein microarrays retain most of the spotted SH2 domains in their folded, functional state. Of the of 84 SH2 domains present on the chip (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), HA4 interacted most strongly with the Abl and Abl2 (Arg) SH2 domains (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, left panel), indicating a high level of specificity. Because the Abl and Abl2 SH2 domains share &gt;90% sequence identity, this cross reactivity was expected. At higher concentrations of HA4, binding to a small number of additional SH2 domains was also detected (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, right panel). Due to differences in the amount and quality of SH2 domains at individual spots, signal intensity does not directly correlate with the strength of interaction. Therefore, we analyzed the microarray data for each spot as a function of HA4 concentration. The apparent K<sub>d</sub> values for the Abl and Abl2 SH2 domains were nearly identical (22 nM and 18 nM, respectively; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), and were consistent with those obtained by SPR. The majority of the spotted SH2 domains (63 domains) show no signal above background levels even with 500 nM HA4, the highest concentration used (data not shown). Furthermore, 15 randomly selected SH2 domains had no detectable interactions with HA4 as tested with SPR, indicating <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &gt; 5 Î¼M and confirming the microarray results (data not shown).</p>
        <p id="P10">The SH2 domains that exhibit detectable interactions with HA4 can be divided into two groups. The first group (15 domains) exhibited no signal saturation at the highest HA4 concentrations used (500 nM), indicating weak interactions (e.g. SH2D5, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The second group (a total of three domains in addition to Abl and Abl2 SH2) displayed signal saturation and thus likely represents cross-reactivity of at least moderate affinity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). This group includes the tandem SH2 domains of Syk (an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of 28 nM), but neither of the individual SH2 domains showed signal saturation, indicating weak interactions and suggesting the presence of a secondary HA4 binding site in the tandem SH2 domain. Grb7 SH2, which had an apparent Kd of 169nM, forms non-covalent dimers<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> that would present two SH2 molecules in close vicinity, but we could not compare monomer and dimer interactions because there was no simple means to disrupt dimerization. Finally, Blk was the only monomeric SH2 domain other than Abl and Abl2 that exhibited signal saturation. The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values obtained from the microarray data (109 nM) and from SPR (240 nM) are substantially higher than for the HA4/Abl SH2 interaction. Together, these protein microarray and SPR analyses showed that HA4 is highly specific for Abl and Abl2.</p>

        <title>Interactome analysis shows highly specificity in cells</title>
        <p id="P11">In order to evaluate the specificity of HA4 in the cellular environment, we stably expressed HA4 and HA4<sub>Y87A</sub> as tandem affinity-purification (TAP) tag fusion proteins in HEK293 and K562 cells.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Both cell lines express Abl, and K562 additionally expresses the constitutively active Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Endogenous proteins interacting with expressed HA4 and HA4<sub>Y87A</sub> were purified, visualized by silver staining, and identified using tandem protein mass spectrometry (MS) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The most abundant proteins retrieved from both cell lines were only identified when HA4, but not HA4<sub>Y87A</sub>, was expressed, and were identified as ABL1, ABL2 and SYK (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In K562 cells, the TAP procedure also retrieved peptides from the BCR protein that correspond to portions present in the Bcr-Abl fusion.</p>
        <p id="P12">A number of other proteins were also detected only when HA4 but not HA4<sub>Y87A</sub> were used as bait, but at lower levels. Many of these were previously identified as interactors of either Abl/Abl2 (FYN, INPPL1, CYFIP, G2DF1, NCKAP1 and FRYL)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> or Bcr-Abl (BTK, INPPL1, GRB2, SHC1, UBASH3B and AP2A1).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Although some of these proteins also contain SH2 domains (FYN, INPPL1, GRB2 and SHC1), none were identified as HA4 interactors in our SH2 microarray experiments, and no binding of HA4 to the SH2 domains of Grb2, Shc1 or Fyn was detected in SPR experiments (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that these additional SH2-containing proteins associate, directly or indirectly, with Abl/Abl2 or Bcr-Abl, rather than with HA4. Importantly, the capture of these additional SH2-containing proteins provides strong support for HA4's high specificity in the cellular context. For example, the association between Bcr-Abl and Grb2 is mediated through the Grb2 SH2 domain.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The identification of Grb2, therefore, indicates that HA4 did not markedly interfere with the function of the endogenous Grb2 SH2 domain.</p>
        <p id="P13">The TAP-MS data indicates that, in the two different cell types, HA4 has strong interactions with only the SH2 domains of Abl, Abl2, and Syk. Gene expression analyses indicate that 65 genes containing a total of 73 SH2 domains (out of the120 SH2 domains encoded in the human genome) are expressed in K562 cells <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, and 67 are expressed in HEK293 cells,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> yielding a total of 92 SH2 genes expressed. Thus, HA4 successfully recognizes its targets in a complex cellular milieu with exquisite specificity. Moreover, the concordance of the highest affinity interactors identified by protein microarray and by TAP-MS provides cross-validation for these very different methods of specificity assessment.</p>

        <title>Crystal structure of the HA4/Abl SH2 domain complex</title>
        <p id="P14">In order to understand how HA4 achieves such remarkable levels of specificity and affinity, we determined the crystal structure of HA4 in complex with the Abl SH2 domain at 1.75 Ã resolution (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The asymmetric unit contains two HA4/Abl SH2 complexes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>); the two HA4 molecules form an intermolecular Î²-sheet through antiparallel association of Î²-strand A and the N-terminal tail, a common mode of crystal contacts observed for Î²-rich proteins. HA4 maintains the FN3 scaffold structure as evidenced by small difference from previously determined monobody structures (C<sup>Î±</sup> root mean squared deviation (RMSD) &lt;0.7 Ã, excluding the three mutated loops).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The overall structure of the Abl SH2 domain is in good agreement with published NMR structures and with the corresponding portion within the crystal structures of larger segments of Abl kinase (C<sup>Î±</sup> RMSD &lt;1 Ã).<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p>
        <p id="P15">HA4 binds to the phosphopeptide-binding site of the Abl SH2 domain, consistent with the inhibition data. The interface buries a total of 684Ã<sup>2</sup> of monobody surface area and 651 Ã<sup>2</sup> of the SH2 domain, roughly in line with the surface area burial observed in crystal structures of monobody/maltose binding protein complexes.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Interestingly, the electron density map contained a well-resolved density in the pY binding pocket, consistent with an inorganic phosphate ion, (probably from a phosphate buffer used for SH2 preparation). This density is adjacent to the hydroxyl group of Tyr87 of HA4 such that Tyr87 and the putative inorganic phosphate together mimic pY (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Consistent with such mimicry, the Î²B-Î²C loop of the SH2 domain is in the âclosedâ conformation characteristic of an SH2 domain with a bound phosphopeptide.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> As noted above, inclusion of phosphate did not alter the affinity of HA4 for the Abl SH2 domain (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), indicating that the bound phosphate ion contributes little to the energetics of the HA4-SH2 interaction.</p>
        <p id="P16">The HA4 structure resembles a cupped hand consisting of the âpalmâ and âfingersâ upon which the Abl SH2 domain rests (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). The palm consists of one Î²-sheet of the FN3 scaffold and the C-terminal residue of the BC loop (Tyr35). The contacts made by HA4 âpalmâ residues, contributing â¼40% of the total interface area, are at the periphery of the phosphopeptide-binding interface. A Î²-hairpin formed by a long FG loop of HA4 (residues 79â90) corresponds to the fingers that recognize the center of the phosphopeptide-binding interface, which make up â¼60% of the interface. The finger residues in the FG loop closely mimic the canonical backbone conformation of an SH2-bound phosphopeptide (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). In the stereotypical mode of SH2-phosphopeptide interaction, the phosphopeptide lies perpendicular to the SH2 central Î²-sheet, and interacts with surface cavities on either side of the central Î²-strand (Î²D) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> One of these cavities accommodates pY, while the other forms a pocket for the amino acid three-residues C-terminal to pY (termed âY+3â). In the HA4 FG loop, Tyr87 is inserted into the pY pocket where it forms cation-Ï interactions with two arginines along the sides of the pocket (Arg194 and Arg153; note that two-digit numbers refer to HA4 residues and three-digit numbers to SH2 residues), and polar contacts with Ser181 at the base (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Residues Ser84âGly86 form a network of polar interactions with SH2 residues at the periphery of the pY pocket. Although Asp83 does not contact the SH2 domain, it forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds with Gly86 and Tyr87, which may be important for supporting the FG loop conformation. Met88 makes hydrophobic contacts (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) and forms a main-chain H-bond with His192 of the SH2 domain (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). C-terminal to Met88, the main chain bends away from the surface such that the âY+3 pocketâ of the SH2 domain is not engaged by the amino acid three residues C-terminal to Tyr87 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Instead, distinct from the canonical mode of peptide-SH2 interactions, Trp80, at the N-terminus of the FG loop, forms a large hydrophobic surface that blankets the Y+3 binding pocket.</p>
        <p id="P17">Unlike the combinatorially optimized FG loop residues, residues mediating the âpalmâ interactions (Tyr35, Tyr36, Arg38, Glu52 and Tyr78) are located in the invariant FN3 scaffold, suggesting that these contacts are serendipitous. These contacts, both hydrophobic and polar, are with portions of the Abl SH2 domain at the periphery of the phosphopeptide-binding interface (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P18">The HA4-Abl SH2 interface shows intermediate characteristics, in terms of size, chemistry and shape complementarity,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> between a typical SH2-phosphopeptide interaction and typical antibody-antigen interactions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). These statistics are consistent with the structural observation that HA4 utilizes a combination of peptide-like and antibody-like modes of recognition to achieve high affinity binding.</p>
        <p id="P19">The HA4-binding interface of Abl SH2 includes nearly the entire pY-peptide-binding interface, as revealed by comparison with the peptide-binding interface of the Lck SH2 domain,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> the closest Abl homologue for which a peptide-bound structure is available (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Of the 18 positions in the peptide-binding interface in the Lck SH2 structure, 13 are identical between Abl and Lck SH2 domains, and three are conservative substitutions; many of these residues are also highly conserved across the entire Src family (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a and c</xref>). Therefore, inhibitors targeting this area alone are unlikely to achieve high specificity.</p>
        <p id="P20">About one third of the HA4-binding interface lies outside the peptide-binding interface (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). While these residues are nearly identical between Abl and Abl2, they are less conserved between Abl/Abl2 and the Src family (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), providing the potential for unique contacts. In addition, Abl SH2 lacks the extended Î²C-Î²D loop characteristic of the Src family (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This loop abuts the Î²D residues of the SH2 domain that interact with HA4 at the periphery of the interface. The CD-loop of Src family SH2 domains is packed with charged and high-entropy residues, which forms a large electronegative âknobâ that is predicted to clash with the HA4 DE loop, negatively impacting HA4 binding (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Consistent with this notion, the SH2 domain of Blk, the only member of the Src family with which HA4 interacts, has a knob that is reduced in size and charge (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). These structural features likely explain both the observed cross-reactivity of HA4 to Abl/Abl2, and the absence of cross-reactivity to members of the Src family and other SH2 domains.</p>

In addition, HA4 directly interacts with SH2 residues that form salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with the C-lobe of the kinase in autoinhibited Abl (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). These observations suggest that the binding of HA4 to the SH2 domain should disrupt the autoinhibited conformation, thereby activating the kinase. Indeed, in <italic>in vitro</italic> Abl kinase assays HA4 and a phosphopeptide derived from c-Jun (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = â¼7 Î¼M)<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> caused a dose-dependent increase in Abl activity but HA4<sub>Y87A</sub> did not (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, left). HA4 was a substantially more potent activator than the phosphopeptide, in line with its â¼1000Ã higher affinity for the SH2 domain.</p>
        <p id="P23">In contrast to its effect on the autoinhibited wild-type kinase, HA4 did not further increase the activity of mutated forms of Abl in which autoinhibition is already disrupted (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, right). This supports the model that HA4 activates Abl by disrupting the interactions that maintain the autoinhibited conformation. It is also notable that HA4 did not inhibit these activated Abl mutants indicating that the HA4-interaction interface of Abl SH2 is distinct from the interface required for kinase activation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
        <p id="P24">The concentration of HA4 at which activation of Abl was half-maximal (â¼0.4â0.5 Î¼M) was â¼60 times higher than the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of HA4 for the isolated SH2 domain. Likewise, the concentration of phosphopeptide required for Abl half-maximal activation is much higher than the measured <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for the SH2-peptide interaction. This disparity may indicate the challenge that HA4 faces in competing with the kinase domain for binding to the SH2 domain. Because the kinase domain is a part of the same polypeptide as the SH2 domain, its effective concentration for SH2 interaction is extremely high. These data also imply that the phosphopeptide-binding interface of the SH2 domain is largely inaccessible in autoinhibited c-Abl, but the conformational dynamics of Abl occasionally permit HA4 to bind the SH2 domain, shifting the equilibrium away from the closed, autoinhibited conformation toward a more active open state.</p>

        <title>HA4 blocks processive phosphorylation by Abl in cells</title>
        <p id="P25">For tyrosine kinases containing an SH2 domain, the SH2 domain may aid in the phosphorylation of substrates containing multiple phosphorylation sites by binding a singly-phosphorylated substrate and positioning the kinase domain for subsequent rounds of phosphorylation.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> This mechanism is referred to as processive phosphorylation and is believed to increase substrate specificity. To test whether the SH2 domain of Abl is responsible for processive phosphorylation in the cellular context, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with a constitutively active form of Abl, HA4, and paxillin, a <italic>bona fide</italic> Abl substrate containing multiple phosphorylation sites (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>).<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> An active Abl form was chosen to eliminate complications from HA4's ability to activate wild-type Abl, and to ensure efficient phosphorylation of paxillin by Abl.</p>
        <p id="P26">In the presence of HA4<sub>Y87A</sub>, or in the absence of any monobody, Abl efficiently phosphorylated paxillin at multiple sites, giving rise to a characteristic smear of slower-migrating species observed on an anti-pY blot (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast, HA4 dramatically reduced multi-site phosphorylation of paxillin. Moreover, at low paxillin concentrations, HA4 also substantially reduced Abl auto-phosphorylation when compared with HA4<sub>Y87A</sub> (Lanes 5 and 6). These results demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Abl is critical for the processive phosphorylation of paxillin and suggest that HA4 prevents the assembly of activated signaling complexes that facilitate the phosphorylation and activation of Abl (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>).

        <p id="P27">The ability of HA4 to disrupt processive phosphorylation illustrates its potential as an intracellular inhibitor of endogenous signaling pathways. Thus, we tested the effect of intracellular expression of HA4 on the phosphorylation level of STAT5 in K562 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of STAT5 is a critical step for the induction of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and a commonly used read-out for Bcr-Abl function.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The level of STAT5 phosphorylation was inversely correlated with the level of HA4 expression, while HA4<sub>Y87A</sub> had no effect (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c and d</xref>).

Our results are consistent with previous work demonstrating that the deletion of both SH2 and SH3 domains abolishes the ability of Bcr-Abl to activate STAT5,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> and they further provide mechanistic evidence for a major role of the SH2 domain in STAT5 activation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P28">In this work we successfully selected a highly specific, high-affinity binding protein to a small protein domain optimized for interactions with phosphopeptides. In terms of affinity, HA4 compares favorably to previously developed SH2 domain inhibitors based on peptide mimics, which showed K<sub>d</sub> values in the range of several to several hundred nanomolar.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The sole SH2 domain to which inhibitors of considerably higher affinity (Kd &lt;500 pM) have been reported is Grb2.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p>
      <p id="P29">Synthetic SH2 inhibitors are mostly conformationally constrained phosphopeptide mimetics, designed to optimize contacts in the binding hotspots of SH2 domains, the pY and Y+3 pockets, while reducing the unfavorable entropic loss incurred upon binding through cyclization. The FG loop of HA4 structurally resembles these inhibitors: it interacts extensively with the pY pocket and the Y+3 pocket, and it is effectively cyclized. Its Î²-turn structure, if formed in the unbound state, could help further reduce the entropic loss upon binding.</p>
      <p id="P30">The convergence of HA4 and synthetic inhibitors to a similar mode of interaction suggests that there are inherent structural requirements for high-affinity binding to the SH2 domain phosphopeptide-binding interface. Since these requirements are shared among SH2 domain family members, it may be extremely difficult to achieve both high-affinity and high-specificity recognition through interactions limited to the phosphopeptide-binding interface. Recent thermodynamic studies of c-Src SH2 domain interactions with pY-peptide and synthetic ligands highlight this challenge,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> by showing that the Y+3 âspecificity pocketâ is poorly equipped to mediate specificity, since it is highly flexible and can bind diverse aliphatic ligands with similar affinity. The pY pocket, on the other hand, is rigid and cannot easily accommodate ligands that are structurally divergent from phosphotyrosine. Since the pY pocket is highly conserved, ligands binding to this pocket should bind with similar affinity to many other SH2 domains, as supported by recent molecular dynamics studies.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
      <p id="P31">While HA4 structurally resembles pY-peptides and pY-peptide-like inhibitors, it does not employ a pY or a pY mimic, and hence does not rely on extensive charge-charge interactions with the conserved pY pocket. In fact, HA4 interactions with SH2 resemble those of the few SH2 domains that bind peptide substrates in a pY-independent manner. One such SH2 domain, SAP, achieves high affinity by forming a very large peptide/SH2 interface,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> with contacts with less conserved portions of the SH2 domain that promote specificity. Recent work has established that enhanced specificity in SH2/target interactions can be achieved through a secondary interface away from the phosphopeptide-binding site.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> These findings suggest that, to achieve high-specificity for an SH2 domain, it is necessary to âbranch outâ and make contacts with less-conserved surfaces outside the peptide-binding interface. The structural information presented here will be useful for improving HA4's affinity and specificity and for designing monobody libraries specifically targeted to SH2 domains.</p>
      <p id="P32">The fact that HA4 generation did not require extensive cycles of affinity maturation highlights the effectiveness of our library design. We applied a âbiased-diversityâ strategy that has been successfully employed to select synthetic antibodies to a diverse set of targets.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Our success with the monobody scaffold illustrates the generality of this strategy and validates that, with respect to molecular recognition, not all amino acids are equal. Binding interfaces consisting solely of serine and tyrosine have been shown to mediate high-affinity and high-specificity molecular recognition,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> and even when the amino acid palette is expanded to incorporate other amino acid types, tyrosine still plays a dominant role in the interaction interface.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> In the HA4/Abl SH2 domain structure, tyrosine contributes &gt;40% of the HA4 interface.</p>
      <p id="P33">HA4 is the first monobody to be functionally expressed within mammalian cells. Thus, this work places monobodies as a useful tool in the manipulation of intracellular networks for research and therapeutic ends, alongside other intracellular inhibitors (e.g., the so-called peptide aptamers and intrabodies).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> More specifically, HA4 should be of immediate use in the dissection of Abl signaling networks, to help identify interaction partners of Abl SH2 in the cellular context and determine physiological consequences of interrupting SH2 interactions. HA4 should also prove valuable in the study of oncogenic signaling mediated by Bcr-Abl. Mutation of the SH2 domain drastically reduces Bcr-Abl oncogenicity, suggesting that the SH2 domain recruits some of the functionally critical downstream targets.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></p>

        <p id="P43">We cultured HEK293 cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. We transfected cells with the designated amounts of expression vectors for AblG2APP, myc-HA4, myc-HA4<sub>Y87A</sub>, and HA-Paxillin using PolyFect (Qiagen). Following a 40 hr growth period, we lysed cells in IP buffer (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref> for its composition), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. We performed Western blotting with anti-HA (Covance), anti-Abl (Oncogene Science), anti-phosphotyrosine (Cell Signaling) and anti-myc (Rockland) antibodies.</p>

The active Abl mutant, G2APP, was cotransfected with HA4 (or HA4<sub>Y87A</sub>) and paxillin, which contains multiple phosphorylation sites. Paxillin and HA4/HA4<sub>Y87A</sub> were expressed as HA-tag (gray oval) fusions to facilitate detection in Western analysis. (<bold>b</bold>) Western blots of lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated amounts of DNA. The putative positions of Abl kinase and paxillin are indicated by arrows. HA4-mediated disruption of paxillin processive phosphorylation is observed, with a more pronounced effect with lower levels of paxillin (<bold>c</bold>) Histograms showing the numbers of K562 cells transfected with a HA4-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion vector (line) or untreated K562 cells (gray area) as a function of GFP fluorescence intensity as measured by flow cytometry. The cells were binned in three classes, low, medium and high, based on GFP fluorescence as indicated. (<bold>d</bold>) Flow cytometric analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in transfected K562 cells. Histograms depict signal intensities of cells stained with anti-phospho-Stat5 antibody. The fusion proteins used for transfection are indicated. The three panels show results of the three GFP-gated classes as shown in (c).</p>
