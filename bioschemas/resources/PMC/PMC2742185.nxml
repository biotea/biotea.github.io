        <p>A regulator of G protein signaling, RGS2, moonlights in protein synthesis control.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a family of guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)âaccelerating proteins. We have discovered a novel function for RGS2 in the control of protein synthesis. RGS2 was found to bind to eIF2BÏµ (eukaryotic initiation factor 2B Ïµ subunit) and inhibit the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into new protein. This effect was not observed for other RGS proteins tested. This novel function of RGS2 is distinct from its ability to regulate G proteinâmediated signals and maps to a stretch of 37 amino acid residues within its conserved RGS domain. Moreover, RGS2 was capable of interfering with the eIF2âeIF2B GTPase cycle, which is a requisite step for the initiation of mRNA translation. Collectively, this study has identified a novel role for RGS2 in the control of protein synthesis that is independent of its established RGS domain function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) and RGS-like proteins comprise a family of at least 30 members that have been grouped into five subfamilies based on their structural and sequence homologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ross and Wilkie, 2000</xref>). RGS proteins possess a conserved â¼120âamino acid RGS domain that promotes their association with heterotrimeric G protein Î± subunits and confers their function as GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs). RGS2 belongs to the B/R4 subfamily of RGS proteins that are characterized by relatively simple structures wherein an RGS domain is flanked by short amino and carboxyl termini. Although RGS2 does not appear to contain any of the other established protein-interacting domains (e.g., PSD-95/Dlg/zona occludens-1, ras binding domain, and GoLoco) that have been identified within some RGS protein subfamilies, accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that RGS2 may regulate cellular activity in a manner that is distinct from its known RGS domain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sinnarajah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Salim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roy et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schoeber et al., 2006</xref>). For example, it has recently been shown that RGS2 interacts with the TRPV6 member of the transient receptor potential family of cation channels to disrupt both Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schoeber et al., 2006</xref>). This effect was dependent on a stretch of amino acids (1â82) situated outside of the RGS domain, as it was not observed with an amino-terminal truncation mutant. RGS2 also binds to tubulin to enhance microtubule polymerization, and this effect is dependent on a stretch of 20 amino acids located outside of its RGS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heo et al., 2006</xref>). These studies support additional functions for RGS2 other than its role as a GAP for GÎ±<sub>q</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ingi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernstein et al., 2004</xref>) and regulator of GÎ±<sub>s</sub>-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roy et al., 2006a</xref>). In this study, we present evidence for a novel and unexpected function wherein RGS2 inhibits the translation of mRNA into protein by blocking the activity of the rate-controlling eIF2B.</p>
      <p>Dysregulation of the protein synthesis machinery can contribute to human disease states such as cancer, diabetes, cardiac hypertrophy, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Proud, 2007</xref>). The stages of mRNA translation are initiation, elongation, and termination. In eukaryotes, cellular control of initiation is governed by a family of proteins referred to as eIFs (eukaryotic initiation factors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Proud, 2005</xref>). The rate-limiting step in translation occurs during initiation and is regulated by the heterotrimeric (Î±Î²Î³) GTPase eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kimball, 1999</xref>). In its activated conformation, eIF2-GTP can form a ternary complex with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, which then binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit to initiate protein synthesis. The guanine nucleotideâbound state of eIF2 is itself governed by the heteropentameric (Î±Î²Î´ÏµÎ³) guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), eIF2B, and the eIF2-specific GAP, eIF5. One of the mechanisms to regulate eIF2 activity is phosphorylation of its Î± subunit in response to various cellular stressors. This is mediated by four stress-activated kinases: haem-regulated inhibitor, general control nonderepressible-2, protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA, and pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum eIF2Î± kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dever, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ron, 2002</xref>). Phosphorylation of this highly conserved serine acts to decrease the dissociation rate of eIF2 from eIF2B, which essentially converts eIF2 from a substrate into a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B GEF activity. However, the control of protein synthesis in response to stress is multifaceted and cannot be solely explained by phosphorylation events.</p>
      <p>Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified an interaction between RGS2 and eIF2BÏµ. This association between RGS2 and eIF2BÏµ was also observed between the endogenous proteins in cells. RGS2 was capable of inhibiting de novo protein synthesis in a manner independent of its RGS domain function. Collectively, this work has identified and characterized RGS2 as a novel component in the control of protein synthesis.</p>

        <title>Physical interaction between RGS2 and eIF2BÏµ</title>
        <p>Initial experiments using full-length human RGS2 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen pointed to an interaction with eIF2BÏµ (4 of 21 total positives). In contrast, RGS4 was not observed to interact with eIF2BÏµ when screened against the same mouse brain cDNA library. The 45âamino acid sequence identified in the RGS2 screen matches perfectly with amino acid residues 550â594 of mouse eIF2BÏµ (equivalent to 554â598 in human). Notably, this corresponds to the highly conserved catalytic surface of eIF2BÏµ that enables the heteropentameric eIF2B complex to promote GDP dissociation from eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boesen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mohammad-Qureshi et al., 2007</xref>). It follows that if RGS2 were to bind to this region of eIF2BÏµ, it could alter the ability of eIF2B to promote protein synthesis. We first sought to confirm whether the interaction between RGS2 and eIF2BÏµ could occur at the protein level. We mixed purified RGS2 or RGS4 with lysates from Sf9 cells overexpressing eIF2BÏµ and examined whether there was an association between the proteins. Consistent with the results of the yeast two-hybrid screen, RGS2 interacted with eIF2BÏµ whether it was expressed as a monomer or as part of the pentameric eIF2B complex (i.e., Â± eIF2BÎ±/eIF2BÎ²/eIF2BÎ´/eIF2BÎ³; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Thus, it appears that the presence of the other four subunits does not sterically hinder the ability of eIF2BÏµ to associate with RGS2. In contrast, RGS4 did not specifically associate with either the eIF2B pentamer or monomeric eIF2BÏµ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Next, we investigated whether there was an association between endogenously expressed RGS2 and eIF2BÏµ; therefore, we addressed whether the interaction could occur between the native proteins in UMR-106 osteoblast-like cells. For these experiments, we were required to up-regulate endogenous RGS2 expression by way of the diterpene forskolin, given that native RGS2 in osteoblast cultures is undetectable by immunoblot analysis under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roy et al., 2006b</xref>). Endogenous eIF2BÏµ was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates, and the immune complex was examined for RGS2 immunoreactivity. Indeed, endogenously expressed RGS2 was observed to coimmunoprecipitate with eIF2BÏµ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). RGS2 expression in forskolin-treated cells and from the coimmunoprecipitation assay presented as a doublet band, which is consistent with a recent report that RGS2 can have multiple protein products resulting from alternative translation initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gu et al., 2008</xref>). This observed association between RGS2 and eIF2BÏµ in lysates from nontransfected cells shows that the interaction between the two proteins is genuine and thus implies a possible role for endogenous RGS2 in mRNA translation.</p>

The precleared cell lysate was obtained as described in Materials and methods, and the indicated RGS protein was added to these lysates to a final concentration of 500 nM. The mixture was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, and samples were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred.

Protein A/G agarose beads were extensively washed, and the bound protein was removed by heating and added to the gels (lane 1â4). The SDS-PAGE gel was transferred to PVDF membrane and probed using anti-RGS2 antibody (top) and stripped and reprobed using the same eIF2BÏµ antibody used for immunoprecipitation (IP; bottom).

        <title>Inhibition of protein synthesis by RGS2</title>
        <p>The role of eIF2B in the control of protein synthesis is to promote guanine nucleotide exchange on the eIF2Î³ subunit. Protein translation cannot be initiated in the absence of a functional eIF2âeIF2B relationship. Thus, we hypothesized that the interaction between RGS2 and eIF2BÏµ may act to interfere with de novo protein synthesis. Therefore, we monitored the production of the luminescent protein, Coleoptera luciferase, from its mRNA using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based in vitro translation assay. Addition of RGS2 resulted in a significant decrease in protein synthesis compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In contrast, neither RGS1 (despite its reported interaction with eIF3Î´; see Discussion) nor RGS4 had any effect on protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Each of the three purified RGS proteins was functional with respect to its known GAP activity, as all were able to dose-dependently increase the rate of M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptorâstimulated G<sub>11</sub> GTP hydrolysis to approximately the same extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>).</p>

        <title>RGS2 regulation of protein synthesis and the RGS domain</title>
        <p>To better define the mechanism by which RGS2 controls protein synthesis, we examined the role of its RGS domain. We generated two mutations within this region of RGS2 that would act to decrease or eliminate its GTPase-accelerating function: RGS2-N149A and RGS2-ÎC169 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The N149A point mutation is thought to disrupt a critical contact point between RGS2 and G protein Î± subunits, whereas ÎC169 removes a substantial portion of the RGS domain at its carboxyl terminus. As expected, neither of these RGS2 mutants was able to increase agonist-stimulated GTP hydrolysis above that of agonist alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In contrast, when the two RGS2 mutants were used in the in vitro translation assay, both proteins retained the ability to inhibit the translation of luciferase mRNA into protein to the same degree as that of wild-type RGS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). These results imply that the ability of RGS2 to inhibit protein synthesis is independent of its effects on G proteins.</p>

        <p>We hypothesized that the binding of RGS2 to eIF2BÏµ might disrupt the eIF2âeIF2B GTP cycle. Thus, we examined the effects of RGS2 on the GEF activity of eIF2B by measuring the potential of eIF2B to promote the dissociation of [<sup>3</sup>H]GDP from eIF2. As illustrated, all three of the RGS2 proteins examined were able to dose-dependently inhibit eIF2B GEF activity for eIF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Collectively, these data show that RGS2 can interfere with eIF2B GEF activity in a manner independent of its established G protein effects.</p>

        <title>Identification of the RGS2 domain involved in regulating protein synthesis</title>
        <p>The observation that RGS2 can interfere with the eIF2âeIF2B GTP cycle suggests that RGS2 may bind to eIF2BÏµ in a manner similar to that of eIF2Î². We identified a stretch of 37 amino acid residues within the RGS2 protein sequence (79â115) that shared 35% homology (nine identical and four conserved) with the eIF2BÏµ-binding domain of eIF2Î² (200â333; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimball et al., 1998</xref>). This corresponding sequence within other RGS and RGS-like proteins did not exhibit the same degree of identity. Structural analyses revealed that the homologous regions of human RGS2 (Protein Data Bank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2af0">2af0</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Soundararajan et al., 2008</xref>) and bacterial aIF2Î² (Protein Data Bank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1nee">1nee</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">GutiÃ©rrez et al., 2004</xref>) were each comprised of two Î± helices oriented at a 45Â° angle and connected by a short linker. We used this homologous sequence of 37 amino acids as a point of reference to generate ÎN79-RGS2, RGS2-ÎC116, and RGS2-Î79â116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>) in an attempt to identify the active domains within RGS2 that confer its novel function. Deletion of the RGS2 amino terminus did not interfere with RGS2 GAP activity. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernstein et al., 2004</xref>), both wild-type RGS2 and ÎN79-RGS2 were able to promote agonist-stimulated GÎ±<sub>11</sub> GTP hydrolysis (unpublished data). This is consistent with the fact that truncation of RGS2 upstream of residue 79 leaves the RGS box intact. However, RGS2-ÎC116 and RGS2-Î79â116 were without RGS2 GAP activity (unpublished data). This was expected given that these mutations disrupt the integrity of the RGS domain. The three RGS2 deletion mutants were used in the translation assay to examine their effects on protein synthesis. Truncation of RGS2 either upstream or downstream of the homologous 37âamino acid sequence did not disrupt the ability of RGS2 to impair protein synthesis. RGS2-ÎC116 and ÎN79-RGS2 each inhibited mRNA translation to a comparable level as that of wild-type RGS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In contrast, RGS2-Î79â116 had no effect on protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>) and correspondingly failed to interact with monomeric eIF2BÏµ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Additional experiments assessed the effect of a purified RGS2 peptide corresponding to residues 79â116 on translation. The results revealed that the RGS2 peptide was capable of inhibiting the translation of luciferase mRNA into protein in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that RGS2 amino acids 79â116 are both sufficient and necessary to inhibit protein synthesis.</p>

        <p>We went on to generate two additional RGS2 mutants termed RGS2-ala1 and RGS2-ala2 in an attempt to further characterize this new domain of RGS2 that is involved in protein translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The RGS2-ala mutants each contain a series of alanine substitutions at strategic locations between residues 79 and 116. For RGS2-ala1, the substitutions are based on the charge and position of the native residue within the helixâlinkerâhelix structure of wild-type RGS2, whereas the substitutions in RGS2-ala2 correspond to the conserved residues between the homologous segments of eIF2Î² and RGS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). RGS2-ala1 and RGS2-ala2 were examined for their potential to interact with eIF2BÏµ and regulate de novo protein synthesis. In comparison with wild-type protein, RGS2-ala2 had minimal interactions with monomeric eIF2BÏµ and, accordingly, did not have a significant impact on the translation of luciferase mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast, RGS2-ala1 retained binding to eIF2BÏµ and also significantly decreased protein translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). These results further reinforce the proposal that this segment of RGS2 is involved in binding eIF2BÏµ in the regulation of protein synthesis and suggest that the common residues between eIF2Î² and RGS2 may contribute to eIF2BÏµ binding.</p>

        <p>We next assessed whether RGS2 and its putative eIF2BÏµ-interacting domain had any impact on protein synthesis in cells. We used two cellular models for these experiments, H9c2 and MCF-7 cells, and infected them with adenovirus coding for full-length RGS2 and an RGS2 minigene comprising residues 79â116. In both of the cell lines tested, RGS2 and the RGS2 minigene were able to attenuate de novo protein synthesis to comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). The magnitude of inhibition was not as robust as that observed in the in vitro translation assay, but this was not surprising given the complexity of the protein synthesis machinery in a whole cell context.</p>

        <p>One possible contributing factor to the observed RGS2 effect on cellular protein synthesis may be that viral infection could promote phosphorylation of serine 51 on eIF2Î±, which itself may impede global protein synthesis. To address this issue, we made use of a previously described mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line in which the gene for eIF2Î± was targeted to mutate the serine 51 phosphorylation site to a nonphosphorylatable alanine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheuner et al., 2001</xref>). Control MEF cells (eIF2<sup>S/S</sup>) and mutant MEF cells (eIF2<sup>A/A</sup>) were used to measure de novo protein synthesis after infection with RGS2 and the RGS2 minigene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Consistent with our results using the H9c2 and MCF-7 cells, a decrease in protein synthesis was also observed in both of these MEF cell lines. The fact that the decrease in de novo protein synthesis was retained in the eIF2<sup>A/A</sup> cells argues that the mechanism by which RGS2 inhibits translation is independent of serine 51 phosphorylation on eIF2Î±. There were no differences observed in the cellular uptake of radiolabeled leucine between the various infection conditions (unpublished data). These data further reinforce the notion that RGS2 may serve a regulatory role in protein synthesis through its interactions with eIF2BÏµ.</p>

        <title>Protein synthesis is elevated in the absence of endogenous RGS2</title>
        <p>Lastly, we went on to investigate the effect of silencing RGS2 expression on cellular protein synthesis. We isolated hepatocytes from wild-type and RGS2 knockout mice (RGS2<sup>â/â</sup>) and compared their levels of de novo protein synthesis. These experiments revealed a 60% increase in protein synthesis in RGS2<sup>â/â</sup> cells compared with wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). These results are in line with previous observations that knocking out either general control nonderepressible-2 or haem-regulated inhibitor decreases eIF2Î± phosphorylation and results in elevated levels of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deng et al., 2002</xref>). We did not observe any difference in the rate of protein catabolism between the two hepatocyte cell cultures (unpublished data). These results are consistent with the notion that in the absence of endogenous RGS2, there would be fewer restrictions on the translational machinery and, therefore, elevated levels of protein synthesis. Collectively, this study provides strong evidence that RGS2 plays a pivotal role in regulating the protein synthesis machinery.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>These results outline a novel function for RGS2 in the control of protein synthesis in addition to its established role as a GAP for heterotrimeric G proteins. RGS2 is able to bind to the Ïµ subunit of the GEF, eIF2B, and this interaction appears to interfere with the initiation of mRNA translation by preventing guanine nucleotide exchange on eIF2. The notable similarities in protein sequence and tertiary structure between the homologous regions of RGS2 and eIF2Î² led to the hypothesis that RGS2 residues 79â116 play a role in binding eIF2BÏµ. Mutagenesis analyses confirmed that this segment of RGS2 is required for its interaction with eIF2BÏµ and regulation of translation. Furthermore, using an alanine substitution approach, we were able to identify key residues involved in the proteinâprotein interaction. The near complete loss of eIF2BÏµ binding and inhibition of in vitro translation by RGS2-ala2 suggests the nine substituted residues within this mutant protein are critical contact points for RGS2âeIF2BÏµ interactions. This is consistent with the fact that these nine residues are identical between the homologous segments of RGS2 and eIF2Î². It is noteworthy to point out the four amino acid substitutions that are unique to RGS2-ala2: L79, E86, L87, and I110. This suggests that these residues are responsible for the observed difference in eIF2BÏµ binding between RGS2-ala2 and RGS2-ala1; the residual interactive forces for binding eIF2BÏµ would presumably be made up of the remaining five overlapping substitutions, although this cannot be conclusively stated at this point in time. The successful crystallization of an RGS2âeIF2BÏµ complex (or parts thereof) will provide more information on the molecular determinants for this interaction.</p>
      <p>Several potential links between G proteinâmediated signaling networks and cellular control of protein synthesis have previously been noted, although no direct effects on the initiation of mRNA translation have been established. The Î± subunit of eIF2B has been reported to interact with the carboxyl tails of the Î±2A, Î±2B, Î±2C, and Î²2 adrenergic receptors in a yeast two-hybrid screen, but not to the carboxyl tail of the vasopressin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klein et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, eIF2BÎ± has been shown to interact with the third intracellular loop of the Î±2B and Î±2C adrenergic receptors in a manner that may be dependent on 14â3-3Î¶ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prezeau et al., 1999</xref>). The third intracellular loop of the M<sub>4</sub> muscarinic receptor, but not M<sub>1</sub> or M<sub>2</sub>, was also reported to associate with eukaryotic elongation factor 1A2 to promote guanine nucleotide exchange on the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McClatchy et al., 2002</xref>), which was suggested to be a mechanism of regulating M<sub>4</sub> muscarinic receptor recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McClatchy et al., 2006</xref>). No effects of RGS proteins on mRNA translation have been reported until now, although RGS1 was identified as a binding partner for eIF3Î´ in a yeast two-hybrid screen (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signaling-gateway.org/data/Y2H/cgi-bin/y2h_int.cgi?id=17628">http://www.signaling-gateway.org/data/Y2H/cgi-bin/y2h_int.cgi?id=17628</ext-link>). The latter interaction was not confirmed at the protein level, and our study has not shown RGS1 to have any effect on protein synthesis. Nonetheless, these data support a role for G proteinâmediated signaling networks in the control of protein synthesis.</p>
      <p>Under conditions of cellular stress such as oxidative damage, nutrient deprivation, viruses, and heat shock, the overall rate of mRNA translation into protein is reduced (although the synthesis of stress-related proteins is maintained or increased through specialized alternative pathways; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ron, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wek et al., 2006</xref>). A variety of mechanisms exist to reduce global protein synthesis, and for the most part, these involve changes in initiation. Of particular importance is the rate-limiting eIF2âeIF2B interaction, which depends upon both the activity and the availability of the exchange factor eIF2B. The best characterized inhibitory mechanism involves the phosphorylation of Ser51 on the eIF2Î± subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gebauer and Hentze, 2004</xref>). Other mechanisms for inhibiting mRNA translation by way of eIF2B have also been reported. For example, GSK3 directly phosphorylates eIF2BÏµ at serine 540 in intact cells, and this inhibits eIF2B GEF activity by up to 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Welsh et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, it has been shown that the effects of eIF2B on eIF2 can be decreased by the binding of the latter to eIF5. The primary function of eIF5 is to promote GTP hydrolysis by eIF2; however, when present at elevated levels, eIF5 may act to sequester eIF2 from eIF2B, thereby impeding protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singh et al., 2006</xref>). These results suggest a comparable inhibitory mechanism wherein the interaction between eIF2 and eIF2B similarly is hindered by the binding of a third protein, in this case the association of RGS2 with eIF2B. Although the specific protein target differs, the functional consequence in both cases is an attenuation of guanine nucleotide exchange on eIF2.</p>
      <p>One interesting aspect of RGS2 signaling is that RGS2 mRNA and protein expression can be up-regulated in response to the same forms of cellular stress that inhibit protein synthesis, including oxidative stress, heat shock, DNA damage, and mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Siderovski et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zmijewski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song and Jope, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Santos de Araujo et al., 2007</xref>). For example, treatment of 1321N1 astrocytoma cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> leads to the up-regulation of RGS2 mRNA and protein in a concentration-dependent manner, and subjecting these cells to heat shock also results in increased levels of RGS2 mRNA in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zmijewski et al., 2001</xref>). Likewise, when SH-SY5Y cells were treated with the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin, RGS2 mRNA levels were found to increase, whereas RGS4 mRNA levels decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song and Jope, 2006</xref>). Although eIF2Î± phosphorylation and RGS2 up-regulation tend to be triggered by similar stimuli, these two processes are likely distinct and separated on a temporal level. It is conceivable that changes in translation mediated by stress-activated kinases could be prolonged by RGS2 because the increase in its protein levels might be expected to coincide with the eventual dephosphorylation of serine 51 in eIF2Î±. It still remains to be demonstrated whether endogenous RGS2 can attain sufficient protein levels in cells to replicate the effects observed on de novo protein synthesis after viral infection. This has been hindered primarily by the fact that the majority of agents and stressors that up-regulate endogenous RGS2 also induce eIF2Î± phosphorylation, thereby making it difficult to assign the contribution from each signaling event toward controlling protein synthesis. However, the observation that levels of RGS2 required for maximal GAP activity (its established biochemical function) closely mirror those needed in the in vitro translation assay suggest that endogenous levels of RGS2 are sufficient to regulate translation in cells. Moreover, we have shown that endogenous RGS2 and eIF2BÏµ can be coimmunoprecipitated. Other factors, such as the complex and changeable intracellular distribution patterns found with RGS2 and the potential effects of posttranslational modifications, may also play a role. Our attempts to circumvent these obstacles by using the RGS2<sup>â/â</sup> mice provide strong evidence that endogenous levels of RGS2 are sufficient to regulate translation; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed difference in protein synthesis between wild-type and RGS2<sup>â/â</sup> cells is not the result of an indirect effect unrelated to RGS2 regulation of eIF2BÏµ.</p>
      <p>Its up-regulation in response to stress suggests that RGS2 may help to maintain cellular integrity. Indeed, RGS2 has previously been shown to act as a negative regulator of Î±1-adrenergic receptorâstimulated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zou et al., 2006</xref>). In primary cultures of ventricular myocytes, induction of hypertrophy by the Î±1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine resulted in the selective increase of RGS2 mRNA over RGS1, RGS3, RGS4, and RGS5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zou et al., 2006</xref>). Overexpression of RGS2 in these cells completely blocked the phenylephrine-dependent increase in cell size as well as the induced expression of various genetic markers for cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zou et al., 2006</xref>). These results are consistent with the report that down-regulation of endogenous RGS2 by way of RNAi exacerbates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Such findings are typically thought to reflect the negative effects of RGS2 on G<sub>q</sub>-mediated signaling; however, given that hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in protein synthesis and cell size, one could argue based on these results that stress-induced up-regulation of RGS2 expression may impede the development of cardiac hypertrophy by inhibiting global protein synthesis. Indeed, de novo protein synthesis appears to be a requirement for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy to develop in some cell-based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hardt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the present study has identified RGS2 as a component of the protein synthesis machinery. This novel function of RGS2 may serve as an unexpected regulatory mechanism of the cellular stress response. Furthermore, the observation that a minigene coding for the RGS2 residues involved in binding eIF2BÏµ (79â116) is sufficient to inhibit de novo protein synthesis provides a template for the development of drugs to treat diseases that are characterized by impaired protein synthesis such as neoplasias, diabetes, cardiac hypertrophy, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Proud, 2007</xref>).</p>

        <title>RGS protein purification</title>
        <p>Histidine-tagged RGS1 and RGS4 proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) strain and purified to &gt;95% purity by nickel affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography using a 10/30 column (Superdex 75 HR; GE Healthcare) as follows: 4 liters of bacterial culture were incubated with vigorous shaking at 37Â°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.55. Expression of the RGS proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropylthio-Î²-<sc>d</sc>-galactoside for 3 h before harvesting the bacteria by centrifugation. Bacteria were resuspended in 60 ml buffer A (50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10 Âµg/ml leupeptin, 1 Âµg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100), lysozyme was added to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, and the suspension was mixed and incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspension was incubated for an additional 30 min on ice after the addition of 25 Âµg/ml DNase and 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The mixture was centrifuged at 140,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min, and the volume of the supernatant was increased to 100 ml with buffer A supplemented with glycerol and imidazole (final concentrations of 20% and 20 mM, respectively). A 50% slurry of 1.5 ml equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin was added, and the mixture was incubated on a rocking platform for 1.5 h at 4Â°C, loaded onto a 30-ml column, washed with 30 ml of buffer A containing 0.5 M NaCl, and washed with 30 ml of buffer A without Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 200 mM imidazole. These protein samples were loaded and run through a 10/30 column (Superdex 75 HR) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM PMSF), and the peak fractions were collected and stored at â80Â°C.</p>
        <p>Histidine-tagged RGS2 and all its derivative mutants were purified from bacterial inclusion bodies as follows: 2 liters BL21 (DE3) bacterial culture was incubated with vigorous shaking at 37Â°C until mid-log phase. Induction was commenced by the addition of 1 mM isopropylthio-Î²-<sc>d</sc>-galactoside for 3â4 h at 37Â°C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and pellets were stored at â80Â°C. Cells were thawed and resuspended in 30 ml of IB (inclusion body) buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10 Âµg/ml leupeptin, 1 Âµg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100), and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme was added. The suspension was mixed and incubated at 30Â°C for 15 min followed by sonication on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4Â°C, and the pellet was washed by resuspension and centrifugation once with IB buffer and once with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein-refolding process was accomplished by extracting inclusion bodies with extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 6 M guanidine hydrochloride) followed by dialysis against buffer A (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 2 M urea) and buffer B (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 500 mM urea). The refolded protein was purified by nickel chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography as described in the previous paragraph for RGS1 and RGS4 except that the concentration of NaCl was 0.5 M throughout the imidazole elution step and reduced to 0.3 M for the final gel filtration step. For RGS2-ala1 and RGS2-ala2, the proteins were purified by nickel chromatography and dialyzed with storage buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 Âµg/ml aprotinin, 10 Âµg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mM urea) to remove imidazole. Protein samples were placed in aliquots and stored at â80Â°C.</p>

        <title>GTP hydrolysis assay</title>
        <p>Sf9 insect cells at a density of 2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml were infected with baculoviruses encoding GÎ²<sub>1</sub>, GÎ³<sub>2</sub>, and an M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptorâGÎ±<sub>11</sub> fusion protein. At 48 h after infection, cells were centrifuged at 228 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, resuspended in PBS, and centrifuged again. The resulting pellet was resuspended in one third of the original volume of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10 Âµg/ml leupeptin, and 1 Âµg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were lysed using a homogenizer (Polytron; Brinkmann Instruments) and centrifuged at 500 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was retained and centrifuged for 30 min at 48,000 <italic>g</italic>. The supernatant from this centrifugation was discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.01 vol of lysis buffer and stored at â80Â°C.</p>
        <p>Membranes were assayed for carbachol-stimulated GTP hydrolysis for 5 min at 30Â°C in the absence and presence of the indicated RGS proteins. The reaction buffer contained 10<sup>6</sup> cpm/assay Î³-[<sup>32</sup>P]GTP, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 200 nM GTP, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 Âµg/ml aprotinin, 10 Âµg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mM ascorbic acid, 300 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Nonspecific GTPase activity was defined as that in the presence of membranes plus the inverse agonist, 10 ÂµM tropicamide, and these values were subtracted to yield the specific agonist- and receptor-dependent signal. GTP hydrolysis reactions were terminated by the addition of 5% Norit in 50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 3.0. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 2,000 <italic>g</italic>, and <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> was recovered from the supernatant. Radioactivity was measured on a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 2900TR; PerkinElmer).</p>

        <title>In vitro translation assay</title>
        <p>Translation was measured as the synthesis of luciferase protein from luciferase mRNA using an in vitro translation kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, rabbit reticulocyte lysates were combined with 20 ÂµM amino acid mixture, 0.5 Âµg luciferase RNA (Promega), 1Ã low salt translation mix, and RGS proteins where indicated. The final concentration of NaCl in the assay was equalized to 300 mM by dilution.

        <p>Cells were seeded in 12-well cluster plates at a density of 500,000 cells/well. 24 h later, cells were infected with the indicated virus. At 48 h after infection, the growth medium was removed and replaced with reduced-serum medium (Opti-MEM I; Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5 ÂµCi/ml [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine for 4 h. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated on ice with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 Âµg/ml aprotinin, 10 Âµg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% [vol/vol] glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min. Protein concentrations were measured using a BSA protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). An equal volume of the cell lysate was combined with a 25% (wt/vol) solution of trichloroacetic acid to precipitate the protein, subjected to a vigorous vortex, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The mixture was filtered through a filtration apparatus (Millipore) onto glass microfiber disks (GF/C; GE Healthcare) and washed three times each with 5% TCA followed by 100% ethanol. Disks were air dried overnight, and their radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 2900TR; PerkinElmer).</p>

        <title>Coimmunoprecipitation</title>
        <p>For in vitro coimmunoprecipitations, 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml Sf9 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding Flag-tagged eIF2BÏµ subunit alone or coinfected with the three recombinant baculovirus stocks encoding all five eIF2B subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fabian et al., 1997</xref>). At 72 h after infection, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C, and these lysates were mixed with 10 Âµg of RGS protein and subsequently precleared by mixing with protein G beads for 1 h at 4Â°C and then centrifuged. The precleared lysate mixture was incubated with 2 Âµg anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody for 3h at 4Â°C. The protein G beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and were resuspended in 2Ã Laemmli sample buffer.</p>
        <p>For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, confluent UMR-106 cells in a T75 tissue culture flask were incubated for 3 h at 37Â°C with vehicle control or 100 ÂµM forskolin to up-regulate RGS2 expression essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roy et al., 2006b</xref>).
