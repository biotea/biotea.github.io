        <p>The oxidoreductases activity of MagT1, an ER-localized thioredoxin homologue, is necessary for posttranslocational N-glycosylation of acceptor sites that lie proximal to cysteine residues.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Stabilization of protein tertiary structure by disulfides can interfere with glycosylation of acceptor sites (NXT/S) in nascent polypeptides. Here, we show that MagT1, an ER-localized thioredoxin homologue, is a subunit of the STT3B isoform of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). The lumenally oriented active site CVVC motif in MagT1 is required for glycosylation of STT3B-dependent acceptor sites including those that are closely bracketed by disulfides or contain cysteine as the internal residue (NCT/S). The MagT1- and STT3B-dependent glycosylation of cysteine-proximal acceptor sites can be reduced by eliminating cysteine residues. The predominant form of MagT1 in vivo is oxidized, which is consistent with transient formation of mixed disulfides between MagT1 and a glycoprotein substrate to facilitate access of STT3B to unmodified acceptor sites. Cotranslational N-glycosylation by the STT3A isoform of the OST, which lacks MagT1, allows efficient modification of acceptor sites in cysteine-rich protein domains before disulfide bond formation. Thus, mammalian cells use two mechanisms to achieve N-glycosylation of cysteine proximal acceptor sites.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asparagine-linked glycosylation of proteins in the lumen of the rough ER (RER) is an essential protein modification reaction in higher eukaryotes. Most consensus acceptor sites (NXT/S, sequons) are glycosylated by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) as the nascent polypeptide is passing through the protein translocation channel into the RER lumen. However, certain acceptor sites are modified by a posttranslocational pathway (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bolt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013b</xref>). A posttranslocational mode of glycan transfer poses a challenge to efficient glycosylation because protein-folding events, particularly disulfide bond formation, will stabilize protein secondary and tertiary structures that are incompatible with binding of the acceptor sequence to the OST active site (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kowarik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lizak et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Most eukaryotic organisms assemble heterooligomeric OST complexes that consist of a catalytic subunit (an STT3 protein) plus three to seven accessory subunits (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006</xref>). Metazoan organisms express two STT3 proteins (STT3A and STT3B) that are incorporated into distinct OST complexes that have partially overlapping roles in N-linked glycosylation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013b</xref>). The STT3A complex is associated with the protein translocation channel and glycosylates acceptor sites as they enter the lumen of the RER (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Shibatani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>), whereas the STT3B complex can modify sites that are skipped by STT3A (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013b</xref>). In addition to a shared set of noncatalytic subunits (ribophorin I, ribophorin II, OST48, DAD1, and OST4) that are present in both OST complexes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dumax-Vorzet et al., 2013</xref>), there is a growing list of OST-associated proteins or subunits (MagT1, TUSC3, DC2, KPC2, and malectin) that in some cases are isoform specific (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Shibatani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Roboti and High, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Two mammalian proteins, currently annotated as magnesium transporter 1 (MagT1; formerly IAP) and tumor suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3; formerly N33) were initially proposed to be OST subunits based upon homology to the yeast Ost3 and Ost6 proteins (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">MacGrogan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>). The mechanistic role of MagT1 and TUSC3 in protein N-glycosylation has been difficult to biochemically evaluate as these proteins dissociate from the canine OST during purification and are dispensable for glycosylation of synthetic peptide substrates (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>). Despite the modest sequence identity (â¼20%) between yeast Ost3/Ost6 and either TUSC3 or MagT1, the four proteins share a lumenally oriented thioredoxin domain followed by four transmembrane spans (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fetrow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006</xref>). Mutagenesis of the active site CXXC motifs in Ost3 or Ost6 reduces glycan occupancy on specific acceptor sites in yeast glycoproteins (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>). The lumenal domains of Ost6p and TUSC3, both of which have a strongly negative redox potential, have been crystalized, which confirms the predicted thioredoxin fold (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Mohorko et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>MagT1 and TUSC3 have also been proposed to be plasma membrane localized magnesium transporters (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Goytain and Quamme, 2005</xref>). Multiple lines of experimental evidence support the conclusion that MagT1 and TUSC3 are required for magnesium uptake by vertebrate cells (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Clapham, 2009</xref>). However, overexpression of MagT1 alone does not increase the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration in cells even though MagT1, but not TUSC3, is expressed in most human tissues (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Molinari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Clapham, 2009</xref>). MagT1-deficient human lymphocytes display altered kinetics of Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake, but have normal cellular levels of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in the human <italic>TUSC3</italic> gene cause autosomal-recessive mental retardation (ARMR), a disease primarily characterized by mental impairment (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Garshasbi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Molinari et al., 2008</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>MAGT1</italic> gene cause X-linked mental retardation (XLMR; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Molinari et al., 2008</xref>) and X-linked human immunodeficiency syndrome (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Analysis of serum glycoproteins from TUSC3 patients has not disclosed any defect in protein N-glycosylation (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Molinari et al., 2008</xref>), further challenging a direct role for TUSC3 or MagT1 in N-glycosylation.</p><p>Here, we show that MagT1 colocalizes with calreticulin, a lumenal lectin in the RER. We explored the hypothesis that MagT1 is required for efficient glycosylation of certain human glycoproteins. siRNA-mediated depletion of MagT1 reduced glycan occupancy on a panel of STT3B-dependent substrates, which is consistent with native co-IP experiments showing that MagT1 is a subunit of the STT3B complex. Inspection of MagT1-dependent acceptor sites in proteins of known tertiary structure revealed that many MagT1-dependent sites were either closely bracketed by a disulfide or that the sequon contained a disulfide-bonded cysteine as the X residue (i.e., NCT/S sites). The MagT1 dependence of glycosylation was reduced by eliminating sequon-proximal cysteine residues or by reducing the ER lumen with DTT. MagT1-depleted cells were fully complemented by expression of TUSC3, which is indicative of functional redundancy between MagT1 and TUSC3. In the cell, the majority of MagT1 is in the oxidized state. Therefore, MagT1 can form a transient mixed disulfide with a free thiol in a glycoprotein substrate, thereby delaying disulfide bond formation until STT3B glycosylates the acceptor site. The reduced form of MagT1 can react with a disulfide in a nascent polypeptide to allow access of STT3B to an inaccessible sequon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>MagT1 resides in the ER</title><p>Direct roles for MagT1 in both N-linked glycosylation and magnesium uptake are incompatible unless one invokes both a dual localization (RER and plasma membrane) and a dual activity (oxidoreductase and Mg<sup>+2</sup> channel). Intact HeLa cells were treated with a membrane impermeable amine-reactive biotinylation reagent to label cell surface proteins. Biotinylated proteins that were collected on streptavidin beads were electrophoresed adjacent to an aliquot of the total HeLa cell extract to quantify the percentage of each antigen that was accessible to the biotinylation reagent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was strongly enriched in the streptavidin-bound fraction relative to the Î± subunit of the F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase, a mitochondrial protein that served as the negative control. MagT1 and two subunits of the OST (STT3B and ribophorin I) showed very low reactivity with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, which is consistent with an intracellular localization. Broken cells likely account for the 2â3% of intracellular proteins that were recovered on the streptavidin beads.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>MagT1 is localized to the RER.</bold> (A) Cell-surface proteins labeled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin were isolated with streptavidin beads (SA-bound) and were resolved adjacent to sample input lanes by SDS-PAGE.

HeLa cells were transfected with an expression vector for MagT1-V5 to allow simultaneous staining for MagT1-V5 and the luminal ER protein calreticulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, dâf). Colocalization of MagT1-V5 and calreticulin confirmed that MagT1 is an ER resident protein.</p></sec><sec><title>MagT1 depletion reduces glycosylation of STT3B-dependent substrates</title><p>siRNA duplexes were designed to explore a role for MagT1 in N-linked glycosylation. HeLa cells treated with MagT1 siRNA typically showed a two- to threefold reduction in MagT1 content after 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Expression of STT3A, STT3B, ribophorin I, or the protein translocation channel (Sec61) was not reduced by treatment with the MagT1 siRNA. In contrast, depletion of STT3B was accompanied by a marked reduction in MagT1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Mutations in the human STT3A and STT3B genes cause two newly described forms of congenital disorders of glycosylation type 1 (CDG-1; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013a</xref>). Protein immunoblot analysis revealed that STT3B-CDG fibroblasts have a lower cellular content of both STT3B and MagT1 relative to STT3A-CDG fibroblasts or normal control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), providing additional evidence that stable expression of MagT1 is dependent on STT3B.</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Hypoglycosylation of STT3B-dependent substrates in MagT1-depleted cells.</bold> (A and CâF) HeLa cells were treated with NC or siRNAs specific for STT3A, STT3B, or MagT1 for 72 h. (A) HeLa cell extracts and cRM were resolved by PAGE in SDS and analyzed by protein immunoblotting using the specified antisera. MagT1-T7 expressed in HeLa cells verified recognition of MagT1 by the anti-MagT1 sera. Expression values relative to cells treated with the NC siRNA are for the displayed image, which is representative of two or more experiments. (B) Cell extracts prepared from STT3A-CDG, STT3B-CDG, and normal control (42F and 50F) fibroblasts were resolved by PAGE in SDS and analyzed by protein immunoblotting. The F0F1-ATPase Î± (A) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; B) served as gel loading controls. The asterisks in A and B designate a nonspecific product recognized by the anti-STT3B sera. Protein expression levels for OST subunits were normalized to the F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase Î± subunit loading control and are expressed relative to the NC siRNA lane. (CâF) After 48 h of siRNA treatment, cells were transfected with expression vectors for SHBG (C), or Hpx (Hpx-DDKHis or HpxÎ145-DDKHis; D) and pulse-chase labeled (4 min pulse, 20 min chase) after an additional 24 h. (E and F) After 72 h of siRNA treatment, cells were pulse labeled for 4 min and chased for 10 min. As indicated, samples were digested with EH after immunoprecipitation with anti-SHBG (C), anti-DDK (D), anti-SapD (E), or anti-granulin (F). Glycoforms resolved by PAGE in SDS are labeled to indicate the number of N-linked glycans. EH-digested proteins migrate slightly slower than the nonglycosylated protein because of the presence of a single residual GlcNAc residue at each site. Quantified values below gel lanes (CâF) are for the displayed image, which is representative of two or more experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201404083R_Fig2"/></fig><p>We next asked whether MagT1 depletion causes a reduction in N-glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins. For this analysis, we used a panel of substrates that have acceptor sites that are mainly glycosylated by either the STT3A or STT3B complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, CâF</xref>). The two extreme C-terminal sequons in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are posttranslocationally glycosylated by STT3B (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013b</xref>). A diagram of SHBG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201404083/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 D</ext-link>) shows the location of acceptor sites and cysteine residues. After 48 h of siRNA treatment, HeLa cells were transfected with an SHBG expression vector and pulse labeled 24 h later. Incomplete modification of the N<sub>380</sub>RS site in SHBG is responsible for the glycoform doublet synthesized by control cells (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013b</xref>). Endoglycosidase H (EH) digestion provides a mobility marker for the nonglycosylated protein. MagT1 or STT3B depletion caused a similar reduction in glycosylation of SHBG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The partial block in glycosylation of SHBG in siRNA-treated cells is primarily explained by the incomplete depletion of STT3B or MagT1. Hemopexin (Hpx; Fig. S1 C) has five glycosylation sites including internal (N<sub>187</sub>CS) and C-terminal (N<sub>453</sub>VT) STT3B-dependent acceptor sites (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal and Gilmore, 2013</xref>). Depletion of MagT1 or STT3B caused the synthesis of Hpx glycoforms that lack one or two glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Cells were transfected with the HpxÎ145 construct, which retains the internal STT3B-dependent site and an STT3B-independent site (N<sub>240</sub>GT). Glycosylation of the (N<sub>187</sub>CS) site requires MagT1 in addition to STT3B. MagT1 was also required for glycosylation of the extreme C-terminal sequon in Î²-glucuronidase (Î²-GUS; Fig. S2, A and B). Prosaposin (pSAP; Fig. S1 A) and progranulin (pGran; Fig. S1 B) are endogenous HeLa cell STT3A-dependent substrates (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013a</xref>). Prosaposin is hypoglycosylated in STT3A-depleted cells, but not in STT3B- or MagT1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Serendipitous proteolytic processing of progranulin at a granulin repeat boundary in the cell lysis buffer yields a more rapidly migrating form of progranulin (pGran-S) with resolution of the granulin glycoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). MagT1 or STT3B depletion does not cause hypoglycosylation of granulin.</p></sec><sec><title>MagT1 is a subunit of the STT3B complex</title><p>Whereas Magt1 depletion caused selective hypoglycosylation of STT3B-dependent acceptor sites, we conducted native coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments to determine whether MagT1 is present in the STT3B complex, but not the STT3A complex. Canine pancreas microsomal membranes were solubilized with the nonionic detergent digitonin and incubated with anti-STT3B IgG or control IgG beads. Proteins that interact with STT3B were selectively eluted with an immunoprecipitation wash buffer containing mixed detergent micelles (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) instead of digitonin. The major eluted proteins that were detected by silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>) include the previously identified OST subunits (STT3B, ribophorin I, ribophorin II, and OST48), as confirmed by protein immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) and liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). High peptide coverages were obtained for Rb-I, Rb-II, OST48, DADI, and malectin, with somewhat lower peptide coverage for proteins with multiple transmembrane spans (STT3B and MagT1). The 34-kD protein detected by silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>) co-migrates with both MagT1 and malectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

Previously identified STT3B-dependent glycosylation sites can be grouped into three categories: (1) extreme C-terminal sequons, (2) internal sequons (NXT/S) that are closely bracketed by a disulfide in the folded protein, and (3) internal NCT/S sequons where the cysteine residue is disulfide bonded in the mature protein. The STT3B dependence of extreme C-terminal acceptor sites is not explained by the presence of nearby disulfides or cysteine residues in the folded protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201404083/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2</ext-link>).</p><p>Procathepsin C (pCatC; Fig. S1 E) has two NCT/S sites, one of which (N<sub>29</sub>CT) is mainly glycosylated by the STT3B complex before nascent chain termination (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>).

The partial restoration of glycosylation that is provided by the MagT1 m1 or TUSC3 m1 mutants indicates that MagT1 or TUSC3 is needed for both oxidoreductase-dependent and -independent functions of the STT3B complex.</p><fig id="fig5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Requirement for active site cysteine residues in MagT1 and TUSC3.</bold> (A) Diagrams of MagT1 and TUSC3 showing the N-terminal signal sequence (gray), lumenal thioredoxin domain (yellow) with active-site CXXC motif, glycosylation site, noncatalytic cysteine residues (red squares), and membrane spanning segments (black).

In contrast, glycosylation of pCatCÎ234-HA C118S remained MagT1 dependent, demonstrating that C30 can form a nonnative disulfide that interferes with glycosylation of the N<sub>29</sub>CT site. As observed for pCatCÎ234-HA, the MagT1-V5 C87S mutant allowed near-normal glycosylation of pCatCÎ234-HA C118S. We next asked whether the MagT1-V5 mutants were able to promote glycosylation of the disulfide bracketed N<sub>360</sub>IT site in factor VII. None of the MagT1-V5 cysteine mutants were active, which indicated that the oxidized form of MagT1 is necessary for promoting glycosylation of the N<sub>360</sub>IT site in factor VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>).</p><p>Elimination of one of the active site cysteine residues in an oxidoreductase will stabilize mixed disulfide adducts.

To determine whether the MagT1 mutants form mixed disulfides, intact HeLa cells expressing wild-type or mutant versions of MagT1 were treated with <italic>N</italic>-ethyl maleimide (NEM) to prevent disulfide bond formation or exchange after cell lysis. Cell extracts were resolved by nonreducing or reducing SDS-PAGE to separate MagT1 from potential MagT1-mixed disulfide adducts. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies to the V5 tag detected MagT1-V5 as well as higher molecular weight immunoreactive products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>) ranging in size between 55 and 170 kD. The major adducts (55â75 kD) were DTT sensitive, hence they correspond to mixed disulfides between a MagT1 mutant and 25â40 kD proteins. The higher molecular weight adducts (&gt;80 kD) included both DTT-sensitive and -insensitive MagT1 adducts. As expected, DTT-sensitive adducts were not formed in cells expressing wild-type MagT1 or the MagT1-V5 C87S C90S mutant, demonstrating that stabilized adduct formation is dependent on the presence of a single cysteine in the CXXC motif.</p><p>We used a previously described sequential cysteine alkylation procedure (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Jessop and Bulleid, 2004</xref>) to probe the redox status of the catalytic cysteine residues in MagT1. Intact HeLa cells were (a) untreated; (b) incubated with dipyridyl disulfide (DPS), a cell-permeable oxidizing reagent; or (c) incubated with DTT, a cell-permeable reducing agent. The latter two treatments will, respectively, oxidize or reduce the CVVC motif in MagT1. Subsequent treatment of intact cells with NEM alkylates solvent exposed cysteine residues and blocked disulfide exchange reactions during cell lysis. Subsequent alkylation of the cell extracts with a higher molecular weight maleimide (4-acetamido-4â²-malemidylstilbene-2,2â²-disulfonic acid; AMS) in the presence of a thiol-free reducing agent (tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine; TCEP) allows resolution of the fully oxidized and reduced forms of MagT1 on an SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). The majority of MagT1 from untreated cells co-migrated with DPS-oxidized MagT1, which indicates that the redox environment of the RER favors the oxidized CVVC motif. We also detected a less abundant reduced form of MagT1. PDI from untreated cells, which served as an internal control, mainly co-migrated with DTT-treated PDI, which is consistent with previous studies indicating that the fully reduced and semi-oxidized forms of PDI are the predominant forms in vivo (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Jessop and Bulleid, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Appenzeller-Herzog and Ellgaard, 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The cellular role of MagT1 and TUSC3 was controversial due to conflicting studies that these proteins are either magnesium transporters or OST subunits (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Goytain and Quamme, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Clapham, 2009</xref>).

For that reason, it is remarkable that MagT1 and TUSC3 exclusively assemble with the STT3B isoform of the OST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Consistent with evidence that MagT1 and TUSC3 do not coprecipitate or copurify with STT3A (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Shibatani et al., 2005</xref>), MagT1 is not required for glycosylation of STT3A-dependent substrates. Proteins that are strongly STT3A dependent (prosaposin and progranulin) are composed of small independent folding domains with multiple disulfides per repeat unit (Fig. S1, A and B). We conclude that cotranslational scanning of the nascent polypeptide by the translocation channelâassociated STT3A complex allows efficient glycosylation of acceptor sites before disulfide bond formation in substrates that have a high density of cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). When cotranslational glycosylation of progranulin or prosaposin is reduced by STT3A depletion, the STT3B isoform of the OST is not able to efficiently modify these sites despite the presence of MagT1, presumably because of the rapid formation of multiple disulfides that stabilize the small protein domains. Transferrin, another disulfide-rich protein that is cotranslationally glycosylated by STT3A (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013b</xref>), has cysteine residue within five residues of both acceptor sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxidoreductase activity of MagT1 and TUSC3</title><p>Both TUSC3 and MagT1 can be functionally incorporated into the STT3B complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>), which indicates that MagT1 and TUSC3 have overlapping functions in cells that express both proteins. Analysis of the role of MagT1 in glycosylation of factor VII and cathepsin C was particularly informative. The N<sub>360</sub>IT site in factor VII is posttranslocationally glycosylated by an STT3B- and MagT1-dependent process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Mutagenesis of the cysteine residues flanking the N<sub>360</sub>IT site caused a slight reduction in skipping by STT3A, and accelerated the kinetics of posttranslocational glycosylation. Previous studies have shown that complete oxidation of the cysteine residues in factor VII lags behind glycosylation of the N<sub>360</sub>IT site (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bolt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>). We propose that the oxidized CXXC motif in MagT1 reacts with a cysteine residue flanking the N<sub>360</sub>IT site in factor VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>) to form a transient mixed disulfide. Mutagenesis of one or both cysteine residues in the CXXC motif of MagT1 blocked the ability of MagT1 to facilitate glycosylation of the N<sub>360</sub>IT site in factor VII. After glycosylation, the substrate would be released from MagT1 by reaction of the free MagT1 thiol with the mixed disulfide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). This should be the predominant reaction pathway for MagT1 in the cell.</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that glycosylation of the N<sub>29</sub>CT site in pCatC involves reduction of a nonnative disulfide in pCatC by the reduced form of MagT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). Glycosylation of the N<sub>29</sub>CT site in cathepsin C was MagT1 dependent unless C30 was replaced with an alanine residue or the ER lumen was reduced with DTT. Mutagenesis of C118, which forms the native disulfide with C30, did not eliminate the MagT1 dependence of N<sub>30</sub>CT glycosylation. The C87S mutant of MagT1 stimulated glycosylation of the N<sub>29</sub>CT site within both the context of pCatCÎ234-HA and pCatCÎ234-HA C118S, which suggests that C90 in MagT1 forms a mixed disulfide with pCatC upon reduction of a nonnative disulfide involving C30 and a second cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). Importantly, formation of a mixed disulfide between C30 and MagT1 would not promote glycosylation, but would delay glycosylation by blocking entry of the sequon into the STT3B active site. Formation of mixed disulfides between MagT1 C87S and MagT1 C90S and HeLa cell proteins supports the conclusion that a reduced form of MagT1 can react with protein disulfides.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of yeast homologues of MagT1 in protein glycosylation</title><p>Yeast OST complexes have a single copy of Ost3p or Ost6p (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Knauer and Lehle, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Spirig et al., 2005</xref>). The active site CXXC motif of Ost6p is strongly reducing, hence Ost6p is thought to be fully oxidized in vivo (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>). Ost3p and Ost6p are required for efficient glycosylation of a subset of yeast acceptor sites that are on average closer to a cysteine residue in the substrate than sequons that are not Ost3p or Ost6p dependent (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>). Ost3p or Ost6p are proposed to form a mixed disulfide with a free cysteine residue in the nascent polypeptide as it enters the ER lumen, thereby delaying disulfide bond formation until STT3 can modify the cysteine-proximal sequons in the substrate (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>). Fungal STT3 proteins are more closely related to STT3B than STT3A (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013b</xref>), which is consistent with exclusive assembly of MagT1 or TUSC3 into the STT3B complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequon skipping by STT3A correlates with MagT1 dependence</title><p>Here, we analyzed glycosylation of acceptor sites in seven human glycoproteins that have a total of 27 glycosylation sites located within 15 residues of the nearest cysteine residue (Fig. S1). Although glycosylation of only 7 of the 27 sites was dependent on STT3B and MagT1, proximity to a cysteine residue does not provide a reliable basis for predicting whether a sequon is MagT1 dependent.</p><p>Sequon skipping by the translocation channelâassociated STT3A complex provides a far stronger basis for predicting whether a cysteine-proximal site is MagT1 dependent. The N<sub>29</sub>CT site in pCatC and the N<sub>187</sub>CS site in Hpx are examples of MagT1-dependent sites that have a cysteine residue as the X position. Even though cathepsin C has two sequons with internal cysteine residues, glycosylation of the N<sub>53</sub>CS site in pCatC occurs by a MagT1 independent pathway. Why are certain NCT/S sites skipped by STT3A, while others are not? Our previous conclusion (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>) that sequon skipping of the N<sub>29</sub>CT site by the STT3A complex was caused by proximity to the signal sequence was verified by inserting a spacer segment that now allowed cotranslational glycosylation of the NCT site by STT3A. Cysteine 188 in Hpx (N<sub>187</sub>CS site) forms a disulfide with a nearby cysteine residue (C200) in the folded protein (Fig. S1 C). The STT3B dependence of N187 glycosylation was greatly reduced by replacing the suboptimal NCS site with an NCT site (S188T mutation; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal and Gilmore, 2013</xref>) due to a reduction in site skipping by STT3A.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxidoreductase-independent roles for the Ost3/Ost6 family</title><p>Extreme C-terminal sequons, which are skipped with high probability by the STT3A complex (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013b</xref>), are MagT1 dependent in substrates that are bracketed by disulfides (Hpx and SHBG; Fig. S1, C and D) as well as substrates that lack nearby disulfides (Î²-GUS and the SHBG C362S C390S mutant; Fig. S2, B and C). Thus, MagT1 is required for the full activity of the STT3B complex even when the oxidoreductase activity is not required for glycosylation of a specific acceptor site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). Oxidoreductase-dependent and -independent roles for Ost3p and Ost6p in N-glycosylation have also been described previously (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>). TUSC3 has a hydrophobic peptide binding pocket near the active site that can accommodate a cysteine containing peptide in two orientations (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Mohorko et al., 2014</xref>). This peptide-binding activity of the Ost3 protein family might be responsible for their oxidoreductase-independent role in N-glycosylation. Further experiments are needed to determine whether MagT1, by virtue of a peptide binding activity, directs glycoprotein substrates into the catalytic site of STT3B.</p></sec><sec><title>MagT1 and TUSC3 deficiencies cause milder forms of CDG-I than an STT3B deficiency</title><p>The <italic>TUSC3</italic> ARMR and <italic>MAGT1</italic> XLMR patients described to date do not have the wide spectrum of additional developmental and multiorgan abnormalities that are associated with CDG-I in general (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Freeze and Aebi, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Haeuptle and Hennet, 2009</xref>) or with STT3B-CDG (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013a</xref>). Importantly, three TUSC3 ARMR patients in one consanguineous family have a homozygous nonsense mutation (Q55X) in the TUSC3 gene; therefore the less severe phenotype of TUSC3 ARMR relative to STT3B-CDG cannot be explained by a partial loss-of-function allele (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Garshasbi et al., 2011</xref>). Hypoglycosylated variants of serum transferrin, the standard diagnostic marker for CDG-1, are not present in the serum of TUSC3 ARMR patients, nor are there alterations in the structure of protein-linked oligosaccharides (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Molinari et al., 2008</xref>). However, serum transferrin is primarily synthesized by the liver, an organ that does not express TUSC3 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Molinari et al., 2008</xref>). Because transferrin is an STT3A-dependent substrate that was not hypoglycosylated by a patient with STT3B-CDG (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013a</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), a MagT1 deficiency should also not cause hypoglycosylation of transferrin. For these reasons, there was no direct evidence that ARMR or XLMR was caused by a defect in protein N-glycosylation or that these syndromes were related to CDG-1. The overlapping functions of MagT1 and TUSC3 likely explain why TUSC3-ARMR and MAGT1-XLMR patients have less severe clinical symptoms than the patient with STT3B-CDG (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Shrimal et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>Protein glycosylation and disulfide bond formation can be viewed as competing reactions in the lumen of the ER because nascent polypeptides cease to be OST substrates upon acquiring a folded conformation. Efficient cotranslational glycosylation of sequons by the translocation channelâassociated STT3A complex minimizes competition between disulfide bond formation and protein glycosylation even when sequons are located in cysteine-rich protein domains like those found in granulin, prosaposin, and transferrin. Here, we have shown that MagT1 and TUSC3 are oxidoreductases that exclusively assemble with the STT3B isoform of the OST to facilitate glycosylation of sequons that are skipped by the STT3A complex and are proximal to cysteine residues in the nascent glycoprotein. Together, these two mechanisms for mediating glycosylation of cysteine proximal sequons reduce competition between disulfide bond formation and N-glycosylation in metazoan glycoproteins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Protein expression vectors</title><p>Plasmids encoding MagT1 (NCBI <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:nucleotide" xlink:href="NM_032121">NM_032121</ext-link>) and TUSC3 (NCBI <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:nucleotide" xlink:href="NM_178234">NM_178234</ext-link>) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.
