      <abstract>
        <p>We have reported that integrins crosstalk with growth factors through direct binding to growth factors (e.g., fibroblast growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), neuregulin-1, fractalkine) and subsequent ternary complex formation with cognate receptor [e.g., integrin/IGF1/IGF1 receptor (IGF1R)]. IGF1 and IGF2 are overexpressed in cancer and major therapeutic targets. We previously reported that IGF1 binds to integrins Î±Î½Î²3 and Î±6Î²4, and the R36E/R37E mutant in the C-domain of IGF1 is defective integrin binding and signaling functions of IGF1, and acts as an antagonist of IGF1R. We studied if integrins play a role in the signaling functions of IGF2, another member of the IGF family. Here we describe that IGF2 specifically binds to integrins Î±Î½Î²3 and Î±6Î²4, and induced proliferation of CHO cells (IGF1R+) that express Î±Î½Î²3 or Î±6Î²4 (Î²3- or Î±6Î²4-CHO cells). Arg residues to Glu at positions 24, 34, 37 and/or 38 in or close to the C-domain of IGF2 play a critical role in binding to integrins and signaling functions. The R24E/R37E/R38E, R34E/R37E/R38E, and R24E/R34E/R37E/R38E mutants were defective in integrin binding and IGF2 signaling. These mutants suppressed proliferation induced by WT IGF2, suggesting that they are dominant-negative antagonists of IGF1R. These results suggest that IGF2 also requires integrin binding for signaling functions, and the IGF2 mutants that cannot bind to integrins act as antagonists of IGF1R. The present study defines the role of the C-domain in integrin binding and signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Integrins are transmembrane receptor heterodimers formed by Î± and Î² chains. Integrins bind to extracellular matrix ligands (e.g., fibronectin, collagen, and vitronectin), cell surface ligands (e.g., intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and soluble ligands including several growth factors [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several integrins, including Î±Î½Î²3 and Î±6Î²4 are overexpressed in human cancers [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We have reported that integrins crosstalk with growth factors through direct binding to growth factors [e.g., fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF1) [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], neuregulin-1 [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], fractalkine [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]] and subsequent ternary complex formation with cognate receptor [e.g., integrin/IGF1/insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF1R)] [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We describe this as the ternary complex model of growth factor signaling. The importance of integrins in growth factor signaling was underscored by the findings that the growth factor mutants that cannot bind to integrins are defective in signaling while they still bind to cognate receptors and are dominant-negative antagonists. In the case of IGF1, an IGF1 mutant in which the Arg residues at positions 36 and 37 to Glu mutant, R36E/R37E was defective in inducing IGF1R signaling and suppressed cell proliferation induced by WT IGF1 in vitro and tumor growth in vivo (dominant-negative antagonistic action)[<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The dominant-negative growth factor mutants we developed have potential as therapeutic agents and are useful tools for studying the role of integrins in growth factor signaling. It is still unclear if integrins play a role in signaling functions of other members of the same growth factor family. We recently reported that the integrin-binding defective mutants of FGF2 (basic FGF) are defective in signaling functions and potently suppressed angiogenesis induced by WT FGF2, suggesting that integrins may be common co-receptors for other members of the FGF family as well [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These findings urged us to study if IGF2, another member of the IGF/insulin family, requires integrin binding for signaling functions.</p>
      <p>IGF1 and IGF2 are homologues and share 67% sequence identity [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and are involved in growth and development of many tissues in the human body and in tumor growth [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. IGF1 and IGF2 induce cell proliferation through IGF1R [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. IGF2 binding to the extracellular subunit of IGF1R induces phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase of the intracellular Î² subunit of the receptor, resulting in the activation of MAPK pathway and PI3K/AKT pathway [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>We studied the role of integrins in IGF2 signaling through IGF1R. We show that IGF2 binds to integrins Î±Î½Î²3 and Î±6Î²4, and induces intracellular signaling in an integrin-dependent manner in CHO cells (IGF1R+) that overexpress these integrins. We located the integrin-binding site of IGF2 in the C-domain that connects B and A domains, suggesting that the C-domain plays a critical role in IGF signaling. The IGF2 mutants defective in integrin binding were defective in signaling and acted as antagonists of IGF1R, indicating that the IGF2 signaling also fits well with the ternary complex model.</p>

        <p>We studied if soluble integrin Î±vÎ²3 binds to immobilized IGF2 in an ELISA-type binding assay. We found that soluble Î±vÎ²3 bound to IGF2 in a dose dependent manner, but did not bind to wells coated only with BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184285.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We studied if Î±vÎ²3 on the cell surface binds to immobilized IGF2 in adhesion assays using CHO cells that express recombinant hamster Î±v/human Î²3 hybrid (Î²3-CHO cells). Î²3-CHO cells adhered to IGF2 in a dose dependent manner, but control CHO cells that express human integrin Î²1 (Î²1-CHO) or parent CHO cells did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184285.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7E3 (specific to human Î²3) and cyclic RGDfV (a specific inhibitor of Î±vÎ²3) reduced the ability of Î²3-CHO cells to bind to IGF2 in adhesion assays, but control mouse IgG or DMSO did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184285.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These results suggest that WT IGF2 specifically binds to Î±vÎ²3.</p>

        <title>Development of IGF2 mutants that are defective in binding to integrin</title>
        <p>Our results so far suggest that Î±vÎ²3 binds to IGF2 and is involved in IGF1R signaling. To further study the role of Î±Î½Î²3 in IGF2 signaling, we generated IGF2 mutants that are defective in integrin binding. We previously reported that Arg36 and Arg37 in the C-domain of IGF1 are critical for integrin-binding [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Based on the homology between IGF2 and IGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184285.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), we substituted Arg residues at positions 24, 30, 34, 37, 38, and 40 in and around the C-domain of IGF2 were mutated to Glutamic acid. The IGF2 mutants were tested for the ability to bind to Î±Î½Î²3 in adhesion assays using Î²3-CHO cells. Although single point mutations did not effectively suppress integrin binding, the combined R24E/R37E/R38E, R34E/R37E/R38E, and R24E/R34E/R37E/R38E mutations effectively suppressed the binding of IGF2 to Î²3-CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184285.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>).

            <p>a. Alignment of IGF1, IGF2 and insulin. Previous studies showed that the critical amino acid residues for integrin binding in IGF1 are present in the C-domain (Arg36 and Arg37, in blue) (5). Thus several Arg residues at positions 24, 30, 34, 37, 38 and 40 (in red) of IGF2 in and around the C-domain were selected for mutagenesis. b and c. Mutations in the predicted integrin-binding interface of IGF2 suppress integrin binding of IGF2. Wells of 96-well microtiter plate were coated with WT and mutant IGF2.

        <p>We studied if the IGF2 mutants bind to the immobilized soluble IGF1R ectodomain in ELISA-type assays. We detected the binding of WT and three IGF2 mutants to IGF1R. R24E/R37E/R38E bound to IGF1R to the similar extent to that of WT IGF2, but the binding of R34E/R37E/R38E and R24E/R34E/R37E/R38E was weaker than that of WT IGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184285.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). We showed that the three integrin-binding defective IGF2 mutants when added in excess suppressed signaling induced by WT IGF2 (dominant-negative effect) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184285.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The dominant-negative effect requires that the IGF2 mutants bind to IGF1R. It is likely that the reduced IGF1R binding of R34E/R37E/R38E and R24E/R34E/R37E/R38E is still enough to induce the dominant-negative effect.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we establish that IGF2 specifically binds to Î±Î½Î²3 and induced proliferation of Î²3-CHO cells and cyclic RGDfV suppressed the cell proliferation induced by IGF2. This suggests that the binding of IGF2 to integrin Î±Î½Î²3 plays a role in IGF2/IGF1R signaling, as in the case of IGF1 [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and IGF2 signaling fits well with the ternary complex model of growth factor signaling. The present findings also suggest that similar strategy can be used in general to identify dominant-negative antagonists of growth factors if they fit with the ternary complex model.</p>
      <p>The biological role of the C-domains of IGF1 and IGF2 has not been established. In our previous studies, IGF1 binds to integrins Î±Î½Î²3, amino acid residues of IGF1 critical for integrin binding were localized in the C-domain (Arg residues at positions 36 and 37) [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which are conserved between IGF2 and IGF1. In the present study, we establish that Arg residues at positions 24, 34, 37, and 38 in and close to the C-domain play a critical role in integrin binding, suggesting that the C-domain of IGF2 is involved in integrin binding as in IGF1. Consistently, the C-domains of IGF1 and 2 are evolutionally as conserved as the B- and A-chains, in contrast to the less conserved C-chain of proinsulin, consistent with the idea that the C-domains of IGF1 and IGF2 play an important role in signaling. Our previous studies show that IGF1 induces integrin/IGF1/IGF1R ternary complex formation on the cell surface [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, it is highly likely that the C-domain is exposed to the surface when IGF1 and IGF2 bind to IGF1R and becomes accessible to integrins. Interestingly, Drosophila insulin-like peptide-6 (DILP6) contains a short C-domain that is well conserved and contains conserved Arg/Lys residues [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This suggests the possibility that DILP6 C-domain may interact with integrins and DILP6 may have similar properties to those of human IGFs.</p>
      <p>We used the integrin-binding defective IGF2 mutants (R24E/R37E/R38E, R34E/R37E/R38E, and R24E/R34E/R37E/R38E) to define the role of integrins in IGF2 signaling. The IGF2 mutants were defective in activating IGF1R and in inducing intracellular signaling and cell proliferation in Î²3-CHO cells. These findings suggest that IGF2 requires integrin binding to induce signaling through IGF1R, as in the case of IGF1 [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We previously reported that an IGF1 mutant defective in integrin binding (R36E/R37E) acted as a dominant negative antagonist of IGF1R [<xref rid="pone.0184285.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Excess IGF2 mutants reduced cell proliferation induced by WT IGF2 in Î²3-CHO cells, suggesting that the integrin-binding defective IGF2 mutants are dominant-negative antagonists of IGF1R. Taken together, our studies indicate that integrin Î±Î½Î²3 is involved in IGF2 signaling through IGF1R. We also found that integrin Î±6Î²4 bound to WT IGF2 but not to R24E/R37E/R38E, R34E/R37E/R38E, and R24E/R34E/R37E/R38E, and that WT IGF2 induced proliferation of Î±6Î²4-CHO cells but not control Î²1-CHO cells, and that WT IGF2 induced proliferation of Î±6Î²4-CHO cells but not the IGF2 mutants. The results suggest that integrin Î±6Î²4 is also involved in IGF2 signaling through IGF1R activation. These findings suggest that integrins (e.g., Î±Î½Î²3 and Î±6Î²4) are common co-receptors for IGF1 and IGF2 signaling and that the C-domain is critically involved in integrin binding and that this property is conserved between IGF1 and IGF2. Insulin, which is homologous to IGF1 and IGF2, has no C-domain and thus it would be interesting to study if integrins play a role in insulin signaling in future studies.</p>

The dilution was kept for 16 hrs at 4Â°C with a slow stirring movement. Then the proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration. Around 2 milligrams of purified proteins were obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture. WT IGF2 protein concentration was determined by measuring A<sub>280</sub>.</p>
