      <abstract>
        <p>Laminins are heterotrimeric molecules composed of an Î±, a Î², and a Î³ chain; they have broad functional roles in development and in stabilizing epithelial structures. Here, we identified a novel laminin, composed of known Î± and Î² chains but containing a novel Î³ chain, Î³3. We have cloned gene encoding this chain, LAMC3, which maps to chromosome 9 at q31-34. Protein and cDNA analyses demonstrate that Î³3 contains all the expected domains of a Î³ chain, including two consensus glycosylation sites and a putative nidogen-binding site. This suggests that Î³3-containing laminins are likely to exist in a stable matrix.</p>
        <p>Studies of the tissue distribution of Î³3 chain show that it is broadly expressed in: skin, heart, lung, and the reproductive tracts. In skin, Î³3 protein is seen within the basement membrane of the dermal-epidermal junction at points of nerve penetration. The Î³3 chain is also a prominent element of the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells of: lung, oviduct, epididymis, ductus deferens, and seminiferous tubules. The distribution of Î³3-containing laminins on the apical surfaces of a variety of epithelial tissues is novel and suggests that they are not found within ultrastructurally defined basement membranes. It seems likely that these apical laminins are important in the morphogenesis and structural stability of the ciliated processes of these cells.</p>

    <p>L<sc>aminins</sc> are large glycoproteins found in all basement membranes (Ekblom, 1996). In overall appearance, laminins are cross-shaped with a single long arm arising from the coiled-coil interaction of three genetically distinct polypeptide chains and three NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal short arms, each originating from the individual polypeptide chains (Maurer, 1996). The three subunit chains are termed Î±, Î², and Î³ according to the current nomenclature (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Burgeson et al., 1994</xref>). The complete primary structure for each of the nine human laminin subunit chains has been elucidated: Î±1 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Haaparanta et al., 1991</xref>), Î±2, (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Vuolteenaho et al., 1994</xref>), Î±3 (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 1994</xref>), Î±4 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Iivanainen et al., 1995a</xref>), Î²1 (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Pikkarainen et al., 1987</xref>), Î²2 (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Wewer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Iivanainen et al., 1995b</xref>), Î²3 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gerecke et al., 1994</xref>), Î³1 (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Pikkarainen et al., 1988</xref>), and Î³2 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kallunki et al., 1992</xref>). The complete cDNA sequence for a fifth laminin Î± chain has been determined in mouse (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Miner et al., 1995</xref>); partial cDNA sequences of human Î±5 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Durkin et al., 1997</xref>), and a novel chicken Î² chain (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 1995</xref>) have been reported. All three chains have globular domains separated by multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains within the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal short arms. Their long arm portions are composed of heptad repeats that are typical for Î±-helical coiled-coil proteins. In addition, the COOH terminus of each Î± chain is composed of five globular (G)<sup>1</sup> domains (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Engel, 1992</xref>).</p>
    <p>The many functions ascribed to laminins are thought to derive from their structural and signal transduction roles, by which they contribute to the formation and stability of basement membranes, to the stability of cellular attachments to basement membranes, and to cytoskeletal rearrangements mediated by their occupancy of cell surface receptors (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 1994</xref>). These activities at least partially result from: (a) the binding of the COOH-terminal laminin G domains to integrins in most cells (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Deutzmann et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Drago et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Goodman, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Matter and Laurie, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Rousselle et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1997</xref>), and/or to dystroglycan in muscle cells (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Henry and Campbell, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Pall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Wewer and Engvall, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>); (b) from the self-assembly of the laminins into a pericellular extracellular matrix through interactions of domains VI, which are present at the ends of the short arms of the subunit chains (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Yurchenco et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Yurchenco and Cheng, 1993</xref>, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>); and (c) from assembly of the pericellular laminin network with a conceptually separate network of type IV collagen molecules specifically mediated by the molecule nidogen, one end of which binds the laminin Î³1 chain, and the other end of which binds type IV collagen and other basement membrane matrix components (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Battaglia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aumailley et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Reinhardt et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
    <p>The role of laminin 5 (Î±3Î²3Î³2) in stabilization of epithelialâstromal interactions is the exception to this generalized scheme. While the 5 laminin G domains of Î±3 bind integrins Î±6Î²4 and Î±3Î²1 on the epithelial basolateral surface (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Niessen et al., 1994</xref>), the absence of domains VI on the truncated short arms of Î±3 and Î³2 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kallunki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 1994</xref>), and the absence of a nidogen binding site on Î³2 (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 1995</xref>) prevent their participation in the above-described model. Instead, the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of the epithelial cellâassociated laminin 5 binds type VII collagen present within the subjacent stromal matrix (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Rousselle et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, laminin 5 appears to play a unique role in epithelial frictional resistance, rather than a direct role in overall basement membrane structure.</p>
    <p>The primary functions of the laminin Î³1 chain in the above generalized scheme is the contribution of a domain VI which shares high amino acid sequence identity to domains VI of the laminin Î± and Î² chains and a unique sequence required for the binding of nidogen. This sequence, NIDPNAV, is present in the fourth EGF-like repeat of domain III (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Poschl et al., 1994</xref>). In the Î³2 chain, the analogous sequence NVDPSAS is present, but does not support high affinity nidogen binding (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this report, we describe a novel human laminin Î³ chain. Its predicted structure indicates the presence of all the domains homologous to Î³1, including a domain VI homologue and a nidogen-binding site containing a single conservative amino acid substitution. We call this chain the laminin Î³3 chain. The predicted structure of this chain suggests that it should be capable of associations with other laminin chains for basement membrane assembly; however, immunolocalization studies in several tissues indicate the presence of laminin Î³3 chains in regions lacking ultrastructurally identifiable basement membranes.</p>

        <title>Isolation of a Novel Laminin 12 (Î±2Î²1Î³3)</title>
        <p>The purification of the novel laminin 12 (Î±2Î²1Î³3) was carried out as follows. Human placental chorionic villi were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground in a Waring blender, and then washed in 1 M NaCl. Unless otherwise noted, all subsequent steps were performed at 4Â°C. The final tissue pellet (200 g, wet weight) was suspended by stirring for 48 h in 1 liter of extraction buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 625 mg/liter <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide, 150 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). The soluble fraction was collected after centrifugation (30,000 <italic>g</italic>, 60 min) and precipitated with 300 g/liter ammonium sulfate. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation (30,000 <italic>g</italic>, 60 min) and dissolved in chromatography buffer (2 M urea, 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). The sample was then dialyzed against the same buffer. After dialysis, 0.5 vol of buffer-equilibrated DEAE-cellulose (DE-52; Whatman) was added and the mixture was shaken overnight. Material not bound to DEAE-cellulose was collected by filtration on a Buchner funnel (Whatman; filter 4) and precipitated by addition of 300 g/liter ammonium sulfate. The proteins were collected by centrifugation (30,000 <italic>g</italic>, 60 min), redissolved in Concanavalin A buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8), and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. The fraction was applied to a 2.5 Ã 5 cm Concanavalin AâSepharose column (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia</named-content>). Unbound material was removed by extensive washing while bound proteins were eluted by successive washing with 10 mM Î±-<sc>d</sc>-mannopyrannoside, 1 M Î±-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyrannoside, and finally 1 M Î±-<sc>d</sc>-mannopyrannoside (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content>). Laminins are typically recovered in the latter two fractions; each fraction was independently concentrated to 10 ml with an Amicon concentrator (30-kD membrane) and applied to a 2.5 Ã 100 cm Sephacryl S-500 column in 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The fractions of interest were pooled, dialyzed against Mono-Q buffer (0.1 M NaCl and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8), and applied to a 1 Ã 5 cm Mono-Q column (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia</named-content>). Elution was achieved with a 60-ml 0.1â0.5-M NaCl gradient. The fraction eluted at 250 mM NaCl was taken for further study.</p>

        <title>Protein Sequencing</title>
        <p>Protein sequencing was performed with minor modifications of published methods (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aebersold et al., 1987</xref>). In brief, laminin 12 was resolved on a polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The bands at 205, 185, and 170 kD were excised separately, digested with trypsin, and then separated by HPLC and sequenced on an Applied Biosystem sequenator. Analysis of a trypsin digest of laminin Î±2 isolated from laminin 12 was performed with matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry performed on a Finnigan Lasermat 2000 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chait and Kent, 1992</xref>).</p>

        <title>cDNA Cloning</title>
        <p>By comparison of the laminin Î³1 amino acid sequence (SWISS-PROT accession number, P11047) with the dbEST database (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Boguski et al., 1993</xref>; NCBI) using the program BLAST (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) one clone (these data are available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AA297192">AA297192</ext-link>) was chosen as a possible candidate for a new laminin Î³ chain. To extend the cDNA, specific primers for 5â² or 3â² extension were deduced from a previously published expressed sequence tag (clone, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AA297192">AA297192</ext-link>). Nested PCR on placental Marathon-Ready cDNA (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="clontech">Clontech</named-content>) were performed following the manufacturer's instructions using the supplied nonspecific primers with the following gene-specific primers: for the 5â² extension; in the first round, (5â²-dCGCATGTGCCGTTCTCGTGGCACTGG); in the second round, (5â²-dGCGGCAGGTGCACTGTCCAGTCTTGG); for the 3â² extension, in the first round, (5â²-dTGCACGGGACTGCAGCCGCTGCTACCC); in the second round (5â²-dGCTGCTACCCTGGCTTCTTCGACCTCC). For PCR, the Long Expand PCR Kit (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="boehringer">Boehringer Mannheim</named-content>) was used with the following conditions: denaturation, 94Â°C for 3 min; 10 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 s, 63Â°C (â0.5Â°C per cycle) for 30 s, 68Â°C for 4 min; 25 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 s, 58Â°C for 30 s, 68Â°C for 4 min (+10 s per cycle); a final extension period at 68Â°C of 8 min.</p>
        <p>The PCR samples from the first round were purified (PCR Purification Kit; Qiagen) and 2% of the sample volume was used in the second round of PCR using the same PCR protocol. These PCR products were purified from an agarose gel (Gel Purification Kit; Qiagen) and either subcloned (into PCR II or PCR 2.1 vectors; Invitrogen) or directly used for sequencing. To reconfirm the nucleotide sequence and control for PCR-induced nucleotide substitutions, gene-specific primers were used to reamplify the entire Î³3 cDNA. A first strand cDNA synthesis kit (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="clontech">Clontech</named-content>) was used to synthesize cDNA from total placental RNA using oligo dT, random, or specific human laminin Î³3 antisense primers following the manufacturer's protocol; PCR was used to generate overlapping clones complementary to the entire human laminin Î³3 chain. Sequencing of all the obtained PCR products revealed the nucleotide sequence of laminin Î³3 from what we eventually inferred as nt 297 to nt 5020. However, all further 5â² extensions failed to extend the sequence further toward the 5â² end.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Genomic DNA</title>
        <p>The sequence of the 5â² end of the cDNA was determined from the human genomic P1 clone DMPC-HFF#1-1461F2, which was obtained from a PCR-based library screen performed at Genome Systems, Inc. The oligonucleotide primers that were provided to Genome Systems specifically amplify exon 2 of the human Î³3 gene (sense primer, 5â²-dCCCCGCAGGGGAAGGCGGGTCCTG; antisense primer, 5â²-dGGCTTATGAGATCACGTATGTGAG). To obtain the sequence of the missing 5â² end, the genomic clone was sequenced (in 4% DMSO) with gene-specific antisense primers. The sequence of the laminin Î³3 5â² untranslated region was confirmed by RT-PCR from placental RNA in 4% DMSO, (sense primer, 5â²-dCGCGCGGCGTCGGTGCCCTTGACC; antisense primer 5â²-dGCTTGTAGATGGCAAAGCTCTCAGG).</p>

        <title>Recombinant Expression of Domain I of the Î³3 Chain</title>
        <p>A cDNA encoding the COOH terminus of human Î³3 was cloned into the HisTrx and pPEP-T vectors (kindly provided by Richard Kammerer, Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland; based on the pET system; Novagen). The HisTrx vector has a histidine-tagged bacterial thioredoxin cDNA as a carrier in front of the cloning site; pPEP-T has a piece of the coiled-coil domain of mouse Î²1 in front of the cloning site. The Î³3 cDNA fragment used was amplified by PCR from human placenta cDNA (see cDNA cloning) using primers that include the EcoRI adapters: forward, 5â²-GC<underline>GGATC</underline>

The resultant plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS bacteria (Novagen) and fusion proteins were isolated according to the pET System manual (Novagen). A recombinant fragment containing only histidine-tagged thioredoxin was similarly expressed and purified.</p>

        <title>Antibody Production</title>
        <p>The 170-kD band (i.e., Î³3 chain) was excised from the reducing SDS-PAGE gel described above and injected into a rabbit for antibody production following standard procedures (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Harlow and Lane, 1988</xref>). The resulting serum (R16) was evaluated by Western analysis and shown to react with the 170-kD Î³3 chain, and showed minor cross-reactivity with other laminin chains at high antibody concentrations. All antibody-related studies presented in this communication were conducted at concentrations well below those where cross-reactivity was observed. The histidine-tagged, thioredoxin-Î³3 fusion protein was used for the production of a second rabbit antiserum (R21) which reacted with a single band in Western blots of placental extracts.</p>

        <title>Affinity Purification</title>
        <p>The R16 antiserum was affinity-purified by binding to gel-purified Î³3 that had been transferred to nitrocellulose and then eluted with 1 M acetic acid followed by immediate neutralization. The R21 serum was purified by binding to the histidine-tagged, mouse Î²1-human Î³3 fusion protein coupled to activated CNBr-Sepharose; the bound antibodies were eluted with 2 M urea in PBS, or with 1 M acetic acid which was immediately neutralized. The immunofluorescent patterns produced by these two affinity-purified antibody pools were indistinguishable, and were similar to whole R21 serum with reduced background staining. Only affinity-purified preparations of R21 serum were used for these studies. Antibodies made against histidine-tagged thioredoxin were similarly isolated by affinity chromatography from R21 serum; immunofluorescent patterns with these controls were blank.</p>

Bovine tissues were purchased from a local slaughterhouse. Dissected and blocked tissues were placed directly in embedding compound (O.C.T.; Sakura Finetek) and frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. 10-Î¼m sections were made on a Leica CM 3000 or 3050 and collected on Superfrost slides (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="fisher">Fisher Scientific</named-content>). Sections were air dried and stored at â20Â°C until use. Just before use, sections were immersed in acetone at â20Â°C and then rinsed three times in PBS at room temperature. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing: 2% normal goat serum, 0.25% sodium azide, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were incubated overnight at 4Â°C; they were washed in three changes of PBS (5 min per wash) and then incubated for 45â60 min with secondary antibody coupled to either Cy3, FITC, or Texas red. After incubation, sections were washed and coverslipped in Prolong (Molecular Probes). The sections were imaged on a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS-NT). The gain was adjusted in each channel of the confocal to assure that there was no bleeding across the channels; this adjustment is performed at the outset of each confocal session. Images were transferred to Adobe Photoshop and cropped for reproduction. The brightness and contrast were adjusted to make printed images similar to that obtained on the microscope monitor.</p>

After overnight hybridization, sections were washed (50% formamide, 1Ã SSC, for 30 min at 60Â°C) and the unhybridized probe was destroyed by RNase A. The hybrids were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="boehringer">Boehringer Mannheim</named-content>).

        <title>Characterization of Laminin 12 (Î±2Î²1Î³3)</title>
        <p>Laminin 12 was extracted from human chorionic villi using EDTA and partially purified by a combination of DEAE-cellulose, Concanavalin A, Sephacryl S-500, and Mono-Q chromatography (see Materials and Methods). The final fraction of interest resulting from the above protocol contains multiple laminins. Laminin 12 was resolved from this mixture by SDS-PAGE (3â5% polyacrylamide) under nonreducing conditions. Six bands were resolved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Unreduced). Only the bands at â¼560 kD and at the top of the gel were reactive with a polyclonal anti-laminin antiserum (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content>; not shown). Therefore, the resolved band at 560 kD was excised, reduced in 10% 2-mercaptoethanol SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and resolved by 5% SDS-PAGE. Three bands were observed with masses of â¼205, 185, and 170 kD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Reduced). The band at 185 kD reacted with a monoclonal antibody (clone 545; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Marinkovich et al., 1992</xref>) specific to the laminin Î²1 chain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Western blot). Each of the three bands was digested with trypsin, the peptides were resolved by HPLC, and selected resolved peptides were sequenced. The sequences obtained are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>. The 205-kD chain contained three peptides sequence identical to human laminin Î±2 (published residues 536, 70, 1367; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Vuolteenaho et al., 1994</xref>). On that basis, the band was identified as human laminin Î±2, despite our observation that the 205-kD band did not react with anti-Î±2 mAb (mAb 1922; Chemicon). The band at 185 kD produced two peptides identical to human Î²1, and was thereby confirmed as human Î²1. </p>
        <p>In contrast to the easy identification of the other two bands, the band at 170 kD contained three sequences not contained within any known laminin chain. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal sequence of the 170-kD chain was determined, and it also was novel; i.e., nonidentical to known laminin sequences. As these four sequences from the 170-kD band were derived from an unknown laminin and we had identified the laminin Î± and Î² chains, we assumed these sequences were derived from a novel laminin Î³ chain that we call Î³3.</p>
        <p>The apparent molecular masses for the 205- and 185-kD bands are not consistent with the literature values published for the Î±2 and Î²1 chains, respectively. Thus, these bands are indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> as Î±2t, Î²1t, and Î³3t to indicate that they have been processed (truncated). Laminin 2 and laminin 4 were also present in these preparations; when characterized by similar procedures (not described here in detail) they showed molecular masses consistent with literature predictions, suggesting that our preparations were not extensively and nonspecifically degraded. Together these observations suggest that the truncations observed for the Î³3-containing molecules may be physiologically relevant.</p>

        <title>Characterization of the Î³3 cDNA</title>
        <p>The cDNA sequences of human Î³1 and Î³2 were used to probe the National Center for Biomedical Information (NCBI) expressed-sequence-tag database (dbEST), and a clone was identified that was homologous, but not identical, to Î³1 and Î³2. The sequence of this clone was used to design PCR primers for extensions at 3â² and 5â² ends (see Materials and Methods) using human placental cDNA, and additional sequence information was obtained by a combination of genomic DNA and placental cDNA sequencing. The resulting sequence is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. The deduced amino acid sequence contains regions with 100% identity to all three of the peptide sequences obtained from the 170-kD band (underlined in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The nucleotide sequence reported in this paper has been submitted to GenBank/EMBL Data Bank with the accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF041835">AF041835</ext-link>. </p>
        <p>The DNA sequence contains an open reading frame predicting 1620 amino acids, including a 19âamino acid-long putative signal peptide that closely meets the criteria described by <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al. (1997)</xref>. The predicted cleavage site was confirmed by protein sequencing of the Î³3 NH<sub>2</sub> terminus; this sequence exactly matched the predicted amino acid sequence following the signal peptide. The overall sequence of Î³3 is most similar to that of Î³1, sharing 52% amino acid similarity with human Î³1 (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Pikkarainen et al., 1988</xref>). In addition, the amino acid sequence predicted by the Î³3 cDNA contains a domain distribution most like that of the Î³1 chain. All six domains are represented.</p>
        <p>Overall, the Î³3 chain has 43.6% amino acid identity with the Î³1 chain and 34% identity with the Î³2 chain. The highest conservation is seen between domains Î³1VI and Î³3VI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Domains Î³3V and III also show considerable similarity to domains Î³1V and III and Î³2V and III. </p>
        <p>The predicted Î³3 sequence contains nine potential glycosylation sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, boxed), only two of which (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, boxed and underlined) are conserved in both human and mouse Î³1. As these conserved sites are contained within the globular domains IV and VI, it is likely that these sites are used physiologically. There is a single RGD sequence (boxed, hatched) within domain II, but this site is not conserved in either human or mouse Î³1 and Î³2 proteins. The sequence NVDPNAV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, double boxed) occurs within the fourth EGF-like repeat of domain III and is a homologue of the nidogen binding site (NIDPNAV) within the same domain of Î³1. These sequences differ by only a single conservative amino acid substitution.</p>

        <title>LAMC3 Maps to Chromosome 9q31-q34</title>
        <p>The Î³3 chromosomal location was determined by searching the NCBI Human Genomic Sequencing Index data base with the Î³3 cDNA sequence. The sequence is identical to a database, Sequence Tagged Sites (clone WI-14302), that has been localized to chromosome 9q33-q34. A 1.2-kb Î³3 cDNA probe within domains I and II of the predicted protein, the regions of least homology among the Î³ chains, was used to localize LAMC3 by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis (SeeDNA Biotech, Inc.). The results confirm the localization to chromosome 9q31-q34 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). </p>

        <title>Laminin Î³3 Associates with Î±2Î²1 to Form Laminin 12 which, in Placenta, Is Lacking Part of the I/II Domains of All Three Chains</title>
        <p>To determine the domains present within Î±2t, the 205-kD gel band, purified from placenta, was fragmented with trypsin and the resulting peptides were fractionated by HPLC; the masses of the eluted peptides were determined by mass spectroscopy. The ion chromatograms were then evaluated relative to the masses predicted from the published amino acid sequence for Î±2 in order to determine the NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal peptides present within the digest. The results identified a number of tryptic peptides; among these, the peptide LVEHVPGQP(VR), beginning at residue 70 within domain VI, was the most NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal; the peptide GTTMTPPADLIEK, beginning at residue 1367 within domain III, was the most COOH-terminal. These results indicate that Î±2t is a fragment containing the short arm of the laminin Î±2 chain. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that the initial peptide sequence identified from Î±2t was within the short arm domains (above).</p>
        <p>Î²1t and Î³3t are also short arm fragments, as all the peptide sequences determined for both species are present within the short arm domains. However, the masses of Î±2t, Î²1t, and Î³3t are greater than predicted for the short arms alone. In addition, Î±2t, Î²1t, and Î³3t are not separable by gel electrophoresis without the reduction of disulfide bonds. Therefore, this truncated laminin 12 molecule is very likely to contain portions of domain II of all three chains, as the interchain disulfide bonds should lie between these domains. It is of interest to note that domain II of Î³3 contains three cysteinyl residues whose bonding partners are not readily identified and are not present in domain II of other laminin chains. These three cysteinyl residues are conserved in mouse Î³3 (Albus, A., and R.E. Burgeson, unpublished observation). Whether these cysteinyl residues could form intrachain, interchain, or intermolecular disulfide bonds that in some way contribute to the cleavage of Î³3 chain-containing laminins is unknown.</p>

        <title>Tissue Distribution of Î³3 Expression by Northern Analysis</title>
        <p>Tissue RNA blots and Master Blot dot blots (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="clontech">Clontech</named-content>) were probed with a Î³3 nucleotide probe (nt 1316 to 2277). A single major transcript of â¼5 kb, consistent in size with other laminin Î³ chains, is present in several of the tissues examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). A small amount of a second larger transcript can also be detected. This larger transcript is most likely due to differences in polyadelylation or due to inefficient splicing. The Î³3 chain RNA is abundant in spleen, testis, placenta, lung, and liver; lesser amounts are seen in kidney and ovary (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). The predominance of a single transcript allowed use of the RNA Master Blot (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="clontech">Clontech</named-content>) to determine expression in a large number of other tissues. On this dot blot, tissue RNA concentrations have been normalized to housekeeping genes. The Master Blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B) confirms the abundant presence of Î³3 transcripts in placenta, adrenal gland, testis, lung, and fetal kidney, but also shows detectable levels of Î³3 transcripts in numerous additional tissues, including brain and skeletal muscle. </p>

        <title>Characterization of the Immunospecificity of Anti-Laminin Î³3 (R16; R21)</title>
        <p>A polyclonal antiserum, R16, was made in a rabbit to the Î³3 chain excised from a reduced SDS-PAGE gel similar to that shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Another, R21, was made to recombinant Î³3 protein (see Methods). The R16 antiserum recognizes the Î³3 chain on immunoblots of placental extracts, but at very high antibody concentrations, it shows some reactivity with the Î²1 and Î³1 chains as well. Thus, as a control, human neonatal foreskin was immunostained with anti-laminin Î³1 (polyclonal anti-laminin 1; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content>), anti-laminin Î³2 (GB3, <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Verrando et al., 1987</xref>), and with anti-laminin Î³3 (R16). Crisp, brilliant fluorescence was observed along the dermal-epidermal junction, and around capillaries with the anti-Î³1 antibodies (data not shown), and in the basement membrane at the dermal-epidermal junction with anti-Î³2 (data not shown); in contrast, no signal above background was detected using the anti-Î³3 reagent (R16) when it was applied at dilutions of 1:250 or more (data not shown). The antigen could not be unmasked by treatment of the cryosections with 2, 4, or 6 M urea, or with 2 M guanidinium-HCl (data not shown). As all known laminin chains have been detected in skin within either the epithelial basement membranes or the vascular basement membranes, these results indicate that the cross-reactivity detected by Western blot analyses using the polyclonal anti-Î³3 (R16) antibody was either not apparent by immunohistochemistry, or was below detection at the antibody concentrations used. For the subsequent anatomical experiments (below), R16 was diluted 1:250 or greater to assure no cross-reactivity was occurring. R21, the affinity-purified antiserum to recombinant Î³3, was also tested on sections of neonatal foreskin. As with R16, no immunoreactivity was seen (data not shown); thus we conclude that this antiserum has no cross-reactivity with other known Î³ chains. Neither R21 nor R16 antiserums label the blood vessel basement membranes (see below) consistent with a lack of cross-reactivity to other Î³ chains.</p>

        <title>Î³3-containing Laminins Are Localized to Peripheral Nerves and to Ciliated Epithelial Apical Surfaces</title>
        <p>Unlike the lack of anti-laminin Î³3 chain immunoreactivity seen in neonatal foreskin, laminin Î³3 chain immunoreactivity was detected in human leg skin. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A, and consistent with published results, laminin Î³1 chain reactivity is seen at the dermal-epidermal junction and within the basement membranes of the vasculature, while laminin Î³2 chain immunoreactivity is restricted to the dermal-epidermal junction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B). The laminin Î³3 chain immunoreactivity is further restricted to distinct patches widely spaced along the dermal-epidermal junction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> C). In experiments not shown, the immunoreactivity did not correlate positively or negatively with sites of cell proliferation, nor did it correlate with fixed positions relative to the rete ridges. However, there is a direct correlation of the laminin Î³3 chain immunoreactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> D) with sites where nerves cross the dermal-epidermal junction as detected by an antibody to the neuronal marker PGP9.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> E), which reacts with ubiquitin COOH-terminal hydrolase (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 1990</xref>). The results in skin suggest that Î³3-containing laminins may be deposited into the dermalâ epidermal junction by nerve or nerve associated cells, or that its expression by epithelial cells is induced by the adjacent nerve. </p>
        <p>Laminin Î³3 is also expressed in the neural retina at the apical surface of the retina and in the outer synaptic layer (Libby, R.T., Y. Xu, E.P. Gibbons, M.-F. Champliaud, M. Koch, R.E. Burgeson, D.D. Hunter, and W.J. Brunken, manuscript submitted for publication); in the retina, the Î³3 chain is coexpressed with the Î±4, Î±3, and Î²2 chains. Native Î³3-containing laminins have not been isolated as yet from the retina; however, they have from another region of the central nervous system, the cerebellum, from which we have obtained two novel laminins, Î±3Î²2Î³3 and Î±4Î²2Î³3 (Champliaud, M.-F., unpublished observations). In addition, anatomical methods (immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization), demonstrate the expression of Î³3 in cerebellum and forebrain structures (Brunken, W.J., unpublished observations). It seems likely that Î³3-containing laminins will be a general feature of the matrix in the CNS.</p>
        <p>The Northern analysis indicated that the laminin Î³3 chain was most strongly expressed in placenta, testis, lung, liver, spleen, and ovary. Therefore, we examined the localization of Î³3 chains within testis, lung, and ovary. The reactivity within the epididymis and the fallopian tube were particularly striking. Thus, the distribution of Î³3 in these tissues was extensively studied. In the female reproductive system, the oviduct was strongly reactive. Cryosections of the bovine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, AâF) or rat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, GâI) ampulla reacted for Î³3 using R16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, A, D, and GâI), or R21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, B and E) showed brilliant immunoreactivity at the apical surfaces of the tubal mucosa. Double immunofluorescent studies performed with laminin Î³3 and either laminin Î±2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, A and D) or laminin Î±5 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> E) demonstrated that both of these Î± chains are restricted to the basement membranes of the tubal epithelial and the subjacent endothelium whereas Î³3 is expressed at the apical surface. The pre-immune serum from rabbit 21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> C) was negative, as was the reactivity of anti-thioredoxin antibodies purified from the R21 serum by immunoaffinity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> F). </p>
        <p>The pattern of immunoreactivity for R16 in the rat oviduct was identical to that seen in bovine tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> G). Higher magnification micrographs of the epithelial apical surface of the rat ampulla (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, H and I) show the Î³3 chain to be localized to the apical surface of the epithelial cells at the base of the cilia.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that the labeling pattern of R21 differed somewhat from that of R16. In general, the pattern with R21 was somewhat punctate, showing large deposits of immunoreactivity at the apical surface, and increased cytoplasmic labeling of the tubal epithelium, whereas the R16 immunoreactivity was more restricted to the apical extracellular surface. These observations suggest that the R21 antiserum, made to recombinant domain I, may recognize the unfolded Î³3 chain better than the R16 antiserum, which should recognize primarily short arm domains.</p>
        <p>The male monkey reproductive tract was examined also. Like the fallopian tube, the epithelium in the epididymis is a single columnar epithelium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, A, H, and E). In situ hybridization performed on adjacent sections of the monkey epididymis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> B; Î³3) localized transcripts for the Î³3 chain to the apical region of the epithelial cells (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, A with B). R16 (data not shown) and R21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, C and D, R21) sera gave similar patterns, reacting with both the basal and apical surfaces of the epithelial cells. The R21 antiserum reacted with apparently intracellular stores of Î³3, as was seen in the bovine fallopian tube. The preimmune control serum from R21 showed only punctate autofluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> E, Pre). </p>
        <p>Potential chains partners were explored by examination of the same tissue with antibodies specific for a variety of other laminin chains: Î±2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> F), Î±4 (G), Î²1 (H), and Î²2 (I). We used two monoclonal antibodies to test for the presence of Î²1 at the apical surface (clones 545; and C21) both gave the same pattern of immunolabeling; only the results with clone 545 are shown. As can be seen readily, Î±2 and Î²2 were restricted to the basal surface of the epithelial cells, while staining for Î±4 and Î²1 were also seen at the apical surface. Thus, in contrast to the results from placental extracts, Î±4 (and not Î±2) appears to be a candidate chain partner for Î³3 in the epididymis. These observations suggest that a wide variety of Î³3-containing laminins will be expressed in a tissue-specific pattern.</p>
        <p>Expression of laminin Î³3 chain was examined in the rat as well and the tissue distribution of Î³3 in the rat epididymis was similar to that described for the monkey (data not shown); namely, Î³3 immunoreactivity was localized to the apical surface of the epithelium. We also studied other regions of the rat reproductive system. Unlike laminin-1 immunoreactivity, which is localized to the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A), Î³3 immunoreactivity is not present within the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules nor is it found around the interstitial cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A, arrows; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B, asterisk). Within the seminiferous tubules, only the occasional tubule reacted strongly with the laminin Î³3 reactive serum (R16, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B); it was our impression that those tubules identified by the antibody contained nearly mature spermatids. Further along the male reproductive system, in the ductus deferens, laminin-1 immunoreactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> C; arrows mark the apical surface of the epithelium) was seen along the epithelial basement membrane, in the lamina propria and ensheathing the smooth muscle cells of the muscular layer. In contrast, Î³3 immunoreactivity (R16) was found at the apical and basal surfaces of the epithelial cells, as well as intracellularly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> D). </p>
        <p>The apical distribution of the Î³3 chain is not confined to the reproductive system; in rat lung, the ciliated epithelial cells lining the bronchi were also strongly reactive with the anti-laminin Î³3 antiserum, R16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> E). Again, the fluorescence was apparent along the apical surface, as determined by differential interference contrast microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> F). No Î³3-immunoreactivity was seen in respiratory epithelium nor in the pulmonary capillary bed (not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The laminin Î³3 chain described here is the eleventh laminin subunit to be identified. The predicted primary and secondary structure of this chain suggests that Î³3 is more closely related to human Î³1 than Î³2. Unlike Î³2, the Î³3 cDNA sequence predicts a laminin subunit without the short-arm truncations predicted for Î³2. Perhaps more significantly, Î³3 contains a Î³1-like nidogen binding motif with only a single conservative amino acid substitution, suggesting that Î³3-containing laminins should be capable of associating with other basement membrane molecules through nidogen interactions (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Poschl et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, domain VI of Î³3 shares the highest sequence identity with domain VI of the Î³1 chain. As this latter domain has been shown to support laminin self-assembly (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Yurchenco and Cheng, 1994</xref>), it seems reasonable to suggest that domain VI of the Î³3 chain may also support self-assembly.</p>
      <p>Two of the predicted glycosylation sites in the Î³3 chain are also found in human and in mouse Î³1; these are within short-arm globular domains, i.e., VI and IV. Interestingly, the glycosylation site in domain IV is also found in human (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kallunki et al., 1992</xref>) and in mouse (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Sugiyama et al., 1995</xref>) Î³2. This remarkable conservation of glycosylation sites among these three chains and between these species suggests that these sites are indeed important and glycosylated; they are likely to be critical in the folding of this region or may play another important function.</p>
      <p>The RGD sequence within domain II of the Î³3 chain is found in neither Î³1 nor in Î³2. Moreover, it seems likely that this sequence is not functional within native Î³3-containing laminins as it is located within the coiled-coil region of Î³3. However, it very well may promote integrin-mediated recognition of non-native molecules or of protein fragments.</p>
      <p>In placenta, the Î³3 chain can combine with the laminin Î±2 and Î²1 chains. This observation suggests that, unlike Î³2 which pairs preferentially with Î²3, Î³3 may pair with any Î² chain, with the possible exception of Î²3, and with any of the known Î± chains. This prediction suggests the existence of an additional 10 laminins with the following chain compositions: Î±1Î²1Î³3, Î±1Î²2Î³3, Î±2Î²1Î³3, Î±2Î²2Î³3, Î±3Î²1Î³3, Î±3Î²2Î³3, Î±4Î²1Î³3, Î±4Î²2Î³3, Î±5Î²1Î³3, and Î±5Î²2Î³3. In both the epididymis and the fallopian tube, Î³3 is not combined with Î±2. In the epididymis, the Î±4 and Î²1 chains appear to be potential partners. Given that the total number of human laminins is not known, at least one additional Î² chain has been identified in chicken (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1998</xref>) and in mammals (Olson, P.F., unpublished observations), assigning a final laminin numerical identifier to these laminins is premature. However, as we have shown Î±2Î²1Î³3 to be the twelfth laminin to be identified, we provisionally call this heterotrimer, laminin 12.</p>
      <p>The masses of the chains of laminin 12 as approximated by electrophoretic mobility are considerably less than predicted by the amino acid sequences and from prior experience with the Î±2 and Î²1 chains. They are also less than the Î±2, Î²1, and Î²2 chains present in laminins 2 and 4 obtained from the same preparations. The reason for these more rapid electrophoretic migration rates appears to be proteolysis within the domains II of the chains comprising this molecule. In placenta, this proteolysis may be physiological, since laminins 2 and 4 isolated from the same preparations are apparently intact. The significance of this observation awaits considerable additional experimentation before it is understood. However, we have observed three cysteinyl residues within domain II of the Î³3 chain that are not present in other human Î±, Î², or Î³ chains. It is possible that a disulfide bond between two of these residues distorts the coiled-coil conformation making molecules containing this chain more susceptible to proteolysis. At this time, we do not know if truncation of laminins containing the Î³3 chain can be generalized to tissues other than placenta; however, this seems unlikely in that our isolation of Î³3-containing laminins from the CNS do not show the same truncation (Champliaud, unpublished observations). The COOH-terminal truncation of Î±2t explains its lack of reactivity with an anti-Î±2 antibody, mAb 1922, which is specific for the Î±2 G domain (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Engvall et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
      <p>The antiserum to the recombinant Î³3 domain I fusion protein (R21) was originally made to evaluate this potential processing, since epitopes contained within this domain should be absent from the processed molecule. In this regard, the immunohistochemical data is not definitive. Like R16, R21 immunoreactivity is seen at the apical surface; however, the apical reactivity is distinctly different than that for R16. Specifically, R21 immunoreactivity appears as a plaque-like structure at the cell surface, with some reactivity within the cells. Thus, it seems possible that R21 epitopes are entirely intracellular but it is also possible that some of the R21 epitopes are present at the apical surface of these epithelial cells. Further experimentation beyond the scope of this report is required to address this question. However, laminins containing Î³3 chains have been immunoisolated from the medium of A204 cells derived from a human rhabdosarcoma (Champliaud, M.-F., unpublished data), indicating that Î³3-containing laminins are capable of being secreted in vitro. These Î³3-containing laminins from A204 are a mixture of processed (truncated) and unprocessed (untruncated) molecules.</p>
      <p>Reports of laminins in tissue locations not identified as basement membranes are increasingly frequent. In the brain, laminins have been observed not only within the basement membrane of capillaries, but also at other sites not conceptualized as basement membranes (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Higuchi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Jucker et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1996a</xref>,b; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Mori et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hagg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto et al., 1997</xref>). In the eye, the laminin Î²2 chain has been identified in both basement membrane and non-basement membrane locations (Hunter et al., 1992; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Libby et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Libby et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Toti et al., 1997</xref>). Laminins have also been observed in cartilage (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Durr et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>Intriguingly, the laminin Î³3 chain appears most commonly to be associated with non-basement membrane structures. In the cerebellum, Î³3 chains are detected in the pericellular nets surrounding both neurons and glia (Brunken, W.J., unpublished observations). Reported elsewhere (Libby et al., manuscript submitted for publication, see above), Î³3 is present within the neural retina at two extracellular sites: between the outer segments of the photoreceptors, and at the synapses of the photoreceptors with the bipolar and horizontal cells. In the retina, these Î³3-containing molecules are the products of the MÃ¼ller glial cells which, like the tubal epithelium, contain a considerable store of intracellular Î³3 chain. The laminin Î±3 and Î²2 chains are also present at these sites, whereas the Î³1 and Î³2 chains are absent. The functions fulfilled by these laminins are unclear, but possibilities include: stabilization of neural architecture; induction and stabilization of differentiated neural phenotypes (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 1992b</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Libby et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hunter and Brunken, 1997</xref>); and stabilization of synaptic junctions.</p>
      <p>However, the most abundant expression of Î³3 as detected by Northern analyses is not within neural tissues, but rather is in the testis, the placenta, the spleen, the lung, and the ovary. Î³3 immunoreactivity is present at the bases of the epithelial cilia of the epididymis, the trachea, the bronchi, and the oviduct. There are no structures resembling basement membrane at these sites. However, Î³3 chains may be present within the basement membranes along the basolateral surfaces of some of these epithelia. The chain partners for the Î³3 chain in these apical laminins are not yet known with certainty. However, in epididymis, the laminin Î±2 chain does not colocalize with Î³3 at the apical epithelial surface; rather, the Î±4 and Î²1 chains are present at that location and, thereby, are potential chain partners. Thus, it seems likely that Î³3 will be as promiscuous as Î³1 with respect to partner choice during laminin assembly.</p>
      <p>The presence of laminins along ciliated epithelial surfaces was unexpected and their functions there are unknown. Perhaps a modified basement membrane containing at least laminin helps organize or stabilize the specialized cytoskeleton of the cilia. Laminins at these apical surfaces may also participate in the anchorage of mucins to the surface. Alternatively, laminins might stabilize the outfoldings of the plasma membranes of the cilia. Similar functions for laminins have been postulated to stabilize the junctional folds beneath synapses at neuromuscular junctions (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Noakes et al., 1995</xref>), and contribute to the organization of epithelial hemidesmosomes (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Langhofer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Baker et al., 1996</xref>). Laminins expressed at the apical surface of the retina are thought to play a role in photoreceptor morphogenesis, specifically outer segment formation and synapse development (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Libby et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p>
      <p>Consistent with the above speculations regarding an essential function for Î³3 containing laminins in neural tissues, the chromosomal locus of LAMC3 at 9q31-q34 is shared with four diseases having various degrees of neural dysfunction in common: Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD); muscle-eye-brain syndrome; Walker-Warburg syndrome; and retinitis pigmentosa-21 with deafness (RP-21). The genetic cause of the latter three of these conditions is unclear. While Î³3 expression may be affected in FCMD, the LAMC3 cannot be the genetic cause of the problem as a retrotransposal insertion in a different gene has recently been identified in 87% of the FCMD alleles (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Kobayashi et al., 1998</xref>). However, LAMC3 is an excellent candidate for mutations underlying one or more of remaining syndromes in this cluster of human diseases, particularly RP-21.</p>
      <p>We have identified the laminin Î³3 chain together with the Î±2 and Î²1 chains within laminin 12 from human placenta, but multiple other combinations are possible in other tissues. It would be of particular interest if Î³3 were to associate with the Î²2 chain and well as with the Î±2 chain, as both these chains have been reported to show neural and muscle-associated expression and function. The Î³3-containing laminins are likely to be the subject of considerable interest as they constitute a novel class of laminin molecules distributed outside of the traditional basement membrane. The identification of the function of this diverse family of laminins remains to be elucidated by future experiments.</p>

        <p>Identification of laminin 12 isolated from human placenta. A partially purified preparation of laminins isolated from an EDTA extract of placenta was subjected to 3â5% SDS-PAGE (Unreduced). The gel band in the indicated position (bar) was excised from the gel and resolved by 5% SDS-PAGE after disulfide-bond reduction. Three bands were seen from the single unreduced band (Reduced). The 185-kD band was recognized by an anti-Î²1 antibody, while the 170-kD band was specifically recognized by a polyclonal antibody (R16; which used the same band as an antigen; Western blot). Each of the three bands (Reduced gel) was subsequently identified as laminin Î±2, Î²1, and Î³3 (see text for details). As they have faster electrophoretic mobilities than expected for these chains they are marked Î±2t, Î²1t, and Î³3t to indicate that they are truncated.</p>

The Î³3 cDNA predicts a full-length laminin chain where all the domains found in Î³1 are represented. On the left side a diagram of the domain structure of both Î³1 and Î³3 is given; on the right, the domain structure of Î³2. Above each diagram is noted by domain the percent amino acid identity between Î³1 or Î³2 and Î³3. The degree of amino acid identity of Î³3 to Î³1 is higher than that of Î³3 to Î³2, suggesting that Î³3 has a closer evolutionary relationship with Î³1 than Î³2.</p>

        <p>Localization of LAMC3 to chromosome 9, band q31-q34 by FISH. The position of LAMC3 was probed using a 1.3-kb cDNA probe within predicted protein domains I and II of Î³3. The FISH signal (A) was superimposed over the DAPI-banded chromosomes (B) to identify the location of the Î³3 gene. Both alleles of the Î³3 gene are labeled (A, arrow) at the end of the long arm of chromosome 9 (B, 9).</p>

        <p>Laminin Î³3 chain is expressed widely in human tissues. The same cDNA probe described in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> was used to probe tissue blots (A) and a dot blot (B). Only a single major RNA species is detected on the tissue blots; strong signals are obtained from testis, spleen, placenta, and lung. Less intense signals are obtained from ovary, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle. Dot blots indicate a more widespread tissue distribution, including thyroid, gut, and some fetal tissues.</p>

        <p>Laminin Î³3 chain is expressed in restricted sites, correlated with nerve terminations, in human skin. Laminin Î³1, Î³2, and Î³3 chains and nerve-specific ubiquitin COOH-terminal hydrolase (PGP 9.5) in human leg skin were localized by immunohistochemistry and confocal laser microscopy. Laminin Î³1 (A) immunoreactivity is present throughout the dermal-epidermal junctional basement membrane, as well as in the basement membranes of the glands and hair follicles. Laminin Î³2 immunoreactivity (B), on the other hand, is restricted to the basement membrane of the dermal-epidermal junction and that underlying the epithelial cells of the outer root sheath of the hair follicles. Finally, laminin Î³3 immunoreactivity (C) is most restricted and is found in distinct patches within the dermal-epidermal junction basement membrane. Laminin Î³3 immunofluorescence (D) and a nerve-specific marker (E, anti-PGP 9.5) are colocalized when both primaries are applied to the same section.</p>

        <p>Laminin Î³3 is expressed on the apical surface of the ciliated epithelium of the bovine and rat fallopian tube. Confocal laser microscope images of freshly frozen tissue sections of fallopian tube; in each image, five optical sections were superimposed. The laminin Î³3-reactive antiserum R16 (A and D, red) and anti-laminin Î±2 chain (A and D, green) were applied to bovine tissue together; Î³3 immunoreactivity is confined to the apical surface of the epithelium, whereas Î±2 is present in the basement membrane; D is a higher magnification of one of the folia in A. Application of the Î³3-reactive R21 serum alone (B) also labels the apical surface of the bovine epithelium, but in plaque-like structures. R21 pre-immune serum is nonreactive (C). Simultaneous visualization of R21 immunoreactivity (E, red) and Î±5 immunoreactivity (E, green) shows that the Î³3 is found on the apical side of the epithelium and in cytoplasmic stores in the long processes of these columnar tubal cells whereas Î±5-immunoreactivity is confined to the basement membrane. Antibodies purified from the R21 serum with the carrier protein, His-thioredoxin are negative (F). Î³3 shows a similar distribution in rat fallopian tube (G and H): R16 reactivity is present at the apical surface over the whole of the ampulla (G) and in a higher power view of the epithelium (H); comparison of the fluorescent image in H with the differential interference contrast image in I demonstrates that Î³3 immunoreactivity is associated with the ciliated surface of the epithelium.</p>

        <p>Laminin Î³3 is expressed on the surface of male reproductive epithelium. Light (A and B) and confocal (CâI) images of the epididymis from monkey (rhesus). In A, a section was fixed and stained with H&amp;E for orientation; the epididymis is composed of a columnar epithelium, with considerable interstitial matrix between adjacent folds. (B) By in situ hybridization, a Î³3-specific probe is localized to the epithelium; the reaction product (dark blue) is concentrated above the nuclear region of the cell; this section is not counter-stained. (C and D) Î³3 immunoreactivity (R21) is present at the surface of the epithelium; (E) pre-immune (Pre) serum is nonreactive in this tissue. (FâI) Immunolocalization of other laminin chains; both Î±2 and Î²2 are confined to the basement membranes of the epithelium and blood vessels, whereas both Î±4 and Î²1 are seen at the apical surface of the epithelium; Î±4 is also expressed in the interstitial matrix and the basement membrane.

        <p>Laminin Î³3 is expressed on the surface of rat ciliated epithelia in testis and lung. Various tissues from the rat male reproductive system (AâD) were incubated with either laminin-1 (Î±1/Î²1/Î³1) antiserum (left column) or Î³3 antiserum (right column). (A and B) testis; (C and D) ductus deferens. The laminin-1 immunoreactivity is present in the basement membrane in these structures (left column); arrows denote interstitial cells in A, and the apical borders of the epithelium in C; the basal lamina surrounding the smooth muscle is also easily distinguished (C). In contrast, laminin Î³3 expression is distinctly not in the basement membrane of the testis (B) nor of the ductus deferens (D). Î³3 expression is limited to the seminiferous tubules themselves and does not surround the interstitial cells (B, asterisk). Within the seminiferous tubules, Î³3 expression appears to change with the state of maturation of sperm (see text for details). In the ductus deferens, Î³3 expression (D) is limited to the surface of epithelial cells (basolateral and apical). No Î³3 expression is seen in the smooth muscle of the ductus deferens. In lung (E and F), laminin Î³3 is expressed on the apical surface of nonrespiratory airways. Î³3 immunoreactivity is limited to the apical surface of the epithelium (E; compare to the differential interference contrast image of the same section in F). Scale bars are given for each pair of figures (A and B, C and D, E and F).</p>
