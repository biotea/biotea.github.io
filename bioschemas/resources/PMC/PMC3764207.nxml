      <abstract>
        <p>Exome sequencing coupled with homozygosity mapping was used to identify a transition mutation (c.794T&gt;C; p.Leu265Ser) in <italic>ELMOD3</italic> at the <italic>DFNB88</italic> locus that is associated with nonsyndromic deafness in a large Pakistani family, PKDF468. The affected individuals of this family exhibited pre-lingual, severe-to-profound degrees of mixed hearing loss. ELMOD3 belongs to the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family, which consists of six paralogs in mammals. Several members of the ELMO family have been shown to regulate a subset of GTPases within the Ras superfamily. However, ELMOD3 is a largely uncharacterized protein that has no previously known biochemical activities. We found that in rodents, within the sensory epithelia of the inner ear, ELMOD3 appears most pronounced in the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells. Fluorescently tagged ELMOD3 co-localized with the actin cytoskeleton in MDCK cells and actin-based microvilli of LLC-PK1-CL4 epithelial cells. The p.Leu265Ser mutation in the ELMO domain impaired each of these activities. Super-resolution imaging revealed instances of close association of ELMOD3 with actin at the plasma membrane of MDCK cells. Furthermore, recombinant human GST-ELMOD3 exhibited GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity against the Arl2 GTPase, which was completely abolished by the p.Leu265Ser mutation. Collectively, our data provide the first insights into the expression and biochemical properties of ELMOD3 and highlight its functional links to sound perception and actin cytoskeleton.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Here, we report a severe-to-profound mixed hearing loss locus, <italic>DFNB88</italic> on chromosome 2p12-p11.2. Exome enrichment followed by massive parallel sequencing revealed a c.794T&gt;C transition mutation in <italic>ELMOD3</italic> that segregated with DFNB88-associated hearing loss in a large Pakistani family. This transition mutation is predicted to substitute a highly invariant leucine residue with serine (p.Leu265Ser) in the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) domain of the protein. No biological activity has been described previously for the ELMOD3 protein. We investigated the biochemical properties and ELMOD3 expression to gain mechanistic insights into the function of ELMOD3 in the inner ear. In rodent inner ears, ELMOD3 immunoreactivity was observed in the cochlear and vestibular hair cells and supporting cells. However, ELMOD3 appears most pronounced in the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells. <italic>Ex vivo</italic>, ELMOD3 is associated with actin-based structures, and this link is impaired by the <italic>DFNB88</italic> mutation. ELMOD3 exhibited GAP activity against Arl2, a small GTPase, providing a potential functional link between Arf family signaling and stereocilia actin-based cytoskeletal architecture. Our study provides new insights into the molecules that are necessary for the development and/or function of inner ear sensory cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Many molecular components that are necessary for the development and maintenance of hearing have been discovered by identifying the genes that underlie hearing impairment in humans and mice <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003774-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Hearing requires the precise and efficient functioning of intricately structured mechanosensory hair cells and supporting cells in the inner ear <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Petit1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. One of the key structures in the mechanotransduction process is the hair cell stereocilium. Protruding from the apical surface of the hair cells, stereocilia are organized in three rows of decreasing height in a staircase pattern. Each stereocilium is composed of an actin core that contains cross-linked and bundled Î³- and Î²-actin microfilaments that are uniformly polarized, with the barbed (positive) ends localized at the tip. At the tapered end of the stereocilium, the actin filaments form a rootlet that has been proposed to anchor the structure in the actin-rich meshwork of the cuticular plate <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Kitajiri1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Interestingly, among the identified hearing loss-associated genes, nineteen encode proteins that interact with actin <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Numerous studies have demonstrated that actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins are involved in the development, maintenance and stabilization of the stereocilia (for review, see <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Continuous depolymerization of actin filaments at the base and polymerization at the barbed end, termed treadmilling, is thought to be critical to the maintenance of the length of stereocilia <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Rzadzinska1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Manor1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, a recent study demonstrated a rapid turnover of the actin filaments only at the tip of the stereocilia, without a treadmilling process <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, emphasizing the specific role of proteins at the stereocilia tip in the regulation of actin filaments. Regardless of the precise site, it is quite clear that the proper regulation of actin dynamics is critical to the generation and maintenance of stereocilia as sensory structures.</p>
      <p>The Rho/Rac/Cdc42 family of GTPases is well known as a regulator of actin. Rho and Rac in the inner ear are involved in the morphogenesis and growth of the otocyst <xref rid="pgen.1003774-GrimsleyMyers1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003774-GrimsleyMyers2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The depletion of Rac1 or both Rac1 and Rac3 in the murine inner ear leads to a shorter cochlear duct with an abnormal sensory epithelium. Rac may participate in cell adhesion, proliferation, and movements during otic development <xref rid="pgen.1003774-GrimsleyMyers1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003774-GrimsleyMyers2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Several studies have suggested that the activation/inhibition of Rho pathways control the actin depolymerization rate in the outer hair cells <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Kalinec1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Although best known for their roles in the regulation of membrane traffic, there is growing evidence that GTPases in the Arf family can also act via changes in actin. <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we report the identification of a new deafness gene, which encodes an ELMO/CED 12 domain containing protein, <italic>ELMOD3</italic>. Our biochemical studies demonstrated that ELMOD3 possesses GAP activity against a small GTPase in the Arf family, Arl2, providing a functional link between Arf family signaling pathways and stereocilia actin-based cytoskeletal architecture. GAPs are regulators and effectors of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, which are increasingly recognized as providing specificity as well as temporal and spatial regulation to GTPase signaling <xref rid="pgen.1003774-East1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Thus, we believe that the identification of ELMOD3 role in the inner ear provides new insights into signaling processes that are important to hearing in humans.</p>

        <p>Family PKDF468 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) was recruited after obtaining Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent. The family history revealed that the onset of hearing loss was pre-lingual, with no clear vestibular impairment among the deaf individuals. Pure-tone bone and air-conduction audiometry revealed severe-to-profound mixed (conductive and sensorineural) hearing loss in the affected individuals of family PKDF468 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Individual V:2 exhibited severe-to-profound mixed hearing loss, with bone conduction thresholds for the right ear displaying a mild downward slope to the severe hearing loss range. The left ear displayed slightly better bone conduction thresholds with normal values for lower frequencies and a downward slope to severe hearing loss at higher frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The audiograms of individual V:5 revealed bilateral severe-to-profound mixed hearing loss, with a large conductive component in both ears. The bone conduction thresholds exhibited a mild downward slope to moderately severe hearing loss for the right ear and were slightly better on the left, for which the thresholds ranged from borderline normal to moderate hearing loss ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The clinical evaluation revealed no clear signs of skin, renal, or retinal abnormalities.</p>

        <p>To determine the temporal bone malformation, we performed computed tomography (CT) scans of two affected (V:2 and V:11) along with a normal hearing sibling (V:7). CT scan of individual V:2 revealed all three semicircular and internal auditory canals were intact on both sides. The middle ear and mastoid appeared well-aerated bilaterally. Imaging of individual V:11 demonstrated a slightly narrow appearing internal auditory canal on the right side only. The mastoid air cells and middle ear cleft were well-aerated bilaterally. The external auditory canal appeared normal as well for both affected individuals.</p>

        <title>Deafness in PKDF468 is linked with <italic>DFNB88</italic> locus</title>
        <p>We initially observed that deafness in family PKDF468 did not co-segregate with short tandem repeat (STR) markers for 74 of the reported recessive nonsyndromic deafness loci (data not shown). We therefore performed a genome-wide linkage analysis and observed that the deafness phenotype of family PKDF468 exhibited significant evidence of linkage to STR markers on chromosome 2p12-p11.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Approximately 85% of the disease-causing mutations in Mendelian disorders reside in coding regions or in exon-intron canonical splice junctions <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We therefore performed exome sequencing of an affected individual from family PKDF468. The sample was enriched using the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome Library v2.0 (Roche Diagnostics; San Francisco, CA), and 100 bp, paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina). An average of 78.94% of bases were sequenced with 20Ã coverage within the targeted regions. This yielded a total of 64,863 single-nucleotide variants, of which 1,928 were not found in the dbSNP133 database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003774.s011">Table S1</xref>). Based on the recessive mode of inheritance evident in the pedigree, we analyzed genes with homozygous changes and potential compound heterozygous changes. Additionally, we removed all of the variants that were present in six ethnically matched control samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003774.s011">Table S1</xref>).

The c.794T&gt;C change was not present near the canonical splice junctions and was not predicted to create any aberrant splice site. However, to confirm that c.794T&gt;C did not affect splicing of <italic>ELMOD3</italic> transcripts, we generated cDNA libraries using the total RNA extracted from the white blood cells of two affected and one normal hearing individual. Sanger sequencing of sub-cloned PCR products, amplified using primers in either exons 9 and 11 or in exons 9 and 12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003774.s002">Figure S2</xref>), did not reveal any aberrant splicing product in affected individuals.

        <p>We next examined the gene structure and expression of <italic>ELMOD3</italic>. Seven alternatively spliced isoforms of human <italic>ELMOD3</italic> were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Isoform A (reference sequence NM_ 032213.4) has a translation initiation codon (AUG) in exon 2, ten coding exons that encode a polypeptide of 391 residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003774.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).

The human ELMOD3 isoforms, A and B, share 87% identity, with all the differences clustered near the C-terminus. Isoforms E, F, and G do not encode the full-length ELMO domain due to alternate splicing of exons in the carboxy terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The c.794T&gt;C transition mutation is predicted to result in the substitution of serine for a highly conserved leucine in all of the ELMO domain-containing isoforms of ELMOD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g002">Figures 2A and 2C</xref>). In comparison to the human sequence, mouse <italic>Elmod3</italic> includes only three known alternatively spliced transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR analysis of multiple human and mouse tissue cDNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003774.s014">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003774.s015">S5</xref>) revealed the ubiquitous expression of isoforms <italic>A/a</italic> and <italic>BâD/bâc</italic> (Figures S3 and 2B). We also assayed the relative mRNA expression of murine <italic>Elmod3</italic> isoforms <italic>a</italic> and <italic>bâc</italic> with real-time quantitative RT-PCR of RNA that was extracted from cochlear and vestibular inner ear tissues from postnatal day 0 (P0), P10, and P30 C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

Therefore, we focused on the ELMOD3 isoform B for the subsequent biochemical and cellular studies. The mouse ELMOD3 protein is 70% and 80% identical to the A and B isoforms of human ELMOD3, respectively, and again the differences are greatest at the C-terminus, although single amino acid changes are scattered throughout the alignments.</p>

        <title>ELMOD3 is localized to the mechanosensory stereocilia of hair cells in rodent organ of Corti</title>
        <p>To characterize the cellular localization of ELMOD3, we produced a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against synthetic peptide immunogens from mouse ELMOD3 isoform b. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELMOD3 antibody was validated in immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses, in transfected cells and mouse tissues (Figures S4 and S7). Our antibodies specifically recognized ELMOD3 isoform b but not murine ELMOD1, ELMOD2, or ELMOD3 isoform a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003774.s004">Figure S4</xref>). We next performed immunolocalization of ELMOD3 in the rat and mouse organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g004">4</xref>). In rat cochlea, ELMOD3 immunoreactivity was observed in the stereocilia, kinocilia and cuticular plate of developing hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003774.s005">S5</xref>). Before P07, ELMOD3 staining was very weak in the inner hair cells stereocilia. By P07, in auditory hair cells, patchy labeling of ELMOD3 immunostaining was detected along the length of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast to actin staining, ELMOD3 immunoreactivity was not uniform along the length of each stereocilium and the protein seemed to be excluded from a region near the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). ELMOD3 immunoreactivity was also found in the supporting cells, including pillar and Dieters' cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Similar to that seen in the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), the stereocilia of inner hair cells in the mouse organ of Corti were more intensely labeled than those of outer hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast to the cochlear hair cells, ELMOD3 antibody labeling was observed within the hair cell bodies in the vestibular end organs of both rat and mouse inner ear, but no prominent immunoreactivity was observed in the hair bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g004">Figures 4Bâ4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003774.s006">S6</xref>). These observations suggest a unique role for ELMOD3 in cochlear sensory cells and may reflect the functional or structural differences between cochlear and vestibular hair bundles.

        <p>To decipher the link between F-actin and ELMOD3, we performed a two-color stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) imaging of EGFP-ELMOD3 transfected MDCK cells. While conventional confocal acquisitions revealed co-localization of ELMOD3 and the actin-cytoskeleton, this high resolution imaging technique allowed us to determine more precisely the relative positions of ELMOD3 and actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g007">Figure 7</xref>). ELMOD3 and actin were each found in close apposition to the plasma membrane and in irregularly shaped puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Many regions of extensive overlap in staining between ELMOD3 and actin, suggest the possibility that a subset of the actin-based structures may contain ELMOD3 but that each protein is also found localized independently of the other at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>

        <title>ELMOD3 exhibits GAP activity against Arl2</title>
        <p>Human ELMOD1 and ELMOD2 each possess Arl2 GAP activity <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Bowzard1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We therefore investigated whether ELMOD3 also possesses GAP activity against Arl2. Previous tests of bacterially expressed human ELMOD3 as either maltose binding proteins or trigger factor fusion proteins were negative, but the homologous preparations of ELMOD1 and ELMOD2 were found to possess very low specific activities as Arl2 GAPs, compared to the preparation purified from bovine tissues. To obtain a potentially more active preparation of human ELMOD3, we expressed ELMOD3 and the mutant p.Leu265Ser in HEK293T cells as N-terminal GST-fusion proteins to facilitate protein purification. Protein expression and purification from â¼10<sup>8</sup> HEK293T cells that expressed GST-ELMOD3 or the mutant each yielded â¼0.6 mg protein. These preparations were stable at 4Â°C and against freeze-thaw cycles, as judged by either GAP activity or lack of precipitation. We expressed and purified GST alone and used it as a negative control in all of our assays. We also evaluated the effect of cleavage of the GST fusion tag by TEV protease on ELMOD3 activity; no changes in activity in the Arl2 GAP assay were observed compared to un-cleaved proteins (data not shown). Thus, we believe that the presence of the GST moiety at the N-terminus does not interfere with access to the substrate or with enzymatic activity in our assay.</p>
        <p>When we varied the amount of GST-ELMOD3 protein in the Arl2 GAP assay, we observed a dose-dependent response and evidence of saturation at higher protein concentrations (data not shown). Using the lower concentrations of GST-ELMOD3 to estimate the initial rates of GAP-dependent activity and estimating the purity of the preparation at 50% (based on visual inspection of Coomassie blue-stained gels), we obtained a specific activity of 24 pmol of GTP hydrolyzed/min/mg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This specific activity of GST-ELMOD3 as an Arl2 GAP is approximately 32-fold lower than that determined for GST-ELMOD1 and nearly 1000-fold lower than that of GST-ELMOD2 or bovine testes ELMOD2, which is the most active reported preparation of any Arl2 GAP <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Bowzard1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Thus, in contrast to our earlier report that it is inactive, GST-ELMOD3 does exhibit Arl2 GAP activity, and we believe that its lower specific activity when expressed in bacteria likely contributed to the earlier negative findings <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Bowzard1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The differences in specific activity among the three human GST-ELMOD preparations from HEK293T cells are predicted to result from differences in substrate specificity, sensitivities to co-activators (as known for Arf GAPs), or both. Thus, more studies are required to determine whether the biologically relevant substrate of ELMOD3's GAP activity in the inner ear is Arl2 or a related GTPase.</p>

        <p>We next assessed the effects of the Leu265Ser point mutation on the Arl2 GAP activity of GST-ELMOD3. The mutant protein was expressed at the same levels in HEK293T cells and was purified in the same way, resulting in equivalent amounts of protein, indicating that the protein is equally stable in mammalian cells and in solution. However, when assayed for Arl2 GAP activity, the mutant was inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Although we observed small amounts of activity over our no protein control, this level of activity seen for the mutant was not different from that observed with GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003774-g008">Figure 8</xref>). These activities are so low as to be at or near the lower limits of our assay. Thus, we can safely conclude that the point mutant has at least a 10-fold lower specific activity than the wild-type protein, but it might be completely inactive as an Arl2 GAP.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our study revealed that <italic>ELMOD3</italic> is important for hearing in humans as a missense mutation in the gene leads to profound hearing impairment. ELMOD3 belongs to the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) protein family, which includes six known members in mammals (ELMO1-3 and ELMOD1-3). Our <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies reveal that fluorescently tagged ELMOD3 localized with the actin-based microvilli of LLC-PK1-CL4 epithelial cells, in the stereocilia of sensory hair cells of mouse organ of Corti explants, and to a lesser extent to the actin cytoskeleton of MDCK cells, whereas the deafness-associated allele (p.Leu265Ser) was deficient in each case. Similarly, we show that human ELMOD3 possesses Arl2 GAP activity but the mutant has at least a 10-fold loss in activity.</p>
      <p>While ELMOD3 antibody reactivity was detected in outer hair cells stereocilia at P02, more pronounced accumulation of ELMOD3 immunoreactivity was detected in rat cochlear inner hair cell stereocilia only by P12, which is when hair bundles are in the late phase of maturation. During this period, the inner hair cell stereocilia undergo a rapid elongation <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The observed staining suggests that ELMOD3 might be necessary for the initial development of the outer hair cell stereocilia or the organization of the bundle in a staircase pattern but may play a different role in the stereocilia of inner hair cells. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that ELMOD3 may play a role in the maturation or maintenance of the cochlear stereociliary bundle. Recently, two spontaneous mutations (<italic>rda</italic> and <italic>rda<sup>2J</sup></italic>) in mouse <italic>Elmod1</italic> were shown to result in profound deafness and vestibular dysfunction <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, demonstrating that the function of ELMOD1 is essential for regulating the shape and maintenance of inner ear hair cell stereocilia in mice <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. <italic>Elmod1</italic> has been shown to be part of a large cluster of genes expressed in the developing inner ear, while <italic>Elmod3</italic> level was below the detectable range <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Hertzano1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. These observations are consistent with findings from other studies, like the SHIELD database, which demonstrated that the level of <italic>Elmod3</italic> mRNA is â¼100-fold lower than that of <italic>Elmod1</italic> in the developing inner ear (P0âP1).</p>
      <p>Besides stereocilia bundles, immunoreactivity for ELMOD3 was also detected along the kinocilium in developing cochlear hair cells. Recently, it has been shown that ELMO1 can act at the interface between the actin-cytoskeleton and microtubule network by interacting with ACF7 (Actin crosslinking family 7) <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Margaron1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Moreover, microtubule polymerization depends on Arl2 activity <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and we have shown that ELMOD3 exhibits a GAP activity against Arl2. Therefore, ELMOD3 expression in the kinocilium might have a role in the assembly of the kinocilium architecture and in pathways regulating planar cell polarity.</p>
      <p>The ELMO family proteins are functionally poorly characterized, and more information is currently available for the ELMOs than for the ELMODs, with no structural information available for any of them. So far, only one activity has been ascribed to ELMOD proteins: we previously reported that recombinant human ELMOD1 and ELMOD2 display <italic>in vitro</italic> Arl2 GAP activity, whereas ELMOD3 and bacterially expressed ELMO1-3 did not <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Bowzard1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. More recently, we performed additional phylogenetic and functional analyses of the ELMO domain that led us to re-examine whether ELMOD3 shares the Arl2 GAP activity of ELMOD1 and ELMOD2. Our data contrast with the earlier-published claim that ELMOD3 lacks Arl2 GAP activity; we determined that it does indeed possess this activity, albeit at a substantially lower specific activity than that of its two closest human paralogs. The large differences in specific activities observed in the Arl2 GAP assay may be due to differences in the specificities of ELMODs as GAPs for different GTPases, including the lack of one or more binding partners (e.g., one that is perhaps analogous to Dock180 binding to ELMO1 or a co-activator for activity such as has been proposed for COP-I and ArfGAP1 <xref rid="pgen.1003774-Goldberg1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>), and/or the lack of post-translational modification.</p>
      <p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment revealed that ELMOD3 harboring the p.Leu265Ser mutation, unlike ELMOD3, has no or few GAP activity against Arl2. The lack of Arl2 GAP activity of the mutant may suggest a reduced affinity for the Arl2 GTPase, which may play an important role in ELMOD3 localization. <italic>Elmod3</italic> and <italic>Arl2</italic> are expressed in developing mouse cochlear tissues and weakly in vestibular tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003774.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Even though ELMOD3 is active and has been defined as âArl2 GAPsâ, we expect it to be active against other GTPases in the Arf family as well. We therefore speculate that ELMOD3 functions as a GAP for Arl2 and perhaps other GTPases that participate in actin organization, polymerization or depolymerization in the cochlear hair bundles. If ELMOD3 is an active GAP for other GTPases, these GTPases are likely to be part of the Arf family given that GAPs are not known to cross family boundaries within the Ras superfamily. However, it is plausible that ELMOD3 functions in a signaling pathway that includes Arl2 (or an Arf family GTPase), Rac, Rho, and, ultimately, affects the actin cytoskeleton.</p>
      <p>Future studies will address the specific roles of ELMOD3 in the development of the inner ear sensory epithelium, cytoskeletal organization, and ELMOD3-mediated signaling pathways. Revealing the interacting partners, substrate specificities for its GAP activities, as well as the means of regulation of ELMOD3 and other ELMO family proteins, will shed light on the overlapping functions of the Ras superfamily in the inner ear. These fundamental functions of this unique protein family are likely to be important in all eukaryotic cells.</p>

        <p>BL21 (DE3) Gold <italic>E. coli</italic> were transfected with the pCOLD-TF-ELMOD3 and pCOLD-TF-ELMOD3 Leu265Ser plasmids, and single colonies were used to inoculate cultures in LB medium with 100 Âµg/ml ampicillin, which were grown at 37Â°C with shaking. When OD<sub>600</sub>â=â0.5, the cells were moved to 15Â°C for 30 min without shaking. IPTG was then added to 1 mM, and the culture was grown overnight at 15Â°C with shaking. The cells were collected and lysed by passage through a French press in 20 mL of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000Ã <italic>g</italic> for one hour at 4Â°C, and the supernatants were loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare) that was pre-equilibrated in the same buffer.

The protein was further purified and buffer-exchanged by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex S200 column (24 mL) that was run in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Typical yields from this protocol were â¼10 mg/L TF-ELMOD3 that was &gt;90% pure, as estimated by visual inspection of a Coomassie blue-stained gel. The actin binding experiment was performed with purified TF-ELMOD3 and TF-ELMOD3 Leu265Ser using an Actin Binding Protein Biochem Kit (Cytoskeleton Inc, Denver, CO), following the manufacturer's protocol and later repeated with the GST-ELMOD3 proteins purified from HEK cells.</p>

The cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by resuspension in 1.5 ml 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, and 1% CHAPS. The solution was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min in a microfuge at a maximum speed (â¼14,000Ã g) at 4Â°C. Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) beads were added and incubated at 4Â°C for 3 hrs with mixing. The beads were then pelleted, washed twice in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 100 mM NaCl and eluted (2Ã0.5 mL) in the same buffer containing 20 mM glutathione. The eluted protein was concentrated to 0.25 mL in a spin concentrator (Amicon Ultra-4; EMD Millipore). The protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay. Typical yields of preparations from 10Ã10 cm plates were â¼600 Âµg of GST-ELMOD3 or mutant and â¼6 mg of GST. The purified proteins were quick frozen and stored at â80Â°C.</p>

<xref rid="pgen.1003774-Bowzard1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Briefly, 2 ÂµM purified recombinant Arl2, prepared as described by Clark <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003774-Marth1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, was pre-loaded with [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM KCl, and 0.5 mM ATP in a total volume of 100 ÂµL. The incubation was performed at 30Â°C for 30 min. The GAP reaction was performed in a buffer that contained 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP and the pre-loaded Arl2 [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP. The total 50 ÂµL reaction was initiated by the addition of the sample that contained the Arl2 GAP and stopped after 4 min at 30Â°C by the addition of 750 ÂµL of ice-cold activated charcoal (5% activated charcoal (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 50 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.4). The samples were clarified by centrifugation, and 400 ÂµL was taken for counting in a liquid scintillation counter. Each GAP sample was also assayed in parallel in a tube that contained all of the above reagents except Arl2 (i.e., the same amount of [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP). The resulting âblankâ values were subtracted from the results that were obtained in the presence of Arl2 to determine the amount of hydrolyzed <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> that was dependent on Arl2 GAP activity.
