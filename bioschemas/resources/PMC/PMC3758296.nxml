      <abstract>
        <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex. Mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are associated with familial ALS and lead to SOD1 protein misfolding and aggregation. Here we show that the molecular chaperone, HSJ1 (DNAJB2), mutations in which cause distal hereditary motor neuropathy, can reduce mutant SOD1 aggregation and improve motor neuron survival in mutant SOD1 models of ALS. Overexpression of human HSJ1a (hHSJ1a) <italic>in vivo</italic> in motor neurons of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mice ameliorated disease. In particular, there was a significant improvement in muscle force, increased motor unit number and enhanced motor neuron survival. hHSJ1a was present in a complex with SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and led to reduced SOD1 aggregation at late stages of disease progression. We also observed altered ubiquitin immunoreactivity in the double transgenic animals, suggesting that ubiquitin modification might be important for the observed improvements. In a cell model of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> aggregation, HSJ1a preferentially bound to mutant SOD1, enhanced SOD1 ubiquitylation and reduced SOD1 aggregation in a J-domain and ubiquitin interaction motif (UIM) dependent manner. Collectively, the data suggest that HSJ1a acts on mutant SOD1 through a combination of chaperone, co-chaperone and pro-ubiquitylation activity. These results show that targeting SOD1 protein misfolding and aggregation <italic>in vivo</italic> can be neuroprotective and suggest that manipulation of DnaJ molecular chaperones might be useful in the treatment of ALS.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective loss of upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The loss of motor neurons results in progressive paralysis and death, typically within 5 years of onset <xref rid="pone.0073944-Wijesekera1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Most cases of ALS are sporadic and of unknown cause (sporadic ALS, or sALS), however, in around 10% of cases the disease is inherited (familial ALS, or fALS). Of these, approximately 20% have been attributed to mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) <xref rid="pone.0073944-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Several potential disease mechanisms have been proposed for mutant SOD1 mediated motor neuron cell death <xref rid="pone.0073944-Ilieva1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Ferraiuolo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; however, the critical initiators and accelerators of motor neuron degeneration remain elusive.</p>
      <p>A hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, is the formation of ubiquitin positive inclusions of aggregated protein. Intracellular proteinaceous inclusions, evident in the motor neurons of ALS patients <xref rid="pone.0073944-Lowe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Leigh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and also in mutant SOD1 mice <xref rid="pone.0073944-Bruijn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, represent an important feature of ALS. The accumulation of misfolded and aggregation-prone protein suggests an imbalance of protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Molecular chaperones are critical factors for maintaining proteostasis through facilitating protein folding and quality control <xref rid="pone.0073944-Voisine1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Indeed, the heat shock response co-inducer arimoclomol, which upregulates molecular chaperone expression, can protect against mutant SOD1 toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0073944-Kieran1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Kalmar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The manipulation of several individual molecular chaperones and co-chaperones, including small Hsps (HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB8), Hsp70 (HSPA1), DNAJB1, CHIP and BAG1 have all been shown to reduce mutant SOD1 aggregation and/or improve viability in cells <xref rid="pone.0073944-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Urushitani1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Rohde1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Crippa1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, the upregulation of individual chaperones <italic>in vivo</italic> has been less successful, as only HSPB1 provided some protective effects at an early phase in the mutant SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> model of ALS, but not at late stage of the disease <xref rid="pone.0073944-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Overexpression of either HSPA1 or BAG1 had no beneficial effects in mouse models of ALS <xref rid="pone.0073944-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Rohde1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The molecular chaperone HSJ1 (DNAJB2) is a member of the Hsp40 (or DnaJ) family of heat shock proteins that contain a J domain, which is crucial in substrate recognition by Hsp70 <xref rid="pone.0073944-Cheetham1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Cheetham2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Kampinga1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Thus, Hsp40/DnaJ protein function is essential for Hsp70 function, including protein folding and directing misfolded proteins towards the proteasome <xref rid="pone.0073944-Kampinga1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. HSJ1 is preferentially expressed in neurons as two alternatively spliced isoforms that differ in their subcellular localisation <xref rid="pone.0073944-Cheetham1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Chapple1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The smaller cytoplasmic isoform, HSJ1a (DNAJB2a), can suppress the aggregation of polyglutamine expanded proteins <xref rid="pone.0073944-Westhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-BorrellPages1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Howarth1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Labbadia1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, through a mechanism dependent on the regulation of the Hsp70 ATPase cycle by its J domain and enhancing proteasomal degradation of misfolded client proteins via its ubiquitin interaction motif (UIM) domains <xref rid="pone.0073944-Westhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. HSJ1a can also co-operate with Hsp70 to regulate the proteasomal targeting of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 3-linked protein, ataxin 3 <xref rid="pone.0073944-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Transgenic upregulation of HSJ1a in a mouse model of Huntington's disease reduced huntingtin aggregation and improved neurological performance by reducing the ability of aggregated huntingtin to promote further aggregation <xref rid="pone.0073944-Labbadia1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, HSJ1 appears to be critical for normal motor neuron function, as mutations in <italic>DNAJB2</italic> cause recessive distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) <xref rid="pone.0073944-Blumen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The potential importance of HSJ1 for motor neuron function was further demonstrated in a cell model of ALS, in which overexpression of HSJ1a or HSJ1b reduced inclusion formation by the A4V mutant of SOD1 <xref rid="pone.0073944-Blumen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is possible that enhanced expression of HSJ1a alone might be beneficial in mutant SOD1 induced ALS and could modify SOD1 proteostasis and/or enhance motor neuron function in ALS. In this study, we investigated the ability of HSJ1a to protect against mutant SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>
<italic>in vivo</italic> and in cells. Using a transgenic approach, we expressed human HSJ1a in mice that overexpress the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mutation and assessed physiological function at a late stage of disease to test whether upregulation of HSJ1a can have beneficial effects in this model of ALS. We also assessed the effects of HSJ1a upregulation on spinal cord motor neuron survival and identified interactions between mutant SOD1 protein and HSJ1a in both spinal cords of transgenic mice and in a cell model. Our results show that HSJ1a reduces mutant SOD1 aggregation dependent on its J and UIM domains and can enhance late stage motor neuron survival in a mouse model of SOD1 ALS.</p>

        <title>hHSJ1a expression in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice</title>
        <p>HSJ1a transgenic mice were produced that express human HSJ1a (hHSJ1a) under the control of the bovine prion protein promoter. Female hemizygous hHSJ1a and male hemizygous SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (G93A) mice <xref rid="pone.0073944-Gurney1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> were then crossed to generate double transgenic (DBLE) mice. These DBLE mice were compared with littermate G93A, wild type (WT) and hemizygous hHSJ1a only (hHSJ1a) animals. hHSJ1a expression in the spinal cord was assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g001">Figure 1A and 1C</xref>). The expression of hHSJ1a was approximately seven-fold the endogenous mouse HSJ1a and was relatively constant at 60 and 90 days, but was reduced at 120 days of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The constant expression in this line, line 61a, is in contrast to another hHSJ1a transgenic line, line 52a, which showed a three-fold increase in expression between 30 and 105 days of age <xref rid="pone.0073944-Labbadia1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Immunohistochemistry of 120 day lumbar spinal cord confirmed that the increase in HSJ1a staining in the hHSJ1a and DBLE animals was predominantly originating from motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests that the reduction in hHSJ1a expression in the DBLE spinal cords at 120 days is likely to reflect a reduction in the number of surviving motor neurons due to SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> toxicity, but might also reflect a reduction in promoter activity or hHSJ1a stability.</p>

        <p>TA and EDL are fast twitch muscles that normally contract and relax rapidly. However, as a result of the selective loss of motor neurons that innervate fast twitch type IIa muscles fibres in G93A mice as disease progresses, the contractile characteristics of TA and EDL alter, and these fast twitch muscles begin to resemble slow twitch muscles, with a decrease in the speed of muscle contraction <xref rid="pone.0073944-Kieran1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Bryson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Sharp2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

        <title>Overexpression of hHSJ1a improves muscle weight and increases motor neuron survival, but has no effect on lifespan of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice</title>
        <p>At the end of the physiological assessment of muscle force, the TA and EDL muscles were removed and weighed in order to determine the extent of muscle mass. As expected, in G93A mice there was a significant reduction in the weight of the TA and EDL muscles compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g003">Figure 3E, F</xref>). In DBLE mice, TA muscle weights mice were not significantly greater than in G93A mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g003">Figure 3E</xref>); however, the EDL muscles from DBLE animals weighed significantly more than in mice expressing SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g003">Figure 3F</xref>; 6.3Â±0.7 mg in G93A and 8.1Â±0.5 mg in DBLE EDL; p&lt;0.05).</p>
        <p>Following removal of the hindlimb muscles, the animals were perfused with fixative and the lumbar spinal cord removed and processed for determination of motor neuron survival. Motor neurons within the sciatic motor pool were identified in the ventral horn of the lumbar cord (between the lumbar regions L2âL6) using morphological criteria (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, and in line with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0073944-Kieran1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Sharp2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, the number of motor neurons in the spinal cord of G93A mice was dramatically less than in either WT or hHSJ1a mice (WTâ=â460Â±20; hHSJ1aâ=â435Â±10 compared to 155Â±15 in G93A; p&lt;0.001 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). However, in DBLE transgenic mice expressing hHSJ1a and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>, there was a 61% increase in motor neuron survival compared to G93A mice (250Â±10; p&lt;0.001). These morphological data reflect those of motor unit survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), and confirm that hHSJ1a overexpression protects motor neurons against mutant SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> toxicity at 120 days of age.</p>
        <p>Given these improvements in motor neuron survival and muscle function at a relatively late stage of disease, we hypothesised that the effect of HSJ1a expression may be more pronounced earlier in disease.

The G93A mice had significantly fewer motor neurons compared to WT (67% of WT level, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Surprisingly, the DBLE mice had a similar reduction in motor neurons suggesting that hHSJ1a expression does not improve motor neuron survival at 90 days, and the beneficial effects are only evident late in disease. Furthermore, analysis of lifespan of male G93A and DBLE mice revealed that overexpression of HSJ1a had no significant effect on the lifespan of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

        <p>As overexpression of hHSJ1a protected spinal cord motor neurons and improved muscle function <italic>in vivo</italic> in a model of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> ALS, we hypothesised that the protective effect of hHSJ1a in motor neurons might be a result of reducing SOD1 aggregation. The levels of SOD1 protein in the spinal cord of male mice were analysed using the C4F6 antibody that recognizes a misfolded conformation of the SOD1 protein <xref rid="pone.0073944-Urushitani2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Bosco1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Analyses of total spinal cord lysates from each genotype confirmed that levels of SOD1 increased as disease progressed in both the G93A and DBLE animals, and hHSJ1a expression did not alter the total level of SOD1 at any stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We then used non-reducing SDS-PAGE to monitor the formation of SOD1 aggregates and observed that higher molecular weight (HMW) species that were trapped at the top of the gel, in the stacking gel and in the loading well accumulated as disease progressed from 60 to 120 days. Interestingly, in the DBLE spinal cords there appeared to be less HMW material trapped at the stacking gel and in the well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). To analyse these potential aggregates further, a differential sedimentation protocol of spinal cord lysates was developed to separate soluble protein from sedimentable, aggregated, insoluble protein. Analysing these fractions by Western blotting with C4F6 confirmed that insoluble, aggregated SOD1 accumulated as disease progressed. Importantly, the amount of insoluble SOD1 was significantly reduced in the DBLE spinal cord, but only at 120 days of age, not at earlier stages of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). To test the hypothesis that HSJ1a could be acting directly on SOD1, co-immunoprecipitation with C4F6 was used to detect potential HSJ1a:SOD1 complexes. hHSJ1a only precipitated with SOD1 from the DBLE tissue and the reciprocal precipitation confirmed that SOD1 could only be recovered with HSJ1a from the DBLE spinal cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, mHSJ1a and mHSJ1b were not detected in the C4F6 precipitation only hHSJ1a, despite the higher levels of mHSJ1b in the cell lysates. This suggests that either HSJ1a preferentially binds mutant SOD1, or that the heterologously expressed hHSJ1a protein is more available to bind mutant SOD1 than endogenous HSJ1 proteins.</p>

        <title>HSJ1a reduces SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> aggregation in a cell model</title>
        <p>To probe the potential mechanisms and domain requirements of the hHSJ1a mediated reduction in SOD1 aggregation and improved motor neuron survival in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS, we developed a cell model of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> aggregation based on the expression of GFP tagged SOD1 (GFP-SOD1) in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells, which do not express detectable endogenous HSJ1. Wild-type SOD1 (SOD1-WT) was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in over 95% of cells and was present in only the soluble protein fraction following sedimentation analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g008">Figure 8AâC</xref>). In contrast, SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (SOD1-G93A) formed perinuclear inclusions in approximately 40% of cells and had a substantial insoluble fraction on sedimentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g008">Figure 8AâC</xref>). The expression of HSJ1a led to a significant reduction in SOD1-G93A inclusions and redistribution to an even cytoplasmic and nuclear staining pattern similar to the SOD1-WT. Furthermore, HSJ1a expression reduced the insoluble sedimentable component of SOD1-G93A. To test if the ability of HSJ1a to reduce SOD1-G93A aggregation was dependent on the J or UIM domains, we used a point mutation in the J domain that disrupts the interaction with Hsp70 (H31Q) or 4 point mutations that disrupt the function of the UIM domains (S219A/E222A/S262A/E265A) (ÎUIM) <xref rid="pone.0073944-Westhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The J domain mutant H31Q lost the ability to suppress SOD1-G93A aggregation and inclusion formation, whereas the UIM mutant was partially functional, as it could still reduce aggregation and inclusion formation, but was not as efficient as wild-type HSJ1a. The interaction of HSJ1a with SOD1-WT and SOD1-G93A was compared by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). HSJ1a bound preferentially to the mutant form of SOD1, although there was some detectable binding to SOD1-WT. The H31Q and ÎUIM mutants of HSJ1a retained the ability to bind SOD1-G93A. In fact, their binding was stronger than wild-type HSJ1a, suggesting that these mutants bind the misfolded client protein non-productively.</p>

        <title>HSJ1a enhances SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> ubiquitylation</title>
        <p>The potential of HSJ1a to alter SOD1 ubiquitylation was investigated further using the cell model. Triple label immunofluorescence revealed that both HSJ1a and ubiquitin were recruited to SOD1-G93A inclusions following proteasome inhibition with MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). To test whether the mutant SOD1 was a target for HSJ1a mediated ubiquitylation, SOD1-G93A was immunoprecipitated with antibody C4F6 from cells co-transfected with HSJ1a, the J domain mutant H31Q, or the UIM mutant and blotted for ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). The expression of HSJ1a or H31Q led to a small increase in HMW ubiquitin immunoreactivity in the cell lysate input, especially in the presence of proteasome inhibition as previously described <xref rid="pone.0073944-Westhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In the absence of proteasome inhibition, the HMW ubiquitin immunoreactive smear in the C4F6 purified material was most pronounced in the cells transfected with the H31Q mutant. In contrast, proteasome inhibition revealed a strong increase in the C4F6 purified HMW ubiquitin immunoreactivity in the HSJ1a co-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073944-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), suggesting that HSJ1a was enhancing mutant SOD1 ubiquitylation and stimulating its removal by the proteasome. The HSJ1a ÎUIM mutant did not enhance SOD1-G93A ubiquitylation, confirming that this effect was dependent on HSJ1a UIM domains.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>ALS is recognized as a multifactorial disease with a range of pathways and cell types affected, leading to the demise of motor neurons and ultimately paralysis of muscles and death. The aggregation of mutant SOD1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of fALS and the upregulation of molecular chaperones can protect against SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mediated motor neuron cell death <xref rid="pone.0073944-Kieran1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Kalmar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The upregulation of individual molecular chaperones, although effective in cell models, has been less effective in animal models <xref rid="pone.0073944-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Rohde1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This has led to the suggestion that upregulation of several chaperones is probably more effective than individual chaperones alone <xref rid="pone.0073944-Batulan1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and that protection may even require several chaperone machines. Here, we have shown that overexpression of HSJ1a can reduce SOD1 aggregation and improve motor neuron survival. This suggests that some molecular chaperones may be more effective than others at reducing protein aggregation and maintaining proteostasis in motor neurons.</p>
      <p>HSJ1 is a member of a subfamily of DNAJB proteins that are particularly effective at preventing polyglutamine aggregation <xref rid="pone.0073944-Hageman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, but HSJ1 is unique in that it also contains two UIM domains that can bind ubiquitin <xref rid="pone.0073944-Westhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. HSJ1a overexpression reduced mutant huntingtin aggregation in mouse brain in a manner that was dependent on its J domain and UIM domains <xref rid="pone.0073944-Labbadia1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In the case of mutant SOD1, the J domain was also needed to reduce SOD1 aggregation in cells, suggesting a role for Hsp70. The J domain mutant could still bind to mutant SOD1 but the binding appears to be non-productive and suggests that HSJ1a co-operates with Hsp70 to actively prevent mutant SOD1 aggregation, rather than by a passive chaperone action. The involvement of the UIM domains of HSJ1a in protecting against mutant SOD1 was less clear, as the UIM mutant retained some partial activity, but was compromised relative to wild-type HSJ1a. We were not able to investigate the role of the J domain or UIM domain in the suppression of mutant SOD1 aggregation <italic>in vivo</italic> because of the relatively low recovery of mutant SOD1 by immunoaffinity purification techniques compared to mutant huntingtin <xref rid="pone.0073944-Labbadia1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In a cell model of mutant SOD1 aggregation, however, HSJ1a stimulated SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation in a UIM dependent manner, suggesting that the altered ubiquitin immunoreactivity observed in the DBLE animals might be involved in the protective mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic>. Collectively, the data suggest that the combination of the different HSJ1a domains function together as a chaperone, cochaperone and pro-ubiquitylation factor to reduce mutant SOD1 aggregation. It is also possible that other members of this DNAJB subfamily of proteins that lack the UIM domain, but are effective against polyglutamine aggregation, may also be effective against mutant SOD1 in cells and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>In addition to the potential specialisation of certain chaperone anti-aggregation properties, it is likely that some chaperones are more important for motor neuron function and maintenance than others. In particular, mutations of some small heat proteins (HSPB1 and HSPB8) lead to dHMN and Charcot-Marie Tooth (CMT2) disease <xref rid="pone.0073944-Rossor1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. HSJ1 proteins are also important for motor neuron function or maintenance, as mutations in <italic>DNAJB2</italic> leads to motor neuropathy in man <xref rid="pone.0073944-Blumen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Whether the critical role of HSJ1 proteins is to prevent protein aggregation or deal with motor neuron specific client proteins still remains to be determined, but it is possible that a loss of HSJ1 chaperone activity could lead to enhanced aggregation of SOD1 or other proteins that could ultimately contribute to motor neuron cell death. This will need to be tested in animal models of HSJ1 loss of function to identify what the cellular consequences are of HSJ1 ablation for motor neuron biology. Similarly, overexpression of other dHMN or CMT2 chaperones may be beneficial for motor neuron survival. HSPB1 showed effects early, but not late, in disease <xref rid="pone.0073944-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and therefore might be complementary to HSJ1a overexpression. Such that a combination of the two chaperones could yield better protection. HSPB8 has yet to be tested in mouse models of fALS, although it is potentially a potent chaperone against fALS related proteins <xref rid="pone.0073944-Crippa1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The overexpression of hHSJ1a improved motor neuron survival and muscle function in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model, but did not prevent the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mediated loss of body mass. Weight loss is a major determinant of the endpoint applied in our ethically approved protocols to reduce animal suffering, therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that we also did not observe any increase in lifespan in the DBLE mice. The lack of lifespan extension, or body mass retention, commensurate with the improved neuromuscular performance could reflect the relatively late effects we observed on SOD1 aggregation and motor neuron survival. Since HSJ1 is part of a larger chaperone complex, it is possible that increasing the expression of one chaperone from the complex cannot exert sufficient chaperone activity to fully correct protein misfolding in ALS. Thus, the reduction in SOD1 aggregation we observed may not be sufficient to protect motor neurons and neuromuscular function in the longer term and increase the lifespan of these mice. Reduced aggregation and increased motor neuron survival were only detectable close to end stage and the disease in this aggressive model may have been too advanced by this point to be delayed. It is unclear why the effect of hHSJ1a on SOD1 aggregation was only observed late in disease, as the level of hHSJ1a was relatively constant. This is unlike the case of mutant huntingtin and hHSJ1a line 52a where we observed a good spatiotemporal correlation between the level of hHSJ1a and reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregation <xref rid="pone.0073944-Labbadia1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It is possible that <italic>in vivo</italic> the mutant SOD1 is not fully accessible for HSJ1a chaperone activity until later in disease, either through a change in conformation or a post-translational modification, such as ubiquitylation. Alternatively, HSJ1a might only bind certain conformations of SOD1, similar to the way it prefers to bind high molecular weight complexes of mutant huntingtin <xref rid="pone.0073944-Labbadia1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and that these species increase as the disease progresses. Interestingly, the proportion of mutant SOD1 that was insoluble increased between 90 and 120 days and this might reflect a change in the type of SOD1 aggregates or a failure of the cellular machinery to deal with the mutant protein later in disease. The effect of hHSJ1a on SOD1 is likely to be direct as hHSJ1a is present in a complex with SOD1 in DBLE spinal cord. Although both HSJ1a and HSJ1b have been reported to reduce SOD1<sup>A4V</sup> inclusion formation in cells <xref rid="pone.0073944-Blumen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, mHSJ1b was not detected in the SOD1 complex suggesting that HSJ1a might be more efficient against mutant SOD1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. It was not possible to determine the composition of the HSJ1a: SOD1 complexes and whether they were monomeric, oligomers or aggregates. Nonetheless, the improved survival of motor neurons suggests that the SOD1 species targeted by HSJ1a are part of the pathological process and potentially important targets for chaperone based therapies.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results show that over expression of HSJ1a ameliorates several disease signs at a late stage of disease progression in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS. The late action of HSJ1a suggests that if methods could be developed for upregulating HSJ1a expression in motor neurons it could potentially be of benefit post-symptom onset. The data also confirm that reducing protein aggregation can lead to improvements in motor neuron survival and suggest that therapies aimed at improving protein quality control may enhance neuronal survival in ALS.</p>

        <p>Hind limb muscle force of female mice was assessed <italic>in vivo</italic> under general anaesthetic at 120 days of age. The animals were anaesthetised with 4.5% chloral hydrate (1 ml/100 g body weight) injected intraperitoneally (Sigma-Aldrich) and prepared for electrophysiological assessment of hind limb isometric muscle force. The distal tendons of the TA and EDL muscles in both hind limbs were exposed, dissected free from surrounding tissue and cut. The sciatic nerve was exposed in the mid-thigh region, and sectioned along with all of its branches except the deep peroneal nerve, which innervates the TA and EDL muscles. The hind limbs of the animal were rigidly secured to the table with stainless steel pins and the distal tendons of the TA and EDL attached to an isometric force transducer (Dyamometer UFI Devices, Welwyn Garden City, UK) via silk thread. The length of each muscle was adjusted to obtain maximal twitch tension. The muscles and nerves were kept moist with saline and experiments were carried out at approximately 22Â°C. Muscle contractions were elicited by stimulation of the sciatic nerve via platinum electrodes. Maximal tetanic contraction, was assessed by stimulating the sciatic nerves of both hind limbs with trains of stimuli at increasing frequencies of 40, 80 and 100 Hz for a total duration of 450 ms. The tetanic tension was measured with the aid of a computer and appropriate software (Picoscope, Pico Technology Limited). To determine the number of functional motor units in EDL muscle, stimuli of increasing intensity were applied to the sciatic nerve. This gradual increase in intensity resulted in stepwise increments in twitch tension due to successive recruitment of motor axons. The motor unit traces were recorded on a storage oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR, USA). The number of increments in twitch tension was counted to give an estimate of the number of motor axons present in the nerve.</p>

Cells were then transfected with 1 Âµg/well of total DNA which was a 1â¶1 mixture of pEGFP-SOD1 (WT or G93A mutant) and pCMV-Tag3a-HSJ1a (wild type, H31Q or UIM mutants described previously <xref rid="pone.0073944-Chapple1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073944-Westhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>) or empty vector using Lipofectamine and Plus reagents from Invitrogen (Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, Renfrewshire, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. For SOD1 ubiquitylation experiments, the plasmid DNA ratio was 2â¶1â¶2 of pEGFP-SOD1, pCMV-Tag3a-HSJ1a and pCW7-myc-Ub respectively. Cells were treated with 50 ÂµM MG132 proteasome inhibitor (Enzo Life Sciences, Plymouth, UK) or DMSO vehicle for 4 hours prior to lysis. 24 hrs post transfection cells were lysed in 200 Âµl/well of RIPA buffer containing 5% of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), sonicated 3Ã5 seconds on ice, cleared, and used for immuno-precipitation or differential sedimentation. Cells in chamber slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and used for inclusion counts on Nikon Eclipse 80i epi-fluorescence microscope (Nikon UK Ltd., Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, UK). Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss UK, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK).</p>
