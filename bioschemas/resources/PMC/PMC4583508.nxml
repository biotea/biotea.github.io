      <abstract>
        <p>The N-terminal domain of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) harbors a large number of naturally occurring mutations that are associated with stress-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden death. Nearly all these disease-associated N-terminal mutations are located at domain interfaces or buried within domains. Mutations at these locations would alter domain-domain interactions or the stability/folding of domains. Recently, a novel RyR2 mutation H29D associated with ventricular arrhythmia at rest was found to enhance the activation of single RyR2 channels by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Unlike other N-terminal disease-associated mutations, the H29D mutation is located on the surface of the N-terminal domain. It is unclear how this surface-exposed H29D mutation that does not appear to interact with other parts of the RyR2 structure could alter the intrinsic properties of the channel. Here we carried out detailed functional characterization of the RyR2-H29D mutant at the molecular and cellular levels. We found that the H29D mutation has no effect on the basal level or the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent activation of [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding to RyR2, the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of single RyR2 channels, or the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>- or caffeine-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in HEK293 cells. In addition, the H29D mutation does not alter the propensity for spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or the thresholds for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release activation or termination. Furthermore, the H29D mutation does not have significant impact on the thermal stability of the N-terminal region (residues 1â547) of RyR2. Collectively, our data show that the H29D mutation exerts little or no effect on the function of RyR2 or on the folding stability of the N-terminal region. Thus, our results provide no evidence that the H29D mutation enhances the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of RyR2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an essential component of excitation-contraction coupling in the heart [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. RyR2 is also a critical player in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To date, more than 150 naturally occurring, disease-associated mutations in RyR2 have been identified. However, the functional consequences of most of these disease-associated RyR2 mutations are completely unknown. Only a small fraction of these RyR2 mutations have been functionally characterized. To improve the diagnosis and treatment of RyR2-linked diseases, it is imperative to understand the functional impact of disease-associated RyR2 mutations.</p>
      <p>Recent major advances in defining the three-dimensional (3D) structure of RyR have provided invaluable and detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease-associated RyR mutations. For instance, high-resolution structures of the N-terminal region of RyR have recently been solved [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The N-terminal region of RyR2 consists of three domains: two domains that form Î²-trefoils (domain A residues 1â217), domain B (residues 218â409), and domain C (residues 410â543) that is part of a longer Î±-solenoid in intact RyRs [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mapping of more than 50 disease-associated mutations into the 3D structure of the N-terminal domains has revealed that all of the disease-associated mutations in this region are located at domain interfaces or buried within individual domains [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In RyR2, these domain interfaces appear particularly important: a central chloride ion is coordinated by residues of all three domains, and disruption of the binding through disease-causing mutations results in domain reorientations [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These observations have led to the proposition that disease-causing mutations in the N-terminal region destabilize domain interfaces or disrupt the folding of individual domains, which would impair domain-domain interactions and structural changes that are required for proper gating of the channel [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In line with this hypothesis, we have shown that a number of disease-associated mutations in the N-terminal region alter the activation and/or inactivation of the RyR2 channel [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>A novel RyR2 mutation, H29D, has recently been identified and is believed to be associated with short-coupled polymorphic ventricular tachycardia at rest [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Functional characterization using single channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers revealed that single H29D mutant channels exhibited enhanced cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation at diastolic cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations compared to single RyR2 WT channels [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It was proposed that the H29D mutation causes a 'leaky' channel at low cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and that 'leaky' RyR2 may be a mechanism for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia at rest [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, unlike all other known N-terminal disease mutations [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the H29D mutation is not located at a domain interface or within a domain. The H29D mutation is located in a loop between beta-sheet 1 and 2, and mapped to the surface of the RyR2 structure that is facing the transverse tubular membrane [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, the H29 side chain has been shown to display great flexibility in multiple crystal structures of the RyR2 N-terminal region [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], further indicating that it forms no significant interactions with any other residues. How then could the H29D mutation affect intrinsic properties of the RyR2 channel? To address this question, in the present study, we characterized the H29D mutant at the molecular and cellular levels using a number of functional and biochemical assays. We found that the H29D mutation did not alter the basal level or the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding to RyR2. Single channel analysis showed that the H29D mutation did not affect cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of single RyR2 channels. The H29D mutation also had no effect on the activation of RyR2 by caffeine or the propensity for store-overload induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (SOICR). The H29D mutation also did not alter the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or the activation or termination threshold for SOICR. Furthermore, the H29D mutation had no effect on the expression of the RyR2 channel or the thermal stability of the N-terminal domains of RyR2. Collectively, our data indicate that the H29D mutation does not significantly alter the intrinsic properties of RyR2. Our results do not support the notion that the H29D mutation causes a 'leaky' RyR2 channel.</p>

        <title>Construction of the RyR2-H29D mutation</title>
        <p>Point mutation, H29D, in the mouse RyR2 was generated by the overlap extension method using PCR [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, a NheI-AflII fragment with mutation H29D was produced by overlapping PCR. The NheI-AflII fragment was removed from the PCR product and used to replace the corresponding wild-type (WT) fragment in the full-length RyR2 cDNA in the expression plasmid pcDNA5. The mutation and sequence of the PCR product were confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p>

        <title>Generation of stable, inducible HEK293 cell lines</title>
        <p>Stable, inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing RyR2-WT or the RyR2-H29D mutant were generated using the Flp-In T-REx Core Kit from Invitrogen [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, Flp-In T-REx-293 cells were co-transfected with the inducible expression vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO containing the WT or mutant RyR2 cDNAs and the pOG44 vector encoding the Flp recombinase in 1: 5 ratios using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> phosphate precipitation method. The transfected cells were washed with PBS 24 h after transfection followed by a change into fresh media for 24 h. The cells were then washed again with PBS, harvested, and plated onto new dishes. After the cells had attached (~4 h), the growth medium was replaced with a selection medium containing 200 Î¼g/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). The selection medium was changed every 3â4 days until the desired number of cells was grown. The hygromycin-resistant cells were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at -80Â°C. These positive cells are believed to be isogenic, because the integration of RyR2 cDNA is mediated by the Flp recombinase at a single FRT site. The handling and storage of the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee at the University of Calgary.</p>

        <p>HEK293 cells were plated in 100 mm tissue culture dishes at ~10% confluence 18~20 h before transfection with RyR2 WT or H29D mutant cDNA. After transfection for 24 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% egg phosphatidylcholine, 2.5 mM DTT, and a protease inhibitor mix (1 mM benzamidine, 2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 2 Î¼g/ml pepstatin A, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mM PMSF) on ice for 60 min. Cell lysate was obtained after removing the unsolubilized materials by centrifugation twice in a microcentrifuge at 4Â°C for 30 min each. Equilibrium [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding to cell lysates was performed as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with some modifications. [<sup>3</sup>H]Ryanodine binding was carried out in a total volume of 300 Î¼l binding solution containing 30 Î¼l of cell lysate, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris, 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine and CaCl<sub>2</sub> to set free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] from pCa 9.89 to pCa 4 and a protease inhibitor mix at 37Â°C for 20 min. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/EGTA ratio was calculated using the computer program of Fabiato and Fabiato [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The binding mix was diluted with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 250mM KCl and immediately filtered through Whatman GF/B filters presoaked with 1% polyethylenimine. The filters were washed three times, and the radioactivity associated with the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding in the presence of 50 Î¼M unlabeled ryanodine. All binding assays were done in duplicate.</p>

        <title>The RyR2-H29D mutation has no effect on the basal level or the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding</title>
        <p>Since ryanodine only binds to the open state of the RyR channel, [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding has commonly been used as an index for the open probability (Po) of RyR. Furthermore, because [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine, once it is bound to RyR, dissociates from the channel very slowly, equilibrium [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding assay performed over several hours is highly sensitive to detect RyR openings especially under conditions where the Po of the channel is very low. Therefore, we employed [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding assay to determine the impact of the H29D mutation on the basal activity of RyR2 at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent activation of the channel. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0139058.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, the H29D mutation had no significant effect on [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (45â150 nM) (<xref rid="pone.0139058.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the EC<sub>50</sub> of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent activation of [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding between the RyR2 WT (0.193 Â± 0.002 Î¼M) and H29D mutant (0.203 Â± 0.008 Î¼M) (P = 0.338) (<xref rid="pone.0139058.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). We also performed [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding to lysate from HEK293 cells co-transfected with RyR2 WT and H29D (in 1:1 ratio) to mimic the heterozygous expression of H29D mutant in patients (i.e. H29D<sup>+/-</sup>). We found that H29D<sup>+/-</sup> does not affect the EC<sub>50</sub> of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent activation of [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding (0.200 Â± 0.002 Î¼M) (P = 0.914). It should be noted that the expression level of the RyR2 WT and H29D mutant are similar (<xref rid="pone.0139058.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that the H29D mutation does not enhance the openings of the RyR2 channel at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations or the sensitivity of the channel to Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation.</p>

        <title>The H29D mutation does not affect the response of RyR2 to caffeine</title>
        <p>We have previously shown that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and caffeine induce different conformational changes in the structure of RyR2, suggesting different mechanisms of RyR2 activation by these ligands [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although the H29D mutation does not alter the activation of RyR2 by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, it is unclear whether it affects the activation of RyR2 by caffeine. To this end, we assessed the responses of HEK293 cells expressing the RyR2 WT and the H29D mutant to caffeine. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0139058.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, applications of incremental concentrations of caffeine (from 0.05 mM to 0.5 mM) induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in HEK293 cells expressing RyR2 WT with increased amplitude. The amplitude of caffeine induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release decreased at higher caffeine concentrations (1.0 mM to 5 mM). This decrease likely resulted from the depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by the prior applications of caffeine (0.025 to 0.5 mM) [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0139058.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).

        <title>The H29D mutation has no effect on the propensity for spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release</title>

        <title>The H29D mutation does not affect the thermal stability of the N-terminal region of RyR2</title>
        <p>The location of the H29 residue on the surface of the RyR2, away from any interface with other RyR2 domains or known auxiliary proteins (<xref rid="pone.0139058.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), supports the lack of functional effects. In previous crystal structures of the RyR2 (1â547) construct, the H29 side chain shows great flexibility, further indicating that it does not form significant interactions with neighboring residues. Disease-causing mutations could also act by causing a general destabilization of the protein fold, which could then indirectly lead to altered domain interactions. Indeed, many disease-causing mutations in RyRs have been found to significantly destabilize the fold, as indicated by a decreased thermal stability [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The location at the surface makes this an unlikely scenario for the H29D mutation, but we decided to confirm this by purifying the H29D variant of RyR2 (1â547) and subject it to thermal melt analysis. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0139058.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>, the H29D mutant N-terminal region displayed a temperature dependence of protein unfolding similar to that of the WT N-terminal region.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Naturally occurring mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) have been linked various cardiac arrhythmias, such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and atrial fibrillation, and structural heart diseases, such as dilated, hypertrophic, and non-compaction cardiomyopathies [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In order to understand the diverse disease mechanisms associated with RyR2 mutations and to develop mechanism-based strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of RyR2-associated diseases, it is imperative to understand the exact molecular defects of individual RyR2 mutations.</p>
      <p>Given their fundamental and clinical importance, over the past decade, a number of structural and functional studies have been carried out to investigate the impact of disease-linked RyR2 mutations. These investigations have provided some important insights into the actions of disease mutations. However, only a small fraction of known RyR2 mutations has been studied. The functional consequences of some of the RyR2 mutations studied are unclear and debatable. For instance, Meli et al. [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] showed that the RyR2-G230C mutation exerts no effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of single RyR2 channels incorporated into planar lipid bilayers under resting conditions. In contrast, we found that single RyR2-G230C channels displayed markedly enhanced sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, we showed that the G230C mutation increased the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent activation of [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding, enhanced the propensity for spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, reduced the threshold for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release activation and termination, and decreased the thermal stability of the N-terminal region of RyR2 [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This G230 residue is part of a conserved Gly-Gly motif that forms a turn at the interface between domains A and B. Replacing G230 with a cysteine (G230C) is likely to affect the geometry of the turn, and thus the relative orientation/packing of domains A and B. In line with this view, our data indicate that the G230C mutation indeed has a dramatic impact on the function and structure of RyR2 [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
      <p>Unlike the G230C mutation, Cheung et al. [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] showed that the H29D mutation significantly enhanced the activation of single RyR2 channels by diastolic cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. It was proposed that the enhanced activity of the H29D mutant channel at diastolic cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> would lead to a âleakyâ channel under resting conditions, which may explain ventricular tachyarrhythmia occurring in the RyR2-H29D mutant carriers at rest [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The H29 residue is located in the loop between beta sheets 1 and 2 in the N-terminal domain A. This loop lies on the surface of the three-dimensional structure of RyR [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, unlike many other disease-linked RyR2 mutations in the N-terminal region, the H29 residue is not located at a domain-domain interface, neither within the N-terminal region nor involving other neighboring domains recently identified in recent cryo-EM studies of RyR [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is also not involved in coordinating the central chloride ion [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], is not located at a known interface with RyR2 auxiliary proteins [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and is not buried within a domain where it could interfere with folding. On the contrary, the H29 side chain has been found to be highly flexible in multiple crystal structures [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], implying that it doesnât even interact with side chains of neighboring residues. Given these observations, it is thus puzzling how the H29D mutation could alter the intrinsic properties of the RyR2 channel. To address this important question, we performed a number of functional assays to determine the impact of the H29D mutation. In contrast to those reported by Cheung et al., we found that the H29D mutation does not alter the activation of single RyR2 channels by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, we showed that the H29D mutation has no effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent activation of [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding, the propensity for spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, the threshold for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release activation or termination, or the thermal stability of the N-terminal region of RyR2. Thus, our data on the impact of both the G230C [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and H29D mutations on single RyR2 channels differ from those of Meli et al. [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and Cheung et al. [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The exact reasons for these controversies are unknown at present. Differences in experimental conditions, such as conditions for transfection, sources/status of RyR2 channels used for single channel studies, and conditions for single channel recordings are likely to be involved. For examples, we used 250 mM K<sup>+</sup> as the charge carrier for our single channel recordings, whereas Cheung et al. [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] used 53 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier. Furthermore, we characterized the impact of the H29D mutation on the function of the mouse RyR2, whereas Cheung et al. [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] studied the human RyR2. It is possible that the structure of the N-terminal domains in the intact human RyR2 differs slightly from that in the intact mouse RyR2, such that the H29D mutation may affect the function of human RyR2, but not that of mouse RyR2. Clearly, further work will be required to sort out these controversies. Nevertheless, our data obtained from single channel analysis, [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release assays, single cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, and structural analysis clearly demonstrate that the H29D mutation has little or no impact on the intrinsic function of mouse RyR2 or the structural stability of the N-terminal region.</p>
      <p>It is, however, unclear how the H29D mutation that does not alter the intrinsic function of the RyR2 channel causes ventricular tachyarrhythmia at rest. Although the H29D mutation does not affect the isolated RyR2 channel, it may alter the interactions between RyR2 and its regulatory proteins in cardiac cells. The H29 residue is exposed on the surface at the top of the cytosolic assembly of the RyR2 structure. Currently, no auxiliary protein has been shown to interact directly with the RyR N-terminal region, but the possibility remains that such a binding partner exists. This part of the RyR2 structure may interact with proteins associated with the transverse tubular membrane. Thus, it is possible that the RyR2-H29D mutation may alter excitation-contraction coupling or SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by affecting protein-protein interactions that regulate RyR2 function. Further investigations will be needed to determine whether the RyR2-H29D mutation alters RyR2 function and SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in the context of cardiac cells, intact heart or animal models.</p>
      <p>Although the H29D mutation has no effect on the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of RyR2, whether the H29D mutation has any effect on luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of RyR2 has yet to be determined. We have previously shown that a number of CPVT RyR2 mutations enhance the activation of the channel by luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the propensity for spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release upon store Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload (SOICR) [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the present study, we found that the H29D mutation has no effect on the propensity for SOICR or the threshold for SOICR activation or termination. Given the close link between SOICR and luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, the lack of effect of H29D on SOICR suggests that the H29D mutation is unlikely to exert a major impact on luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation. However, further studies are required to directly assess the impact of H29D on the luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of RyR2.</p>
      <p>In summary, in the present study, we have characterized the impact of a recently identified RyR2 mutation H29D that is thought to be associated with ventricular arrhythmia at rest using a number of biochemical, electrophysiological, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging techniques. Our data show that, in contrast to a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0139058.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the RyR2-H29D mutation has no effect on the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of RyR2. Our results also demonstrate that the H29D mutation does not alter the propensity for spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, a well-known cause for triggered arrhythmia.</p>
