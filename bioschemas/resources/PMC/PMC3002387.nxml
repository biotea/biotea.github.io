        <p>The localization of polycystin (PC)1) to the plasma membrane requires coexpression with PC2 and cleavage at the PC1 G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site. Neither the PC1 binding capacity of PC2 nor its channel function is required for this effect.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Polycystin (PC)1 and PC2 are membrane proteins implicated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. A physiologically relevant cleavage at PC1's G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS) occurs early in the secretory pathway. Our results suggest that PC2 increases both PC1 GPS cleavage and PC1's appearance at the plasma membrane. Mutations that prevent PC1's GPS cleavage prevent its plasma membrane localization. PC2 is a member of the <italic>trp</italic> family of cation channels and is an important PC1 binding partner. The effect of PC2 on PC1 localization is independent of PC2 channel activity, as tested using channel-inhibiting PC2 mutations. PC1 and PC2 can interact through their C-terminal tails, but removing the C-terminal tail of either protein has no effect on PC1 surface localization in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Experiments in polarized LLC-PK cells show that apical and ciliary PC1 localization requires PC2 and that this delivery is sensitive to PC2 truncation. In sum, our work shows that PC2 expression is required for the movement of PC1 to the plasma and ciliary membranes. In fibroblast cells this localization effect is independent of PC2's channel activity or PC1 binding ability but involves a stimulation of PC1's GPS cleavage before the PC1 protein's surface delivery.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Most membrane proteins must be targeted to specific and restricted subcellular locations to function optimally. Consequently, cells have developed intricate signaling pathways and trafficking machinery to guarantee the proper establishment and maintenance of these localizations. Mislocalization of functionally important proteins can be detrimental at the cellular and organismal levels, and some genetic diseases are attributable to pathogenic mutations that alter a particular protein's distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Seabra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Muth and Caplan, 2003</xref>). This correlation between abnormal pathology and protein localization is certainly true in the case of an interesting subset of mutant alleles of the genes PKD1 and PKD2, which encode the membrane proteins polycystin (PC)1 and PC2, respectively. Mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a common genetic disease affecting approximately one in a thousand individuals. The disease causes progressive cyst formation in the adult kidney, resulting in end-stage renal failure in approximately half of all ADPKD patients by their sixth decade of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Gabow, 1993</xref>). Many pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding PC1 result in the production of little or no full length PC1 protein. Other disease-causing mutations of PC1, however, lead to the generation of PC1 protein that does not accumulate in at least one of its sites of functional residence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Roitbak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Russo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, mutations in the tuberous sclerosis 2 protein, which may play a role in ensuring the proper trafficking of PC1, also is associated with a polycystic kidney phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Kleymenova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The connection between mislocalization of PC1 and severe kidney pathology reveals the critical importance of the cellular mechanisms that ensure the proper subcellular trafficking and retention of the PC1 protein.</p><p>There is robust expression of PC1 and PC2 in the epithelial cells of the developing and mature renal tubules, as well in the cells of a variety of other somatic tissues, including the heart, liver, bone, and endocrine glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Ward <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Markowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Peters <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Within the cell, polycystin-1 and -2 colocalize to the primary cilia where they play roles in calcium signaling, mechano- and chemosensation, and the modification of signaling cascades such as the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), activator protein (AP)-1, and the Wnt pathways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Veland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>. Polycystin-2 is a transient receptor potential channel family member that acts as a calcium-activated calcium release channel and is most abundantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Koulen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). PC2 and PC1 are thought to interact primarily through their C-terminal cytoplasmic tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Qian <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Tsiokas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Casuscelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Several investigations have suggested that PC1 and PC2 may reciprocally affect each other's surface membrane or ciliary localizations, although the precise nature of this interdependence has varied somewhat among experimental systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hanaoka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Grimm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Babich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). An interaction between these two proteins also has been suggested to be important in creating a functional ion channel, whether through activation of the PC2 protein's intrinsic channel properties or through emergent channel properties attributable to formation of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hanaoka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Delmas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>PC1 is a very large protein that undergoes several cleavages during its processing and movement through the secretory pathway. One of these cleavages occurs at a G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS), which is located at a position in the PC1 protein's extracellular N-terminal domain just before the beginning of the first transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Qian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Cleavage at this site involves a <italic>cis</italic>-autoproteolytic event that occurs early in the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Missense mutations in PC1 residues that are required for the autocatalytic GPS cleavage severely impair the normal functions of the PC1 protein, as evidenced by the capacity of these mutations to cause ADPKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Qian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In addition, the ability of the PC1 protein to undergo successful GPS cleavage seems to be a prerequisite for proper kidney development, because evidenced by the cystic phenotype observed in mice that are homozygous for the expression of noncleaving PC1 alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Two other cleavages take place at the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of PC1, releasing fragments that translocate to the nucleus and modify the AP-1 and JAK/STAT signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Chauvet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Low <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The extent of C-terminal cleavage is modulated by changes in fluid flow, consistent with the hypothesis that production of soluble cytoplasmic fragments contributes to the PC1 protein's postulated role as a participant in mechanosensory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Chauvet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Naturally occurring mutations in PC2 suggest important information about the protein's possible functions. One variant identified in ADPKD families substitutes the aspartic acid residue at position 511 in the protein's third predicted transmembrane domain with a valine residue (D511V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Reynolds <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The aspartic acid residue at position 511 is thought to constitute part of the PC2 channel's conducting pore, and the PC2-D511V protein has no channel activity and exerts dominant-negative effect on the activity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium release channels when it is expressed by transfection in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Koulen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The localization of the D511V protein, however, is indistinguishable from that of wild-type PC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Koulen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Many investigators also have studied the properties of a PC2 protein in which a stop codon has been inserted immediately after the leucine at residue number 703 (L703X). This truncation eliminates most of the PC2 protein's cytoplasmic C terminus. The L703X truncated PC2 protein is structurally similar to the PC2 proteins produced by several naturally occurring disease-causing truncating mutations found in ADPKD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Koulen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The L703X truncating mutation eliminates a domain of the PC2 that interacts with PC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Qian <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), and the protein lacks the calcium- or voltage-based regulation of channel activity that is detected in the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Koulen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The extent to which PC1 undergoes at least one of its C-terminal cleavages seems to be affected by the expression of wild-type and mutated forms of PC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bertuccio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, the PC1 and PC2 proteins exhibit a complex and delicate interdependence in the regulation of their localizations and functions, both with respect to their independent activities and in their collaboration as members of the same complex. Much remains to be learned about the molecular and mechanistic details of this interdependence. Here, we present evidence that the localization of PC1 to the plasma membrane depends on the presence of PC2. More specifically, PC1 surface localization correlates with a PC2-stimulated increase in GPS cleavage. This cleavage and localization effect in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells is independent of any stable interaction between the two proteins. It is also independent of PC2's channel function, but the surface localization effect is disrupted by the PC2-D511V mutation. This evidence links PC2's regulation of PC1 cleavage to an effect on PC1 localization, and, by extension, to PC1 function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell Culture and Transfection</title><p>HEK293 and LLC-PK cells were grown at 37Â°C in DMEM or Î±-minimal essential medium, respectively (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% <sc>l</sc>-glutamine. Transient transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), and the quantities of each of the PC2 cDNA constructs used for transfection were adjusted to yield similar levels of protein expression as assayed by Western blot. Cells were assayed 24 h after transfection. Stable expression of PC1 was established in HEK293 and LLC-PK cells by using selection with G418 (Invitrogen). Stable PC2 expression was generated using Zeocin (Invitrogen). Ionomycin and A23187 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were added at the indicated concentrations for 30 min before processing the cells for immunofluorescence. To visualize cilia, LLC-PK cells were grown on 0.4-Î¼m polycarbonate filters (Costar, a division of Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA) for 5 d after reaching confluence before being processed for immunofluorescence.</p><p>We used a full-length cDNA encoding the mouse <italic>Pkd1</italic> that had been modified to contain both an N-terminal FLAG and a C-terminal triple-hemagglutinin (HA) tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Grimm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Construction of cDNA plasmids expressing PC2, PC2-D511V, and PC2-L703X, all with c-Myc tags, have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). To generate cell lines stably expressing these constructs, the coding sequence of tagged PC2 was moved to a vector that carries Zeocin resistance (pcDNA3.1; Invitrogen). PC2-T712A, which lacks a c-Myc tag, also has been characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>PC1 was detected using a polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) against the N-terminal epitope tag, or monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Covance Research Products, Princeton, NJ) against the C-terminal epitope tags. Monoclonal anti-HA antibodies conjugated to agarose beads were used for immunoprecipitation (Sigma-Aldrich). Polycystin-2 was detected using anti-c-Myc antibody (polyclonal from Sigma-Aldrich; monoclonal from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA<bold>)</bold>, or a polyclonal antibody against the native PC2 protein's N terminus (antibody B9, a gift from Dr. Stefan Somlo, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Cilia were marked using a monoclonal anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (clone 6-11B-1; Sigma-Aldrich). Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Flour 594 and 488 dyes, respectively (Invitrogen). All dilutions were 1:200 for immunofluorescence and 1:2000 for Western blotting. For Western blots, we used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies; anti-mouse was diluted 1:10,000 and ant-rabbit was diluted 1:5000 (Jackson ImmuoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA).</p></sec><sec><title>Surface Immunofluorescence</title><p>HEK293 cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine, whereas LLC-PK cells were grown on polycarbonate filters. To stain surface protein the cells were incubated for 1 h in a humidified chamber at 4Â°C with polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody diluted in a blocking buffer of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 100 nM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (PBS<sup>++</sup>). Cells were then washed with PBS<sup>++</sup>, fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in PBS<sup>++</sup> with 0.3% TritonX-100 and 0.1% BSA, and blocked for 30 min in goat serum dilution buffer (GSDB; 16% goat serum, 120 mM sodium phosphate, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 450 mM NaCl). They were then incubated for 1 h in a humidified chamber with the monoclonal anti-HA primary antibody diluted in GSDB, washed, and incubated for 1 h with the Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in GSDB. For a more detailed description, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chapin <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref>. The protocol for immunofluorescence without surface labeling takes cells straight to paraformaldehyde fix after washing with PBS<sup>++</sup> and then continues as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Image Acquisition and Quantification</title><p>Images used for illustration were taken with Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope. A single 0.5-Î¼m scan slice is shown, except in those images where it is noted that a vertical z-stack of images was compressed to provide a single view of the entire cell surface. For quantification, 10 representative images of each experimental condition were taken using an Axiophot microscope with AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) by using identical exposure conditions. In one experiment, the calculations were based on compressed vertical z-stacks of confocal images, as noted. The images were then analyzed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to calculate the sum of the pixel intensities above a cut-off threshold determined to eliminate background noise. This threshold was chosen based on analysis of the fluorescence intensity histograms associated with images of fields of coverslips lacking cells. This pixel intensity total was then divided by the number of cells that were positive for surface PC1 staining above the given threshold, yielding a calculation of average pixel intensity per cell. To quantify conditions with no PC1 surface expression, cells were counted using the internal anti-HA antibody immunofluorescence. A two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation, Biotinylation, Western Blots, and Quantification</title><p>Biotinylation was performed by incubating the cells with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce Chemical from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) in buffer (10 mM triethanolamine, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 125 mM NaCl at pH 8.9) at 4Â°C for a total of 40 min, followed by quenching with 100 mM glycine for a further 20 min. Lysis proceeded as described below, and labeled protein was precipitated using streptavidin-coated agarose beads by rotating overnight at 4Â°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Gottardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>).

Lysates were then mixed with SDS-containing sample buffer and heated to 55Â°C for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation from cleared lysates from a 12-well cell culture plate, monoclonal anti-HA was added, either preconjugated to agarose beads (15 Î¼l, total volume) or simultaneously with the addition of protein G beads (30 Î¼l of beads with 1 Î¼l of anti-HA antibody). After rotating overnight at 4Â°C the samples were washed four times with lysis buffer, once with PBS, and eluted off the beads with sample buffer at 55Â°C.</p><p>Prepared samples were run in an SDS buffer in a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and elecrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). After blocking for one hour in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 5% (wt/vol) powdered milk and 0.1% Tween, the blots were incubated with the specified primary antibody followed by the species-appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.

ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used for densitometry.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Surface Localization of PC1</title><p>To visualize the pool of PC1 at the surface of cells, we used a live-cell labeling protocol in which cells were incubated at 4Â°C with an antibody against the N-terminal FLAG epitope of PC1, thereby labeling proteins that had reached the membrane and were exposed to the extracellular space. The total pool of protein was visualized using the immunofluorescence signal produced by an antibody directed against the C-terminal HA tag on the PC1 construct, applied to cells after fixation and permeabilization. This immunofluorescence protocol revealed that HEK293 cells transfected with full-length PC1 alone showed a primarily intracellular localization of the protein. When PC2 was transiently expressed with PC1, there was a sevenfold increase in the size of the surface pool of PC1, as quantified by measuring average per-cell pixel intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). When PC1 was coexpressed with PC2-L703X there was an increase in plasma membrane localization similar to that seen with wild-type PC2, but coexpression with PC2-D511V resulted in the appearance of substantially less PC1 at the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, A and B).

Unfixed, unpermeabilized cells transiently transfected with PC1 were labeled using an antibody directed against the extracellular FLAG epitope tag appended to the N terminus of PC1 (A, aâd). The composites presented here are compressed stacks of 15 confocal images. Internal PC1 was detected after fixation and permeabilization using an antibody directed against the C-terminal HA epitope on PC1 and the images were merged to show colocalization at the plasma membrane (iâl). There was minimal expression of PC1 on the surface when it was expressed alone (a). These cells, however, expressed PC1 internally, as seen with the antibody directed against the C-terminal HA epitope tag (e). Coexpression of PC2 was associated with the appearance of PC1 protein at the surface (b). PC2-D511V had a substantially smaller effect on PC1 surface localization (c), whereas PC2-L703X caused a distribution of PC1 similar to that seen with PC2 (d). Quantification of five representative compressed stacks showed the extents of the increases in surface PC1 that occurred in the presence of each of the PC2 constructs; asterisk indicates p &lt; 0.05 compared with PC1 alone (B).

Confocal images of individual cells were obtained and the surface staining detected in these cells was then compared among cells that exhibited similar anti-HA antibody immunofluorescence pixel intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).

The CTF band was clearly visible on a Western blot of lysates prepared from transfected HEK293 cells probed with an antibody directed against the HA epitope tag that is appended to the C terminus of our PC1 construct (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Coexpressing PC2 with PC1 resulted in a twofold increase in the relative amount of PC1 CTF present in the cells, as quantified by densitometry and normalized to the total expression of PC1. Coexpressing PC2-L703X caused a similarly significant increase in PC1 cleavage, but PC2-D511V decreased the relative amount of the CTF fragment compared with the total amount of PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, A and B). It is worth noting that there was an overall increase of PC1 protein levels in cells that coexpress PC2, as seen in the immunofluorescence experiment depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and as documented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Tsiokas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). The fact that PC2-L703X changes the ratio of GPS cleavage without dramatically increasing PC1 protein levels, however, suggests that these two effects of PC2 expression are mechanistically distinct.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Cleavage of PC1 at the GPS is correlated with PC2-induced surface localization. Lysates from cells expressing PC1 alone or cotransfected with PC2, PC2-D511V, or PC2-L703X were immunoblotted with an antibody directed against the C-terminal HA tag of PC1, revealing the full-length PC1 band (arrow) and the large fragment resulting from cleavage at the GPS site (arrowhead, A). Expression of PC2 was verified using anti-PC2 antibody (A, bottom). The proportion of GPS-cleaved PC1 was calculated as the intensity of the GPS-cleaved protein band divided by the quantity of total PC1 protein expression, which was itself determined by summing the densities of the three major bands visible by Western blot: full-length, 150-kDa, and 70-kDa bands (B). Western blotting revealed that the 70-kDa band is not detected in untransfected cells (data not shown). Asterisk indicates significant increase or decrease in comparison to PC1 expressed alone (p &lt; 0.05), and error bars indicate SE. Comparing the lysate and the surface protein in HEK cells expressing PC1 and PC2, as detected using surface biotinylation and streptavidin pull-down (lanes labeled Surface), showed that most of the surface PC1 had been GPS-cleaved (C, top). There was no full-length PC1 detected in the biotinylated fraction (arrow, C). Blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody showed that FLAG-positive full-length PC1 protein was not present in the pool of surface PC1 (C, bottom).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zmk0241097070002"/></fig><p>The pool of PC1 brought to the plasma membrane by each of the PC2 constructs was predominantly GPS-cleaved, as detected by cell surface biotinylation. Essentially all of the PC1 protein that could be labeled by cell surface biotinylation had undergone GPS cleavage; whereas both the full-length and CTF forms of PC1 were readily detected on Western blots of the lysate from HEK293 cells expressing PC1 and PC2, protein found in streptavidin pull-downs prepared from surface biotinylation of these cells contained CTF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Consistent with the conclusion that uncleaved PC1 is largely absent from the cell surface, blotting with the antibody directed against the N-terminal FLAG epitope did not detect any full-length protein in the material recovered through surface biotinylation. Perhaps surprisingly, the cleaved N-terminal fragment was also not detected among the biotinylated proteins. It is possible that the structure of this domain of the PC1 protein precludes its lysine residues from being readily accessible to the NHS-SS-biotin reagent. Our preliminary observations, however, suggest the interesting alternative possibility that the conditions used in the biotinylation assay actually elute the N-terminal fragment from its noncovalent attachment to the membrane-associated PC1 C-terminal tail fragment (data not shown). Were this the case, then the absence of the N-terminal fragment from the pool of proteins collected after biotinylation would be consistent with the possibility that the majority of the surface population of PC1 has undergone GPS cleavage. We conclude that the presence of PC2 enhances GPS cleavage of the PC1 protein and that this stimulation of cleavage is strongly correlated with the surface delivery of PC1.</p><p>Given the correlation between GPS cleavage and increased PC1 surface localization we tested whether GPS cleavage was a prerequisite for or a consequence of surface delivery. PC1-L3040H is a form of PC1 that cannot be cleaved at the GPS site due to the mutation of the requisite leucine residue at the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). When expressed alone, PC1-L3040H exhibited an intracellular localization similar to that of wild-type PC1, but it failed to reach the plasma membrane when coexpressed with PC2 or PC2-L703X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). This lack of surface localization was not attributable to inefficient or incomplete cotransfection with PC2, because the cells expressed both PC1-L3040H and PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). To confirm these findings, we biotinylated cells cotransfected with PC2 and either PC1 or PC1-L3040H. Under conditions in which the wild-type PC1 protein was readily detected among the recovered biotinylated cell surface proteins, no PC1-L3040H was detected in this material by using antibodies directed against either the PC1 N- or C-terminal epitope tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Impairing GPS cleavage in PC1 prevents PC1 plasma membrane localization. The GPS-mutated PC1-L3040H (A) was not delivered to the plasma membrane in association with any PC2 construct (arrowheads in B). This lack of surface delivery occurred despite robust internal expression of the PC1-L3040H protein, as seen by immunofluorescence with an internal anti-HA antibody (B, bottom). In contrast, PC1 was readily detected at the surface when it was coexpressed with PC2 and imaged under identical conditions (arrows in B, far left). PC2 was coexpressed with PC1 constructs under both cotransfection conditions (arrows, C), and any cells that expressed only one construct were most likely to express PC2 alone rather than PC1 alone (arrowheads, C).

Because this mutation abrogated surface delivery, we next assessed the surface delivery of the converse mutation, a PC1-N-terminal deletion (PC1-NTD) construct lacking the majority of the extracellular N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The deletion removed the receptor for egg jelly domain, which is necessary for optimal GPS cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Qian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), resulting in a very low amount of GPS cleavage even in the presence of PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Under conditions of coexpression with PC2 that produced abundant PC1 surface delivery (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), there was little or no PC1-NTD detectable at the plasma membrane (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). It is possible that the L3040H and NTD mutations cause misfolding of the PC1 protein or otherwise impair its trafficking through mechanisms independent of any effect on GPS cleavage. It is safe to conclude, however, that the essential role of cleavage in PC1's surface delivery is not attributable solely to the physical dissociation of some putative transport-inhibiting component residing in the PC1 N terminus from the C-terminal fragment, because the PC1 NTD lacks most of the N-terminal fragment but fails to reach the plasma membrane when coexpressed with PC2.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The presence of a cleavable N-terminal tail on PC1 is necessary for plasma membrane localization.

Both PC1 and PC1-L3040H stably bound PC2 and PC2-D511V, whereas neither stably interacted with PC2-L703X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The observation that PC1 could not form a stable complex with PC2-L703X demonstrated that the PC2 C-terminal tail is an obligate participant in the PC1-PC2 interaction.

This failure of PC2-L703X to coIP was not due to a lack of PC1 construct pull-down, as shown by blotting the IP with polyclonal anti-HA antibody (A). PC1-NTD also robustly bound to PC2, as seen by PC2's presence in the pull-down from an IP with the anti-HA antibody against PC1-NTD (B, left).

The conclusion from this experiment is that PC2's channel function is not required to stimulate PC1's GPS cleavage or localization to the plasma membrane.

To investigate PC1 localization in polarized, ciliated cells we stably expressed PC1 alone or with PC2 constructs in LLC-PK cells. We grew cells on filters to allow complete polarization and then performed surface immunofluorescence against the N-terminal FLAG epitope to label PC1 at the plasma membrane. PC1 failed to substantially reach either the surface of the primary cilium or the cellular apical membrane when expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8</xref>, A and Aâ²).

This localization was revealed even more clearly in the cross-sectional view showing surface PC1 in the apical and ciliary plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D).

Our results suggest that the increase in GPS cleavage is a prerequisite for surface delivery, rather than being a result of PC1 reaching the plasma membrane. In nonpolarized cells coexpressing any one of the four PC2 constructs tested, the amount of GPS cleavage correlates closely with the corresponding measurement of the intensity of the surface PC1 immunofluorescence signal. Our results also suggest that the cleavage occurs before PC1 arrives at the plasma membrane, because the population of PC1 that is detected at the cell surface is GPS cleaved. Furthermore, constructs in which this cleavage is prevented, including the PC1-L3040H and PC1-NTD constructs, are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and do not reach the plasma membrane. These observations complement and are entirely consistent with the evidence gathered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Wei <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> showing that GPS cleavage takes place early in the secretory pathway.</p><p>The use of a surface immunofluorescence protocol allows us to measure quantitatively the PC1 surface population and to relate this localization to other aspects of the protein's processing.

The missense sequence alteration that resulted from this insertion was located very close to the subsequently discovered GPS cleavage site. We have found that this alteration significantly reduces the GPS cleavage of the PC1 protein, which both explains the perplexing lack of PC1 surface localization observed in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Grimm <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> study and further underscores the importance of GPS cleavage for surface localization.</p><p>Several other studies have examined the parameters that govern the localization of both endogenous and transfected PC1 expressed in cultured cells.

The presence of full-length protein at the lateral membranes of polarized cells, in contrast to the GPS-cleaved form of PC1 that we detect at the plasma membranes of nonpolarized cells, suggests that the different forms of PC1 may have functionally distinct roles, and strengthens the argument that regulating cleavage also may regulate localization.</p><p>In another study employing polarized cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Roitbak <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> found normal levels of PC1 expression but reduced levels of PC1 at the plasma membrane in kidney cells cultured from tissue excised from ADPKD patients. They attributed this effect to excessive phosphorylation of the PC1 protein. This study did not determine the nature of disease-causing mutations in the gene encoding the PC1 protein. It would be interesting to determine whether these mutations affected GPS cleavage without altering protein expression levels.</p><p>In a study employing nonpolarized cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Babich <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> found that PC1 colocalized with the plasma membrane marker CD4 when it was expressed in the presence of PC2 in CHO cells, similar to our results with HEK cells. They also concluded that expression of PC2-D511V was sufficient to induce accumulation of PC1 at the plasma membrane and that a PC1 construct lacking a portion of its N-terminal domain could reach the plasma membrane. It is important to note that these effects were quantified by measuring channel conductance induced by PC1 and PC2 expression and by assessing these proteins' presence at the cell surface by the extent of their colocalization with a plasma membrane marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Babich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Their marker for PC1 at the surface membrane was its colocalization with CD4, but we could not detect any surface PC1 in CHO cells using our surface immunofluorescence protocol (data not shown). It is possible that the CHO cell line that they used may have expressed relatively high levels of endogenous wild-type PC2 compared with the cells used in our studies. It is also worth noting that their electrophysiological assay is likely to be able to detect very small surface populations of active PC1âPC2 channel complexes, whereas their fluorescence assay may not be able to distinguish among bulk populations of proteins associated with submembranous compartments located close to the cell surface from the much smaller contingents that have attained a bona fide surface localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Babich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate that the effect of PC2 on PC1 localization is independent of a stable interaction between the two proteins. The PC2-D511V mutant stably binds PC1 but does not increase the amount of PC1 at the plasma membrane, whereas the truncated PC2-L703X cannot bind PC1 but still promotes its surface delivery. This suggests that the release of PC1 from the endoplasmic reticulum is not due to the release of PC1 from associations with chaperone proteins upon PC2 binding to form a heterodimeric complex with PC1, a mechanism that regulates the surface delivery of a other multimeric membrane protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Zerangue <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The dramatically different degrees of enhancement of PC1 GPS cleavage produced by PC2-L703X and PC2-D511V also shows that stimulating GPS cleavage neither requires nor is guaranteed by a stable interaction with PC1.</p><p>The results obtained with the PC1-CTD construct reveal several significant details of PC2's effect on PC1 expression and cleavage. The most apparent is that, though the coiled-coil region of PC1 has been shown to bind PC2 in isolation from the rest of the PC1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Qian <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), the fact that our PC1-CTD construct lacks the coiled-coil domain but still binds PC2 suggests that there are likely to be additional domains of in PC1 that are involved in the PC2 interaction. In regard to the effect of PC2 on PC1 stabilization and cleavage, coexpressing PC2 elevates PC1-CTD protein expression but does not increase the proportion of GPS-cleaved protein, suggesting that the stabilization and cleavage effects of PC2 on PC1 are mechanistically distinct.</p><p>A second implication arising from these studies is that an intact PC1 C-terminal tail is necessary for the enhancement of GPS cleavage. Our results suggest that the majority of the PC1 proteins that are present at the surface have intact C termini, because immunofluorescence analysis of PC2 coexpressing cells reveals surface patterns for the PC1 protein with both the anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. Furthermore, biotinylated PC1 protein from the surface of cells expressing PC1 and PC2 is detectable with the anti-HA antibody on a Western blot. Together, these data suggest the possibility that PC1 protein with an intact C-terminal tail is the substrate for PC2-stimulated GPS cleavage, and this protein subsequently moves to the surface. Given that the C-terminal tail has multiple signaling roles once cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Chauvet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Low <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), the prevalence of PC1 with an intact C-terminal tail at the plasma membrane suggests a spatial and possibly functional distinction between forms of PC1 that differ with respect to the states of their C termini.</p><p>The surprising incongruity in the effects of PC2-D511V and PC2-T721A on PC1 surface localization in nonpolarized cells underscores the significance of GPS cleavage in the promotion of trafficking PC1 to the plasma membrane. Both PC2-D511V and PC2-T721 are reported to manifest defective channel activity. Whereas PC2-D511V does not support PC1 GPS cleavage or surface delivery, both of these activities are accomplished by PC2-T721A. This is strong evidence that PC2's channel function is not the principle characteristic through which it mediates its effect on PC1 cleavage and distribution. We believe that, with respect to its effects on PC1 surface delivery, the significant point of difference between PC2-D511V and wild-type PC2 resides in the inability of the mutant PC2-D511V to promote GPS cleavage of PC1. This cannot be explained by a difference in the subcellular localizations of the wild type and D511V mutant PC2 proteins or by their capacity to interact physically with PC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Reynolds <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). We conclude that the regulation of GPS cleavage is dependent upon as yet unappreciated aspects of PC2 function and that further study will be necessary to understand how the D511V point mutation could cause such a dramatic shift in the functional link between PC1 and PC2.</p><p>The results obtained with polarized epithelial cells expand and provide important context for our understanding of PC2-enhanced PC1 plasma membrane delivery. In the kidney, the native polycystin proteins are expressed in the polarized epithelial cells of the renal tubules. Unlike the fibroblastic HEK293 cells, these cells possess plasma membranes divided into distinct apical and basolateral domains and contain sensory primary cilia. Thus, the surfaces of these cells provide a complex array of trafficking options to the machinery that controls the localization and physiological effects of PC1 and PC2. Given this distinction between polarized and nonpolarized cells, we thought it both important and potentially illuminating to expand findings from fibroblast cells into polarized cells. Our stable LLC-PK cell lines confirmed that expression of PC2 stimulates and is required for PC1 to achieve plasma membrane localization. This effect could be developmentally significant, given the nonsynchronous changes in PC1 and PC2 expression in the developing kidney: PC1 is most strongly expressed early in development, whereas PC2 expression is higher in mature tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Ward <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Markowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Chauvet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Our results suggest that PC2 coexpression both increases PC1 protein levels and alters its localization. Hence, alterations in PC2 expression may coordinately affect PC1 levels and localization. Further study is needed to test this hypothesis in the developing tubule, as well as to determine whether there are the functional differences between the pools of PC1 molecules present at internal and plasma membrane locations.</p><p>We were quite surprised to find substantial differences in the capacity of mutant forms of PC2 to support PC1 cell surface delivery in polarized versus fibroblastic cells. The most notable of these differences was that PC2-L703X failed to support PC1 localization to either the apical plasma membrane or the primary cilium in LLC-PK cells, whereas PC2-L703X coexpression was sufficient to ensure robust PC1 surface expression in HEK293 cells. In addition, PC2-D511V expression allowed a very low level of PC1 delivery to the primary cilium in LLC-PK cells, whereas as no surface PC1 expression was detected in HEK293 cells in which PC1 was coexpressed with the PC2-D511V construct. Some of this surface PC1 localization may be explained by the presence of endogenous PC2, as detected by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>E). Endogenous PC2 also may explain the low level of ciliary membrane PC1 seen in cells not transfected with PC2. In sum, the incongruence between PC1 localization in polarized and fibroblastic cells suggests the unexpected possibility that the processes and requirements that govern the trafficking of PC1 in polarized, ciliated cells differ from those that operate in nonpolarized cells. Further studies are required to determine whether the postsynthetic pathways pursued by PC1 in polarized versus nonpolarized cells are governed by distinct itineraries, interactions, or check points. It will also be interesting to determine whether the presence of a cilium alters generates signals that influence or alter the trafficking options available to PC1.</p><p>Based upon our evidence, PC2 coexpression leads to the delivery of PC1 to the plasma membrane, and more specifically to the apical and ciliary membranes of polarized cells. PC2 acts on PC1 early in the secretory pathway to promote cleavage of PC1 at the GPS site, leading to delivery of PC1 to the plasma membrane, and this effect is independent of a stable physical interaction between the two proteins. Cleavage at the GPS site separates the intracellular pool of PC1 into two functionally distinct groups, as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and we find that the GPS-cleaved pool of PC1 is characterized at least in part by its ability to reach the membrane. A regulatory effect of PC2 on PC1 cleavage has already been shown for the cytoplasmic PC1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Chauvet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bertuccio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and results shown here suggest that PC2 enhances the GPS cleavage as well. Given that the majority of the surface population of PC1 retains its cytoplasmic HA tag, PC2's effects on C- and N-terminal PC1 cleavages may be exercised on distinct pools of PC1 protein that ultimately reside in different subcellular compartments and that serve functionally distinct roles. It remains to be determined whether there is any functional relationship between the GPS cleavage and the C-terminal tail cleavage, and whether it is the surface or ER pools of PC1 that are preferentially susceptible to C-terminal tail cleavage. Future studies will examine this relationship, and explore the molecular processes through which PC2 expression influences the GPS cleavage and cell surface delivery of PC1.</p></sec>
