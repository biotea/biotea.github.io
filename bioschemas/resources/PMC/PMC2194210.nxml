      <abstract>
        <p>TollâIL-1âresistance (TIR) domainâcontaining adaptor-inducing IFN-Î² (TRIF)ârelated adaptor molecule (TRAM) is the fourth TIR domainâcontaining adaptor protein to be described that participates in Toll receptor signaling. Like TRIF, TRAM activates interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, IRF-7, and NF-ÎºB-dependent signaling pathways. Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 and 4 activate these pathways to induce IFN-Î±/Î², regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and Î³ interferonâinducible protein 10 (IP-10) expression independently of the adaptor protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). Dominant negative and siRNA studies performed here demonstrate that TRIF functions downstream of both the TLR3 (dsRNA) and TLR4 (LPS) signaling pathways, whereas the function of TRAM is restricted to the TLR4 pathway. TRAM interacts with TRIF, MyD88 adaptorâlike protein (Mal)/TIRAP, and TLR4 but not with TLR3. These studies suggest that TRIF and TRAM both function in LPS-TLR4 signaling to regulate the MyD88-independent pathway during the innate immune response to LPS.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family is the essential recognition and signaling component of mammalian host defense (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). At least 10 TLRs have been cloned in mammals, which recognize molecular products derived from all the major classes of pathogens. (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Toll signaling to NF-ÎºB originates from the conserved TollâIL-1âresistance (TIR) domain, which mediates recruitment of the TIR domainâcontaining adaptor molecule, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88 [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), a critical adaptor molecule used by all TLRs (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The recruitment of MyD88 to proximal TIR domains of activated TLRs allows for the interaction and activation of the IL-1Râassociated kinase (IRAK) family members (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and the subsequent activation of TNF receptorâassociated factor (TRAF)-6 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These events, at a minimum, result in NF-ÎºB activation via the IÎºB kinase (IKK)Î±âÎ²âÎ³ complex (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>Whereas most of the TLRs seem to be absolutely dependent on the expression of MyD88 for all of their functions, TLR3 and TLR4 are unique in their ability to activate both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent responses (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A feature of MyD88-independent signaling is the induction of a DC maturation pathway and the induction of the type 1 interferon (IFN-Î²) (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The transcription enhancer of the <italic>IFN-</italic>Î² promoter binds NF-ÎºB, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, and ATF-2âc-Jun. Whereas all TLRs activate NF-ÎºB and ATF2âc-Jun, not all TLRs induce IFN-Î² because not all TLRs induce IRF-3 activation. Thus, TLR3 and TLR4 appear to have evolutionarily diverged from other TLRs to activate gene expression programs and trigger antiviral responses by a mechanism involving the coordinate activation of NF-ÎºB and IRF-3 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
      <p>MyD88 adaptorâlike protein (Mal) (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), also called TIRAP (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), is a related MyD88-like protein, which was discovered based on its ability to mediate TLR4 signaling. Mal/TIRAP has been implicated in LPS-induced IFN-Î² induction in vitro (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, studies with Mal/TIRAP geneâtargeted mice show that Mal/TIRAP functions in the MyD88-dependent NF-ÎºB activation pathway after LPS stimulation, and engagement of TLR2 by its ligands (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A third adaptor protein, TIR domainâcontaining adaptorâinducing IFN-Î² (TRIF) (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), also known as TIR-containing adaptor molecule (TICAM)-1 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), interacts with TLR3 and mediates the TLR3-dependent induction of IFN-Î² via NF-ÎºB and IRF-3 activation.</p>
      <p>Constitutively expressed IRF-3 has been implicated in the induction of IFN-Î² (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), RANTES (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and ISG-54/56 expression (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). IRF-3 is activated after phosphorylation on a cluster of specific COOH-terminal serine residues (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), facilitating its dimerization and interaction with the coactivators CBP and p300 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>â<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The activated IRF-3 complex then translocates to the nucleus where it regulates the transcription of target genes (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). IRF-7 is a related transcriptional regulator that is expressed mostly in lymphoid cells and is essential for IFN-Î± gene expression (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The transcription of IRF-7 is induced by IFN and posttranslationally activated by phosphorylation on its COOH-terminal serine residues, some of which are conserved with IRF-3 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). IKKÉ (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and TANK-binding kinase (TBK)1 (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>â<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) are key regulators of the IRF-3 and IRF-7 activation pathways in cells that have been exposed to some viruses and/or activated by dsRNA via TLR3 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). IKKÉ and TBK1 are also required components of the TRIF signaling pathway, resulting in IRF-3 activation (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p>
      <p>Studies with IRF3-deficient mice have established an essential role for IRF-3 in LPS-induced IFN-Î² gene expression and endotoxin shock (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the MyD88-independent LPSâTLR4 pathway to IRF-3 and NF-ÎºB activation are unknown. Here, we have identified a fourth TIR domainâcontaining adaptor molecule, which we have named TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM). TRAM, like all of the TIR domainâcontaining adaptor molecules, activates NF-ÎºB. In addition, TRAM, like TRIF, activates IRF-3 and IRF-7. Unlike any of the other known TIR domainâcontaining adapters, TRAM appears to be restricted to the LPS activation (TLR4) pathway, whereas TRIF plays a role in both TLR3 and TLR4 pathways leading to IRF target gene expression. Our findings suggest that TRAM may have evolved to mediate TLR4-specific signals, resulting in a gene expression profile that is not shared by TLR3.</p>

        <title>LPS and dsRNA Activate IRF-3 and IRF-7.</title>
        <p>The promoters of RANTES and IP-10, like that of IFN-Î², contains transcription factor binding elements for NF-ÎºB and IRF-3 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The expression of RANTES and IP-10 represent downstream targets of Toll receptors that are entirely independent of MyD88 expression after stimulation by LPS or dsRNA. Stimulation of mouse BM-derived macrophages with LPS (TLR4) or dsRNA (TLR3) induced RANTES secretion, an effect that was observed equally in BM macrophages deficient in MyD88 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). This was also true for IP-10 levels as measured by ELISA (unpublished data). In contrast, TLR2 signaling via lipopeptides absolutely requires MyD88 and does not lead to RANTES expression. TLR2-mediated production of TNFÎ± was entirely absent in MyD88-deficient macrophages (unpublished data), in agreement with published studies (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).</p>

        <p>We next examined the effect of LPS and dsRNA on IRF-3 DNA binding activity. IRF-3 DNA binding activity was induced in both WT and MyD88-deficient macrophages after LPS and dsRNA stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> b). The presence of IRF-3 in this ISRE DNA binding complex was confirmed by depletion (âgel shiftâ) analysis using antibodies to IRF-3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> b, bottom). Stimulation of cells with the TLR2 ligand, Malp-2, did not result in IRF-3 activation. NF-ÎºB was activated in WT cells by all stimuli and in MyD88-deficient macrophages after LPS or dsRNA stimulation (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>We next addressed the question of whether the related transcriptional regulator IRF-7 was a target of TLR signaling. We employed an in vivo assay for IRF-7 activation, which utilizes a hybrid protein consisting of the yeast <italic>Gal4</italic> DNA-binding domain (DBD) fused to <italic>IRF-7</italic> lacking its own DBD (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Reporter gene expression from the <italic>Gal4</italic> upstream activation sequence in this assay requires IRF-7 activation (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). IRF-3 activation was also measured in this assay using a <italic>Gal4</italic>â<italic>IRF-3</italic> fusion protein. Stimulation of TLR3 or TLR4/MD2-expressing HEK293 cells with dsRNA or LPS but not IL1Î² activated both IRF-3 and IRF-7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> c). IRF7 plays a critical role in regulating IFN-Î±1 expression. Exogenously expressed IRF7 increased the activation of an IFN-Î±1 reporter construct when TLR4/MD2- or TLR3-expressing HEK293 cells were stimulated with LPS or dsRNA, whereas a dominant negative IRF7 mutant inhibited the effect (unpublished data). These observations are strong evidence that TLR3 and TLR4 activate IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, as a result, induce IRF target genes such as RANTES and IFNÎ±/Î².</p>

        <title>Discovery of a Fourth TIR Domainâcontaining Adaptor Molecule, TRAM.</title>
        <p>A search of the human genome for additional TIR domainâcontaining adaptor molecules resulted in the identification of a small protein fragment that shares sequence similarity with other TIR domainâcontaining proteins, most notably with TRIF/TICAM-1. A set of overlapping EST sequences were subsequently identified and used to clone the full-length cDNA of human and mouse TRAM, which share 75% sequence identity (sequence data available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession nos. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY232653">AY232653</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY268050">AY268050</ext-link>, respectively). The TRAM gene is located on human chromosome 5 (ENSEMBL ID: ENSG00000164226). TRAM is a 235 aa protein with a COOH-terminal TIR domain. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> a shows a multiple sequence alignment of human and mouse TRAM with other human adapters and TLRs. The crystal structure of the TIR domain of TLR2 has been resolved. The TIR domain âBB loopâ is an essential part of its structure, and this portion of the molecule appears to engage downstream elements such as adaptor molecules or other TLRs (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Most TIR domain BB loop sequences contain a conserved proline residue in the BB loop. When this residue is mutated to histidine, the mutant protein is typically unable to signal and may even function as a dominant suppressing mutation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Unlike the other known adaptor proteins, both human and mouse TRAM contain a cysteine residue at this position (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> a, #). A proline residue resides directly adjacent to this residue in TRAM, at position 112.</p>

        <p>Because of the similarity in the sequence of the TIR domain of TRAM and TRIF, we first compared the effect of TRIF and TRAM on IRF-3 and IRF-7 activation. Overexpression of TRAM activated the IRF-3 and IRF-7 response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> b). TRIF also activated both transcription factors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> b). As a consequence, TRAM and TRIF also induced the IFN-Î², RANTES, IP-10, and IFN-Î±1/Î±2 promoters, all of which contain ISRE elements (unpublished data). These data imply that TRAM and TRIF also activate NF-ÎºB, as some of these promoters (IFN-Î², RANTES, and IP-10) also require NF-ÎºB for full activity (see TRAM Also Activates NF-<sc>k</sc>B).</p>
        <p>As a further test of TRAM- and TRIF-dependent IRF-3 activation, we examined their effects on the nuclear translocation of IRF-3. Overexpression of TRAM and TRIF in a stable cell line expressing a GFP chimera of IRF-3 resulted in the nuclear translocation of this IRF-3âGFP fusion protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> a). TRIF has been shown recently to coimmunoprecipitate with IRF-3 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We were interested in determining if TRAM might also associate with IRF-3. When HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged TRAM and immunoprecipitated with antibody to endogenous IRF-3, Flag-tagged TRAM could be detected in the immunoprecipitated complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> b, top). Immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody confirmed this interaction; endogenous and cotransfected IRF-3 could be detected in the immunoprecipitated complexes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> b, second panel). TRIF also interacted with endogenous and transfected IRF-3 in agreement with published studies (unpublished data). There were no nonspecific associations detected in cells lacking the transfected adaptor constructs. Although not shown, we also performed similar experiments with IRF-7. IRF-7 also interacted with TRAM and TRIF and vice versa.</p>

IKKÉ has also been implicated in LPS signaling (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). We next examined the effect of dominant negative mutants of IKKÉ and TBK1 on TRAM signaling. We used the RANTES reporter gene construct to address this issue. Cells were cotransfected with TRAM, which activates downstream molecules as a result of overexpression, and the kinase inactive mutants of IKKÉ (IKKÉ-k38a) or TBK1 (TBK1-k38a). Both mutants inhibited TRAM-induced RANTES reporter activation in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that these two kinases may also function downstream of TRAM. Together these observations provide strong evidence that TRAM and TRIF are important components of the IRF3 signaling pathway and suggest that these adaptor proteins form a multiprotein complex with IRF-3/7, CBP, and the IRF-3/7 kinases (IKKÉ and TBK1) during signal transduction.</p>

        <title>TRAM Activates the IRF Pathway in the TLR4 but Not the TLR3 Signaling Pathway.</title>
        <p>We next generated a series of TRAM mutants and examined their ability to activate the <italic>RANTES</italic> reporter gene. Transfection of HEK293 cells with a plasmid encoding the TIR domain alone of TRAM (TRAM-TIR) induced the RANTES reporter, although this response was considerably less than that observed with the full-length TRAM cDNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> a). TRAM contains a cysteine residue (C113) in the BB loop with an adjacent proline residue (P112). Mutation of the proline residue to histidine (TRAM-P112H) significantly impaired the RANTES-inducing activity of TRAM, whereas mutation of the cysteine residue at position 113 (TRAM-C113H) completely abrogated all activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> a). This suggested that either TRAM-C113H or TRAM-P112H might function as a dominant interfering mutant of TRAM activity.

        <p>We subsequently examined the effect of these TRAM mutants on TLR-mediated signaling that culminates in RANTES promoter activation or the activation of the transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7. We focused on TLR3 and TLR4 because of their unique abilities to activate both NF-ÎºB and IRF-3. Neither the TRAM-TIR domain nor the TRAM-P112H mutants had any dominant negative inhibitory activity on either TLR-dependent IRF-3 pathway tested (unpublished data). Transfection of HEK-TLR3 cells with TRAM-C113H had no inhibitory effect on dsRNA-induced RANTES response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> b). In contrast, LPS-induced activation of the <italic>RANTES</italic> reporter via TLR4 was impaired by the TRAM-C113H mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> b, left). The LPS-dependent induction of the RANTES reporter gene was considerably less potent than that observed after TLR3 stimulation. The TRAM-C113H mutant also inhibited the TLR4- but not the TLR3-dependent activation of IRF-3 and IRF-7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> c). The TRAM-C113H mutant also inhibited the TLR4- but not the TLR3-dependent activation of an IP-10 reporter construct (unpublished data). We also examined the role of TRIF in the TLR3- and TLR4-dependent pathways in parallel by expressing a dominant negative mutant of TRIF lacking both the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal and COOH-terminal regions surrounding the TIR domain (TRIFÎNÎC) [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). As expected, this mutant completely suppressed the TLR3-dependent response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> b). The TRIFÎNÎC mutant also inhibited the TLR4 response, although the effect was less potent than that observed in the TLR3 pathway under identical experimental conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> d, right). Together, these observations suggest that TRIF regulates the TLR3 and TLR4 pathways to IRF target genes, whereas TRAM appears to be TLR4 specific.</p>

The isolated TIR domain of TRAM also induced a robust NF-ÎºB response, though this was considerably less than that observed with the full-length gene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> a).

        <p>Subsequently, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments on cells that heterologously expressed both of these gene products and the related adaptor molecule Mal/TIRAP. These immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that TRAM interacted with both TRIF and Mal/TIRAP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b, left). TRIF also interacted with Mal (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b, right). Finally, both TRIF and TRAM interacted with the Mal-P125H (dominant negative) mutant. The stronger interaction of TRIF and TRAM observed with the Mal-P125H mutant does not reflect a higher avidity for this interaction but rather was a consequence of the higher expression level of the MAL-P125H mutant in whole cell lysates, compared with the expression level of Mal or TRIF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b, middle). These data may explain a previously unexplained finding, i.e., that the Mal/TIRAP dominant negative mutant powerfully inhibited LPS-induced signaling to NF-ÎºB (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and IFN-Î² expression (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), whereas the Mal/TIRAP knockout mouse both retained the ability to induce NF-ÎºB (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and IFN-Î² expression (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It is likely that the more profound effect of the dominant negative construct is due to its ability to limit the function of other adaptor molecules involved in LPS signaling such as TRAM and TRIF. Furthermore, these data suggest that TRIF and TRAM interact with Mal at a site distinct from the TLR4 interaction site of Mal (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>

Stable TLR3- or TLR4-expressing cell lines were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged expression vectors for TRAM, TRAM-C113H, and Mal, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. These experiments indicated that TRAM interacts with TLR4 but not with TLR3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> c), one more indication of the specificity of TRAM for the TLR4 pathway. The dominant negative mutant TRAM-C113H failed to immunoprecipitate with TLR4, suggesting that the C113 residue is critical for this interaction. Mal also interacted with TLR4 and not TLR3, providing additional evidence that Mal has a role in the TLR4 but not the TLR3 signaling pathway.</p>

        <title>TRIF and TRAM Are Essential for TLR4 Signaling.</title>
        <p>The data obtained by testing dominant negative constructs and assessing proteinâprotein interactions suggest that TRIF and TRAM both function in the TLR4 signal transduction pathway. Dominant negative constructs, when highly expressed, have the potential to bind (as seen in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b) and interfere with proteins that might otherwise not be related to a specific signal transduction pathway. Therefore, we performed siRNA-silencing experiments as an additional methodology to delineate the relationship between TRIF and TRAM in the TLR4 and TLR3 signaling pathways.</p>
        <p>To assess the gene-silencing activity of siRNA duplexes we selected, cells were transiently transfected with a fluorescent chimeric construct of TRAM (TRAMâCFP) and cotransfected with siRNA duplexes targeting the coding region of TRAM or a control siRNA, lamin A/C. These siRNA duplexes can therefore be used to assess the silencing effect of a fluorescent chimeric construct of TRAM. This methodology has been used extensively to assess siRNA efficiency and provides a quantitative assessment of silencing efficiency (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). We found that siRNA duplexes targeting the TRAM coding region completely ablated the expression of the TRAMâCFP chimeric fusion protein, whereas lamin A/C siRNA duplexes were without effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> a). We also examined the effect of these TRAM siRNA duplexes on TRIF and Mal expression in order to ensure the specificity of the TRAM siRNA duplexes. This is particularly important as TRIF and TRAM are most closely related in sequence. TRAM siRNA duplexes had no effect on chimeric constructs of TRIF or Mal expressed as CFP fusion proteins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> a).</p>

            <p>TRAM and TRIF are required for RANTES activation by LPS. (a) 293T cells plated in 24-well plates were transfected with 1 Î¼g of plasmids encoding TRAM-CFP, TRIF-CFP, or Mal-CFP and cotransfected with 50 nM siRNA-TRAM or lamin A/C as indicated. 24 h later, CFP fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry using a 405 nm laser for excitation of CFP. The siRNA-TRAM nearly completely abolished expression of the subpopulation of cells that express CFP. (b) U373âCD14 or TLR3-expressing HEK293 cells were transfected with a <italic>RANTES</italic> reporter gene and cotransfected with siRNA duplexes as indicated for 36 h. Cells were then stimulated for 8 h with LPS or dsRNA, and luciferase reporter gene activity was measured.</p>

        <p>Having determined that the siRNA duplexes chosen for TRAM effectively and specifically suppressed TRAM expression, we examined the effect of these siRNA duplexes on the LPS and dsRNA signaling pathways. Native macrophages and macrophage cells lines are extraordinarily difficult to transfect with siRNA. In contrast, U373âCD14 cells resemble CNS macrophages, are easily transfectable, and are highly inducible by treatment with LPS. Thus, we tested the effect of TRAM siRNA duplexes on the LPS response in U373âCD14 cells. In comparison, we used HEK-TLR3 cells to test the effects of TRAM and TRIF in pIC-stimulated RANTES expression. The response of each of these cell lines to these TLR ligands is comparable.</p>
        <p>TRAM siRNA duplexes inhibited the LPS-dependent induction of the RANTES reporter gene in U373âCD14 cells, whereas siRNA targeting of lamin A/C had no effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> b, top). We also examined the effect of published TRIF siRNA duplexes, which target the 3â² untranslated region of TRIF on this response. These TRIF siRNA duplexes have been shown to completely silence endogenous TRIF mRNA expression (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). TRIF siRNA duplexes also inhibited the LPS response to RANTES induction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> b, top). In striking contrast to LPS, when the TLR3-mediated response to dsRNA was analyzed, the TRAM siRNA duplexes had no inhibitory effect on the dsRNA response, whereas TRIF siRNA duplexes inhibited dsRNA-dependent RANTES induction, in agreement with published reports (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). As with RANTES, siRNA silencing of TRAM prevented LPS but not poly IC induction of the IP-10 promoter (unpublished data). These observations confirm the studies with TRIF and TRAM dominant negative mutants and demonstrate that both adaptor molecules are required for full LPS-TLR4 signaling to IRF target genes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The ability of individual TLRs to discriminate between invading pathogens is an important determinant of the unique gene expression profiles activated by different microorganisms. Whereas the specificity of microbe detection begins with the ligand recognition features of one or more TLR, the discovery of a family of TIR domainâcontaining adaptor molecules, including MyD88 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), Mal (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), TRIF (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and TRAM, suggest that the outcome of induced pathogen recognition also depends on the TLR-restricted utilization of these molecules, alone and in combination, to drive a stimulus-specific response. The TLR3- and TLR4-restricted utilization of IRF-inducing adaptor molecules such as TRAM and TRIF induces not only the cytokines, costimulatory molecules, and antimicrobial peptides that are induced by all TLRs but also antiâviral type I interferons and specific chemokines including IP-10 and RANTES.</p>
      <p>The dominant negative, siRNA, and proteinâprotein interaction data presented here demonstrate that TRAM is specifically required for LPS signaling, whereas TRIF is required for signaling by both TLR3 and TLR4. Both MyD88 and Mal/TIRAP also have a role in more than one TLR. Thus, the activity of TRAM, unlike any of the other known adaptor molecules, may be restricted to a single TLR.</p>
      <p>Defining the constituents of the TLR4 pathway activated by LPS has proven to be a complicated process. First, it was believed that MyD88 was the only adaptor molecule needed for the full extent of the LPS response (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, data rapidly emerged that showed that at least part of the LPS response also involves Mal/TIRAP (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Thus, both MyD88 and Mal/TIRAP are involved in LPS signal transduction but cannot account for all, or even most, of the observed signaling traffic. The existence of TRAM and the potential cooperativity of TRAM and TRIF in the TLR4 pathway may explain how double MyD88âMal-null cells are still capable of responding to endotoxin. It is intriguing that the TLR4 pathway requires TRIF, TRAM, MyD88, and Mal/TIRAP, whereas TLR3 signaling appears to require only TRIF and MyD88. The gene expression profiles activated after dsRNA and LPS stimulation of cells, though similar, are not identical (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). The utilization of TRAM by TLR4 and not TLR3 may allow LPS-TLR4 to induce signaling pathways and gene expression programs not possible by TLR3âTRIF-mediated signaling. Thus, the combinatorial utilization of TRIF and TRAM by TLR4 may allow a specific tailoring of the immune response to the pathogens that activate TLR4.</p>
      <p>Both functional and direct biochemical studies indicate that the adaptor molecules used for the LPS response are interacting with one another and with TLR4. One obvious question that needs to be addressed is how these types of observations, which were made in a few types of transfected cell lines and primary BM-derived macrophages, apply to the myriad of cell types that respond to LPS. The response to LPS is not uniform, an observation that is generally attributed to the cell surface density of the LPS receptor components. However, simple receptor density clearly does not always explain these differences and many different mechanisms are undoubtedly at work. Based on scanning electron micrographs of LPS-exposed cells, it is likely that activated TLR4 forms a large âsignalosomeâ involving multiple molecules of TLR4 (unpublished data). The cytoplasmic face of the activated LPS receptor is likely to have a large surface upon which these adaptor molecules may sit. We propose that cell-specific differences in the response to LPS may also involve differences in the number and the composition of adaptor molecules that assemble on TLR4. Cocrystalization of the cytoplasmic face of TLRs in complexes with the various adaptor molecules or combinations of adaptor molecules is going to be necessary to fully understand the physical basis of how an activated Toll receptor actually collaborates with these molecules to propagate an intracellular signal. We predict that TRAM will be a portion of a large platform of adaptor molecules bound to TLR4 upon which a variety of kinases and other molecules can effectively function to initiate LPS responses.</p>
      <p>While this manuscript was in preparation, Shu and colleagues reported on the identification of TRAM, to which they gave the name TIRP, as an adaptor molecule that interacts with the IL-1R, Mal, IRAK, and TRAF-6 (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). These authors reported that TRAM/TIRP functions exclusively in IL-1 signaling (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). In agreement with Shu and colleagues, we have also detected TRAM in association with Mal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> b), TRAF-6 and the IL1RAcP (unpublished data). Furthermore, we detected no inhibition of the IL1-induced NFÎºB response when cells were transfected with the TRAMâC113H mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Since submission of this paper, two articles have reported on the role of TRIF in LPS signaling (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). One of these articles (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), postulates that there may be another TLR4 adaptor molecule, which is designated âX.â TRAM may represent a potential candidate for such a molecule, although the precise mechanism whereby the four known LPS adapters interact and contribute to MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent signaling remains to be determined.</p>
