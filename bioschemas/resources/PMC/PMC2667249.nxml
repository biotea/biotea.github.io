          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Bacteria engage cell surface receptors and intracellular signaling molecules to enter the cell. Unc119 is an adaptor protein, which interacts with receptors and tyrosine kinases. Its role in bacterial invasion of cells is unknown.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We used biochemical, molecular and cell biology approaches to identify the binding partners of Unc119, and to study the effect of Unc119 on Abl family kinases and <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. We employed loss-of-function and gain-in-function approaches to study the effect of Unc119 in a mouse model of pulmonary shigellosis. Unc119 interacts with Abl family kinases and inhibits their kinase activity. As a consequence, it inhibits Crk phosphorylation, which is essential for <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Unc119 co-localizes with Crk and <italic>Shigella</italic> in infected cells. <italic>Shigella</italic> infectivity increases in Unc119-deficient epithelial and macrophage cells. In a mouse model of shigellosis cell-permeable TAT-Unc119 inhibits <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Conversely, Unc119 knockdown in vivo results in enhanced bacterial invasion and increased lethality. Unc119 is an inducible protein. Its expression is upregulated by probacteria and bacterial products such as lipopolysacharide and sodium butyrate. The latter inhibits <italic>Shigella</italic> infection in mouse lungs but is ineffective in Unc119 deficiency.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Unc119 inhibits signaling pathways that are used by <italic>Shigella</italic> to enter the cell. As a consequence it provides partial but significant protection from <italic>Shigella</italic> infections. Unc119 induction in vivo boosts host defense against infections.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During the bacterial infection various proteins from the pathogen and the host participate in bacterial entry and cellular response <xref rid="pone.0005211-TranVanNhieu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Pathogens like <italic>Shigella</italic> induce their own uptake into mammalian cells <xref rid="pone.0005211-Nhieu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. <italic>Shigella</italic> delivers multiple virulence proteins into host cells through the type III secretion system (TSS) <xref rid="pone.0005211-Ogawa1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-Phalipon1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. One of these effector proteins is IpaB, which interacts with the mammalian cell surface receptor CD44 <xref rid="pone.0005211-Skoudy1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-Lafont1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Another efefctor, IpaA interacts with the integrin Î±5Î²1 <xref rid="pone.0005211-Watarai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The interaction of <italic>Shigella</italic> effectors with these host receptors is likely to facilitate the initial contact of the bacterium to the cell membrane, especially in the region of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. At this stage the TSS proteins interact with cellular proteins to reorganize the cytoskeletal structures that results in their engulfment <xref rid="pone.0005211-Rmer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0005211-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. One of the crucial intracellular processes that play an essential role in bacterial uptake is actin polymerization <xref rid="pone.0005211-BourdetSicard1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Actin polymerization leads to membrane ruffling, which promotes bacterial internalization. Once internalized, <italic>Shigella</italic> utilizes actin tail to move about the cell. <italic>Shigella</italic> induces actin polymerization through multiple ways. <italic>Shigella</italic>-derived IcsA mimics activated-Cdc42 and directly activates N-WASP, which promotes actin polymerization <xref rid="pone.0005211-Egile1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Another effector IpgB1 mimics the host Rho G and activates Rac1 through the DOCK180-ELMO pathway <xref rid="pone.0005211-Handa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Rac1 activates WAVE1 and WASP to induce actin polymerization <xref rid="pone.0005211-Eden1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The CD44-associated Src family kinases also promote actin focus formation <xref rid="pone.0005211-Dehio1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-Dumnil1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The Abl family kinasesâAbl and Arg also become activated during the <italic>Shigella</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0005211-Burton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Both these kinases have an actin binding domain. Abl kinase phosphorylates N-WASP <xref rid="pone.0005211-Burton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, which is an essential activator of Arp2/3. The latter directly induces actin polymerization. Both kinases phosphorylate the cytoskeletal regulator Crk <xref rid="pone.0005211-Bougnres1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Crk cooperates with cortactin to facilitate actin reorganization. Arg possesses actin-microtubule cross-linking activity and plays an important role in lamellopodia formation <xref rid="pone.0005211-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Unc119 is an adaptor molecule that has SH2- and SH3-binding motifs in addition to other protein-protein interaction motifs. Unc119 binds and activates Lyn and Hck kinases through its SH2- and SH3-binding motifs <xref rid="pone.0005211-Cen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Unc119 plays a significant role in T cell signaling by activating Lck and Fyn <xref rid="pone.0005211-Gorska1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Unc119 activates Fyn in fibroblasts and facilitates their differentiation into myofibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0005211-Vepachedu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As mentioned previously, Src promotes <italic>Shigella</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0005211-Dehio1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For this reason we asked if Unc119 played a role in <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. To our surprise Unc119 inhibited <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. It did so by inhibiting Abl family kinases and their substrate Crk. On the basis of these findings we believe Unc119 represents a novel inhibitory mechanism in <italic>Shigella</italic> infection.</p>

        <p>Unc119 activates Src family kinases (SFKs) <xref rid="pone.0005211-Cen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0005211-Vepachedu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The latter facilitate bacterial internalization <xref rid="pone.0005211-Dehio1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-Dumnil1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We assumed that Unc119 would promote bacterial infection because of its role in SFK activation. To study the effect of Unc119 on bacterial infection, we knocked down Unc119 expression by 70â90% in human epithelial cells (Caco2 and HeLA) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH 3T3, abbreviated as 3T3) using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and then infected them with <italic>Shigella</italic> flexneri. In all these cell lines the knockdown of Unc119 doubled the bacterial uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) as measured by a colony forming assay. A flow cytometric assay demonstrated a three-fold increase in <italic>Shigella</italic> uptake in Unc119 knocked-down THP-1 cells, a monocytic cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g001">Figure 1C &amp; D</xref>). The effect of Unc119 on <italic>Shigella</italic> infectivity was unaltered by aroA<sup>â</sup> virG<sup>â</sup> mutations that result in loss of intracellular movement of <italic>Shigella</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0005211-Noriega1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005211.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The results suggest that Unc119 inhibition of infection is independent of the intracellular motility of <italic>Shigella</italic>. In order to determine whether Unc119 inhibits other bacterial infections, we studied Mycobacterium bovis BCG infection of THP-1 cells. Unc119 knockdown resulted in a two-fold increase in BCG uptake in THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005211.s001">Figure S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The results suggest that the action of Unc119 is not specific for <italic>Shigella</italic>.</p>

            <p>(A) Unc119 knockdown by siRNA. The expression of Unc119 in siUnc119- and control siRNA (siCon)-transfected cells was checked after 48 h by western blotting (Nâ=â3). Equal loading was measured by reprobing the membrane for tubulin (lower panel). (B) Unc119 knockdown increases bacterial infection. 3T3, Caco2 and HeLa cells were transfected with siControl and siUnc119 RNA and then infected with <italic>Shigella</italic> flexneri. Following washes and gentamicin treatment the cells were lysed and plated for colony forming assay. The infectivity was expressed as the number of colony forming units per 10 cells. The results represent meanÂ±SD of six independent experiments performed in triplicates. (*Pâ=â0.012, **Pâ=â0.014, ***Pâ=â0.04). (C) Unc119 inhibition of <italic>Shigella</italic> infection in the THP-1 monocytic cell line. Preactivated THP-1 cells transfected with siRNA and then infected <italic>Shigella</italic> as described above. Fixed cells were stained with a rabbit anti-<italic>Shigella</italic> antibody and an Alexa 488 labeled secondary antibody. A representative flowgram is shown. (D) Unc119 inhibition of <italic>Shigella</italic> and BCG uptake by THP-1 cells. FITC-labeled Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) were used to study the effect of Unc119 knockdown (siUNc119 and SiControl) on bacterial uptake by THP-1 cells as measured by flow cytometry (see above and also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005211.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Individual flow cytometry data for <italic>Shigella</italic> and BCG (Nâ=â3 each) were analyzed statistically. *p&lt;0.02.</p>

</title>
        <p>In a next set of experiments HeLa cells were infected with DsRed expressing <italic>Shigella</italic> to study the localization of Unc119. Immunofluorescent staining showed a diffuse cytosolic distribution of Unc119 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Unc119 was associated with vesicular structures in the cytosol and some of these vesicles were co-localized with the intracellular <italic>Shigella</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005211.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Next we examined the association of Unc119 with the internalized bacteria in live cells. Epifluorescence microscopy showed a time dependent association of Unc119-GFP with DsRed-expressing <italic>Shigella</italic>. Unc119-GFP remained associated with <italic>Shigella</italic> for up to 15 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The co-localization of Unc119-GFP with <italic>Shigella</italic> was highest at 30 minutes after the start of infection with 40% of the total internalized bacteria associated with Unc119-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The Unc119-<italic>Shigella</italic> association decreased to 10% by 60 minutes. We examined direct interaction of Unc119 with <italic>Shigella</italic>. Pull-down experiments with the <italic>Shigella</italic> lysate showed an interaction with 3 <italic>Shigella</italic>-derived proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005211.s008">Table S1</xref>), which may not be relevant as these proteins are not known to be secreted or expressed on the cell surface. At this time we do not know if Unc119 interacts with the type III secreted proteins of <italic>Shigella</italic>.</p>

Next, we explored the interaction of Unc119 with CD44 and Î±5Î²1. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that Unc119 precipitated with CD44 but not with Î±5 integrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005211.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). The engagement of CD44 results in activation of Src <xref rid="pone.0005211-Bourguignon1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, which influences infection <xref rid="pone.0005211-Dumnil2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Unc119 activates Lck, Hck and Fyn but not Src <xref rid="pone.0005211-Cen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We explored the activation of Fyn, a ubiquitously expressed SFK <xref rid="pone.0005211-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-Cen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, during the bacterial infection in 3T3 cells overexpressing Unc119. Fyn was not significantly activated during infection in normal cells but was strongly activated in Unc119 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005211.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). To explore if the Unc119 mediated regulation of bacterial infection is dependent upon SFKs, we used the SFK deficient SYF fibroblast cell line, which lacks Src, Yes and Fyn kinases. In the absence of all SFKs, Unc119 knockdown still doubled the bacterial infection in the SYF cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005211.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). This suggests that Unc119 inhibition of <italic>Shigella</italic> infection is not mediated by SFKs.</p>

        <title>Unc119 interacts with Abl/Arg tyrosine kinases and their substrate Crk</title>
        <p>To identify proteins that interact with Unc119 and thus affect bacterial infection, we screened for Unc119 interactive SH3 domain-containing proteins using a TranSignal SH3 domain array. The array contained 38 SH3 domains of different cellular proteins. Unc119 interacted with the SH3 domain of a number of proteins. The order of binding to the top 4 SH3 proteins on the array was Abl&gt;Crk&gt;PSD95&gt;spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Crk is a substrate for Abl and Arg kinases <xref rid="pone.0005211-Kain1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

To confirm the results of the array screen we immunoprecipitated Crk, Abl and Arg proteins from 3T3 cell lysates and checked for co-precipitation of Unc119. All three immunoprecipitates showed the presence of Unc119 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g003">Figure 3B</xref> upper panel). Conversely, the immunoprecipitate of Unc119 showed the presence of Abl and Crk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lower panel). Next we examined the association of Crk, Abl and Unc119 by immunostaining. We expressed Unc119 as a fusion protein of GFP and stained for Crk and Abl. Overexpression of Unc119-GFP resulted in altered cytoskeleton organization in the cell and reduced membrane ruffle formation (see below). In some cells where membrane ruffles were detectable, Unc119-GFP but not GFP localized to membrane ruffles and co-localized with Abl and Crk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly Arg kinase showed co-localization with Unc119 at the membrane ruffles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005211.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The co-precipitation and co-localization studies indicate that Unc119 forms complexes with Abl, Arg and Crk at membrane folds. This localization of Unc119 is important because membrane ruffles are active sites for bacterial engulfment <xref rid="pone.0005211-Nhieu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>

Recombinant Unc119 was labeled with biotin and used to probe a protein array containing 38 SH3 domains from different proteins that were spotted undiluted and at 1â¶5 dilution. Unc119 binding was detected by treating the membrane with streptavidin-linked HRP and its substrate (Nâ=â2).

        <title>Unc119 regulates infection by inhibiting Abl/Arg kinase activity</title>
        <p>As mentioned previously, Unc119 activates the Src family of tyrosine kinase. Since Abl and Arg kinases belong to a closely related tyrosine kinase family, we asked if Unc119 affected the kinase activity of Abl and Arg. We examined the effect of recombinant Unc119 on the enzymatic activity of Abl family kinases in an in vitro kinase assay using GST-Crk as a substrate. Unc119 inhibited the phosphorylation of GST-Crk in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, left panels). The inhibitory effect was stronger on Arg than Abl kinase. Since Unc119 directly interacts with Crk through its SH3 domain, it is possible Unc119 sequesters Crk and thereby prevents its phosphorylation without affecting Abl kinase activity. To address this concern we used a different substrate that lacks the Crk SH3 domain. We used GST-Abltide, which is a fusion peptide containing the Abl phosphorylation motif (EAIYAAPFAKKK) with an N-terminal GST-tag. The inhibition of phosphorylation of GST-Abltide by Unc119 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, right panels) was actually stronger than that of GST-Crk. The results suggest that the inhibitory effect of Unc119 on Abl kinases is direct. To demonstrate the region of Unc119 that interacts with the kinases and inhibits the enzymatic activity we used peptide sequences of the SH2-binding motif (TCEHIYDFPPLS) and SH3-binding motif (QGKQPIGPED) from Unc119 in the kinase assay. The presence of the SH2 binding motif had no effect on the kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, lower panels). On the other hand, the SH3-binding motif of Unc119 caused inhibition of GST-Crk phosphorylation indicating that an SH3-mediated interaction is responsible for inhibition of the enzymatic activity.</p>

            <p>(A) Unc119 inhibits Abl and Arg kinase activity. Abl and Arg kinases were immunoprecipitated from the 3T3 cells and their kinase activity was measured by incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P-Î³-ATP into two different substrates- GST-Crk (left top two panels) and GST-Abltide (right top two panels) in presence of increasing concentrations of recombinant Unc119 (Top and middle panels) or Unc119-derived SH2 and SH3 motif peptides (bottom panels. The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and exposed to storage phosphor screen. The phosphorylation was captured using the Typhoon Variable Mode Imager. The membranes were reprobed for the kinases to show equal loading (lower panels, Nâ=â3).

Overexpression of Unc119 as a GFP fusion protein showed reduced actin polymerization and reduced formation of dendrite-like cellular projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

        <p>Next, we examined the effect of overexpression of Unc119 on bacterial uptake. Unc119 overexpression by a bicistronic GFP-RV-Unc119 retrovirus reduced bacterial uptake by 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Overexpression of proteins can be toxic to many cell types. To ensure that the reduced bacterial uptake was not due to the loss of cell viability, we measured LDH release from Unc119 overexpressing cells, which was similar to that from control vector-transfected cells (data not shown). Next, we studied the activation of Abl kinases and Crk phosphorylation during bacterial infection in cells overexpressing Unc119. Abl and Arg kinases were immunoprecipitated and the kinase assay was performed using GST-Crk as a substrate. In Unc119 overexpressing cells the Abl and to a lower extent, the Arg kinase activity was low compared to the cells expressing the vector alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g005">Figure 5B &amp; D</xref>). This data suggest that in the presence of Unc119 Abl and Arg kinases are not fully activated by bacterial infection. The decreased Abl family kinase activation should result in decreased phosphorylation of their physiological substrates Crk and CrkL <xref rid="pone.0005211-Schwarze1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

        <title>Unc119 deficiency augments pulmonary shigellosis</title>
        <p>We wanted to examine the effect of Unc119 knockdown on <italic>Shigella</italic> infection in vivo. To this goal we generated an shRNA construct for Unc119 in a Banshee vector that knocked down Unc119 expression by 70% in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005211.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). Intranasal treatment of mice with the shUnc119 construct induced a 71% reduction in Unc119 expression in infected mouse lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>, upper panel). This reduction in Unc119 expression was associated with a statistically significant (*Pâ=â0.039) increase in <italic>Shigella</italic> infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, lower panel). <italic>Shigella</italic> count in the lungs was increased by 51% in shUnc119-treated mice as compared to control vector-treated mice. In Unc119 knockdown mice <italic>Shigella</italic> infection is more lethal and caused increased animal death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Various cytokines influence <italic>Shigella</italic> infection in mouse. IL8 and IFN-Î³ are known to play a role in <italic>Shigella</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0005211-Way1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-VanEtten1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The murine chemokine KC is a homologue of human IL8. We checked level of KC and IFN-Î³ in control and shUnc119 knock down lungs during the infection. Unc119 knockdown almost doubled the KC levels in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). On the other hand IFN-Î³ levels went down in shUnc119-treated lungs.</p>
        <p>Sodium butyrate has previously been shown to reduce <italic>Shigella</italic> infectivity in rabbits <xref rid="pone.0005211-Philpott1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. To examine whether Unc119 upregulation is one of the mechanisms by which sodium butyrate decreases the bacterial infection we treated Unc119 knockdown mice with butyrate and studied <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Treatment with butyrate decreased <italic>Shigella</italic> infection in the mouse lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g007">Figure 7F</xref>, left panel). However, in the absence of Unc119 butyrate was ineffective in decreasing the bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g007">Figure 7F</xref>, right panel) indicating that Unc119 plays an essential role in mediating the protective effect of butyrate.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>
<italic>Shigella</italic> and other pathogens engage many cellular proteins such as Src and Abl family kinases, Crk and cortactin to facilitate their entry into the cell <xref rid="pone.0005211-Skoudy1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-BourdetSicard1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It is unknown whether this process leads to the engagement of cellular inhibitory mechanisms to counter the pathogen entry. In this study we demonstrate that Unc119 functions to regulate <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. The inhibitory effect of Unc119 on <italic>Shigella</italic> infection is similar regardless of the cell line used suggesting that it represents a general inhibitory mechanism. Unc119 also blocks the uptake of BCG by the THP1 cells suggesting that the effect is not specific for <italic>Shigella</italic>.</p>
      <p>Through an SH3 domain array screen we identify Abl family kinases and their target Crk as novel binding partners and effectors of Unc119. The interaction of Unc119 with Abl family kinases and Crk is important for a number of reasons. Both Abl and Arg kinases regulate actin cytoskeleton <xref rid="pone.0005211-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Arg kinase interacts with both actin and tubulin and promotes their cross-linking <xref rid="pone.0005211-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We show that Unc119 co-localizes with both Abl and Arg kinases and their substrate Crk. Unc119 also co-localizes with <italic>Shigella</italic>. <italic>Shigella</italic> engages CD44 as one of the host molecules to enter mammalian cells <xref rid="pone.0005211-Skoudy1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-Lafont1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. We have shown that CD44 physically interacts with Unc119. We speculate that CD44 recruits Unc119 to the site of <italic>Shigella</italic> invasion.</p>
      <p>One of the most important findings of this work is the inhibition of Abl family kinases by Unc119. It directly inhibits Crk phosphorylation by Abl kinases. Crk phosphorylation by Abl/Arg kinases results in activation of Cdc42 that leads to actin rearrangement and internalization of bacteria <xref rid="pone.0005211-Burton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Cells deficient in Abl kinases or expressing non-phosphorylatable mutants of Crk are resistant to <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Recent studies have shown that Abl kinases play an important role in invasion of cells by Chlmydia trchomatis and Coxsackievirus <xref rid="pone.0005211-Elwell1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-Coyne1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. They are also essential in poxvirus dissemination <xref rid="pone.0005211-Reeves1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In both studies the inhibition of Abl family kinases by imatinib blocked the infection. We believe that the inhibition of Abl kinases by Unc119 directly contributes to its inhibitory effect on <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Unc119 knockdown had no effect on infection in Abl<sup>â/â</sup>Arg<sup>â/â</sup> cells. We examined the mechanism of inhibition of Abl/Arg kinases by Unc119. Our results suggest that the SH3 binding motif of Unc119 but not the SH2 binding motif is essential and sufficient for inhibition of Abl and Arg kinases. A number of proteins including F-actin, Abi1, Abi2, AAP1, PAG and RB1 and phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 biphosphate interact with Abl kinases and inhibit their kinase activity <xref rid="pone.0005211-Woodring3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0005211-Plattner1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Except for F-actin and the phospholipid the other proteins exert their inhibitory effect through the interaction with the SH3 domain. This is consistent with the finding that deletion or mutation of the SH3 binding motif of Unc119 restores activation of Abl kinases.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate that Unc119 plays a role in <italic>Shigella</italic> pathogenesis in vivo we performed a proof-of-concept experiment in a mouse model of shigellosis <xref rid="pone.0005211-Phalipon2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005211-Ingersoll1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Mouse colonic epithelium is resistant to <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. As an alternative investigators have developed a mouse model of pulmonary shigellosis. In this model transduction of Unc119 inhibits <italic>Shigella</italic> infection and neutrophilic inflammation. Conversely, Unc119 knockdown increases Shigellla infection and mortality. It should be emphasized that <italic>Shigella</italic> is specifically adapted to human colon. Thus, the results of our experiments with cell lines and pulmonary shigellosis must be interpreted with reservations until the relevance of Unc119 is confirmed in humans.</p>
      <p>In absence of Unc119, the level of IFN-Î³ decreases. IFN-Î³ has been shown to be essential for innate resistance to <italic>Shigella</italic> infection in mouse lungs and in its absence the mouse become more susceptible to infection and manifest increased mortality <xref rid="pone.0005211-Way1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Mouse KC is a functional homologue of human IL8. The level of KC increases with bacterial infection <xref rid="pone.0005211-Philpott1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, which is likely a defense mechanism and increases the recruitment of neutrophils. The increase in the level of KC in Unc119-deficient lungs could contribute to the worsening pathophysiology and increased mortality. The exact mechanism of the altered cytokine level in Unc119-deficient lungs is not known. Unc119 plays an important role in mediating intracellular signals for cytokine (e.g. TGF-Î², IL-5) receptors and T cell antigen receptors <xref rid="pone.0005211-Cen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0005211-Vepachedu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. During <italic>Shigella</italic> infection the activation of some of these receptors may be impaired in the absence of Unc119, which could result in altered cytokine production. It should be pointed out that the changes in the cytokine level could be secondarily due to the increased inflammation.</p>
      <p>Unc119 is an inducible protein and <italic>Shigella</italic> infection increases the expression of Unc119 in the mouse lungs, human lung and colonic epithelial cells. Lactobacillus, a normal gut flora, also upregulates Unc119. Intestinal infection with pathogenic bacteria frequently occurs when the normal gut flora is destroyed (e.g. after an antibiotic treatment). We speculate that the loss of Lactobacillus reduces Unc119 expression and thereby, increases susceptibility to pathogens. Butyrate is a fermentation product of the normal gut flora and provides protection against <italic>Shigella</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0005211-Raqib1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Butyrate was shown to induce the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in rabbit colonic epithelium <xref rid="pone.0005211-Raqib1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We show that butyrate upregulates Unc119. We speculate that the normal gut flora supports the expression of Unc119 in epithelial cells directly and also indirectly through the generation of butyrate. A transient loss of or reduction in Unc119 expression along with other innate host factors allows <italic>Shigella</italic> invasion of colonic epithelial cells. <italic>Shigella</italic> infection, although serious, is nonetheless a self-limited illness in most healthy subjects. During <italic>Shigella</italic> infection Unc119 is rapidly induced to counter the persistence of the bacterial invasion, which results in spontaneous recovery. Sodium butyrate has recently been promoted as a therapeutic agent for <italic>Shigella</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0005211-Raqib1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We show that this therapeutic benefit of butyrate is lost in the absence of Unc119. We propose the induction of Unc119 as a novel approach to boosting host defense and fighting infection.</p>
      <p>In summary, <italic>Shigella</italic> infection elicits two opposing signaling events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Through the activation of tyrosine kinases and Rho/Rac family of GTPases it induces actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization, which promotes its own uptake. <italic>Shigella</italic> also recruits Unc119 through CD44, which inhibits Abl/Arg tyrosine kinases and Crk phosphorylation. This leads to an inhibition of bacterial uptake. <italic>Shigella</italic> stimulates Unc119 synthesis, which further boosts this inhibitory pathway. We speculate that this Unc119-mediated inhibition represents a non-immunologic recovery mechanism in certain infections.</p>

        <p>Mouse Unc119 cDNA was cloned into the bicistronic retroviral vector GFP-RV as described previously <xref rid="pone.0005211-Gorska1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. For generation of Unc119 overexpressing fibroblasts, GFP-RV-Unc119 retrovirus was produced by transfecting the Phoenix Ampho packaging cell line using TransFectin (Bio-Rad laboratories, Hercules, CA) as per manufacturer's protocol. The supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and sterilized with 0.45-Âµm filters. Target cells were suspended in viral supernatants mixed 1â¶1 with the growth media (DMEM+10% FCS) and 8 Âµg/ml polybrene and then centrifuged in plates at 1200 g for 90 min at 32Â°C. The cells expressing Unc119 were selected at 48 hours by sorting for the GFP-expressing cells. For Unc119-GFP fusion protein the Unc119 cDNA was cloned into the pLEGFP vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The plasmid was transfected into 3T3 cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or the Amaxa Nucleofector kit (Amaxa, Inc. MD). Recombinant Unc119 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in the pGEX2T vector by inserting the Unc119 sequence in-frame at EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. For construction of the TAT fusion protein, the TAT sequence (MRKKRRQRRR) followed by Xba1 site was inserted into the pGEX2T-Unc119 vector by PCR mutagenesis to produce pGEX2T-TAT-Unc119.

For shRNA the Unc119 sequence was ligated into the Banshee vector as described previously <xref rid="pone.0005211-HernndezHoyos1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. One of the clones with sequence <named-content content-type="gene">GAGAGGCACUACUUUCGAAUU</named-content> in the loop was selected for its better performance and used for further studies. Immunoblotting confirmed Unc119 knock down in the cells.</p>

          <p>Unc119 knockdown increases the infectivity. A) Infectivity of S. flexneri CVD1203 ( aroA virG) mutant in 3T3 cells. The 3T3 cells were allowed to grow for 48 h followed by infection with Shigella flexneri mutant at a 1â¶100 ratio and incubated for 2 h. The cells were washed and the extracellular bacteria were killed with gentamicin. The cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 and serial dilutions were plated for colony formation. The bacterial colony forming units were counted and the infectivity was expressed as the number of colony forming units per 10 cells. The results represent meanÂ±SD of six independent experiments. *Pâ=â0.006. (B) Uptake of BCG. To evaluate uptake of Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) by THP-1 cells, bacteria were labeled by incubation with FITC (0.5 mg/ml) in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.0) at 37Â°C for 2 h. Thereafter, FITC-labeled bacteria were washed twice with PBS to remove unbound FITC. Bacteria were opsonized by suspending in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 50% serum and rocked for 30 min at 37Â°C. Bacteria were then pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 and clumps were disrupted by multiple passages through a 25-gauge needle. THP-1 cells were infected with BCG for 2 h then non-ingested bacteria were removed by extensive washing with PBS followed by trypsinization of the cells. The cells were fixed and bacterial uptake was estimated by flow cytometry (Nâ=â4). (C) Colocalization of Unc119-GFP and Shigella. NIH3T3 cells expressing Unc119-GFP were infected with Shigella 1â¶1000 multiplicity for 30 min. The Shigella and nucleus were stained with Hoechst 33258 stain (blue) and false colored as red to show colocalization.</p>

          <p>Unc119 interacts with CD44 and activates Fyn. (A) CD44 and alpha5 beta1 are required for Shigella infection. 3T3 cells were treated with anti-CD44 and anti-alpha5 blocking antibodies and their isotype controls for 2 h followed by Shigella infection for 2 h. The cells were processed and the infectivity was measured as described under <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005211-g001">Figure 1a</xref> (Nâ=â6, *P&lt;0.051). (B) Unc119 co-precipitates with CD44 but not with alpha5 beta1. CD44 (upper left panel) and alpha5 (upper right panel) proteins were immunoprecipitated from 3T3 lysates and co-precipitation of Unc119 was checked by western blotting. Rat IgG and mouse IgG3 were used as isotype controls for antibodies against CD44 and alpha5 respectively (Nâ=â3). The lower panel shows immunoprecipitation with Unc119 and western blotting for CD44. Rabbit (Rab) IgG was used as an isotype control. The immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) indicates equal protein loading. rUnc119 indicates the position of recombinant Unc119 in the gel. (C) Fyn activation increases during Shigella infection. Control and Unc119 overexpressing cells were serum starved for 24 h then infected with Shigella. Fyn kinase was immunoprecipitated from the infected cells and an auto-phosphorylation assay was performed. The immunoprecipitate was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane and autoradiographed (upper panel). The membrane was reprobed with an anti-Fyn antibody (lower panel) (Nâ=â3). (D) The effect of Unc119 on Shigella infection is unaltered in SYF cells. Embryonic fibroblasts deficient in Src, Yes and Fyn (SYF) were transfected with siControl and siUnc119 RNA. After 48 h the cells were infected with Shigella and the infectivity was measured (Nâ=â6, *Pâ=â0.042).</p>

          <p>Expression and purification of TAT-GFP, TAT-Unc119 and TAT-Unc119 mutant proteins. (A) The recombinant proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins and allowed to bind to glutathione agarose beads. The beads were washed and recombinant proteins were cleaved from GST by thrombin. The TAT-Unc119 and TAT-Unc119 mutant proteins were passed through a Sephadex G-50 column. The protein fractions were pooled and the purity of the proteins was checked by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie blue staining. (B) TAT-GFP uptake by 3T3 cells. 3T3 cells were incubated with TAT-GFP (0.1 microM) for 1 h and the uptake was measured by flow cytometry (green plot for cells treated with TAT-GFP). The inset shows the uptake of TAT-GFP observed under a microscope (Nâ=â2). (C) TAT-Unc119 uptake by 3T3 cells. Cells were incubated with recombinant TAT-Unc119 or Unc119 (both at 0.1 microM) for 1 h. The uptake of the recombinant protein was examined by western blotting. Equal protein loading was checked after reprobing the membrane with an anti-tubulin antibody (Nâ=â3). Note TAT-Unc119 migrates slightly slower than the native Unc119. (D) Cells were incubated in 1 microM TAT-Unc119 and its uptake was measured at the indicated time points by western blotting. Cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of TAT-Unc119 and the uptake was measure after 1 h. (E) 3T3 cells were pretreated with TAT-GFP, TAT-Unc119 or TAT-Unc119 mutant proteins for 1 h followed by a 2 h-infection with Shigella and then infectivity was measured. Results represent the meanÂ±SD of 3 independent experiments in triplicates (*P&lt;0.001).</p>

          <p>Direct binding of Unc119 to Shigella proteins. A sample of Shigella lysate was passed through an Unc119 affinity agarose column (prepared using the Amino-link kit from Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and a control agarose column. The unbound proteins were washed with PBS. The bound proteins were eluted with 8 ml 100 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). The eluate (8 ml) was dialyzed (5 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.0) and concentrated by lyophilization. The samples were resuspended in 0.5 ml and equal amounts of sample were resolved on a polyacrylamide gel. The eluate from Unc119 column but not the control column showed three protein bands upon staining with SYPRO Ruby, which were cut and analyzed by LC-MS. This analysis identified three proteins as presented in the Table-1. Existing literature suggests that these are Shigella intracellular proteins and are unlikely to be involved in a direct interaction with Unc119.</p>
