        <title>SUMMARY</title>
        <p id="P2">Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common cardiac valve disease that affects nearly 1 in 40 individuals<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. It can manifest as mitral regurgitation and is the leading indication for mitral valve surgery<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Despite a clear heritable component, the genetic etiology leading to non-syndromic MVP has remained elusive. Four affected individuals from a large multigenerational family segregating non-syndromic MVP underwent capture sequencing of the linked interval on chromosome 11. We report a missense mutation in the <italic>DCHS1</italic> gene, the human homologue of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell polarity gene <italic>dachsous (ds)</italic> that segregates with MVP in the family. Morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish homolog <italic>dachsous1b</italic> resulted in a cardiac atrioventricular canal defect that could be rescued by wild-type human <italic>DCHS1</italic>, but not by <italic>DCHS1</italic> mRNA with the familial mutation. Further genetic studies identified two additional families in which a second deleterious <italic>DCHS1</italic> mutation segregates with MVP. Both <italic>DCHS1</italic> mutations reduce protein stability as demonstrated in zebrafish, cultured cells, and, notably, in mitral valve interstitial cells (MVICs) obtained during mitral valve repair surgery of a proband. <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice had prolapse of thickened mitral leaflets, which could be traced back to developmental errors in valve morphogenesis. <italic>DCHS1</italic> deficiency in MVP patient MVICs as well as in <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mouse MVICs result in altered migration and cellular patterning, supporting these processes as etiological underpinnings for the disease. Understanding the role of <italic>DCHS1</italic> in mitral valve development and MVP pathogenesis holds potential for therapeutic insights for this very common disease.</p>

    <p id="P3">In a previous study, based on specific diagnostic criteria<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, <italic>MMVP2</italic> (Myxomatous Mitral Valve Prolapse-2) was mapped to a 4.3 cM region of chromosome <italic>11p15.4</italic> in a family of Western European descent segregating non-syndromic mitral valve prolapse as an autosomal dominant trait with age-dependent penetrance (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, C</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. We performed tiled capture and high-throughput sequence analysis of genomic DNA from four affected individuals (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), identifying 4891 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertion/deletion polymorphisms in the targeted region (see Methods). After selecting rare protein-coding variants shared among all affected pedigree members, we identified three heterozygous protein-altering variants: two missense SNVs in <italic>DCHS1</italic>, a member of the cadherin superfamily<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, resulting in p.P197L and p.R2513H (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), and a single missense SNV, in <italic>APBB1</italic>, the amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein-binding family B, member 1 gene resulting in p.R481H. Both <italic>DCHS1</italic> mutations, p.P197L and p.R2513H, were rare in the population (the former observed three times in 4300 European-American individuals from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project and the latter never observed), and both were predicted to be protein damaging by PolyPhen-2<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, LRT<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and MutationTaster<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. While the <italic>APBB1</italic> variant was also rare in population-based data, no cardiac phenotype was observed in <italic>apbb1</italic> morphant zebrafish, despite reduction of <italic>apbb1</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1A, B</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Apbb1</italic> is not expressed in murine cardiac valves (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and no cardiac defects have been reported in the <italic>Apbb1</italic> knockout mouse<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. This suggests that the <italic>APBB1</italic> variant is unlikely to be contributing to MVP in this family.</p>
    <p id="P4">The functional impact of the <italic>DCHS1</italic> variants was evaluated in the zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, as this model system lends itself to functional annotation of mutations implicated in human disease<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Zebrafish have two <italic>DCHS1</italic> homologues, <italic>dachsous1a</italic> and <italic>dachsous1b. Dachsous1b</italic> is located in a region of <italic>Danio rerio</italic> chromosome 10 that is syntenic to the <italic>DCHS1</italic> region of human chromosome 11. Knockdown of <italic>dachsous1a</italic> did not result in a cardiac phenotype despite reduction in mRNA levels (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1AâB</xref>); however, knockdown of <italic>dachsous1b (dchs1b)</italic> led to significant changes in cardiac morphology (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1A</xref>). Control zebrafish hearts undergo looping and develop an atrioventricular (AV) constriction by 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf), whereas <italic>dchs1b</italic> knockdown disrupts this process resulting in impaired formation of the atrioventricular constriction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2AâB</xref>). While control embryos have unidirectional blood flow between the atrium and ventricle at 72 hpf (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Video 4</xref>), <italic>dchs1b</italic> knockdown causes regurgitation of blood from the ventricle into the atrium (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Video 5</xref>). An AV canal defect was defined as failure of cardiac looping combined with any AV regurgitation at 72 hpf. Using a high morpholino dose (1.5 ng) to establish the phenotype, the prevalence of AV canal defects was 76% (n=170), whereas spontaneous cardiac defects were rarely observed in controls (0.5%, n=205) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of <italic>dchs1b</italic> confirmed predominant expression at the AV junction at 54 and 72hpf, corresponding to the temporal defects observed in the morphants (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3AâC</xref>). We evaluated gene expression patterns in the developing AV ring, and observed that <italic>bmp4</italic> expression is expanded into the ventricle at 48 hpf in <italic>dchs1b</italic> knockdown embryos while it is restricted to the AV ring in controls (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4AâB</xref>). Additionally, <italic>has2</italic> expression was not detectable at 48 hpf, and only faintly at 72 hpf in the <italic>dchs1b</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4IâL</xref>). To test mutation pathogenicity in this model, rescue experiments were performed using both wild-type human <italic>DCHS1</italic> and P197L/R2513H mutant mRNA, which were injected into <italic>dchs1b</italic> knockdown zebrafish with a lower dose of morpholino (0.75 ng) to minimize combined morpholino/mRNA toxicity. Human wild-type <italic>DCHS1</italic> mRNA rescued the AV canal defect observed upon <italic>dchs1b</italic> knockdown, whereas injection of an equimolar amount of mutant <italic>DCHS1</italic> mRNA failed to rescue (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Injection of the mutant <italic>DCHS1</italic> mRNA alone did not cause AV canal defects, supporting a loss of function mechanism for the <italic>DCHS1</italic> mutation.</p>
    <p id="P5">Having demonstrated segregation of a loss-of-function <italic>DCHS1</italic> mutation with MVP in our large pedigree, we sought to determine if genetic variation in <italic>DCHS1</italic> plays a role in MVP beyond the linked family. By evaluating a cohort of MVP patients, we identified 2 additional families in which MVP segregated with the novel <italic>DCHS1</italic> protein variant p.R2330C (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1DâG</xref>). The proband of family 2 underwent surgical mitral valve repair for severe MVP and mitral regurgitation at age 21. Valve tissue was resected to repair the posterior leaflet and examination of the tissue showed classic myxomatous degeneration<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). Mitral valve interstitial cells were isolated from a portion of the posterior leaflet resected during surgery, providing a unique resource for the functional studies described below. The probandâs sister, evaluated at age 27 and also heterozygous for the p.R2330C mutation, demonstrated classical MVP with thickened leaflets and moderate regurgitation. The father and maternal grandmother were unaffected and do not carry the mutation. The mother (age 49) and maternal grandfather (age 76) are both affected with mild MVP and both carry p.R2330C. In family 3, the proband (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) had moderate to severe heart failure due to severe mitral regurgitation with posterior leaflet prolapse requiring surgery at age 72. The probandâs sister, age 69, is unaffected and negative for the p.R2330C mutation. The son (age 52) and the daughter (age 53) are both affected with MVP and both carry p.R2330C. The second son (age 55) also carries p.R2330C, however his MVP status is indeterminate due to due to mild LV inferior wall hypokinesis that tethers the leaflets down into the LV cavity<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, masking leaflet prolapse motion toward the left atrium.</p>
    <p id="P6">To evaluate the functional consequence of the DCHS1 mutations, we quantified protein levels in cells transfected with either wild-type or variant (p.P197L/p.R2513H) <italic>DCHS1</italic> cDNA constructs. Expression of the <italic>DCHS1</italic> mutant protein was ~60% less than wild-type with no significant change in mRNA levels, suggesting that the <italic>DCHS1</italic> variants reduce protein stability (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3AâC</xref>). Cycloheximide treatment revealed that wild-type <italic>DCHS1</italic> protein in transfected cells had a half-life of 5.8 hours while the mutant <italic>DCHS1</italic> protein (p.P197L/p.R2513H) had a half-life of 1.6 hours (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). <italic>DCHS1</italic> constructs harboring either p.P197L or p.R2513H were evaluated showing that p.R2513H markedly reduced protein levels, implicating this variant as pathogenic in the family (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). A similar analysis of <italic>DCHS1</italic> protein half-life was conducted using p.R2330C MVICs from the proband of family 2. Consistent with the data obtained from the p.R2513H transfectants, these studies showed significant reduction in protein half-life compared to control MVICs (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 0.46 hours vs. 1.73 hours, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>). Together, our studies show that p.R2513H and p.R2330C result in <italic>DCHS1</italic> loss of function. In order to evaluate <italic>DCHS1</italic> loss of function in a mammalian model, we analyzed <italic>Dchs1</italic> deficient mice for phenotypic similarities to human MVP.</p>
    <p id="P7">Homozygous knockout of <italic>Dchs1</italic> in mice results in neonatal lethality and multi-organ impairment<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>; however, the relevant genetic model for human MVP is the heterozygous <italic>Dchs1</italic> mouse. <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice exhibit mitral valve prolapse with pronounced involvement of the posterior leaflet, which is elongated and shifts the leaflet coaptation anteriorly (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) as in the proband from Family 1 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Videos 1</xref>â<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>, <xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">6</xref>, <xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">7</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Micro-MRI analyses and 3D reconstructions of adult <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice reveal prominent posterior leaflet thickening with quantitative increases in valve volume (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 8</xref>). All other echocardiographic measurements were unchanged (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Histological and molecular characterization of <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice confirmed leaflet thickening and showed myxomatous degeneration with increased proteoglycan accumulation in both mitral leaflets (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These results clearly show that <italic>Dchs1</italic> heterozygosity results in mitral valve prolapse in mice.</p>
    <p id="P8">To determine if MVP has a developmental origin, we performed expression and functional analyses during embryonic and fetal timepoints. RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed expression of <italic>Dchs1</italic> in endocardial and mesenchymal cells of atrioventricular valve leaflets at all timepoints examined (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). While no morphological defects were observed in the <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice during early embryonic development (E11.5âE13.5), at later timepoints (E15.5âE17.5) <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice displayed changes in mitral-valve shape (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5AâC</xref>), which were more severe in <italic>Dchs1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> animals. Histology and three-dimensional reconstructions of anterior and posterior mitral leaflets at E17.5 of <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic>, and <italic>Dchs1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice showed comparable leaflet volumes. However, <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> and <italic>Dchs1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> animals exhibited statistically significant changes in valve length and width (<xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Video 9</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5AâC</xref>). In most leaflet regions measured, <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> animals displayed an intermediate phenotype, demonstrating a gene dosage effect. These shape changes implicate <italic>Dchs1</italic> as critical for proper anatomical patterning of the valve, consistent with previous reports of <italic>dachsous</italic> function in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>in vivo</italic> lineage-tracing studies were performed on <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice. Crossing the <italic>WT1-Cre/ROSA-eGFP</italic><sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> line onto both <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> backgrounds allowed visualization of patterning defects of epicardial-derived cells (EPDCs) during migration into the posterior leaflet. This EPDC population initially migrates into the posterior leaflet as a sheet of cells. However, in the <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice this sheet-like appearance is disrupted and an increase in EPDCs infiltrating diffusely throughout the valve tissue is observed (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9AâC</xref>, <xref rid="SD10" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 10</xref>), concomitant with altered cellular patterning and alignment (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9D, E</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies of MVICs from <italic>Dchs1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> and from the Family 2 MVP proband (p.R2330C) also show this increased migration phenotype (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10A, B</xref>). Taken together, the mouse and human studies support a developmental etiology for MVP, and invoke a model for MVP in which cell migration and patterning defects mediated by <italic>DCHS1</italic> contribute to disease pathogenesis.</p>
    <p id="P9">MVP is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases, affecting nearly 1 in 40 people world-wide<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Although its heritability and variable expression in large pedigrees has been known for decades, its genetic underpinnings have remained elusive<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. We report the discovery of two loss-of-function mutations in <italic>DCHS1</italic> that segregate with MVP in three families. Our mouse models exhibit classical MVP, a phenotype that was traced back to developmental errors during valve morphogenesis. These findings provide a model for understanding inherited non-syndromic MVP as a developmentally based disease that progresses over the lifespan of affected individuals, consistent with previous reports on the natural history of MVP<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. A robust estimate of the total contribution of rare <italic>DCHS1</italic> genetic variation to sporadic MVP has yet to be determined and will require sequencing of large cohorts of MVP patients. Nonetheless, discovery of this novel mechanistic pathway elucidated by intensively studying rare familial mutations will facilitate the identification of additional MVP genes and reveal pathogenic mechanisms that hold the potential for pre-surgical therapy for this very common cardiac disease.</p>

        <title>Study Participants</title>
        <p id="P10">Family 1 was originally recruited through the Echocardiography Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital as part of a phenotype-driven genetic study of MVP. MVP was diagnosed by specific criteria (&gt;2 mm atrial leaflet displacement in a parasternal long-axis view)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Partners Healthcare, Boston, MA, and all participants provided written informed consent. Complete details of the linkage analysis on this large, multigenerational family have been previously published<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. In brief, the family contains 41 individuals in five generations. Echocardiograms and DNA were obtained on 28 subjects, of whom 12 were diagnosed with MVP, three were classified as having nondiagnostic minimal leaflet displacement, and 13 were unaffected<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Three patients had non-diagnostic valve leaflet displacement and were considered unknown for the original linkage analysis. The proband had prominent MVP with thickened leaflets, severe MR, and heart failure ultimately requiring surgical valve repair (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Videos 1</xref>â<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>). Other affected members also showed diffuse leaflet thickening, prolapse, and MR of varying severity; one required surgical repair. No extracardiac manifestations of connective-tissue abnormalities or Marfan syndrome were present in any family members. Following a complete genome scan, parametric and non-parametric analyses confirmed linkage of this family to a 4.3 cM region of chromosome 11p15.4. Consistent with the model of sex- and age-dependent penetrance, several of the unaffected members who carried the MVP allele were less than 15 years old at the time of evaluation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Importantly, an analysis utilizing only affected individuals confirmed the linkage result.</p>

        <title>DNA Sequencing and Variant Calling in Family 1</title>
        <p id="P11">In order to identify the mutation, four affected individuals who shared the disease haplotype were chosen for sequencing (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To reduce the likelihood of random haplotype sharing, we selected individuals with four distinct haplotypes on the non-MVP allele. A 2.1 Mb region of human chromosome 11 (5094774â7248926; NCBI36 coordinates) was targeted and screened for repetitive regions using the SureSelect system (Agilent). DNA extraction was performed using the AutoGenFlex STAR automated system (Autogen) and FlexiGen DNA purification reagents (Qiagen) according to the manufacturersâ instructions. Bait oligonucleotides were designed to the non-repetitive regions of the targeted linkage peak, resulting in 1.03 Mb of target sequence using the SureSelect in-solution long RNA baits (Agilent). Captured DNA was amplified and quantified using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit for the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and sequenced using Illumina sequencing chemistry (paired-end, 100 cycles) at the Venter Institute supported by the NHLBI Resequencing and Genotyping Program. One hundred bases were sequenced from each end of the captured DNA fragments. Image analysis and base calling were performed using Illuminaâs GA Pipeline version 1.6.0. Sequence reads were mapped to the human genome (ncbi36) and variants identified using clc-ngs-cell-2.0.5-linux_64 (clc_ref_assemble_long -q -p fb ss 180 360 âI âr, and find_variations -c 8 -v -f 0.2). Variants were classified using VariantClassifier<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. 4891 SNVs were identified in the four subjects, 1951 were shared by all four subjects. We classified all rare SNVs or those of unknown frequency based on conservation data, population genetic data, and predictive functional impact from public resources.

Six patients were collected in Nantes, France, and had similar clinical characteristics with an average age at onset of 42. Exome capture was carried out using the SureSelect Human All Exon System using the manufacturerâs protocol version 1.0 that is compatible with Illumina paired-end sequencing. Exome-enriched genomes were multiplexed by flow cell for 101-bp paired-end read sequencing according to the protocol for the Hiseq 2000 sequencer (version 1.7.0; Illumina) to allow a minimum coverage of 30x. Reads were aligned to the human reference genome (UCSC NCBI36/hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.5.9). Evaluation of the <italic>DCHS1</italic> gene yielded 4 novel coding sequence variants that confirmed following repeat Sanger sequencing: 6646587 G/A (p.R2330C) 6646709 G/A (p.A2289V), 6648584 C/T (p.A1896T), 6648820 A/G (p.V1817A), base pair positions are NCBI36 coordinates. These four variants, in addition to the variants identified in Family 1, were genotyped using Sequenom technology in the sporadic cohort. The major steps included primer and multiplex assay design using Sequenomâs MassARRAYÂ® Designer software, DNA amplification by PCR, post-PCR nucleotide deactivation using shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) to remove phosphate groups from unincorporated dNTPs, single-base extension reaction for allele differentiation, salt removal using ion-exchange resin, and mass correlated genotype calling using SpectroCHIPÂ® array and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Quality control to determine sample and genotyping quality and to potentially remove poor SNPs and/or samples was performed in PLINK, a whole genome association analysis toolset.

The proband in family 2 carried the p.R2330C variant and underwent surgery for MVP in Paris. We were able to collect DNA and echocardiograms on first-degree relatives at that time. Additional clinical characteristics of the proband in family 2 included congestive heart failure (NYHA II/III) with left ventricular [LV] dilatation (70/50 mm end-diastolic/end-systolic dimensions), impaired LV systolic function (ejection fraction 53%, low for this volume overload), recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension (70 mmHg systolic).

Antibodies used for IHC were: Hyaluronan Binding Protein (HABP) to stain proteoglycans (1:100) (Callbiochem), collagen I (1:100) (MDbio), and Hoescht to stain nuclei (1:10000) (Invitrogen). AMIRA 3D reconstructions were performed to generate volumetric measurements of fetal (E17.5) anterior and posterior mitral leaflets (N=5 for each genotype) as previously described <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Length and width measurements of the mitral leaflets were obtained from histological sections. 25 consecutive 5 Î¼M sections from anterior and posterior mitral leaflets of each genotype were used for measurements (<italic>Dchs1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, N=4, <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic>, N=7, <italic>Dchs1<sup>â/â</sup></italic>, N=5). ImageJ software was used to measure the length of anterior and posterior leaflets from annulus to tip and the perpendicular width at the base, mid-region and tip. Measurements were compared to wild-type data to generate fold change and statistical significance (p&lt;.01) was calculated using a <italic>Students t-test</italic>. For quantification of mitral valve interstitial cell alignment: hearts were initially dissected from E17.5 fetuses. The apex of the heart was dissected and discarded followed by removal of the left atrium. A cut was made cranial to caudal along the anterior aspect of the myocardium. The left ventricle was reflected to gain visualization of the leaflets. The left ventricle and interventricular septum were pinned such to stretch the papillary muscle and the chords. This resulted in obtainment of the leaflet as a planar sheet of tissue. The tissue was fixed in this position to ensure the leaflet was maintained in this orientation, as failure to do so results in curling of the leaflet making measurements and plane of orientation inconsistent between animals. Once the planar leaflet tissue was fixed in 4%PFA for 5 minutes, the leaflet was released from the heart by cutting the chords and dissecting along the annulus fibrosae. The tissue was then processed through normal protocols and placed <italic>en-face</italic> on paraffin. This technique was performed blinded to genotype and performed in exactly the same manner for all valve isolates. Performing this type of dissection and tissue processing ensures that all leaflets are placed in nearly identically oriented planes. The vector maps and quantification of cell alignment were performed blinded by two independent researchers. Only after the data was generated did a third researcher perform the PCR genotyping. Vector maps were manually generated as previously described<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Cells that deviated &gt;10 degrees from an average alignment plane were counted as misaligned. Interstitial cells within anterior leaflets from each genotype were measured. Total number of cells measured were: WT=1083, (N=4), Het=1118, (N=4), KO=1953, (N=4). Statistical significance was calculated using a <italic>Students t-</italic>test with a p value &lt;.05 being significant. Very little variation existed between the independent valves of each genotype as is graphically depicted. For mouse echocardiography the Vevo2100 imaging system (VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada) was used with 22â55 MHz linear transducer probe (MS550D) and utilized for 2-D B-mode and M-mode analysis. Heart rate was maintained at 400â500 bpm via isoflurane anesthesia. The mitral valve leaflet was visualized and its function was assessed in parasternal long-axis B-mode view by placing the transducer on the left lateral chest wall. End-systolic and end-diastolic LV dimensions and wall thicknesses were measured according to the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines as applied to mice. LV wall thickness was measured at the level of interventricular septum and the posterior wall. LV volume was calculated from Simpsonâs method of disks and ejection fraction determined from the formula (LV end-diastolic-end-systolic volume)/(LV end-diastolic volume). Offline image analyses were performed using dedicated VisualSonics Vevo2100 1.2.0 software. Mitral valve prolapse was determined based on superior systolic displacement of one or more leaflets above the line connecting the annular hinge points in the long-axis view (N=6/genotype).

Hearts were sectioned at 5 Î¼m and slides were treated with 15mls of antigen unmasking solution (Vector Biolabs, H-3300) in 1600mls of distilled water for 10 minutes in a pressure cooker (Cuisinart) followed by incubation for 1 hour at room temperature with 1% BSA (Sigma, B4287) in PBS. Expression of EGFP after Cre recombination was detected by immunofluorescence using antibodies against GFP (Abcam, 13970) and Myosin heavy chain (MF20; DSHB). 5 Î¼m sections throughout the entire valve were used for 3D reconstructions using Amira software. The volume of GFP positive cells and the volume of each mitral leaflet were measured using this software. Cell counting was done on GFP positive and GFP negative cells every 15 microns throughout the entire valve. Pairwise comparison of littermates were performed and statistical significance was determined (<italic>Students t-test</italic>) with p=.04 for posterior leaflet and p=.86 for anterior leaflet.</p>

Cells were allowed to adhere overnight and then gels were dissolved. Wells were imaged over a period of 24 hours and area of the cell free region was measured in photoshop v.10.0.01 and subtracted from the initial area of the hydrogel to generate area migrated over time. Migration in the <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> and <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice was assessed by explanting P0 neonatal posterior mitral leaflets onto plastic. Images of the explants and migrating cells were captured at multiple timepoints. Distance migrated was measured as the distance from the explant to the farthest migrating cell. Measurements were taken at 5 points around the explant and averaged to calculate distance migrated. After 24 hours, cells were fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol for 10 minutes and immunofluorescence was performed using an antibody against N-cadherin (1:1000 dilution, BD Transduction Labs, 610920). Pairwise comparisons were performed and statistical significance was determined (<italic>Students t-test</italic>) with p&lt;.05.</p>

This normal patterning is perturbed in the <italic>Wt1-Cre/Rose-eGFP/Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice. 3D reconstructions were used to examine all EPDCs in the posterior leaflet of both genotypes to obtain a complete fate map of these cells. <bold>(B, C)</bold> Total volume of the leaflet is unchanged at this time point. However, the total volume of EPDCs as well as total EPDC cell number is significantly increased. There is a significant decrease in the number of non-EPDCs in the posterior leaflet with no overall change in total cell number. These data demonstrate that a minimum threshold of Dchs1 expression is required for normal migration of EPDCs into the posterior leaflet, normal patterning of this cell population, and cross-talk between EPDC and non-EPDC cell types in the valve. (**p&lt;.01) (<bold>D</bold>) Isolated anterior mitral leaflet from fetal (E17.5) <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Dchs1<sup>+/â</sup></italic>, and <italic>Dchs1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice were used to quantify cellular alignment of valvular interstitial cells.
