      <abstract>
        <p>Heat shock protein (Hsp)70 is a molecular chaperone that maintains protein homoeostasis during cellular stress through two opposing mechanisms: protein refolding and degradation. However, the mechanisms by which Hsp70 balances these opposing functions under stress conditions remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Hsp70 preferentially facilitates protein refolding after stress, gradually switching to protein degradation via a mechanism dependent on ARD1-mediated Hsp70 acetylation. During the early stress response, Hsp70 is immediately acetylated by ARD1 at K77, and the acetylated Hsp70 binds to the co-chaperone Hop to allow protein refolding. Thereafter, Hsp70 is deacetylated and binds to the ubiquitin ligase protein CHIP to complete protein degradation during later stages. This switch is required for the maintenance of protein homoeostasis and ultimately rescues cells from stress-induced cell death <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, ARD1-mediated Hsp70 acetylation is a regulatory mechanism that temporally balances protein refolding/degradation in response to stress.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The 70âkDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) are a family of ubiquitously expressed intracellular proteins that are required for the maintenance of protein homoeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Hsp70 isoforms have been reported in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> through higher organisms. In humans, a dozen Hsp70s with unique patterns of expression or subcellular localizations have been identified. Among these, Hsc70 (heat shock cognate protein, Hsp73/HSPA8) and Hsp70 (Hsp72/HSPA1A) have been extensively studied and have unique biological functions despite their high sequence homology. Hsc70 is a constitutively expressed chaperone that plays crucial roles in stabilizing protein folding under non-stress conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In contrast, the stress-induced protein Hsp70 is highly induced in response to cellular stressors including oxidative stress, hyperthermia, hypoxia and changes in pH (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), contributing to their resistance to stress-induced cell death. Despite the distinct roles of these proteins under normal or stress conditions, the mechanisms underlying their selective regulation in different environments remain largely unknown.</p>
    <p>Most tumour cells, which live under continuous stress conditions, express elevated levels of Hsp70 to combat these harsh conditions and suppress apoptosis. Once tumours acquire the ability to overexpress Hsp70, its expression also remains high under normal conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. This elevated Hsp70 level enables cancer cells to respond promptly to stress, in contrast to normal cells, which require time to transcribe Hsp70. However, the mechanisms responsible for the prompt or time-dependent response of Hsp70 have not been extensively studied.</p>
    <p>The cellular response to proteotoxic stress includes protein refolding and degradation. When proteins are denatured under stress conditions, misfolded proteins can be preferentially repaired by refolding. However, if refolding fails, proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The molecular chaperone Hsp70 is responsible for both protein refolding and degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, and these opposing properties of Hsp70 are closely regulated by cooperation with co-chaperones such as Hop and CHIP, which bind to Hsp70 in a competitive manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Hop and CHIP contain tetratricopeptide repeat domains that associate with the Hsp70 C terminus. Hop provides a link between Hsp70 and Hsp90 and assists in chaperone-mediated protein refolding, whereas CHIP exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity that promotes ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Therefore, the choice to bind with Hop or CHIP is crucial to the protein triage decision by Hsp70 of whether proteins are repaired or eliminated when they are denatured by cellular stress. However, the mechanisms by which Hsp70 chooses its binding partner and balances its opposing chaperone functions between protein refolding and degradation under stress conditions remain unknown.</p>
    <p>Hsp70 is composed of three domains: a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), a substrate-binding domain (SBD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The NBD exhibits ATPase activity that hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, and the SBD accommodates the peptides of substrate proteins. The structure of Hsp70 is highly dynamic and is dependent on ADP/ATP binding. When ADP binds to the NBD, the NBD interacts only minimally with the SBD, and peptides are able to be tightly bound to the SBD. When ATP binds to the NBD, an extensive NBD surface interacts with the SBD, and peptides can rapidly bind to and be released from the SBD. These conformational changes in Hsp70 enable the allosteric mechanisms that transfer the energetic tension from the ATP-bound NBD to the SBD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Therefore, the allosteric regulation of Hsp70 is indispensable for its proper function. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the allostery of Hsp70 are also unknown.</p>
    <p>The acetyltransferase ARD1 was first identified in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In mammals, several splice variants of ARD1 have been identified that have different biological functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Among these, human ARD1<sup>235</sup> is the major isoform in humans and is involved in a wide range of biological processes including cancer development, apoptosis, differentiation and neurodegenerative disorders. ARD1 might have an important role in cell survival; however, studies of the function of ARD1 during cellular stress have yielded controversial results. For example, the depletion of ARD1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, indicating that ARD1 contributes to cell survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In contrast, ARD1 was required for caspase activation during apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and reduced cancer cell survival through autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Because of these disparate results, it is uncertain whether the role of ARD1 in cellular stress is protective or apoptotic.</p>
    <p>In this study, we elucidated the ARD1-mediated Hsp70 functional interplay between protein refolding and degradation. After stress induction, Hsp70, but not Hsc70, gradually switches its co-chaperone complex from protein refolding to protein degradation machinery to perform protein repair and elimination in sequence. This Hsp70 functional switch is regulated by ARD1-mediated acetylation. In response to cellular stress, Hsp70 is promptly acetylated at K77 by ARD1 and then gradually deacetylated at later stages. The acetylation/deacetylation state of Hsp70 regulates its co-chaperone complex, switching the chaperone functions of Hsp70 between protein refolding and degradation. In addition, the proper timing of the Hsp70 functional switch after stress induction is essential for the maintenance of protein homoeostasis and cell survival under stress conditions. Therefore, the prompt response of Hsp70 to cellular stress enables Hsp70-expressing cancer cells to be more resistant to proteotoxic stress. Thus, our study not only address how cells efficiently balance protein refolding/degradation under stress conditions but also provide a new perspective on the existence of a prompt stress response by post-translational modification that is specific to Hsp70 versus Hsc70.</p>

        <title>Correlation between Hsp70 acetylation and its co-chaperone</title>
        <p>To investigate the interplay of Hsp70 function between protein refolding and degradation, we first evaluated the temporal change of Hsp70 function over time after stress. Because the opposing chaperone functions of Hsp70 between protein refolding and degradation are determined by the competitive binding of co-chaperone proteins, such as Hop and CHIP, we analysed the changes in co-chaperone binding to Hsp70 over time after stress induction. Because high Hsp70 levels must be maintained during stress for the quantitative comparison of co-chaperone binding, we utilized HEK293T cells, which consistently express high levels of endogenous Hsp70 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). After hydrogen peroxide treatment, the binding of Hop and Hsp90 to Hsp70, which promotes protein refolding, rapidly increased in the early phases (1â4âh) after stress induction. In contrast, the binding of CHIP and Hsp40, which promotes protein degradation, markedly increased during the later phases (12â24âh; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These results suggest that Hsp70 is converted from a component of the refolding machinery during the early phases after stress to a component of the degradation machinery during the late phases. We also assessed the co-chaperone-binding changes of another Hsp70 family member, Hsc70, which is involved in normal cellular functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Unlike Hsp70, Hsc70 did not exhibit changes in co-chaperone binding after stress, suggesting the specificity of Hsp70 behaviour during stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
        <p>Recent studies have shown that post-translational modifications regulate various cellular functions of Hsp70 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). In particular, investigations on stress-induced autophagy causing Hsp70 acetylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> led us to hypothesize that protein acetylation might act as a switch to mediate Hsp70 function between protein refolding and degradation. To investigate this possibility, we analysed Hsp70 acetylation levels after stress. Notably, as for the co-chaperone-binding patterns associated with refolding, the acetylation level of Hsp70, but not that of Hsc70, rapidly increased during the early phases after stress and decreased during the later phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). These results suggest the possibility that the acetylation state of Hsp70 might decide between the opposing chaperone functions of Hsp70 by regulating co-chaperone binding after stress. To confirm our results under other physiological stress conditions, cellular stresses were induced by various reagents, including etoposide (a DNA-damaging reagent), 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>, a neurotoxin), sodium chloride (hyperosmotic stress) and ethanol. Following treatment, Hsp70 acetylation rapidly increased and the co-chaperone binding changed accordingly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1aâd</xref>). These results indicate that the prompt stress response of Hsp70, the changes in its acetylation level, and the co-chaperone-binding pattern are conserved mechanisms shared by various types of cellular stress. In addition, we also exposed cells to brief stress instead of constant stress. Cells were briefly stimulated with hydrogen peroxide for 1âh, followed by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) washes to remove the toxin. During the recovery period, the acetylation level and co-chaperone binding of Hsp70 gradually changed in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). These results suggest that during cellular stress, the functional switch of Hsp70 from protein refolding in the early phase to protein degradation in later phases is a serial event within the same primary response, rather than representing independent events of two parallel phases.</p>
        <p>Because Hsp70 is inducible in many cells after stress, its transcriptional activation has been considered as a central component of Hsp70 stress response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Therefore, we compared the peak period of Hsp70 acetylation with that of its transcriptional activation in SH-SY5Y cells following the stable expression of GFP-Hsp70. After stress induction, the acetylation of GFP-Hsp70 rapidly increased in the early phases (1â4âh), whereas expression of endogenous Hsp70 significantly increased in the later phases (12â24âh). These results indicate that acetylation is an immediate stress response and occurs faster than the transcriptional activation of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

        <title>ARD1 regulates the stress response of Hsp70</title>
        <p>Previously, we identified mammalian ARD1 as a lysine acetyltransferase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Thereafter, we screened for ARD1-interacting proteins using affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry and observed that ARD1 bound to endogenous Hsp70 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Using co-immunoprecipitation, we observed that ARD1 bound to Hsp70 but not to Hsc70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting the involvement of ARD1 in the Hsp70-specific stress response. To determine whether ARD1 mediates an Hsp70 stress response, we assessed the acetylation level and co-chaperone binding of Hsp70 in ARD1-deficient cells. Although hydrogen peroxide rapidly increased Hsp70 acetylation in control cells, Hsp70 acetylation was significantly diminished in ARD1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Accordingly, increased binding of Hop and Hsp90 to Hsp70 at the early phase (1âh) after stress induction also did not occur in ARD1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These results suggest that ARD1 is critical for the prompt stress response of Hsp70. Next, an <italic>in vitro</italic> acetylation assay was performed to determine whether ARD1 directly acetylates Hsp70. In accordance with its selective binding pattern, recombinant GST-ARD1 directly acetylated recombinant GST-Hsp70 <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, GST-ARD1 did not acetylate GST-Hsc70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), demonstrating that ARD1 directly and selectively acetylates Hsp70.</p>

        <title>Hsp70 K77 is acetylated by ARD1</title>
        <p>To identify the target site of ARD1-mediated Hsp70 acetylation, we constructed Hsp70 deletion mutants and subjected them to an <italic>in vitro</italic> acetylation assay. The NBD of Hsp70 was acetylated by ARD1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To identify the acetylation site, acetylated GST-NBD was digested into peptides and then subjected to micro-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCâMS/MS), which showed that the peptide containing the Lys 77 residue (K77) was acetylated. The peptide identity and the acetylation residue position were confirmed via the MS/MS spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). To establish the causality of this relationship, we mutated the K77 of recombinant Hsp70 to an Arg 77 residue (K77R) and performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> acetylation assay. Although wild-type GST-Hsp70 was acetylated by ARD1 in a time-dependent manner, the K77R mutation significantly decreased the ARD1-mediated acetylation of GST-Hsp70, indicating that K77 is the main target site of ARD1-mediated Hsp70 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Although K77 was the only acetylated site discovered using LCâMS/MS, the K77R mutation did not completely diminish Hsp70 acetylation, suggesting the existence of other, minor acetylation sites. To exclude their effects and focus on Hsp70 K77 acetylation, we constructed an antibody specific for this modification (Hsp70-K77-Ac) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, to examine whether K77 acetylation of Hsp70 was upregulated by cellular stress, we measured the change in Hsp70 K77 acetylation level in cells after stress induction. Using the Hsp70-K77-Ac specific antibody, we determined that Hsp70 K77 acetylation rapidly increased following hydrogen peroxide treatment in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Similar results were also observed in MPP<sup>+</sup>-treated SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>), confirming the stress-induced K77 acetylation of Hsp70. Notably, we observed that ARD1 was also acetylated in a similar pattern under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). These results indicate the existence of an acetylation cascade that sequentially activates ARD1 and Hsp70 following stress. Previously, we reported that ARD1 is autoacetylated at K136, and this autoacetylation is a critical step to stimulate the catalytic activity of ARD1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). To determine whether the autoacetylation of ARD1 is required for the Hsp70-mediated stress response, we used K136R and dominant-negative mutants of ARD1 that inhibit its autoacetylation activity. These two mutants eliminated hydrogen peroxide-stimulated ARD1 acetylation and completely blocked stress-induced Hsp70 K77 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), indicating that in response to cellular stress, ARD1 is activated through autoacetylation, and that this step represents the upstream signal for stress-induced Hsp70 acetylation.</p>

        <title>K77 acetylation enhances Hsp70 chaperone activity</title>
        <p>To determine whether ARD1-mediated acetylation site at Hsp70 K77 is conserved in various species, we compared the amino acid sequences across species. Sequence alignment revealed that this site is highly conserved from yeast to humans, whereas it is not conserved in Hsc70. Hsc70 contains an R77 residue instead of K77, which might explain why Hsc70 is not acetylated after stress and also supports the specialized function of Hsp70 during stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p>
        <p>Although Hsp70 has an ATPase enzyme activity, the protein modification that regulates this activity is unknown. Therefore, we next evaluated whether Hsp70 K77 acetylation affects its enzymatic activity. Because Hsp70 is allosterically activated by an ADP/ATP binding-induced conformational change, we first predicted the location of K77 in ADP-bound and ATP-bound structures. As the crystal structure of human Hsp70 is unknown, we used the crystal structure of DnaK, the Hsp70 homologue of <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In DnaK, the R76 residue corresponds to K77 of human Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>) and is located in the interface between the NBD and SBD of the ATP-bound form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Because the interaction of NBD with SBD is an important event for the allosteric activation of Hsp70 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), the putative location of K77 suggests an important role for K77 acetylation in regulating Hsp70 chaperone activity. To determine whether K77 acetylation indeed regulates the ATPase cycle of Hsp70, we assessed the ATPase activity and ATP-binding affinity of Hsp70 using wild-type and K77R mutant GST-Hsp70 recombinants. These functions of wild-type Hsp70 were significantly enhanced when Hsp70 was acetylated by ARD1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>), but exhibited no ARD1-induced change in the K77R mutant Hsp70 and Hsc70 recombinants, consistent with their acetylation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Together, these results suggest that ARD1-mediated K77 acetylation enhances the chaperone activity of Hsp70.</p>

        <title>Acetylation state of Hsp70 determines its chaperone function</title>
        <p>Hsp70 conformational change induced by ADP/ATP binding is also related to its co-chaperone affinity, which decides whether Hsp70 functions as a chaperone for protein refolding or degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Therefore, we next determined whether the composition of Hsp70 co-chaperone complex is regulated by K77 acetylation. We transfected wild-type or K77R mutant Hsp70 into HEK293T cells and then compared their binding affinities with co-chaperones. Compared with wild-type Hsp70, the K77R mutation weakened the binding of Hsp70 to Hop and Hsp90 and enhanced its affinity for CHIP and Hsp40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). To clarify the direct effects of Hsp70 acetylation on the competitive binding of Hop and CHIP to Hsp70, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay. After the Hsp70 recombinant was acetylated by ARD1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, Hop and CHIP recombinants were subjected to an <italic>in vitro</italic> competitive-binding assay. Acetylated Hsp70 preferred to associate with Hop rather than CHIP, whereas nonacetylated Hsp70 bound to CHIP instead of Hop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These results suggest that the K77 acetylation status of Hsp70 determines its chaperone function between refolding and degradation by directly regulating Hop and CHIP binding. To further elucidate whether the co-chaperone complex is altered by the acetylation/deacetylation state of Hsp70 under stress conditions, we treated cells with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) and measured the changes in Hsp70 acetylation levels and co-chaperone binding. Consistent with the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>, depending on the acetylation state, Hsp70 bound to Hop during the early phase (2âh) and to CHIP during the late phase (20âh) after stress induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). However, after TSA treatment for 4âh at the late phase (20âh), Hsp70 acetylation was recovered, and Hsp70 consequently changed its binding partner from CHIP to Hop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). In addition, we also observed that HDAC4 bound to and deacetylated Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a and b</xref>). In HDAC4-overexpressing cells, Hsp70 acetylation levels were reduced and Hsp70 co-chaperone binding was accordingly altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). In HDAC4-deficient cells, Hsp70 was not deacetylated in the late phase (20âh) and switch of co-chaperone bindings was also disappeared, indicating that HDAC4 is a relevant deacetylase for Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). These data also confirm that the co-chaperone binding of Hsp70 can switch and is dependent on its acetylation/deacetylation state.</p>
        <p>To further confirm our results, we transfected cells with the deacetylation-mimic K77R and acetylation-mimic K77Q Hsp70 mutants and checked the temporal switching of their co-chaperone binding from early phase (2âh) to late phase (20âh) response. Although wild-type Hsp70 temporally switched its co-chaperone-binding partner from Hop in the early phase (2âh) to CHIP in the later phase (20âh), the K77R and K77Q Hsp70 mutants could not convert their binding partners under the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Throughout the period of cellular stress, the K77R and K77Q mutants consistently bound to CHIP and Hop, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). These results indicate that the conversion of acetylation/deacetylation state of Hsp70 acts as a key switch that temporally balances the Hsp70 co-chaperone complex between the refolding machinery and the degradation machinery under stress conditions.</p>
        <p>Next, to determine whether this temporal switch of co-chaperone binding to Hsp70 between early and late phases after stress is necessary for the maintenance of protein homoeostasis under stress conditions, we measured protein refolding at the early phase and degradation at the late phase using the Hsp70 K77R and K77Q mutants. Consistent with the defects in co-chaperone binding, the K77R mutation of Hsp70 impaired its capacity for protein refolding during the early phase after stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), whereas it exhibited normal protein degradation activity in the late phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). In contrast, the K77Q mutant exhibited normal protein refolding activity during the early phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), but exhibited defects in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during the later phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Consequently, the final accumulation of protein aggregates caused by the failure of protein refolding or degradation was elevated by both mutations after stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). These results indicate that the Hsp70 switch from facilitating protein refolding to facilitating degradation at the proper time under stress conditions is essential for the maintenance of protein homoeostasis.</p>

        <title>Hsp70 acetylation protects cells against stress</title>
        <p>Stress-induced disruption of protein homoeostasis eventually results in cell dysfunction or cell death, and Hsp70 plays a protective role during these processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Hsp70 acetylation on cell survival under various types of cellular stress using stable cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant Hsp70 and ARD1. Wild-type Hsp70-protected cells against various cellular stresses, but this protective effect was eliminated by the K77R mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). In addition, the protective effect was abolished by co-expression with dominant-negative mutant ARD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>), indicating that ARD1 supports cell survival during cellular stress through Hsp70 acetylation. Similarly, the K77Q mutant also impaired the protective effect of wild-type Hsp70 despite its normal ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). These results suggest that in Hsp70-mediated stress response, although Hsp70 exhibits normal ATPase activity throughout, the temporal switch of chaperone functions between protein refolding and degradation is indispensable to protect cells under stress conditions.</p>
        <p>Next, we also examined the effect of Hsp70 acetylation on stress-induced apoptosis. As expected, wild-type Hsp70 decreased the apoptotic cell number after the induction of various stresses, whereas the Hsp70 K77R mutant showed no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). The anti-apoptotic effect of wild-type Hsp70 was eliminated in dominant-negative mutant ARD1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). These results were confirmed using apoptotic markers including cleavage of caspase-9 and -3 and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release from mitochondria. Wild-type Hsp70 inhibited the stress-induced cleavage of caspase-9 and -3, however, this protective effect was abolished by K77R mutation of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Similarly, co-expression of dominant-negative mutant ARD1 also reduced the protective effect of wild-type Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>). We further observed that stress-induced cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release from mitochondria was increased by K77R mutation of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>). These results indicates that ARD1-mediated Hsp70 acetylation has an anti-apoptotic effect during cellular stress.</p>
        <p>The protective effects of Hsp70 acetylation were also confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> using zebrafish expressing Hsp70 with or without ARD1. To induce lethality, zebrafish were incubated with hydrogen peroxide and survival ratios were measured. Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, the K77 mutation in Hsp70 reduced the protective effect of HSP70 against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). Furthermore, the protective effect of Hsp70 K77 acetylation was blocked by co-expression of the dominant-negative mutant ARD1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11b</xref>). In addition, we treated zebrafish with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and measured the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Compared with zebrafish expressing wild-type Hsp70, zebrafish expressing the Hsp70 K77R mutant exhibited increased dopaminergic neuron loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11c,d</xref>). Functionally, the K77R mutation markedly decreased zebrafish locomotor activity compared with that in wild-type Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11e</xref>), and expression of the dominant-negative mutant ARD1 eliminated the protective effects of wild-type Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11f</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study presents a molecular mechanism that temporally balances protein refolding and degradation mediated by Hsp70 under stress conditions. We propose a model of Hsp70 functional interplay between protein refolding and degradation during cellular stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). In response to stress, Hsp70 is rapidly activated by acetylation to preferentially encourage refolding of denatured proteins. However, when Hsp70 reaches the limit of protein repair, its acetylation is gradually decreased thus converting its function from misfolded protein repair to misfolded protein degradation.</p>
      <p>The chaperone-mediated protein triage decision between protein refolding and degradation is modulated by the co-chaperone complex. However, how the different co-chaperones are associated with and influence the Hsp70 decision was unknown. The present study investigated Hsp70 acetylation as a potential switch for its mode of action. We observed that the Hsp70 acetylation state decides between protein refolding and degradation by controlling the competitive binding of Hop and CHIP. The possibility that protein modification affects co-chaperone binding was also recently suggested in previous reports. Muller <italic>et al</italic>. and Assimon <italic>et al</italic>. showed that phosphorylation of the C termini of Hsp70 and Hsp90 enhanced their binding to Hop<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In addition, RÃ¶hl <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> reported that phosphorylation of Hop decreased its binding affinity to Hsp70 <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is possible that these modifications are correlated with K77 acetylation of Hsp70 under stress conditions. For example, Hsp70 may be phosphorylated in the early phase after stress and synergize the effect of acetylation of Hsp70 to promote Hop binding. In contrast, phosphorylation of Hop may be stimulated during the late phase after stress to become separated from deacetylated Hsp70. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate how these post-translational modifications are sequentially stimulated over time after stress induction and how they interact with each other to regulate Hsp70 function.</p>
      <p>In this study, Hsp70 acetylation site is located in the NBD, which does not directly interact with Hop and CHIP. Therefore, this modification may affect C-terminal binding of these proteins through an Hsp70 conformational change. Hsp70 is a representative enzyme regulated by allosteric mechanisms. Without direct interactions, distal domains can be allosterically modulated by co-factors such as nucleotides, ions, disulfide bonds and post-translational modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Several studies have shown that phosphorylation-induced allosteric conformational changes modulate protein activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Thus, K77 acetylation in NBD may induce allosteric conformational changes in SBD and CTD, resulting in changes in co-chaperone-binding preference. In addition, K77 is located at a significant position for NBD-SBD interdomain contacts, which adds another interesting possibility that K77 acetylation at the NBD-SBD interface may modulates the Hsp70 conformational change. Although detailed investigations are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms, our results provide insight into the allosteric mechanism of Hsp70 regulation by post-translational modifications.</p>
      <p>Hsp70 is induced by cellular stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Therefore, most Hsp70 studies have focused on its transcription. However, transcriptional activation is not sufficient to explain the enzymatic characteristics of Hsp70 as an ATPase. Furthermore, Hsp70 is already highly expressed in many cells including cancer cells. Thus, we speculated the existence of a prompt Hsp70 stress response that could react more immediately than allowed by transcriptional activation and regulate the enzymatic activity of Hsp70 after cellular stress. Post-translational modification is a representative cellular switch that dynamically controls the cellular functions of various proteins. Relative to transcriptional activation, post-translational modification is a more efficient, rapid response to changes in the cellular environment and can reversibly turn on/off enzyme activity. Indeed, recent studies have suggested that such modifications regulate the diverse Hsp70 cellular functions involved in cell cycle regulation, cancer proliferation and autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Consistent with these results, our study revealed that Hsp70 could respond immediately to cellular stress through its acetylation. In response to stress, Hsp70 acetylation occurred more rapidly than transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), indicating the existence of a novel, prompt Hsp70 stress response regulated by post-translational modification.</p>
      <p>This prompt Hsp70 stress response ultimately contributes to the effective disposal of stress-induced denatured proteins. Specifically, acetylated Hsp70 prioritizes protein repair in the early phase after stress. Then, the remaining unrepaired proteins are eliminated by deacetylated Hsp70 during the late phase. This temporal distribution of protein refolding/degradation is an effective measure to overcome cellular stress. In cells that rarely express Hsp70, Hsp70-mediated protein refolding in the early phase might be weak; therefore, denatured proteins can be more strongly regulated by the protein degradation pathway in the late phase after sufficient Hsp70 is synthesized. We suggest that the existence of a prompt Hsp70 stress response might be one reason why Hsp70-expressing cells are more resistant to proteotoxic stress. For this reason, many cells including cancer cell might maintain elevated levels of Hsp70 under normal conditions as a preventive measure to allow immediate response to unexpected cellular stress.</p>
      <p>ARD1 was originally identified in yeast as an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal acetyltransferase that acetylates the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal amino acid of newly synthesized proteins. In mammalian cells, we found that ARD1 exhibits lysine acetyltransferase activity that acetylates the internal lysine residues of proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Thereafter, diverse ARD1 substrates were identified and various cellular functions of ARD1 in angiogenesis, cancer proliferation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, development and differentiation were reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In the present study, we identified Hsp70 as a new substrate of ARD1 and also suggested a novel role for ARD1 in the regulation of protein homoeostasis. Through acetylation of Hsp70 K77, ARD1 enhanced the ATPase activity and regulated the chaperone function of Hsp70 required for cell protection against stress conditions. In addition, similar to other enzymes that regulate post-translational modification, ARD1 can activate itself through autoacetylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Notably, ARD1 was rapidly autoacetylated in response to stress, and this step was indispensable for Hsp70 acetylation. These results suggest the presence of an acetylation cascade for sensing cellular stress and directing the downstream response.</p>
      <p>Hsp70 acetylation was also observed in other studies. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors increased intracellular Hsp70 and Hsp90 acetylation levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Furthermore, Hsp70 K159 was acetylated and deacetylated by p300 and HDAC6, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In this study, we found that HDAC4 deacetylates the K77 acetylation of Hsp70 and changes its co-chaperone binding. On the basis of the acetylation/deacetylation state, we assume that Hsp70 may bind more strongly to ARD1 in the early phase after stress, then Hsp70 may gradually convert its binding from ARD1 to HDAC4 over time. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the component proportion ratio of HDAC4 and ARD1 in the Hsp70 complex and its modulation over time after cellular stress. In addition, we did not examine all HDAC family members in this study, therefore, the involvement of other HDACs in K77 deacetylation of Hsp70 is also needed to be examined in further studies.</p>
      <p>In this study, we used two Hsp70 mutants, K77R and K77Q, which mimic deacetylation and acetylation, respectively, to investigate the effect of ARD1-mediated Hsp70 acetylation. The K77R mutation significantly downregulated the ATPase activity of Hsp70, whereas K77Q showed no change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref>). However, both mutants failed to convert their co-chaperone binding according to early or late phase response, resulting in reduced cell survival under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). These results indicate that Hsp70 acetylation/deacetylation does not simply represent the active/inactive state of Hsp70, but rather that the dynamic conversion of Hsp70 between acetylation and deacetylation states is critical for its proper cellular function.</p>
      <p>Although Hsp70 and Hsc70 are indiscriminately considered in most studies, because of their highly similar roles and sequence homologies, their differences warrant further investigation. For example, Hsp70 promotes cancer growth and survival, whereas Hsc70 is more relevant for normal cellular growth. Therefore, the selective inhibition of Hsp70 is a promising approach for the development of selective cancer therapies that do not disturb the normal cellular function of Hsc70. However, the high similarity between these proteins makes it difficult to develop a selective inhibitor for Hsp70.</p>
      <p>In the present study, the prompt stress response mediated by ARD1 acetylation was specific for Hsp70 but not for Hsc70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The distinguishable stress responses of Hsp70 and Hsc70 might be explained by their differing amino acids at residue 77, where instead of lysine (K), Hsc70 contains arginine (R), which cannot be acetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that ARD1-mediated selective acetylation of Hsp70 might contribute to the specialized functions of Hsp70 and Hsc70 in different cellular environments.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study identified a selective Hsp70 regulatory mechanism and offers a promising approach for the development of a specific inhibitor of Hsp70 that does not target the normal cellular functions of Hsc70. Regulation of Hsp70 K77 acetylation might be helpful in treating various diseases involving Hsp70 including cancer development, inflammatory diseases and neurodegeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.</p>
