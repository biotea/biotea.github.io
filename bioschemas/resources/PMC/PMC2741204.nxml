          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>Expression of the Exon 10 region of <italic>GABRB2</italic> from minigene constructs revealed this region to be an âalternative splicing hotspotâ that readily gave rise to differently spliced isoforms depending on intron sequences. This led to a search in human brain cDNA libraries, and the discovery of two novel isoforms, Î²<sub>2S1</sub> and Î²<sub>2S2</sub>, bearing variations in the neighborhood of Exon-10. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of postmortem brain samples showed increased Î²<sub>2S1</sub> expression and decreased Î²<sub>2S2</sub> expression in both SCZ and bipolar disorder (BPD) compared to controls. Disease-control differences were significantly correlated with SNP rs187269 in BPD males for both Î²<sub>2S1</sub> and Î²<sub>2S2</sub> expressions, and significantly correlated with SNPs rs2546620 and rs187269 in SCZ males for Î²<sub>2S2</sub> expression. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Thr<sup>365</sup>, a potential phosphorylation site in Exon-10, played a key role in determining the time profile of the ATP-dependent electrophysiological current run-down.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>This study therefore provided experimental evidence for the importance of non-coding sequences in the Exon-10 region in <italic>GABRB2</italic> with respect to Î²<sub>2</sub>-subunit splicing diversity and the etiologies of SCZ and BPD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Î³-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. The fast synaptic inhibition is mediated by the opening of a chloride channel formed by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are also clinically relevant drug targets for anti-convulsant, anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic agents. Subtypes of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are assembled from pentameric combinations of Î±<sub>1</sub>-Î±<sub>6</sub>, Î²<sub>1</sub>-Î²<sub>3</sub>, Î³<sub>1</sub>-Î³<sub>3</sub>, Ï<sub>1</sub>-Ï<sub>3</sub>, Îµ, Î´ and Ï subunits <xref rid="pone.0006977-Korpi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006977-Whiting1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The molecular heterogeneity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits is further increased by the alternative splicing of some subunit mRNAs, producing at least two isoforms of each of the Î±<sub>6</sub>, Î²<sub>2</sub>, Î²<sub>3</sub> and Î³<sub>2</sub> subunits <xref rid="pone.0006977-Mehta1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Most GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are composed of two Î± subunits, two Î²<sub>2</sub> subunits and one Î³ subunit <xref rid="pone.0006977-Whiting2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The Î²<sub>2</sub> subunit gene products of human <italic>GABRB2</italic> expressed from cDNA library are found in two alternatively spliced isoforms, the short form Î²<sub>2S</sub> and the long form Î²<sub>2L</sub>. The inclusion of an extra 38-amino acid Exon 10 in Î²<sub>2L</sub> but not in Î²<sub>2S</sub> in an intracellular loop brings with it a potential phosphorylation site at Thr<sup>365</sup> for calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g001">Figure 1A</xref>)<xref rid="pone.0006977-McKinley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are major psychotic disorders with a significant genetic component in their complex etiology <xref rid="pone.0006977-Craddock1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. <italic>GABRB2</italic>, which encodes the Î²<sub>2</sub> subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, contains single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-coding sequences in the Intron 8-Intron 9 region that have been associated with SCZ <xref rid="pone.0006977-Lo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0006977-Petryshen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, the expressions of Î²<sub>2S</sub> and Î²<sub>2L</sub> mRNA were found to be differentially decreased in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of SCZ brains by real-time quantitative PCR, and these altered expressions were correlated with the SCZ-associated SNPs rs1816071 and rs1816072 in SCZ subjects carrying the heterozygous genotypes <xref rid="pone.0006977-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Since GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing Î²<sub>2L</sub> underwent a steeper current run-down than those containing Î²<sub>2S</sub> under conditions of ATP depletion induced by repeated GABA-stimulation <xref rid="pone.0006977-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, these findings pointed to relationships between the alternate splicing of the Exon 10 region with both GABA current regulation and schizophrenia. It is therefore the objective of the present study to examine the factors determining the alternative splicing of Exon 10, and how the different Î²<sub>2</sub> isoforms might be correlated with the major psychotic disorders.</p>

        <title>Variability of Exon 10 splicing in vertebrates</title>
        <p>Based on sequence alignments, Exon 10 is readily identified in mammals and lizard, but not in chicken, frog (<italic>X. tropicalis</italic>) or fishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, Exon 9 and Exon 11 are present in all of these vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006977.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Notably, expressions of Exon 10 have been reported for both humans <xref rid="pone.0006977-McKinley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and chicken <xref rid="pone.0006977-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006977-Harvey2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, even though the Exon 10 sequence expressed in chicken bears little resemblance to that in mammals. In the present study, expression of Exon 10 was detected in rhesus monkey and mouse brains but not in rat brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The full-length Î²<sub>2L</sub> coding sequences amplified from monkey and mouse brain cDNA libraries also confirmed the presence of Î²<sub>2L</sub> in these two species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006977.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus there exist considerable variations among the vertebrates with respect to Exon 10 expression.</p>
        <p>The species variations in Exon 10 expression are paralleled by variations in the length of the intervening gene segment between Exon 9 and Exon 11(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, right), which increases from &lt;3,000 bp in the fishes to 14,000â19,000 bp in non-mammalian land vertebrates, and &gt;28,000 bp in marsupial and placental mammals. Furthermore, this region of the gene is readily blocked by RepeatMasker, which identifies DNA sequences containing interspersed repeats and low sequence complexity <xref rid="pone.0006977-Jurka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This suggests that insertions and expansions of repeat elements could be a significant contributing factor to the sharp increase in Exon 9-Exon 11 length from the lower vertebrates to the higher vertebrates. In fact, the sequence from 85-bp upstream to 66-bp downstream of Exon 10 has been annotated as a candidate LINE3, viz. a member of the Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element family (UCSC GenomeBrowser: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks</ext-link>). Evolutionary changes in the lengths of the gene segments corresponding to the other human introns in <italic>GABRB2</italic> are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006977.s003">Figure S3</xref>. Since only gene but not cDNA sequences are available in various non-human species, their exact exonic structures yet remain to be ascertained.</p>

        <title>Expressions of human Exon 10 region from minigenes</title>
        <p>In order to identify some of the effects of intronic sequences flanking Exon 10 on the splicing of the region between Exon 9 and Exon 11, minigene constructs containing Exons 2â9, a varying length of Intron 9, Exon 10, an shortened Intron 10, and Exon 11 were constructed and expressed in Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This wild-type (WT) minigene construct containing a full length Intron 9, was unfavorable toward the generation of Exon 10, as indicated by the absence of a significant Exon 10-containing Band II DNA in the WT gel slot (Lane 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, the Î1, Î3, Î6, Î7 and Î8 minigenes, each containing a shortened Intron 9, also did not give rise to any Band II DNA. Surprisingly, when the sequence between bp 1,451 and 3,513 in Intron 9 was further deleted from Î1 to yield Î2, a significant Exon 10-containing Band II was obtained, along with a Band I which contained a novel Exon 10a consisting of two segments of base sequences located between the E9 and E10 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006977.s004">Figure S4</xref>). When Î2 underwent a further shortening of Intron 9 in the direction toward Exon 9 to yield Î3, removing 451 bases including the rs187269 SNP site, both Exon 10 and Exon 10a disappeared. With still further shortening of Î3 to yield Î4, a different novel Exon 10b appeared in the form of Band IV. Shortening of Î4 to yield Î5 led to a re-emergence of the Exon 10-containing Band II along with a novel Exon 10c in the form of Band III. These observed exonal variations encoded by minigenes WT and Î1âÎ8 pointed to the complexity of Exon 10 expression, in keeping with the relative ease of generation of new splicing forms in this region.</p>

        <title>Identification of potential isoforms from human brain cDNA</title>
        <p>The results described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g002">Figure 2</xref> revealed splicing variants that generated three novel exons from the minigenes Î2, Î4 and Î5: Exon 10a from Î2, Exon 10b from Î4, and Exon 10c from Î5. In view of this observed propensity of the Exon 9-Exon 11 region to give rise to these novel exons in minigene transfected cells, it becomes of interest to determine whether the novel exons of this kind might also be expressed in the human brain. Accordingly, a human brain cDNA library (Resgen, Invitrogen) was PCR-amplified with primers F1 (forward), and R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 (reverse) designed to amplify such novel exons, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. The amplified PCR products shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g003">Figure 3B</xref> were cloned into the pMD-18T vector and sequenced. The sequencing results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g003">Figure 3C</xref> showed that the Lane 1, Lane 2 and Lane 3 DNAs were all derived from a cDNA encoding a novel isoform Î²<sub>2S1</sub> that spanned from the F1 primer to a point between the R3 and R4 primers. The absence of a visible DNA band in Lane 4 indicated the lack of significant F1-R4 PCR product. In Lane 5, a F1-R5 PCR reaction gave rise to three distinct DNA sequences corresponding to the known long (Î²<sub>2L</sub>) and short (Î²<sub>2S</sub>) isoforms together with a novel isoform Î²<sub>2S2</sub>.</p>

        <p>Previously it was found that upon repeated GABA-stimulations, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing Î²<sub>2L</sub> displayed a greater current run-down compared to those containing Î²<sub>2S</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0006977-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Since Thr<sup>365</sup>, a potential phosphorylation site for calmodulin dependent protein kinase II, is present in Î²<sub>2L</sub> but not Î²<sub>2S</sub>, its possible involvement in current run-down was examined by a Thr365Ala mutation to yield the mutant construct Î²<sub>2L-T365A</sub>. When repeated receptor activation was induced by exposure of cells transiently expressing Î±<sub>1</sub>Î²<sub>2L-T365A</sub>Î³<sub>2L</sub>, Î±<sub>1</sub>Î²<sub>2L</sub>Î³<sub>2L</sub> or Î±<sub>1</sub>Î²<sub>2S</sub>Î³<sub>2L</sub> to 300 ÂµM GABA in the absence of ATP infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g001">Figure 1D</xref> show that the 64.3% run-down reduction relative to initial current displayed by the Î²<sub>2L-T365A</sub>-containing receptors was smaller than the 77.3% reduction displayed by the wildtype Î²<sub>2L</sub>-containing receptors, and practically the same as the 64.0% reduction displayed by the Î²<sub>2S</sub>-containing receptors. These findings suggest that the greater sensitivity of Î±<sub>1</sub>Î²<sub>2L</sub>Î³<sub>2L</sub> relative to Î±<sub>1</sub>Î²<sub>2S</sub>Î³<sub>2L</sub> toward current run-down is caused by the depletion of intracellular ATP affecting the phosphorylation status of Thr<sup>365</sup>. In keeping with this, addition of 4 mM ATP to the intracellular infusate reduced the run-down amplitudes of all three kinds of receptors, and effectively narrowed the differences between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006977.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Novel isoforms in a splicing hot-spot</title>
        <p>The Î²<sub>2</sub> subunit polypeptide of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, encoded by up to eleven exons, is known to exist in different isoforms: Î²<sub>2L</sub> which contains Exon 10, and Î²<sub>2S</sub> which is devoid of Exon 10 <xref rid="pone.0006977-McKinley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Since the Î²<sub>2L</sub> and Î²<sub>2S</sub> expressions are associated with SCZ, and also produce different effects on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor run-downs, they could provide a fundamental link between <italic>GABRB2</italic> genotypes and physiological perturbations in schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0006977-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006977-Lo3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In the minigene system, while minigene Î2 gave rise to an Exon 10-containing Band II and an Exon 10a-containing Band I, a shortening of Î2 to Î3 that included the removal of the gene expression-correlated and schizophrenia-associated SNP rs187269 <xref rid="pone.0006977-Lo2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> abolished both Band II and Band I. Likewise, other minigene deletions gave rise to Exon 10b (expressed from Î4) and Exon 10c (expressed from Î5). These findings pointed to the facile occurrence of different splicing modes in the Exon 9-Exon 11 segment in response to intron sequence variations. They prompted a search among human brain cDNAs for novel splicing products and led to the discovery of the two novel Î²<sub>2</sub> isoforms Î²<sub>2S1</sub> and Î²<sub>2S2</sub> in the brain. In the Î²<sub>2S1</sub> isoform, Exon 9 is extended through Intron 9 retention, and both Exons 3, 10 and 11 were omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In the Î²<sub>2S2</sub> isoform, Exon 10 is omitted, and Exon 11 is shortened by a 64-bp deletion that brought about a frameshift-generated TAG. The absence of Exon 11 from Î²<sub>2S1</sub> and Î²<sub>2S2</sub> implies the loss of the C-terminal transmembrane domain TM4 from these Î²<sub>2</sub> isoforms. Functionally, the different Î²<sub>2</sub> isoforms displayed non-identical EC<sub>50</sub> values. Since the EC<sub>50</sub> values of Î²<sub>2S</sub> (containing Exon 11) and Î²<sub>2S1</sub> (devoid of Exon 11) were not greatly different, Exon 11 and its constituent TM4 domain might not be an important determinant of EC<sub>50</sub>. Similarly, since the EC<sub>50</sub> of Î²<sub>2L</sub> (containing Exon 10) was also not greatly different from those of Î²<sub>2S</sub>, Î²<sub>2S1</sub> and Î²<sub>2S2</sub> (all devoid of Exon 10), Exon 10 also might not be an important determinant of EC<sub>50</sub>. That the Î²<sub>2S2</sub> isoform was not detected earlier was likely due to its similar size as Î²<sub>2S</sub>, differing only by 64-bp, such that Î²<sub>2S2</sub> was only found through screening of individual clones bearing RT-PCR products. The Î²<sub>2S1</sub> isoform on the other hand has hitherto escaped detection probably because it became detectible only using PCR primers suggested by the minigene results.</p>
        <p>The existence of as many as four isoforms, viz. Î²<sub>2S</sub>, Î²<sub>2S2</sub>, Î²<sub>2S1</sub> and Î²<sub>2L</sub> arising from alternative splicings of the Exon 10 region suggests that this region represents an âalternative-splicing hotspotâ. The brain-region distributions of Î²<sub>2S</sub>, Î²<sub>2L</sub> and Î²<sub>2S2</sub> were largely similar whereas that of Î²<sub>2S1</sub> was more dissimilar. Exons 10a, 10b and 10c, which were expressed only by minigenes (viz. Î2, Î4 and Î5 respectively) that carried a deletion in Intron 9, were not detected in the brain.</p>

        <title>Relationships between novel isoforms and psychotic disorders</title>
        <p>Based on the six tagging SNPs in the Intron 8-Intron 9 segment, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006977-t002">Table 2</xref> showed that the expression of the novel Î²<sub>2S2</sub> isoform participated, at least among the males, along with the expressions of Î²<sub>2S</sub> and Î²<sub>2L</sub> in a number of allelic, genotypic and haplotypic correlations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, the expressions of all four isoforms in SCZ deviated significantly from CON, and this was also the case with Î²<sub>2S1</sub> and Î²<sub>2S2</sub> in BPD. Thus a derangement in Î²<sub>2</sub> isoform expressions represents an important characteristic common to these two major psychotic disorders.</p>
        <p>The genotypic effects recorded for the MM, Mm and mm genotypes of rs187269 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g004">Figure 4B</xref> showed generally higher levels in the male BPD and SCZ cohorts compared to CON in agreement with the overall increases in Î²<sub>2S1</sub> in BPD and SCZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), with the positive correlations between Î²<sub>2S1</sub> in BPD and genotype reaching the <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 significance level in the case of rs187269 MM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). On the other hand, the genotypic effects showed generally lower levels in the BPD and SCZ cohorts compared to CON in agreement with the overall decreases in Î²<sub>2S2</sub> in BPD and SCZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), with the negative correlations between Î²<sub>2S2</sub> in SCZ and genotype reaching the <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 significant level in the case of the rs2546620 Mm and negative correlations between Î²<sub>2S2</sub> in BPD and genotype also reaching the <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 significant level in the case of the rs187269 Mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus the observed increases in Î²<sub>2S1</sub> expression in BPD in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g004">Figure 4A</xref> were led by increased expression by the MM genotype more so than any increased expression by the Mm or mm genotype, whereas the observed decreases in Î²<sub>2S2</sub> expression in BPD and SCZ were led by decreased expression by the Mm genotype more so than any decreased expression by the MM or mm genotype. Correspondingly, such genotype-dependent alterations in Î²<sub>2S2</sub> expression were supported by the statistically significant inter-genotype differences (marked by # and â in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006977-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) observed in the BPD and SCZ cohorts, in contrast to the absence of such differences in the CON cohort.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, Î²<sub>2S1</sub> and Î²<sub>2S2</sub>, the two novel isoforms of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor Î²<sub>2</sub>-subunit discovered in the present study, shared two fundamental attributes with the previously known Î²<sub>2S</sub> and Î²<sub>2L</sub> isoforms: the expressions of all four were significantly correlated with not only SCZ or BPD or both, but also with the genotypes of SNPs in the Intron 8-Intron 9 region of the <italic>GABRB2</italic> gene. The present study therefore has rendered even more unambiguous the importance of the SNPs in this region of <italic>GABRB2</italic> with respect to isoform expressions and the etiologies of the two major psychotic disorders.</p>
