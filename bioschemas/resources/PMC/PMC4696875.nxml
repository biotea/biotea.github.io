      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Patients with a combined immunodeficiency characterized by normal numbers, but impaired function, of T and B cells had a homozygous p.Tyr20His mutation in transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), encoded by <italic>TFRC</italic>. The mutation disrupts the TfR1 internalization motif, resulting in defective receptor endocytosis and markedly increased TfR1 surface expression. Iron citrate rescued the lymphocyte defects and transduction of wild type, but not mutant, TfR1 rescued impaired transferrin uptake in patient fibroblasts. <italic>Tfrc<sup>Y20H/Y20H</sup></italic> mice recapitulated the patientsâ immunologic defects. Despite the critical role of TfR1 in erythrocyte development and function, the patients had only mild anemia and only slightly increased TfR1 expression in erythroid precursors. We show that STEAP3, a metalloreductase expressed in erythroblasts, associates with TfR1 and partially rescues transferrin uptake in patient fibroblasts, suggesting that STEAP3 may provide an accessory TfR1 endocytosis signal that spares the patients from severe anemia. These findings demonstrate the importance of TfR1 in adaptive immunity.</p>

    <p id="P2">Combined immunodeficiencies (CID) are characterized by life-threatening infections due to genetic defects resulting in impaired T and B lymphocyte development or function<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The 41 documented monogenic causes of CID have identified pathways and molecules important for adaptive immunity, but many patients with CID remain without a genetic diagnosis<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. We report the first human immunodeficiency caused by defective iron transport.</p>
    <p id="P3">Fourteen Kuwaiti children in Family A (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) had severe childhood infections leading to the death of six individuals (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Three patients (A1, A2, and A3) followed at our center had hypogammaglobulinemia, normal lymphocyte counts, intermittent neutropenia, and intermittent thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</xref>). Hematologic parameters were normal except for borderline-low hemoglobin in two patients and low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in all three (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Data on six additional patients revealed severe hypogammaglobulinemia and mild anemia resistant to iron supplementation (data not shown). Eight patients received early matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with resolution of clinical and laboratory abnormalities.</p>
    <p id="P4">Patient 1 of Family B from western Saudi Arabia is a five-year old son of consanguineous parents, with early-onset chronic diarrhea and recurrent infections (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). He had agammaglobulinemia, normal lymphocyte counts, intermittent thrombocytopenia, mildly low hemoglobin, and low MCV (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</xref>). He was treated with anti-CD20 antibody for presumed autoimmune thrombocytopenia, resulting in loss of circulating B cells without clinical improvement.</p>
    <p id="P5">The numbers of circulating total (CD3<sup>+</sup>), helper (CD4<sup>+</sup>), and cytotoxic (CD8<sup>+</sup>) T cells, natural killer (CD3<sup>â</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>/CD56<sup>+</sup>) cells, and B (CD19<sup>+</sup>) cells in the patients were normal or near normal. However, percentages of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> memory B cells, important for antibody production, were significantly reduced (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in response to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA), crosslinking of the T cell receptor (TCR) with anti-CD3 antibody, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (PMA+IO), which bypass the TCR, was significantly decreased in all four patients (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). T cell co-stimulation using anti-CD28 antibody or addition of IL-2 growth factor did not correct the defective TCR-driven proliferation, which was not associated with increased apoptosis (data not shown). These observations demonstrate a global defect in T cell proliferation.</p>

A missense mutation in <italic>TFRC</italic> (c.58T&gt;C, NM_003234.2), which encodes transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1, also known as CD71), was the only rare nonsynonymous or splice site mutation homozygous in both patients and heterozygous in the obligate carrier father (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). <italic>TFRC</italic> is located 919 kb downstream of the distal boundary of the linkage peak, which can be explained by a recent <italic>de novo</italic> occurrence of the mutation and segregation of both mutant and non-mutant copies of the disease haplotype within the family (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Text</xref>).

    <p id="P9">TfR1 is important for cellular iron uptake. Circulating apotransferrin binds two Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions to form holotransferrin, which binds to TfR1<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The TfR1-holotransferrin complex is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, which requires an aromatic residue at the p.Y20 position mutated in the patients<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. When intracellular iron is low, iron regulatory proteins bind to the 3â untranslated region of <italic>TFRC</italic> mRNA, increasing its stability<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. <italic>TFRC</italic> mRNA and TfR1 protein levels were higher in PBMCs from patients than in controls (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2câd</xref>), consistent with this feedback mechanism. Surface TfR1 was minimally expressed on unstimulated control T and B cells, but was expressed on a large percentage of patientsâ T and B cells, at levels 13- and 7-fold higher, respectively, than in controls (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Likewise, surface TfR1 expression was 6-fold higher on patient than control fibroblasts (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Soluble TfR1, generated by cleavage of surface TfR1, was significantly elevated in the patientsâ sera (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), consistent with increased surface TfR1 expression. TfR1 endocytosis was examined in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells or activated T cells, both of which highly express surface TfR1. Crosslinking of TfR1 dramatically decreased its surface expression on control but not patient cells, demonstrating that the p.Tyr20His mutation impairs TfR1 internalization (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Furthermore, transduction of wild type TfR1, but not TfR1<sup>Y20H</sup> or GAPDH, corrected defective transferrin uptake by patient fibroblasts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2gâh</xref>).

This observation demonstrates that insufficient iron uptake is the cause of the defective T and B cell activation underlying the patientsâ CID.

Therefore, the mild anemia in the patients was unexpected. Surface expression of TfR1 on glycophorin A (CD235a)<sup>+</sup> erythroid precursor cells (EPCs) from bone marrow was increased by only 2- to 2.5-fold in patients compared to controls (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6aâb</xref>).

STEAP proteins are conserved ferrireductases that co-localize with TfR1<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and possess a cytoplasmic YXXF motif<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> similar to the <sup>20</sup>YTRF<sup>23</sup> internalization motif of TfR1<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.

Transfection of WT STEAP3, but not STEAP3<sup>Y288H</sup>, partially rescued defective transferrin uptake in patientsâ fibroblasts (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). These findings suggest that through interaction with TfR1, STEAP3 facilitates TfR1 endocytosis in EPCs, which may protect the patients from severe anemia.</p>
    <p id="P13">Heretofore, the role of TfR1 in host defense had not been established, and <italic>TFRC</italic> mutations had not been implicated in human disease. We describe a new CID caused by a homozygous mutation in <italic>TFRC</italic> that hinders TfR1-mediated iron internalization, resulting in defective T and B cell proliferation as well as impaired class switching, which is necessary for antibody production. To our knowledge, this is the first human mutation implicating impaired iron transport in the pathogenesis of an immunodeficiency. We demonstrate that insufficient iron internalization constitutes the mechanism underlying this CID through <italic>in vitro</italic> correction of the patientsâ lymphocyte defects with iron citrate, which is internalized independently of TfR1. Furthermore, the relative importance of transferrin-dependent and non-transferrin-bound iron to host immunity was previously unknown.

Our data also suggest a novel pathway for TfR1 endocytosis mediated by its interacting partner STEAP3, which may account for the mild effect of the mutation on erythropoiesis. Of clinical importance, we have taken advantage of elevated TfR1 surface expression on lymphocytes to diagnose two patients at birth, thereby facilitating early cure by HSCT.</p>

All mice were kept in a pathogen-free environment. Retro-orbital bleeds were performed to obtain peripheral blood for quantification of murine hematologic parameters (Hemavet 950FS) and serum immunoglobulins, which were quantified using standard ELISA techniques.</p>

        <p id="P31">Anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the following molecules and the appropriate isotype controls were used for flow cytometry: CD4 (GK1.4), CD8 (53-6.7), CD62L (MEL-14) from BioLegend; CD44 (IM7), CD25 (PC61.5), FOXP3 (FJK-16S), NK1.1 (PK136), CD49b (DX5), Ter119 (TER-119) from eBioscience. Murine CD1d (Î±-GalCer analog) from the NIH Tetramer Facility-Emory University Vaccine Center, Atlanta, GA. Murine splenic T and B cells were purified by negative selection (Pan-T Cell Isolation Kit II and CD43 Kit respectively, Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.). Purified murine T cells were labeled with CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs protocol, followed by stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3Îµ (5 Î¼g/ml, 145-2C1) mAb, soluble anti-CD28 (2 Î¼g/ml, 37.51) mAb (both from eBioscience), murine rIL-2 (40 ng/ml, PeproTech), and PMA+IO for 96 hours prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. T cell proliferation was measured using the proliferative index (PI), calculated as follows: PI=Log[FI<sub>nd</sub>/MFI<sub>all</sub>]/Log[2], where FI<sub>nd</sub> represents the peak fluorescence intensity of the viable non-divided cells and MFI<sub>all</sub> represents the median fluorescence intensity of all viable T cells.</p>
        <p id="P32">Purified B cells were stimulated with murine rIL-4 (50 ng/ml, R&amp;D systems) plus either anti-mouse CD40 (1 Î¼g/ml, HM40-3, Pharmingen) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 Î¼g/ml, Sigma). Proliferation was assayed at day 4 by measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation, added for the last 16â20 hours of culture. On Day 7 supernatants were collected and assayed for IgE and IgG1 by ELISA. Standard flow cytometric methods were used for staining of cell-surface proteins, and data were collected and analyzed as shown for human cell staining. Fluorochrome-labeled mAbs to the following murine molecules and the appropriate controls were used for staining: TfR1 (R17217) from eBioscience, and CD3 (17A2) and B220 (RA3-6B2) from BioLegend. For TfR1 internalization, resting mutant T cells, purified wild type or mutant T cells stimulated with PMA+IO for 16â18 hours, or bone marrow harvested from murine femurs were used, following the same procedure performed on human EBV-transformed B cells. Erythroid precursors were identified using fluorochrome-labeled mAbs to CD44 (IM7) and Ter119 (Ter-119) from eBioscience. Purified rat anti-mouse TfR1 (R17217) was used for crosslinking and phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG was used for secondary detection of surface TfR1 expression. Percent TfR1 internalized was calculated as described previously in the Methods. Internalized TFR1 in murine erythroblasts was calculated as follows: MFI at zero minutes â MFI after 30 minutes of TFR1 cross-linking.</p>

        <p id="P33">Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare groups with equal variances and two-way ANOVA was used for comparing more than two groups. For animal experiments, the sample size was determined using a conservative estimate of a 50% decrease in lymphocyte proliferation, immunoglobulin secretion, TfR1 expression, and TfR1 internalization in <italic>Tfrc<sup>Y20H/Y20H</sup></italic> cells compared to controls, with a standard deviation of 10%. To detect this difference with 95% power, we would need at least two mice of each genotype for each experiment. All experiments were performed a minimum of two times unless otherwise indicated.</p>
