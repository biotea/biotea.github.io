      <abstract>
        <p>Multiple transcripts encode for the cell cycle inhibitor p21<sup>Cip1</sup>. These transcripts produce identical proteins but differ in their 5â untranslated regions (UTRs). Although several stresses that induce p21 have been characterized, the mechanisms regulating the individual transcript variants and their functional significance are unknown. Here we demonstrate through <sup>35</sup>S labeling, luciferase reporter assays, and polysome transcript profiling that activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) kinase GCN2 selectively upregulates the translation of a p21 transcript variant containing 5â upstream open reading frames (uORFs) through phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2Î±. Mutational analysis reveals that the uORFs suppress translation under basal conditions, but promote translation under stress. Functionally, ablation of p21 ameliorates G<sub>1</sub>/S arrest and reduces cell survival in response to GCN2 activation. These findings uncover a novel mechanism of p21 post-transcriptional regulation, offer functional significance for the existence of multiple p21 transcripts, and support a key role for GCN2 in regulating the cell cycle under stress.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cells sense nutrient levels in their environment in order to determine if conditions are favorable to divide. GCN2 is a protein that senses amino acids and responds to amino acid deficiency by suppressing protein synthesis and increasing the expression of genes involved in recovery from nutrient stress. Although GCN2âs role in amino acid sensing is well-characterized, it is not known how it links nutrient availability with the cell cycle. Here, we show that GCN2 induces the cell cycle inhibitor p21<sup>Cip1</sup> at the level of protein translation. The induction of p21 is limited to a specific messenger RNA variant that contains upstream open reading frames, and these upstream open reading frames are required for its enhanced translation under stress. Previously, the functional significance of these different p21 variants was unknown. Upregulation of p21 allows cells to halt division and survive under conditions of nutrient stress. Collectively, this work demonstrates a new mechanism of p21 regulation and the connection between GCN2 and the cell cycle.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, a member of the CIP/KIP family of cell cycle inhibitors, is known to play a key role in regulating the transition from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase of the cell cycle. Under normal conditions, complexes of cyclin E and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) are active in late G<sub>1</sub> phase and phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Phosphorylated pRB dissociates from E2F transcription factors, resulting in the transactivation of genes required for progression into S phase. Many different stress conditions upregulate p21 expression to inhibit cell proliferation and allow time for recovery before cell division. When p21 is induced, it binds to and inhibits cyclin E:CDK2 complexes. This prevents full phosphorylation of pRB, resulting in G<sub>1</sub>/S arrest [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>p21 expression must be tightly controlled in order for cells to properly progress through the cell cycle. As a result, p21 is regulated at many levels, both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. At the transcriptional level, p21 was first described as a p53 target and a major effector of cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, many stressors, such as oncogenic Ras [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and histone deacetylase inhibition [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], upregulate p21 transcription independently of p53. A variety of mechanisms regulate p21 levels post-transcriptionally. mRNA binding proteins, such as Hu-antigen D (HuD) [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Hu-antigen R (HuR) [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], bind to the 3â untranslated region (UTR) of the p21 transcript to enhance its stability. Both ubiquitin-dependent and independent pathways regulate the stability of p21 protein [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Phosphorylation events also regulate p21 protein stability, as well as its binding partners and subcellular localization [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Interestingly, p21 is encoded by multiple transcript variants in both mice and humans [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although much is known about the regulation of p21 expression as a whole, the regulation of the individual transcript variants is not understood. These transcript variants differ in their 5â UTRs but are identical in their coding sequence and thus produce the same protein. The 5â UTR of a transcript plays a crucial role in regulating its translation, suggesting that these variants might be differentially controlled at the translational level.</p>
      <p>Here, we demonstrate that upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5â UTR of an individual p21 transcript variant upregulate its translation during amino acid deprivation. This stress activates the serine/threonine kinase general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2), which phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2Î± [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Mutation of the uORFs in the p21 transcript variant or mutation of eIF2Î± preventing its phosphorylation blocks translational induction. Similarly, the translation of a second p21 transcript variant that lacks uORFs is not enhanced by eIF2Î± phosphorylation. Unlike many other known mechanisms of p21 upregulation under stress, GCN2-dependent regulation does not require p53 or the other p53 family members, p63 and p73. p21 induction is required for optimal G<sub>1</sub>/S arrest and promotes cell survival under conditions of amino acid deprivation. Together, these findings uncover a novel mechanism of differential regulation of distinct p21 transcript variants at the translational level and establish GCN2 as a critical regulator of the cell cycle and cell survival.</p>

        <title>p21 accumulation in response to amino acid deprivation requires GCN2 and eIF2Î± phosphorylation</title>
        <p>Multiple p21 transcript variants have been identified in mammals, but their significance remains unknown. In mice, there are two p21 transcripts generated by alternative promoter usage. The classical p21 transcript is designated as variant 1, while variant 2 is produced from a promoter located 2.8 kilobases upstream from the variant 1 promoter [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Both transcripts are ubiquitously expressed throughout mouse tissues [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These variants differ only in their 5â UTRs, suggesting that they undergo differential post-transcriptional regulation. Elements in the 5â UTR, such uORFs and internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes), play a major role in regulating translation. Analysis of the known mouse p21 transcript variants revealed that transcript variant 2 contains 5â uORFs, while transcript variant 1 does not. A diagram of the 5â uORFs is depicted in <xref rid="pgen.1005212.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>. The first uORF of the transcript overlaps out of frame with the coding region for p21. uORFs 2 and 3 are located within the first uORF and are fully contained within the 5â UTR. Human p21 is also encoded by multiple transcripts, some of which contain uORFs in their 5â UTRs [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

        <p>One of the most well-studied transcripts translationally regulated by uORFs is activating transcription factor 4 <italic>(ATF4)</italic>. ATF4 is a transcription factor that is translationally upregulated as part of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). The ISR consists of the four mammalian kinases GCN2, protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), which all phosphorylate eIF2Î± in response to a diverse array of stressors [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While eIF2Î± phosphorylation leads to a general downregulation of protein synthesis, the presence of 5â uORFs in <italic>ATF4</italic> leads to its translational upregulation under these conditions [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mouse <italic>ATF4</italic> contains two 5â uORFs. Under normal conditions, translation begins at the first uORF and then quickly reinitiates at the second uORF. Since the second uORF overlaps out of frame with the ATF4 coding region, no protein is produced. Upon eIF2Î± phosphorylation, the exchange of GDP to GTP on eIF2 is hampered. This delays translation reinitiation, allowing ribosomes to scan through uORF2 and begin translation at the ATF4 ORF [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
        <p>To determine if p21 is regulated by eIF2Î± phosphorylation, we cultured SV40 large T antigen transformed MEFs in media lacking leucine to activate GCN2, which phosphorylates eIF2Î± upon amino acid deprivation. We chose to focus on GCN2 because previous work has demonstrated that amino acid deprivation upregulates p21 [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Leucine deprivation resulted in phosphorylation of eIF2Î± and induction of p21. This response was strictly dependent on GCN2, as GCN2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs did not phosphorylate eIF2Î± or induce p21 under stress (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). MEFs containing a knock-in mutation of eIF2Î± in which serine 51 is converted alanine to prevent phosphorylation were also unable to upregulate p21 under stress, indicating that GCN2-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2Î± is necessary for p21 induction upon amino acid starvation (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). A close analysis of the kinetics of induction showed that p21 protein induction began between 8 and 12 hours of leucine deprivation (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). We repeated the experiment with glutamine deprivation to ensure that these results were not specific to leucine deprivation. Similar results were observed in the three cell lines (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we wanted to determine if dependence on GCN2 and p-eIF2Î± for p21 upregulation is a general stress response phenomenon or is restricted to nutrient deprivation. To do so, we exposed cells to ionizing radiation, a stress that induces p21 but does not activate the ISR. As shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005212.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, wildtype, GCN2<sup>-/-</sup>, and eIF2Î± S51A cells all rapidly increased p21 expression in response to DNA damage. These data indicate that GCN2 loss specifically renders cells incapable of inducing p21 in response to amino acid deprivation.</p>
        <p>After resolution of stress, we found that p21 levels return to baseline. GCN2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs were cultured without leucine for two days, then returned to complete media for 16 hours. p21 induction was robust after 48 hours of amino acid deprivation, but levels were barely detectable after a period of recovery (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). This indicates that p21 induction is reversible and cells can adjust p21 levels in response to their environment.</p>
        <p>To confirm that these findings were not specific to MEFs, we transfected SQ20Bs, a human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line, with non-targeting siRNA or siRNA against GCN2 and cultured the cells without leucine. Upon leucine deprivation, the siNT-transfected SQ20Bs phosphorylated eIF2Î± and induced p21. Knockdown of GCN2 prevented eIF2Î± phosphorylation and reduced p21 induction by almost 70% (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Thus, GCN2 regulates p21 in both human and murine cells.</p>
        <p>It has been reported that amino acid deprivation also induces p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, a cell cycle inhibitor closely related to p21 [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To establish if GCN2 and eIF2Î± phosphorylation are responsible for its upregulation under amino acid deprivation, we leucine deprived GCN2<sup>+/+</sup>, GCN2<sup>-/-</sup>, and eIF2Î± S51A MEFs cells and found that all three cell lines induced p27 (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). The p27 5â UTR does not contain any uORFs (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>), further supporting that eIF2Î± is not responsible for its upregulation under stress. Thus, p21 and p27 are regulated by different mechanisms under nutrient stress.</p>

        <title>Transcriptional upregulation of p21 through p53 does not play a role in its induction by amino acid deprivation</title>
        <p>One of the best-known mechanisms of p21 regulation is at the transcriptional level through p53, and it has been previously established that p53 regulates both murine p21 transcript variants [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To evaluate if any p53 family members contribute to p21 upregulation under amino acid deprivation, we leucine starved E1A transformed wildtype, p53<sup>-/-</sup>, p63<sup>-/-</sup>, and p73<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs and measured p21 transcript levels by qPCR. p21 transcript levels were upregulated in all cell lines in a time-dependent manner, although loss of any one of the p53 family members compromised basal levels of p21 mRNA (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). To confirm these results in a human cell line, we glutamine starved p53<sup>+/+</sup> and p53<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116s, a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, and analyzed p21 induction by western blot. Similar to the MEFs, we observed a decrease in basal levels of p21 in p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells, but loss of p53 did not prevent p21 upregulation under stress (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the SQ20B cells shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005212.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref> express a nonfunctional mutant version of p53 [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Overall these results demonstrate that p53 and other p53 family members maintain p21 transcript levels in unstressed cells but are not necessary for p21 induction upon amino acid deprivation.</p>

        <title>A p21 transcript variant containing 5â uORFs is translationally upregulated by GCN2</title>
        <p>When p21 mRNA levels were measured in leucine-starved GCN2<sup>+/+</sup>, GCN2<sup>-/-</sup>, and eIF2Î± S51A MEFs, we observed a time-dependent increase in total p21 transcript in all three cell lines (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Loss of GCN2 or the eIF2Î± S51A mutation did not affect basal levels of p21 transcript (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). We also measured levels of the p21 transcript variants separately under leucine deprivation. Transcript variant 1 was the predominant variant present in the MEFs, with a relative abundance of six to eight times more than variant 2 in complete media (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). Under amino acid deprivation, increases in variant 1 are primarily responsible for the increase in total p21 mRNA (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>). Interestingly, variant 2 levels increased modestly in GCN2<sup>+/+</sup> and eIF2Î± S51A MEFs under stress, but decreased by half in GCN2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig</xref>). This indicates that GCN2 plays a role independently of eIF2Î± in maintaining variant 2 mRNA levels under conditions of leucine deprivation.</p>
        <p>The increase in p21 mRNA without a corresponding increase in p21 protein in the GCN2<sup>-/-</sup> and eIF2Î± S51A MEFs further supported that p21 is regulated at the translational level by eIF2Î± phosphorylation through GCN2. To directly measure p21 translation, we grew GCN2<sup>+/+</sup> and GCN2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs with or without leucine for 16 hours, labeled newly synthesized proteins with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine and <sup>35</sup>S-cystiene, and immunoprecipitated p21. GCN2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs increased translation of p21 by approximately four-fold under leucine deprivation, while GCN2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs showed no increase in p21 labeling under stress (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Thus, GCN2 translationally upregulates p21 under nutrient stress.</p>
        <p>We next wanted to address the possibility that enhanced protein stability might also contribute to increased p21 levels under amino acid deprivation. We leucine starved GCN2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs to initially induce p21 protein, and then switched the cells to complete or leucine-free media containing cycloheximide to block any new p21 protein synthesis. A time course analysis revealed that p21 protein half-life was approximately 80 minutes in complete media and 20 minutes in leucine-free media (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Therefore, enhanced protein stability does not contribute to p21 induction under nutrient stress. Furthermore, this experiment further supports the notion that translational control plays a major role in maintaining p21 protein levels under stress.</p>
        <p>We created luciferase reporter constructs to assess the effects of amino acid deprivation on the translational efficiency of each p21 variant. To do so, we inserted either the 5â UTR of p21 variant 1 or 2 between the HindIII and NcoI restriction sites in a pGL3 reporter vector in which the SV40 promoter drives expression of luciferase. This created a construct in which the luciferase coding sequence is located directly after the p21 ORF start codon (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). GCN2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs were transfected with the resulting p21 variant 1 5â UTR-luciferase and p21 variant 2 5â UTR-luciferase plasmids, and luciferase activity was measured during a time course of leucine deprivation. No change in luciferase activity was observed from the variant 1 construct, while luciferase activity from the p21 variant 2 construct increased in a time-dependent manner (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). These results indicate that translational upregulation is specific to p21 variant 2. Furthermore, the translational regulation was dependent on eIF2Î± phosphorylation, as there was no statistically significant increase in luciferase activity from the variant 2 construct in eIF2Î± S51A MEFs (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

        <p>In order to determine if the 5â uORFs in the p21 variant 2 transcript were responsible for translational upregulation under stress, we introduced point mutations to disrupt the uORF start codons. Constructs were created with deletion of uORF1 (ÎuORF1), deletion of both uORFs 2 and 3 (ÎuORF2,3), and deletion of all three uORFs (ÎuORF1,2,3) (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Again, GCN2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs were transfected with these constructs, and luciferase activity was measured over a time course of leucine deprivation. Deletion of uORF1 or deletion of both uORFs 2 and 3 compromised induction of luciferase activity, demonstrating that all three uORFs promote translation under stress. The uORFs appear to be the only 5â elements regulating p21 translation since deletion of all three uORFs essentially blocked the increase in luciferase activity (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Under basal conditions, deletion of either uORF1 or uORFs 2 and 3 modestly raised luciferase activity, indicating that all three uORFs are inhibitory to translation under normal, unstressed conditions. The deletion of all three uORFs completely rescued basal luciferase activity to levels similar to that of p21 variant 1, which contains no uORFs (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). This suggests that under unstressed conditions, ribosomes tend to initiate translation at the uORFs instead of the p21 ORF.</p>
        <p>To confirm that the changes observed in luciferase activity were not due to changes in the transcript levels of the reporters, we performed qPCR for luciferase on GCN2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs transfected with the 5â UTR constructs. No appreciable changes in luciferase mRNA were observed (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). As a positive control, luciferase assays were performed with ATF4 5â UTR constructs (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>). In agreement with previous data [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], treatment with thapsigargin induced luciferase activity from the wildtype construct, and deletion of uORF2 increased basal translation levels while preventing induction in response to stress. This response is very similar to that seen with the deletion of p21 variant 2 uORFs.</p>
        <p>To ascertain if the two endogenous variants of p21 mRNA were translated with different efficiencies under stress, we leucine starved GCN2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs for 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours, and analyzed the distribution of the two p21 transcript variants in different polysome fractions. The polysome profiles for these time points are shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005212.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, and the pooling scheme of the fractions for qPCR analysis is shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005212.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig</xref> p21 variant 1 exhibited a strong shift from the high to the low molecular weight polysomes at 16 hours, after which it began to recover towards its baseline distribution (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). This pattern of translational suppression and recovery is similar to that of the housekeeping gene Î²-actin, as opposed to ATF4, which is translationally upregulated under stress (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). The association of p21 variant 2 with polysomes changed very little with time. It exhibited a slight decrease in association at 16 hours, followed by full recovery back to baseline at 24 hours (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Thus, by 24 hours, p21 variant 2 appears to be translated at its normal efficiency while variant 1 is still suppressed (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005212.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>).</p>

This value reflects the fraction of all mRNAs that are associated with polysomes under leucine deprivation as compared to complete media.

        <p>To confirm these results in a human cell line, we transfected SQ20B cells with either non-targeting siRNA (siNT) or siRNA against p21 (sip21). The knockdown efficiency of p21 is shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005212.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>.

        <p>To directly assess the role of GCN2 and eIF2Î± phosphorylation in cell cycle arrest, we leucine starved GCN2<sup>-/-</sup> and eIF2Î± S51A MEFs and measured the degree of G<sub>1</sub>/S cell cycle arrest by flow cytometry. The phenotype was even stronger in these cells, as they did not undergo any measurable degree of cell cycle arrest by 32 hours of leucine starvation (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005212.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5C Fig</xref>). This indicates that GCN2 and eIF2Î± phosphorylation are critically required for the induction of G<sub>1</sub>/S arrest in response to leucine deprivation and likely regulate other factors that promote cell cycle arrest under stress. These results were also confirmed in SQ20B cells transfected with siNT or siGCN2 (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5D Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>Previous findings showed that ER stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2Î± by PERK and GCN2 in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in translational suppression of cyclin D1 and subsequent G<sub>1</sub> arrest [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

Therefore, under our study conditions, GCN2 does not contribute to cell cycle regulation by modulating levels of cyclin D1. The GCN2-independent decrease in cyclin D1 and increase in p27 may explain why knockdown of p21 does not completely abolish the ability of MEFs to undergo G<sub>1</sub>/S arrest in response to amino acid deprivation.</p>
        <p>Next, we wanted to determine if p21 contributes to cell survival under amino acid deprivation. To do so, we cultured the shNT and shp21 MEF clones in complete media or media lacking leucine. After 72 hours, the viable cells were re-plated at low density in complete media. Virtually all shNT cells were able to recover from nutrient stress and form colonies. However, clonogenic survival was significantly reduced by approximately 40â50% in the two shp21 MEF clones after leucine deprivation (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5Eâ5F</xref>). Importantly, knockdown of p21 did not compromise cell viability, as measured by trypan blue exclusion, or clonogenic survival (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6AâS6B Fig</xref>) when the cells were grown in complete media. These results demonstrate that p21 is dispensable for cell growth under nutrient replete conditions but is critical for cell survival during the recovery from amino acid starvation. Interestingly, these results are consistent with another study which showed that p21 promotes cell survival under the combined stresses of complete amino acid and serum starvation independently of p53 [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to regulate p21 at the post-transcriptional level. However, translational regulation of p21 has been largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of translational control of a specific p21 transcript variant that regulates cell proliferation and survival under nutrient stress. GCN2 activation and subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2Î± translationally upregulates a p21 mRNA variant with 5â uORFs. Many genes are upregulated by eIF2Î± phosphorylation indirectly through activation of the ATF4 transcriptional program [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the number of genes known to be directly translationally upregulated by eIF2Î± phosphorylation is much smaller. In addition to ATF4, several other genes, such as activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 34 (GADD34) [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase Î± (IBTKÎ±) [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and protein kinase C Î· (PKCÎ·) [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], are also translationally upregulated by eIF2Î± phosphorylation due to the presence of uORFs in the 5â UTR. These studies into p21 regulation expand on the known targets of translational upregulation by phosphorylation of eIF2Î± and provide greater understanding of the functional outcomes of ISR activation.</p>
      <p>Our results suggest a model in which under normal, unstressed conditions, translation typically initiates at the uORFs in the p21 variant 2 transcript, resulting in very little production of p21 protein. Initiation at uORF1 would fail to produce a protein because it overlaps out of frame with the p21 coding sequence. Initiation at uORFs 2 and 3 likely do not produce a protein because they are located very close to the p21 coding sequence, which does not provide ribosomes sufficient time to reinitiate translation at the p21 ORF. When GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2Î±, translation initiation is delayed. This promotes leaky scanning through the uORFs and increases the likelihood that ribosomes will begin translation at the p21 ORF (<xref rid="pgen.1005212.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

          <title>Model of p21 translational regulation.</title>
          <p>Upon amino acid deprivation, GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2Î±, which delays translation initiation. This results in ribosomes bypassing 5â uORFs in the p21 variant 2 transcript and beginning translation at the p21 ORF, resulting in p21 upregulation under stress. This pathway is distinct from p53-dependent transcriptional upregulation of p21. Induction of p21 upon nutrient deprivation leads to G<sub><bold>1</bold></sub>/S arrest and promotes cell survival.</p>

      <p>This mechanism of translation regulation also offers an explanation for the existence of multiple p21 transcript variants that encode for the same protein. While our work focused on the two mouse p21 mRNA variants, humans also have multiple p21 mRNA variants that are likely regulated in a similar manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Some of these variants contain 5â uORFs, while others contain none. We speculate that p21 transcript variants with 5â uORFs provide an advantage to cells by allowing them to upregulate p21 under stress conditions that would normally repress translation. Translation is one of the highest energy consuming processes in the cell, which is why it is often suppressed to conserve resources under stress. Under these conditions, proliferation is not favored and upregulation of p21 provides an advantage to cells by promoting cell cycle arrest. However, the variants without 5â uORFs ensure that cells are not restricted to express p21 only when eIF2Î± is phosphorylated. Other stresses, such as DNA damage, do not suppress translation but still require cell cycle arrest to allow time for recovery. In these cases, cells could still translate p21 efficiently to respond to stress even though eIF2Î± remains unphosphorylated.</p>
      <p>From a functional standpoint, this study provides a link between the nutrient-sensing capabilities of GCN2 and the mammalian cell cycle. Several studies have shown that Gcn2 regulates a G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> in response to stressors such as nitrogen starvation [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and UV irradiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but GCN2âs contribution to this process in mammalian cells was not delineated. Many mammalian proteins that respond to nutrient levels impinge upon the cell cycle. Amino acids are also sensed by mTOR, one of the master metabolic switches of the cell. mTOR activity is inhibited upon amino acid deprivation, resulting in G<sub>1</sub> arrest through decreased production and increased turnover of cyclin D1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Amino acid starvation also increases the half-life of both p21 and p27 mRNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Glucose deprivation activates AMPK, a major cellular energy regulator, which phosphorylates and stabilizes p53, resulting in p21 induction [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Glucose deprivation also perturbs protein folding and activates the ISR initiator and endoplasmic reticulum resident kinase PERK, which induces G<sub>1</sub> arrest by suppressing cyclin D1 translation [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that GCN2 directly links amino acid availability with cell cycle progression by translationally upregulating a transcript variant of p21. As there is no homologue of p21 in fission yeast, cell cycle arrest downstream of Gcn2 in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> must occur through a different mechanism. Based on this work, it is tempting to speculate that the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> CDK inhibitor Rum1 contributes to this response, especially since there are two transcript variants of <italic>rum1</italic>, one that contains 5â uORFs and one that does not [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
      <p>The induction of p21 promotes cell cycle arrest when nutrients are scarce and conditions are not favorable for division. As a likely consequence of continued proliferation in a nutrient-poor environment, cells lacking p21 exhibit decreased survival after exposure to amino acid deprivation. These findings may have important implications for cancer. Tumor cells often exist in a nutrient-poor microenvironment due to inadequate tumor perfusion and increased metabolic demands of tumor cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We have previously shown that GCN2 is overexpressed in human tumors, and loss of GCN2 slows or inhibits tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of cancer [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Downstream of GCN2, p21 may serve to promote tumor cell survival in areas where nutrients are limiting. This fits with observations that p21 has both pro- and anti-tumorigenic properties [<xref rid="pgen.1005212.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In general, limiting cell division would slow tumor growth. However, in areas lacking adequate nutrient supply, p21-dependent cell cycle arrest would allow tumor cells to remain dormant and survive adverse conditions that would otherwise lead to cell death. Understanding the mechanism of p21 regulation and its function will greatly enhance the development of targeted therapeutics against the GCN2-eIF2Î±-p21 pathway.</p>

          <p>A) Viability of shNT, shp21 cl. 4, and shp21 cl. 7 MEFs grown in complete media as measured by trypan blue exclusion. There was no statistically significant difference in viability between shNT and shp21 cells. Data represent the average of three independent experiments Â± S.E.M. B) Clonogenic survival of shNT, shp21 cl. 4, and shp21 cl. 7 MEFs grown in complete media. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between shNT and shp21 cells. Data represent the average of three independent experiments Â± S.E.M.</p>
