        <p id="P1">Activating mutations of G protein alpha subunits (GÎ±) occur in 4â5% of all human cancers<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> but oncogenic alterations in beta subunits (GÎ²) have not been defined. Here we demonstrate that recurrent mutations in the GÎ² proteins GNB1 and GNB2 confer cytokine-independent growth and activate canonical G protein signaling. Multiple mutations in GNB1 affect the protein interface that binds GÎ± subunits as well as downstream effectors, and disrupt GÎ±-GÎ²Î³ interactions. Different mutations in GÎ² proteins clustered to some extent based on lineage; for example, all eleven GNB1 K57 mutations were in myeloid neoplasms while 7 of 8 GNB1 I80 mutations were in B cell neoplasms. Expression of patient-derived GNB1 alleles in <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>-deficient bone marrow followed by transplantation resulted in either myeloid or B cell malignancies. <italic>In vivo</italic> treatment with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 suppressed GNB1-induced signaling and markedly increased survival. In several human tumors, GNB1 mutations co-occurred with oncogenic kinase alterations, including BCR/ABL, JAK2 V617F and BRAF V600K. Co-expression of patient-derived GNB1 alleles with these mutant kinases resulted in inhibitor resistance in each context. Thus, GNB1 and GNB2 mutations confer transformed and resistance phenotypes across a range of human tumors and may be targetable with inhibitors of G protein signaling.</p>

    <p id="P2">Numerous somatic mutations are present in less than 5% of cases across multiple tumor types. To extensively catalog mutations in these âlong-tailâ genes<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> will require sequencing thousands of additional specimens from each tumor subset, a daunting challenge for rare malignancies<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. A fraction of mutations in long tail genes are gain-of-function and may represent tractable therapeutic targets, confer resistance to particular agents, or underlie so-called âexceptional responsesâ<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The timely identification of clinically actionable mutations is particularly pressing as focused sequencing panels to guide targeted therapeutics become widely utilized.</p>
    <p id="P3">To functionally interrogate tumors for gain-of-function alterations, we construct retroviral cDNA libraries from individual cancers and transduce them into cytokine-dependent cells, such as murine BaF3 cells that express BCL2 or MYC<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Oncogenic alleles of EGFR, FLT3, RAS, and ALK with single nucleotide, insertion/deletion, splice-variant, or gene fusion alterations, confer cytokine-independent growth. Proliferating clones are isolated and the integrated cDNA is sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">We constructed a cDNA library from a patientâs bone marrow infiltrated with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), an acute leukemia subtype with no obviously targetable driver oncogene<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, and transduced it into BaF3-BCL2 cells. Multiple distinct cytokine-independent clones harbored full-length GNB1 with a lysine to glutamic acid mutation at codon 89 (GNB1 K89E). We confirmed that GNB1 K89E also confers IL3-independent growth in BaF3-MYC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">GNB1 encodes a beta subunit (GÎ²) of heterotrimeric G proteins, which consist of GÎ±, GÎ² and GÎ³ components that mediate signaling downstream of G protein-coupled receptors<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Upon activation, heterotrimeric G proteins dissociate to form two functional molecules: the GTP-bound GÎ± monomer, and the GÎ²Î³ dimer, both of which bind and activate downstream effector proteins<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Gain-of-function mutations of GÎ± have been described in many cancers<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, oncogenic mutations in GÎ² have not been explored.</p>
    <p id="P6">We searched publically available databases, published reports, and our unpublished sequencing data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) to identify somatic mutations of GNB1 and the highly related family member GNB2. We identified amino acids recurrently mutated across multiple tumor types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). For example, GNB1 mutations were present in 3 (1.9%) of 157 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in one cohort<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and 5 (0.53%) of 944 cases of MDS in another cohort<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Different codon mutations clustered to some extent based on lineage. Most notably, all eleven GNB1 K57 mutations were in myeloid neoplasms compared with 1 of 8 GNB1 I80 mutations (p &lt; 0.001 by two-tailed Fisherâs exact test). The remaining seven I80 mutations were in B cell neoplasms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Multiple GNB1 alleles conferred cytokine-independent growth in IL3-dependent lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) or GM-CSF-dependent myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>

The most potent compounds (with 50% growth inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) &lt; 30nM) included a MEK inhibitor (GSK-1120212), catalytic site mTOR inhibitors (PP242, INK-128), and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (BEZ235, PI-103) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). K562 myeloid leukemia cells expressing GNB1 K89E have increased phosphorylation of targets of mTOR (AKT S473, NDRG1 T346, 4E-BP-1 T37/T46 and P70S6K T389) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 and the catalytic mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 suppressed phosphorylation of these substrates.

    <p id="P13">A recent screen in melanoma cells suggested that activation of G-protein-coupled receptors by overexpression confers resistance to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. We identified GNB2 K78E in a melanoma (MEL-JWCI-WGS-6)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> that harbored BRAF V600K. Expression of GNB2 K78E in A375 melanoma cells, which harbor BRAF V600E, conferred relative resistance to vemurafenib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). These findings raised the possibility that GÎ² mutations mediate resistance to a range of kinase inhibitors. We detected GNB1 K89E in a patient with BCR/ABL (p210)-rearranged B-ALL who had a poor response to ABL inhibitors. The ABL inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib suppressed BCR/ABL-dependent phosphorylation of STAT5 in K562 cells expressing GNB1 K89E but failed to suppress AKT/mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This was associated with relative resistance to nilotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In addition, BaF3 cells expressing BCR/ABL with GNB1 K89E, but not with wild-type GNB1, proliferated in the presence of nilotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>

    <p id="P15">In summary, oncogenic GÎ² mutations occur in multiple cancers, disrupt GÎ±-GÎ²Î³ interactions, activate canonical signaling downstream of G proteins, and confer resistance to targeted kinase inhibitors. Distinguishing these functionally relevant mutations from the long catalogs of somatic alterations was achieved by cDNA library screening, rather than next-generation sequencing. Like mutations in GÎ± subunits, different GÎ² mutations may cluster to some extent within cancer subtypes. Further research is needed to clarify whether differences in signaling downstream of these alleles contribute to context-dependent transformation.</p>

        <p id="P30">All animal experiments were performed with approval of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse bone marrow transplants were performed as previously described<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. In brief, female FVB mice 8â9 wk of age were lethally irradiated (5.5 Gy Ã 2 doses), and then transplanted with 10<sup>6</sup> donor bone marrow cells (injected i.v. into the tail vein in a total volume of 200 Î¼l PBS, pH 7.4) that had been transduced with pMSCV GNB1-IRES-GFP (wild-type or mutant) or empty pMSCV-GFP retrovirus. Donor bone marrow was from FVB mice that had or had not been treated 5 days prior with 150 mg kg<sup>â1</sup> 5-FU intraperitoneally. Animals were followed daily for signs of illness and when moribund were sacrificed and peripheral blood, bone marrow, and splenocytes were harvested for analysis and cryopreservation. For primary transplantation 10 mice were used per arm for 80% power to detect a 60% difference in survival at a specific time point with Î± of 0.05. No randomization or blinding was used, and no samples or animals were excluded. To test secondary transplantation, 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes from a primary leukemic mouse were injected intravenously into sublethally irradiated (5.5 Gy once) FVB wild-type recipients. For treatment trials, after secondary transplantation mice were randomized into treatment groups to receive vehicle or BEZ235 45 mg kg<sup>â1</sup> by oral gavage daily. Days of treatment for each experiment are detailed in figure legends.</p>

        <p id="P31">Flow cytometry to characterized myeloid dendritic cell neoplasms was performed as previously described<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Other flow cytometry antibodies included Annexin V (Thermo Fisher BDB550475), CD11b (Thermo Fisher BDB552850), CD11c (eBiosciences 47-0114-82), CD19 (Thermo Fisher BDB557835), B220 (Thermo Fisher BDB558108), CD43 (Thermo Fisher BDB561856), CD24 (Thermo Fisher BDB560536), BP-1 (eBiosciences 12-5891-82), IgM (eBiosciences 12-5890-82), and CD127 (Thermo Fisher 17-1271-82). Immunohistochemistry was performed in the Brigham and Womenâs histopathology core using a Leica Bone III Autostainer, with the following antibodies: GFP (Abcam ab6556), cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling 9664), Ki-67 (Vector VP-RM04), TdT (Dako A3524).</p>

        <title>Karyotyping</title>
        <p id="P32">Splenocytes harvested from moribund animals were placed in short-term culture in MarrowMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) medium for 24â72 hours. B cell leukemias were supplemented with PWM (pokeweed mitogen, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 10 Î¼g ml<sup>â1</sup> final concentration. Cultures were treated with colcemid (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) at a final concentration of 0.1 Î¼g ml<sup>â1</sup> for 3 hours, or 0.01 Î¼g ml<sup>â1</sup> for overnight exposure. Cells were then exposed to hypotonic 0.075 M KCl for 25 minutes at 37Â°C and fixed with 3:1 methanol:acetic acid. Air-dried slides were made and G-banded following standard GTG banding protocols. Twenty metaphase cells were counted for each successfully analyzed specimen, and 4â6 karyotypes prepared. For clarity, karyotype descriptions are given using ISCN 2013 nomenclature, developed for human but acceptable for mouse chromosome aberrations when whole arm changes are described (MGI Rules for Nomenclature of Chromosome Aberrations, revised Nov 2013; accessed Aug 2014 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/anomalies.shtml#nomenuse">http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/anomalies.shtml#nomenuse</ext-link>).</p>

        <p id="P33">BaF3 cells expressing vector, wild-type, or mutant GNB1 were interrogated against a panel containing graded concentrations of 116 small molecule inhibitors as previously described<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> (for full list of small-molecules, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). After three days, cell viability was assessed using a tetrazolium based MTS assay (CellTiter Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega). All cell viability values were normalized to the average of control wells containing no drug, and a second order polynomial curve fit was used to calculate IC50s for each agent.</p>

        <title>Mutant GÎ² proteins lose interaction with GÎ± subunits and induce activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways</title>
        <p>(a) Molecular representation of a heterotrimeric G protein (GÎ±: blue, GÎ²: red, GÎ³: yellow) based on a crystal structure (PDB ID 1GP2; DOI<bold>:</bold>10.2210/pdb1gp2/pdb)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Corresponding sites of multiple recurrent oncogenic mutations are indicated and side chains of the residues are shown in green. (b) Silver staining of anti-Flag immunoprecipitates (IP) from BaF3-MYC cells expressing wild-type GNB1 or GNB1 K89E. The band indicated by the arrow was analyzed by mass spectrometry and the three GÎ± subunits indicated were identified. (c) Unsupervised clustering analysis of proteins identified in TAP-MS analyses of GNB1, based on their relative association to wild-type and mutant GNB1. Combined extracts of SILAC-labeled TF-1 cells (Heavy: TF-1-Flag-HA-GNB1 mutants, Light: TF-1-Flag-HA-GNB1 WT) were used for tandem affinity purification (TAP) with Flag and HA antibodies followed by mass spectrometry. The ratio of wild type and mutant GNB1 in each TAP was used to normalize the abundance of all interacting proteins. Normalized abundance of G protein subunits and PDCL associated with mutant compared to wild type GNB1 is shown (red = more binding to mutant, blue = less binding to mutant compared to wild-type). (d) Western blotting of anti-Flag IP and whole cell lysates (WCL) from BaF3-MYC cells expressing GÎ² alleles. (e) GSEA plots of the indicated gene sets in TF-1 cells transduced with GNB1 K89E that were isolated 12 hours after GM-CSF withdrawal (K89E starved, n = 3) compared to the combined data from TF-1 cells transduced with empty vector that were isolated after GM-CSF withdrawal (n = 3) and either cell line without cytokine withdrawal (n = 3 each; total of n = 9 controls). (f) Heatmap of leading edge genes<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> in the AKT gene set from gene set enrichment analysis in TF-1 GNB1 K89E or empty vector-transduced cells with (+) or without (â) cytokine starvation. (g) Western blotting of TF-1 cells expressing GNB1 alleles or empty vector.</p>
