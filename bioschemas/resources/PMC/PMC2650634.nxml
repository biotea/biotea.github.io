      <abstract>
        <p>Recently, we have developed a vector-capping method for constructing a full-length cDNA library. In the present study, we performed in-depth analysis of the vector-capped cDNA library prepared from a single type of cell. As a result of single-pass sequencing analysis of 24Â 000 clones randomly isolated from the unamplified library, we identified 19Â 951 full-length cDNA clones whose intactness was confirmed by the presence of an additional G at their 5' end. The full-length cDNA content was &gt;95%. Mapping these sequences to the human genome, we identified 4513 transcriptional units that include 36 antisense transcripts against known genes. Comparison of the frequencies of abundant clones showed that the expression profiles of different libraries, including the distribution of transcriptional start sites (TSSs), were reproducible. The analysis of long-sized cDNAs showed that this library contained many cDNAs with a long-sized insert up to 11Â 199Â bp of golgin B, including multiple slicing variants for filamin A and filamin B. These results suggest that the size-unbiased full-length cDNA library constructed using the vector-capping method will be an ideal resource for fine expression profiling of transcriptional variants with alternative TSSs and alternative splicing.</p>

  <body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The Human Genome Project disclosed sequence information on an entire set of elements that construct and regulate each human cell, tissue, and organ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C3">3</xref></sup> Our next challenge is to decode the instructions encoded by three billion bases on the genome and to understand the molecular basis of human biology and pathology. In the last decade, post-sequencing projects have taken two approaches: (i) to collect an entire set of full-length transcripts (transcriptome) and in turn map them on the genome to identify their promoter region, and (ii) to compare the expression profiles of genes in different types of cells or tissues at different biological conditions. To achieve these purposes, many technologies have been developed: practical methods for synthesizing full-length cDNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C7">7</xref></sup> hybridization-based microarray,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C9">9</xref></sup> and tag-sequencing-based technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C14">14</xref></sup> for analyzing an expression profile.</p><p>Large-scale analyses using these technologies have produced an enormous amount of data on human full-length transcripts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C17">17</xref></sup> as well as on expression profiles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C20">20</xref></sup> and have revealed the following facts. (i) Multiple transcripts of different sizes are generated from the same gene locus by alternative promoter usage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C21">21</xref></sup> diverse transcriptional initiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C22">22</xref></sup> alternative splicing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C23">23</xref></sup> and alternative polyadenylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C24">24</xref></sup> (ii) There are an unexpectedly large amount of senseâantisense pairs of transcripts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C26">26</xref></sup> (iii) Many non-coding RNAs are transcribed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C16">16</xref></sup> (iv) A considerable amount of transcripts estimated by expressed sequence tags (EST) of the UniGene database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C27">27</xref></sup> or by genome tiling array<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C29">29</xref></sup> still remain to be annotated because of their low abundance.</p><p>These data sets were accumulated using diverse cell types or tissues, because the first phase of the project was aimed at comprehensive gene collection. Hereafter, a second phase of investigation requires in-depth analysis of transcripts in a single type of cell population to elucidate the intracellular transcriptional regulatory network in a given cell. However, the full-length cDNA libraries constructed using the conventional methods do not meet the requirements for in-depth analyses because of the low complexity of the constituents. Furthermore, the presence of transcriptional variants raises a serious problem regarding the use of the conventional method for expression profiling of genes. If multiple variants transcribed from the same gene locus have a different function, we need to determine the expression profile of each variant to elucidate their role in the regulation network. However, the conventional methods that measure the amount of the limited region of each transcript by counting the number of sequence tags or by quantifying the hybridization signal cannot distinguish these variants without the precedent information of the full sequence of all variants expressed in a given cell.</p><p>The two problems described above, the low complexity of the full-length cDNA library and the presence of multiple variants, can be solved by analyzing all variants that comprise a bias-free full-length cDNA library constructed from a single type of cell. Unfortunately, the conventional methods for synthesizing full-length cDNA were unsuitable for constructing a bias-free cDNA library that reflects an expression level of each transcript in the cell, because they have many processes during which the ratio of components may change. It is especially difficult to construct a bias-free library containing rare or long-sized full-length cDNA clones without changing their content.</p><p>Recently, we have developed the vector-capping (V-capping) method for synthesizing full-length cDNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C30">30</xref></sup> This method is expected to be suitable to construct a bias-free cDNA library, because it consists of only three steps: the first-strand cDNA synthesis using a vector primer, self-ligation of the cDNA-vector construct, and the replacement of mRNA by the second-strand cDNA. The previous paper showed that we were able to construct the cDNA libraries containing full-length cDNA clones of &gt;95% content without any selection procedure for full-length cDNAs. The further advantage of this library is that we can validate full-length cDNA by the presence of an additional G at its 5' end.</p><p>In this paper, we performed in-depth analysis of the cDNA libraries constructed using the V-capping method from the total RNA isolated from human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19, and demonstrated that the constructed library was useful as a starting resource not only for the comprehensive collection of full-length cDNA clones, but also for fine expression profile analysis of transcripts expressed in a single type of cell, including variants generated by alternative promoter usage, alternative transcriptional initiation, alternative splicing, and alternative polyadenylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Cell culture and RNA preparation</title><p>Human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell line ARPE-19 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).

Each library contained insert-free vectors (3.3â3.9% in content), which may result from uncut vectors escaping from removal during the vector primer preparation process.</p><table-wrap id="DSN010TB1" position="float"><label>TableÂ 1</label><caption><p>Summary of single-pass sequencing analysis of libraries</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Library Name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lib-1</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Lib-2</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clone Name</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ARe/ARf</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ARi</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ARiS</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">âVector</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">pKA1U5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">pGCAP10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">pGCAP10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>âEco</italic>RI cut</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 176</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6528</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7296</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">âUnreadable</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">940</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">340</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">588</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">âReadable</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9236</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6188</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6708</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ââInsert-free vector</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">305</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">244</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">221</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ââdT tail</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">177</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ââMitochondria</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">86</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">65</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">69</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">âârRNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ââcDNA insert</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8665</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5867</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6405</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">âââFull-length</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8275</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5586</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6090</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">âââTruncated</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">310</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">243</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">271</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">âââPoly(A)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">80</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">38</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">44</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Lib-1 contained clones carrying a dT tail at the 5' end (1.9% in content). Inspection of the downstream sequence of these clones showed that they lacked a poly(A) tail and contained the inversely inserted cDNA whose 5' end was joined to the <italic>Kpn</italic>I-cut end of the vector where the 3'-protruding bases were deleted. These clones may be generated by use of an aberrant vector primer that has a dT tail at the opposite end from the intended one, implying that the dT-tail addition to only one end of the vector plasmid occasionally occurred at the dT-tailing step with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Although the dT tail added to the opposite end should be removed by <italic>Eco</italic>RV digestion after the dT-tailing reaction, some must remain uncut. These clones starting with the dT tail could be removed by adding an <italic>Eco</italic>RI digestion step before self-ligation, as shown in the modified protocol. In fact, it worked so well that these artifacts drastically decreased to 0.16% in the ARi library and to 0.13% in the ARiS library.</p><p>The same mechanism can also explain the addition of a vector-derived sequence, ATCCTG in the case of using pKA1U5 as a vector primer, adjacent to the 5' end of â¼5% of cDNA clones isolated from Lib-1. In this case, the opposite end might not have been dT-tailed and in addition might have escaped from <italic>Eco</italic>RV digestion. Although the <italic>Eco</italic>RI digestion step in the modified protocol was expected to remove this kind of additional sequence, 2.8% of clones in Lib-2 still had a residual sequence (CGGCCGGCCGAT) derived from the vector sequence located between the <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Eco</italic>RV sites because of incomplete digestion with <italic>Eco</italic>RI.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><label>3.2.</label><title>Assessment of full-length cDNA</title><p>The 5'-terminal sequences of cDNA inserts were used for the database search. Clones having only poly(A) or the sequence of several bases with poly(A) were classified into a truncated cDNA, because these clones might be derived from degraded mRNA. The sequence similarity was searched against our custom human full-length cDNA database, the NCBI RefSeq database, and the human genome database using the BLAST algorithm. The libraries contained cDNA clones for mitochondria genome-derived transcripts (â¼1% of cDNA-carrying clones) and rRNA (&lt;0.06%). Except for mitochondrial clones, all sequences were able to map on the human genome.</p><p>Most of the full-length cDNA clones identified as a known gene have a transcriptional start site (TSS) near to that of RefSeq. However, some sequences did not match the 5'-terminal sequence of RefSeq, presumably because our cDNA had a longer 5' UTR than RefSeq or was transcribed by the usage of an alternative promoter. These sequences were mapped on the human genome and the location of the sequence was determined. If the query sequence was located near the upstream region of the first exon of RefSeq or could be linked to the RefSeq via other mRNA or EST sequences that partly shared the query sequence, the clone was assigned to the gene for the corresponding RefSeq even though there was no shared sequence between the query and RefSeq.</p><p>Consequently, 8275 clones from the ARe/ARf library, 5586 from ARi, and 6090 from ARiS were identified as a full-length cDNA. Most clones (93.6% for Lib-1, 92.3% for Lib-2) had an additional G or NG (N: T, TT, G, etc.) at their 5' end, which is a requisite for full-length cDNA starting from the cap site when using the V-capping method. The previous paper showed that some full-length cDNAs had no additional G.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C30">30</xref></sup> Thus, if the cDNA not having a 5'-end G started at the upstream region of the first exon of the known gene, it was admitted to be a full-length cDNA for the corresponding gene. Although some cDNAs contained a repetitive sequence such as an Alu repeat, they were also precisely mapped on the genome. Most of the truncated cDNAs existed as a short form with a poly(A) tail. Even such short cDNA was assigned to full-length when it was mapped to the region that was not a known gene locus and had an additional G at the 5' end. Consequently, the content of the full-length clone in all clones carrying a cDNA insert [including only a poly(A) insert] was calculated to be 95.5% for ARe/ARf, 95.2% for ARi, and 95.1% for ARiS.</p><p>Out of 19 951 full-length cDNA clones, 1123 clones (5.6%) lacked an additional 5'-end G. These 5'-G-free genes were classified into two groups. One group (625 clones) consisted of clones starting with a nucleotide A. Another group (309 clones) was a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5'-TOP) gene family that started with a pyrimidine-rich sequence, including predominantly ribosomal proteins. The genes that contained more than three 5'-G-free clones (G â ) with the same TSS were listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn010/DC1">Supplementary TableÂ 1</ext-link>. It should be noted that G-added clones (G + ) corresponding to each Gâ clone were obtained except for NDUFB11. The content of Gâ clones was 0.04â0.31 for 16 kinds of 5'-TOP genes. On the other hand, the Gâ content for 12 out of 15 A-starting genes was 0.38â1.0, higher than for 5'-TOP genes. Although we could not find any conserved sequence in the 5' end of the G-free A-starting genes, the following finding suggests that the 5'-end sequence affected the addition or elimination of a cap structure. We obtained 82 clones starting with 5'-ACCACGCACGâ¦ for MT2A, out of which 44 had an additional G and 38 were G-free as shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn010/DC1">Supplementary TableÂ 1</ext-link>. In addition, we obtained 43 clones starting with the fourth nucleotide A of the previous MT2A clone, i.e. 5'-ACGCACGâ¦. Interestingly, all 43 clones had an additional G, suggesting that the presence of 5'-end three-nucleotide sequence resulted in the production of G-free clones.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><label>3.3.</label><title>Gene annotation</title><p>Mapping a total of 19 951 full-length cDNA sequences to the genome revealed that they were classified into 4513 kinds of transcriptional units (i.e. genes), of which 4370 (96.8%) were included in Entrez Gene.

This success may be attributed to the following reasons. (i) Total RNA was used as a template without purifying poly(A) RNA. (ii) The protocol of cDNA synthesis did not include an intact mRNA selection process such as modification of the cap structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C6">6</xref></sup> These purification and modification processes might cause mRNA degradation. (iii) A small amount of mRNA was used as a template for reverse transcription. When a large amount of mRNA is used, the synthesis of short abundant cDNAs may consume reverse transcriptase and nucleotide substrates, and rare or long-sized cDNA synthesis may be suppressed. (iv) Size fractionation of cDNAs was not carried out. (v) Restriction enzyme digestion of cDNA was not included. (vi) PCR amplification was not used. (vii) Insertion of cDNA into a small-sized vector of 3.4 kb was done by self-ligation. One conceivable size bias may result from incomplete extension of the first-strand cDNA synthesized from a long-sized mRNA template. The presence of GOLB1 cDNA with an 11.2 kb insert and multiple FLNA cDNAs with an 8.2 kb insert suggested that the termination of reverse transcriptase was not problematic under the present conditions.</p><p>The present analysis also revealed that the full-length content was unexpectedly high despite lacking a full-length selection process. The full-length content of abundant transcripts was 94.0â100%. The most probable explanation for this high content is that most mRNA molecules are intact in the cell. However, the degradation of mRNA, especially long-sized mRNA, seemed to occur during the RNA isolation process. The overall full-length content was 95%, and analysis of the remaining 5% incomplete cDNAs showed that â¼10% of them were derived from the degradation product of the long-sized mRNA of &gt;6 kb (data not shown). Although a size bias due to RNA degradation during the course of its isolation is inevitable, this method can faithfully reflect the composition of a given purified RNA sample.</p><p>The high full-length content and size-unbiased feature of the library enabled us to determine the fine distribution of TSS of genes expressed in a single type of cell. Recently, methods such as CAGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C12">12</xref></sup> or 5'SAGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C13">13</xref></sup> have been developed to determine the distribution of TSS. For these analyses, a vector-capped library prepared using a modified vector primer for CAGE or 5'SAGE analysis can serve as a starting material. The additional G at the 5' end could ensure the intactness of TSS and provide more precise results.</p><p>The vector-capped cDNA library also enabled us to analyze the presence of a cap structure at the 5' end of mRNA. The large-scale TSS analysis revealed that a small part of full-length clones lacked an additional 5'-end G, indicating the absence of the cap structure of the mRNA. The common feature of the 5'-end sequence of these clones was a pyrimidine-rich sequence or A-starting sequence. Further in-depth analysis of G-free clones suggested that the 5'-end sequence affected the addition or elimination of the cap structure. This finding may partially be explained by the recent results that human decapping enzyme Dcp2 preferentially binds to a subset of mRNAs and identifies sequences at the 5' terminus of the mRNA as a specific substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C47">47</xref></sup> Further investigation is required to elucidate the mechanism of the cap-free mRNA generation observed in the present study and its biological meaning.</p><p>We identified 4513 kinds of genes out of 19 951 full-length clones isolated from unamplified ARPE-19 cDNA libraries. The total number of genes consisting of the present library was estimated to be 8000â14 000, which is consistent with â¼10 000 estimated for the transcriptome of RPE using UniGene clusters, SAGE tags and ESTs by Swaroop and Zack.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C48">48</xref></sup> The expression profile analyses using a microarray with 12 600 gene probes identified 5634 Â± 65 genes for ARPE-19 and 5580 Â± 84 genes for human RPE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C49">49</xref></sup> These results suggest the low expression level of unidentified genes that may include non-coding and antisense genes. In order to obtain the remaining rare genes, further large-scale analyses in combination with subtraction/normalization are required.</p><p>Recent investigations have shown that an unexpectedly large amount of alternative splicing variants exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C23">23</xref></sup> and that some variants were expressed in a cell-specific manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C50">50</xref></sup> In order to analyze a transcriptional network in a single type of cell, it is necessary to measure the expression levels of these variants. When alternative splicing occurs at the multiple sites, it is difficult to quantify each variant by the RTâPCR method, which measures only the expression level of a limited region of mRNA. The most precise method for determining the expression level of a splicing variant is to count the number of full-length cDNA clones for each variant. This is a particular requirement for long-sized full-length transcripts. The present study demonstrated that multiple splicing variants for long-sized genes such as FLNA and FLNB were expressed in a single type of cell and that the V-capping method was able to provide unique genuine full-length cDNA to each variant. The physiological role of each variant remains to be solved.</p><p>One of the characteristics of the V-capping method is the use of a vector primer with a relatively long dT tail, which has the following merits compared with the use of an oligo dT primer by conventional methods: (i) the unidirectional insertion of the cDNA is guaranteed and makes it easy to identify an antisense transcript against the known gene; (ii) it does not prime a short A-stretch in the mRNA, not generating 3'-truncated cDNAs that were occasionally observed in the RefSeq database (e.g. N4BP2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSN010TB2">TableÂ 2</xref>). However, we should keep in mind the possibility that the vector primer could fail to capture mRNA with a short poly(A) tail.</p><p>The remaining challenge to analyzing the vector-capped cDNA library is to develop a method for high-throughput single-pass sequencing. When we intend to analyze &gt;100 000 clones, the present single-pass sequencing strategy is not realistic because of high cost and because of the amount of work involved. However, considering that the analysis of the present high-quality full-length cDNA library is expected to enable discovery of rare or long-sized full-length cDNA clones and fine expression profiling of various variants, it makes sense to analyze more than a million clones corresponding to total clones composed of one library. Thus, developing a novel method for massive single-pass sequencing is desired, for example, by applying recently developed technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C51">51</xref></sup> Furthermore, in order to achieve a comprehensive collection of full-length transcripts, the removal of abundant clones should be carried out by subtraction.</p><p>In conclusion, a full-length cDNA library constructed with the V-capping method has been shown to meet requirements for a size-unbiased library, and thus is expected to be suitable for the comprehensive collection of full-length transcripts and their fine expression profiling. Recently, Miura et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C52">52</xref></sup> analyzed full-length cDNA libraries constructed from budding yeast using the V-capping method and identified novel full-length transcripts, including splicing variants and antisense transcripts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN010C52">52</xref></sup> Even for well-characterized organisms such as yeast, in-depth analysis of the vector-capped cDNA library has been shown to still bring discovery of novel full-length transcripts. To analyze the transcriptome of not only uncharacterized organisms but also well-characterized ones such as human and mouse, the V-capping method will become the first choice for constructing a full-length cDNA library.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn010/DC1">Supplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was partly supported by a grant for the Genome Network Project from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.
