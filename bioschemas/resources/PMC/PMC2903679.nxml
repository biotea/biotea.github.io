        <p>Arrestin-2 interacts with ESCRT-0 proteins STAM-1 and HRS to control the amount of chemokine receptor CXCR4 targeted into the degradative pathway by regulating the ubiquitination status of HRS.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The chemokine receptor CXCR4, a G protein-coupled receptor, is targeted for lysosomal degradation via a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism that involves the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. We have reported recently that arrestin-2 also targets CXCR4 for lysosomal degradation; however, the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that arrestin-2 interacts with ESCRT-0, a protein complex that recognizes and sorts ubiquitinated cargo into the degradative pathway. Signal-transducing adaptor molecule (STAM)-1, but not related STAM-2, interacts directly with arrestin-2 and colocalizes with CXCR4 on early endosomal antigen 1-positive early endosomes. Depletion of STAM-1 by RNA interference and disruption of the arrestin-2/STAM-1 interaction accelerates agonist promoted degradation of CXCR4, suggesting that STAM-1 via its interaction with arrestin-2 negatively regulates CXCR4 endosomal sorting. Interestingly, disruption of this interaction blocks agonist promoted ubiquitination of hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) but not CXCR4 and STAM-1 ubiquitination. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby arrestin-2 via its interaction with STAM-1 modulates CXCR4 sorting by regulating the ubiquitination status of HRS.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The chemokine receptor CXCR4, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), upon activation by its cognate ligand stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1Î± (CXCL12) is rapidly internalized and targeted into the degradative pathway by a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Marchese and Benovic, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marchese <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Activation by CXCL12 induces rapid and transient phosphorylation of serine residues 324 and 325 within the carboxy-terminal tail (C-tail) of CXCR4, thereby promoting binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase atrophin-1âinteracting protein (AIP)4 via a novel WW-domainâmediated interaction culminating in ubiquitination of vicinal lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marchese <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bhandari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This is followed by internalization of CXCR4 onto early endosomes where the ubiquitin moiety serves as a sorting signal to direct the receptor to lysosomes for proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Marchese and Benovic, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marchese <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In general, the ubiquitin moiety on ubiquitinated receptors interacts with ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs) found in several proteins of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Shields <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The ESCRT machinery consists of four distinct protein complexes (ESCRT 0âIII) that act in a sequential and a coordinated manner to target ubiquitinated receptors into multivesicular bodies, which then fuse with lysosomes where degradation occurs. Recruitment into this pathway takes place by the initial recognition of the ubiquitinated receptor by ESCRT-0, which then subsequently recruits ESCRT-I to the endosomal membrane, followed by recruitment of ESCRT II and III, culminating in proper execution of the sorting process (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Williams and Urbe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009</xref>). Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) is a critical element of ESCRT-0 and has been shown to mediate down-regulation of several cell surface signaling receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bache <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kanazawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Abella <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Hasdemir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), including CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marchese <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The ubiquitin moiety on CXCR4 is thought to interact with the ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM) found in HRS, thereby targeting CXCR4 into the degradative pathway.</p><p>Together with HRS, signal-transducing adaptor molecule (STAM) forms ESCRT-0. STAM was originally identified as an adaptor protein involved in cytokine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Takeshita <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1997</xref>). Two STAM isoforms exist, STAM-1 and STAM-2, which share 53% amino acid identity and may be redundant in their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Lohi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Endo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Pandey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Yamada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Similar to HRS, STAM also binds to ubiquitin and may act in concert with HRS to recruit ubiquitinated receptors for lysosomal sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Asao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Takata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bache <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kanazawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). STAMs also may modulate endosomal sorting by virtue of their ability to interact with endosomal associated deubiquitinating enzymes AMSH and UBPY, which may modulate the ubiquitination status of both receptors and/or the sorting machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">McCullough <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bowers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Row <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Kong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Recently, STAMs have been implicated in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking, possibly via their interaction with coat protein II proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Rismanchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, to our knowledge, their role in GPCR trafficking and signaling remains relatively unknown.</p><p>We have recently shown that arrestin-2 mediates endosomal sorting of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bhandari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Nonvisual arrestins, arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 (a.k.a. Î²-arrestin1 and Î²-arrestin2, respectively), are generally known for their ability to regulate GPCR desensitization, internalization, and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), although their role in endosomal sorting remains relatively unexplored. Arrestin-2 interacts with and colocalizes with AIP4 on early endosomes, where it targets CXCR4 for lysosomal sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bhandari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In addition to mediating ubiquitination of CXCR4 at the plasma membrane, AIP4 also interacts with and mediates ubiquitination of HRS, probably on endosomes; however, the function of the ubiquitin moiety remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marchese <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). How arrestin-2 integrates with AIP4 and HRS to carry out CXCR4 sorting into the degradative pathway remains poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we show that arrestin-2 interacts with ESCRT-0 via a direct interaction with STAM-1. Disruption of this interaction attenuates CXCR4 mediated ubiquitination of HRS and accelerates CXCR4 degradation, suggesting that the arrestin-2/STAM-1 complex negatively regulates CXCR4 lysosomal sorting via ubiquitination of HRS. This study provides novel mechanistic insight into the role that arrestin-2 has on targeting CXCR4 into the degradative pathway and furthers our understanding of the complex molecular events that mediate endosomal sorting of GPCRs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Reagents</title><p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (Microbix, Toronto, ON, Canada) and HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone Laboratories).

To gain mechanistic insight into this process, we initially examined whether arrestin-2 interacts with ESCRT-0 by determining whether it binds to HRS, STAM-1, or STAM-2. To address this, cell lysates prepared from HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged STAM-1, STAM-2, or HRS were incubated with bacterially purified GST-arrestin-2 and GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose resin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, arrestin-2 bound to STAM-1 and HRS but only weakly to STAM-2. To rule out the possibility of an intermediate protein mediating the interaction with STAM-1, similar experiments were performed using purified arrestin-2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, GST-STAM-1, but not GST-STAM-2 and GST, bound to purified arrestin-2, indicating that the interaction between arrestin-2 and STAM-1 is direct and confirming that arrestin-2 binds poorly to STAM-2. To determine whether arrestin-2 associates with ESCRT-0 in cells, HA-arrestin-2, HA-arrestin-3, or empty vector (pcDNA3) were transfected into HeLa cells followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting to detect the presence of endogenous STAM-1 and HRS. Both STAM-1 and HRS were detected in the immunoprecipitates from cells expressing HA-arrestin-2, suggesting that arrestin-2 associates with HRS and STAM-1 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), whereas HRS, but not STAM-1, was detected in the HA-arrestin-3 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Similarly, endogenous arrestins also coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous STAM-1 and HRS in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Together, these data show that the interaction between STAM-1 and nonvisual arrestins is limited to arrestin-2 and that HRS interacts with both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3. In addition, our data suggest that arrestin-2 exists in complex with a subpopulation of ESCRT-0 that includes STAM-1 and HRS but not STAM-2.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Arrestin-2 interacts with ESCRT-0.

HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-CXCR4 were transfected with control or STAM-1 siRNA, followed by treatment with CXCL12 (30 nM) for 3 h, and receptor degradation was assessed by immunoblot analysis, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marchese <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, siRNA-mediated depletion of STAM-1 lead to a moderate, but statistically significant, increase in CXCR4 degradation, compared with control siRNA-treated cells, suggesting that STAM-1 negatively regulates agonist promoted degradation of CXCR4. As the amount of receptor that is degraded is in part a function of the rate of receptor internalization and recycling, we also examined the effect of depleting STAM-1 on CXCR4 internalization and recycling. Cell surface FLAG-tagged CXCR4 was labeled with the M1 anti-FLAG antibody on ice in the presence of 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, because the M1 antibody binds to the FLAG epitope in a calcium-dependent manner. Cells were washed to remove unbound antibody, and the media were replaced with DMEM containing CXCL12 (30 nM) in the continued presence of 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and placed at 37Â°C for 45 min to allow for internalization of the M1/CXCR4 complexes to take place. Antibody remaining on the surface, mostly representing uninternalized receptor, was removed by incubating cells with PBS containing EDTA (0.04%), a calcium-chelating agent. The amount of antibody (i.e., receptor) that recycled back to the cell surface was quantified by cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in parallel wells that were incubated at 37Â°C for 30 and 60 min. In control siRNA treated cells, â¼20% of internalized CXCR4 recycled back to the cell surface after 30 and 60 min, similar to what we observed in STAM-1âdepleted cells, suggesting that STAM-1 depletion had no effect on recycling of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). In addition, agonist-promoted internalization of CXCR4 was similar in STAM-1âdepleted cells, compared with control siRNA-treated cells, suggesting that STAM-1 is not involved in CXCR4 internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). We also examined the role of AMSH on agonist promoted degradation of CXCR4. AMSH is a deubiquitinating enzyme that interacts with STAM-1 and negatively regulates endosomal sorting of the EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">McCullough <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, siRNA-mediated depletion of AMSH did not effect agonist promoted degradation of CXCR4 in HeLa cells, suggesting that AMSH does not regulate endosomal sorting of activated CXCR4. However, CXCR4 levels were elevated in vehicle treated cells transfected with AMSH siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D), suggesting that AMSH may regulate degradation of constitutively internalized CXCR4, similar to what has been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Sierra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).

To gain insight into the function of the arrestin-2/STAM-1 interaction on CXCR4 trafficking, we initially set out to determine the mechanism of the interaction. To accomplish this we mapped the arrestin-2 binding region on STAM-1 by truncation mutagenesis. STAMs contain multiple domains, characterized by the presence of an amino-terminal Vps27, Hrs, STAM homology (VHS) domain, UIM, SH3 (Src homology) domain, immunoreceptor based tyrosine activation motif (ITAM), and a GGA and TOM1 homologous (GAT) domain that partially overlaps with the ITAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Prag <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). We created several STAM-1 N-terminal and C-terminal truncation mutants, according to its domain organization, tagged with the FLAG epitope on the amino-terminal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).

Remarkably, expression of the GAT domain significantly accelerated CXCR4 degradation after agonist treatment as compared with empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, B and C). Together, these data suggest that the STAM-1/arrestin-2 interaction negatively regulates CXCR4 sorting to lysosomes. Because the STAM-1 GAT domain has been shown recently to bind to HRS and is predicted to be required for the assembly of ESCRT-0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), it is conceivable that arrestin-2 binding to STAM-1 displaces its interaction with HRS and promotes disassembly of ESCRT-0, which somehow negatively regulates the amount of CXCR4 that is targeted for lysosomal degradation.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Expression of the GAT domain disrupts the arrestin-2/STAM-1 interaction and accelerates CXCR4 degradation.

Both the N- and C-terminal regions of arrestin-2 bound to GST-STAM1, but not GST, although binding to the N-terminal region seemed to be stronger, suggesting that it represented the main binding region. Further deletion of this region revealed that the STAM-1 binding site on arrestin-2 is between amino acid residues 1â161 (Supplemental Figure S2B). We next determined whether expression of this region as a minigene in cells also disrupted the arrestin-2/STAM-1 interaction. However, when expressed in cells the arrestin-2-(1-161) minigene completely blocked CXCR4 degradation (data not shown). The N-terminal lysine residues within arrestin-2 are predicted to serve as phosphosensors and recognize phosphates attached to receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Kern <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), analogous to what has been observed for arrestin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Vishnivetskiy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>); therefore, the arrestin-2-(1-161) construct may bind to CXCR4 and have a dominant-negative effect on CXCR4 internalization. To rule out any effects at the level of internalization, the first 24 amino acids from the N terminus of arrestin-2 were deleted to create arrestin-2-(25-161), and we initially tested the ability of this mutant to bind to STAM-1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, GST fused to arrestin-2-(25-161), but not GST alone, efficiently bound to FLAG-STAM-1 expressed in cells. A FLAG-tagged construct of arrestin-2-(25-161) when expressed in HEK293 cells also bound to GST-STAM-1-GAT, suggesting that the STAM-1/GAT domain binding site on arrestin-2 is located between amino acid residues 25-161 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). We next examined whether expression of arrestin-2-(25-161) disrupted the STAM-1/arrestin-2 interaction and modulated CXCR4 degradation. Expression of FLAG-arrestin-2-(25-161) markedly disrupted the interaction between arrestin-2 and STAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A) and significantly accelerated agonist promoted degradation of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, B and C), similar to what was observed with the STAM-1 GAT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Together these data further indicate that the interaction between STAM-1 and arrestin-2 attenuates CXCR4 trafficking into the degradative pathway.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Mapping of the STAM-1 binding domain on arrestin-2.

Therefore, one possibility is that the STAM-1/arrestin-2 interaction modulates the ubiquitination status of CXCR4 and STAM-1, thereby facilitating CXCR4 trafficking into the degradative pathway. To examine this possibility we examined the effect of expressing the GAT domain on the ubiquitination status of both CXCR4 and STAM-1. Surprisingly, expression of the GAT, compared with empty vector, did not significantly change the ubiquitination status of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A) and STAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B), suggesting that the STAM-1/arrestin-2 interaction does not regulate their ubiquitination status. In sharp contrast, expression of the GAT domain blocked CXCR4 mediated ubiquitination of HRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C). Therefore, together our data show that the STAM-1/arrestin-2 interaction is critical for modulating ubiquitination of HRS, which is probably important for regulating sorting of CXCR4 into the degradative pathway.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Disrupting the STAM-1/arrestin-2 interaction inhibits HRS ubiquitination but does not effect on CXCR4 and STAM-1 ubiquitination.

We have reported recently that arrestin-2 interacts with AIP4 and mediates endosomal sorting of CXCR4 into the degradative pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bhandari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Here, we extend these findings and provide further mechanistic insight into this unprecedented role of arrestin-2. Our data suggest that arrestin-2 mediates multiple interactions with ESCRT-0 on early endosomes, serving to regulate the amount of CXCR4 that is degraded. Arrestin-2 probably links ubiquitinated CXCR4 to ESCRT-0 via an initial interaction with HRS and/or STAM-1. Interestingly, our data reveal that the arrestin-2 interaction with STAM-1 is important for regulating ubiquitination of HRS, which we propose attenuates HRS sorting function, thereby controlling the extent to which CXCR4 is degraded (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism for the role of the STAM-1/arrestin-2 complex in endosomal sorting of CXCR4. CXCR4 is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 at the plasma membrane, after which it is internalized onto early endosomes, although ubiquitination is not required for this process. Once on endosomes ubiquitinated CXCR4 is recognized by HRS, likely by an interaction involving the ubiquitin moiety (red) on CXCR4 and the UIM of HRS, and possibly via an interaction with arrestin-2. Arrestin-2 then interacts with STAM-1, which serves to recruit AIP4 culminating in the ubiquitination of HRS. We speculate that this triggers a conformational change in HRS induced by an interaction between the ubiquitin moiety (blue) and the internal UIM. CXCR4 is subsequently committed to downstream interactions with ESCRT-I-III, whereas arrestin-2, STAM-1, AIP4, and autoinhibited HRS are recycled such that another round of sorting can take place.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zmk0141095160010"/></fig><p>We used truncation mutagenesis to narrow the arrestin-2 binding region on STAM-1 to the GAT domain and the STAM-1 binding region on arrestin-2 to amino acid residues 25-161. Expression of both of these domains similarly disrupted the arrestin-2/STAM-1 interaction and enhanced agonist promoted degradation of CXCR4. Our data are consistent with the notion that the STAM-1/arrestin-2 interaction negatively regulates sorting of CXCR4 into the degradative pathway. This interaction may be specific to modulating CXCR4 and/or GPCR sorting as EGFR degradation was not altered by expression of the STAM-1 GAT domain and arrestin-2-(25-161) (Supplemental Figure S3). Depletion of STAM-1 by siRNA also enhanced CXCR4 degradation further revealing that STAM-1 negatively regulates CXCR4 endosomal sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, we have shown previously that arrestin-2 promotes CXCR4 sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bhandari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and when considered with our present data indicate that arrestin-2 has opposing effects on CXCR4 degradation. This suggests that arrestin-2 probably acts at multiple steps in the sorting process and may initially act upstream of STAM-1 to positively regulate sorting of CXCR4 into the degradative pathway. Arrestin-2 interacts with the C-tail of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Busillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>); therefore, it is possible that arrestin-2 binds to CXCR4 on endosomes in order to recruit CXCR4 to ESCRT-0, possibly through an interaction with either HRS and/or STAM-1. This is consistent with our data that shows that arrestin-2 colocalizes with CXCR4 and STAM-1 on early endosomes upon agonist activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study found that Rim8, a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> molecule distantly related to mammalian arrestins, may function to directly recruit a putative 7TM receptor to the ESCRT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Herrador <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). After arrestin-2 initially directs CXCR4 to ESCRT-0, this is probably followed by an interaction with STAM-1 to attenuate CXCR4 degradation. Therefore, our data are consistent with a model in which arrestin-2 influences CXCR4 sorting positively and negatively, and it is a balance of these two activities that dictates the extent to which CXCR4 is degraded.</p><p>How does STAM-1 mediate the negative action of arrestin-2 on CXCR4 degradation? Because ubiquitination of HRS is markedly reduced by expression of the GAT domain, it is likely that STAM-1 via its interaction with arrestin-2 regulates the ubiquitination status of HRS to control CXCR4 degradation. This suggests that CXCR4 promoted ubiquitination of HRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marchese <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) attenuates its sorting activity. HRS contains a UIM that is thought to bind to ubiquitin moieties on cargo to recruit them into the degradative pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Hirano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, monoubiquitination of UBD containing proteins is thought to induce an intramolecular interaction between the ubiquitin moiety and the internal UBD, which in a protein such as HRS may induce an autoinhibitory conformation such that it can no longer bind to ubiquitin moieties on cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Hoeller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Because HRS ubiquitination is reduced by expression of the GAT domain, a loss of autoinhibition probably enhances its sorting function culminating in enhanced degradation of CXCR4. Therefore, CXCR4 promoted ubiquitination of HRS may occur once HRS has completed its sorting function and CXCR4 has been committed to downstream elements of the degradative pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>How does arrestin-2/STAM-1 regulate the ubiquitination status of HRS? We have shown previously that arrestin-2 interacts with AIP4 to regulate endosomal sorting of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bhandari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and that AIP4 mediates agonist promoted ubiquitination of HRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marchese <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that arrestin-2 together with STAM-1 may serve to bridge AIP4 and HRS to facilitate HRS ubiquitination by AIP4. This is consistent with our data that show that expression of arrestin-2-(25-161) also displaces HRS binding to arrestin-2/STAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Alternatively, the arrestin-2/STAM-1 complex may regulate HRS deubiquitination. STAM has been shown to interact with deubiquitinating enzymes, such as AMSH and UBPY, which have been shown to regulate the ubiquitination status of cargo (e.g., EGFR, protease activated receptor 2) and/or of STAM itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">McCullough <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Row <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Hasdemir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, the arrestin-2/STAM-1 complex does not seem to modulate the ubiquitination status of CXCR4 and nor of STAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). In addition, depletion of AMSH did not affect agonist promoted degradation of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D), suggesting that it may not be linked to this process, although it does not exclude the possibility that other DUBs may be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Row <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Shenoy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, our data are consistent with the notion that the arrestin-2/STAM-1 complex mediates ubiquitination of HRS probably via AIP4.</p><p>Interestingly, STAM-2 seems to be excluded from endosomal sorting of CXCR4 because arrestin-2 binds selectively to STAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). This suggests that CXCR4 sorting is restricted to ESCRT-0 complexes that contain STAM-1 but not STAM-2. We also observed that activation of CXCR4 selectively enhances STAM-1 ubiquitination over STAM-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), further supporting the selectivity of STAM-1 toward CXCR4. However, the arrestin-2/STAM-1 interaction may not be linked to STAM-1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). Presently, the function of STAM-1 ubiquitination on CXCR4 trafficking remains unknown, although it is possible that it may have a role in some other aspect of CXCR4-related functions. Polyubiquitination of STAM has been linked to its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Row <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>); however, it is doubtful that CXCR4 regulates STAM-1 stability because we did not observe any differences in STAM-1 levels in cells treated with CXCL12 (data not shown).</p><p>In summary, our study provides novel mechanistic insight into the role of arrestin-2 in endosomal sorting of CXCR4 via multiple interactions with ESCRT-0. We reveal here that via an interaction with STAM-1, arrestin-2 serves as an adaptor to regulate endosomal ubiquitination events that are critical for regulating sorting of ubiquitinated CXCR4 into the degradative pathway, thereby controlling the amount of CXCR4 that is degraded.</p></sec>
