        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>Nek2 has been implicated in centrosome disjunction at the onset of mitosis to promote bipolar spindle formation, and hyperactivation of Nek2 leads to the premature centrosome separation. Its activity, therefore, needs to be strictly regulated. In this study, we report that Cep85, an uncharacterized centrosomal protein, acts as a binding partner of Nek2A. It colocalizes with isoform A of Nek2 (Nek2A) at centrosomes and forms a granule meshwork enveloping the proximal ends of centrioles. Opposite to the effects of Nek2A, overexpression of Cep85 in conjunction with inhibition of the motor protein Eg5 (also known as KIF11) leads to the failure of centrosome disjunction. By contrast, depletion of Cep85 results in the precocious centrosome separation. We also define the Nek2A binding and centrosome localization domains within Cep85. Although the Nek2A-binding domain alone is sufficient to inhibit Nek2A kinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, both domains are indispensable for full suppression of centrosome disjunction in cells. Thus, we propose that Cep85 is a bona fide Nek2A-binding partner that surrounds the proximal ends of centrioles where it cooperates with PP1Î³ (also known as PPP1CC) to antagonize Nek2A activity in order to maintain the centrosome integrity in interphase in mammalian cells.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The centrosome is an organelle that serves as the main microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) to promote bipolar spindle formation and timely mitotic progression (<xref rid="JCS171637C3" ref-type="bibr">Bornens, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C31" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>). It consists of a pair of centrioles and a surrounding protein meshwork called pericentriolar material (<xref rid="JCS171637C4" ref-type="bibr">Bornens et al., 1987</xref>). Highly reminiscent of DNA replication, the centrosome duplicates once per cell cycle (<xref rid="JCS171637C30" ref-type="bibr">Nigg, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C35" ref-type="bibr">Tsou and Stearns, 2006</xref>). Following cytokinesis, a single centrosome is replicated during S phase, separated in G2/M phase and pulled to the spindle poles at the onset of mitosis (<xref rid="JCS171637C2" ref-type="bibr">Bettencourt-Dias and Glover, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C23" ref-type="bibr">Mardin and Schiebel, 2012</xref>). In interphase, the two centrioles in one centrosome are connected by a proteinaceous linker comprising centrosomal Nek2-associated protein 1 (C-Nap1, also known as CEP250), rootletin and LRRC45 (<xref rid="JCS171637C1" ref-type="bibr">Bahe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C11" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al., 1998a</xref><xref rid="JCS171637C10" ref-type="bibr">, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C19" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2013</xref>). C-Nap1 localizes at the proximal ends of the centriole and is considered to act as a docking site for rootletin and LRRC45. Both rootletin and LRRC45 interact and form a fiber-like structure to link the pair of centrioles (<xref rid="JCS171637C19" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2013</xref>). This intercentriole linkage needs to be dissolved before mitosis to allow bipolar spindle formation. Multiple kinases have been demonstrated to be involved in this procedure, including cyclin B2 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) (<xref rid="JCS171637C29" ref-type="bibr">Nam and van Deursen, 2014</xref>), Aurora-A (<xref rid="JCS171637C33" ref-type="bibr">Pugacheva and Golemis, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C36" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>), Polo-like kinases (Plks) (<xref rid="JCS171637C13" ref-type="bibr">Glover et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C25" ref-type="bibr">Mardin et al., 2011</xref>), and NIMA (never in mitosis A)-related kinase 2 (Nek2) (<xref rid="JCS171637C12" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al., 1998b</xref>). Among them, Nek2A has been shown to be the main kinase directly responsible for the phosphorylation and dissolution of the linker proteins.</p><p>Nek2, a member of the NIMA-related kinase (Nek) family of serine/threonine protein kinases, has three splicing isoforms, Nek2A, Nek2B and Nek2C (<xref rid="JCS171637C9" ref-type="bibr">Fry, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C32" ref-type="bibr">O'Regan et al., 2007</xref>). Depending on whether there is a nuclear localization sequence on their C-termini, they are differentially distributed in cells. Nek2A is located within the nucleus and cytoplasm, Nek2B is mainly cytoplasmic, and Nek2C is predominantly nuclear (<xref rid="JCS171637C15" ref-type="bibr">Hames and Fry, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C32" ref-type="bibr">O'Regan et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, Nek2A and Nek2B exhibit distinct cell-cycle-dependent expression patterns. Both are very low in G1, rise significantly at the G1/S transition and remain high throughout S and G2 phase (<xref rid="JCS171637C15" ref-type="bibr">Hames and Fry, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C16" ref-type="bibr">Hames et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C17" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike Nek2B, which remains at about the same level as in G2, Nek2A is degraded rapidly at the onset of mitosis owing to anaphase promoting complex (APC)-mediated ubiquitylation (<xref rid="JCS171637C16" ref-type="bibr">Hames et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C17" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, Nek2A is not required for mitotic entry in human cells, but does function at the G2/M transition to phosphorylate the linker proteins, such as C-Nap1, rootletin and LRRC45 (<xref rid="JCS171637C19" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C23" ref-type="bibr">Mardin and Schiebel, 2012</xref>). Phosphorylation leads to dissolution of linker and, eventually, separation of centrosomes. It is well known that hyperactivation of Nek2 results in the premature separation of centrosomes in interphase (<xref rid="JCS171637C8" ref-type="bibr">Faragher and Fry, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C12" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C23" ref-type="bibr">Mardin and Schiebel, 2012</xref>). As Nek2A protein levels remain high in the S to G2 phase, there must be some mechanisms by which Nek2A activity at centrosomes remains low in interphase to prevent centrosome disjunction but high at the G2/M transition to promote centrosome disjunction.</p><p>Nek2A activity at the centrosome is subject to both positive and negative regulation. At the G2/M transition, Hippo pathway components and cell-cycle-dependent kinase Plk1 have been reported to be involved in the elevation of Nek2A activity at centrosomes. Two Hippo pathway components, the mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 2 (Mst2, also known as STK3) and the scaffold protein Salvador (Sav1), directly interact with Nek2A and enhance its centrosomal accumulation so that it can phosphorylate C-Nap1 and rootletin, thereby facilitating centrosome disjunction in conjunction with the kinesin-5 motor protein Eg5 (also known as KIF11) (<xref rid="JCS171637C24" ref-type="bibr">Mardin et al., 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, as Plk1 increases its activity at G2 (<xref rid="JCS171637C14" ref-type="bibr">Golsteyn et al., 1995</xref>), it phosphorylates Mst2 in the Mst2âNek2AâPP1Î³ complex at centrosomes, leading to a reduction in the amount of PP1Î³ (also known as PPP1CC) in the complex (<xref rid="JCS171637C25" ref-type="bibr">Mardin et al., 2011</xref>). This in turn increases the localized Nek2A activity to promote centrosome separation. In interphase, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), including PP1Î± (also known as PPP1CA) and PP1Î³ (<xref rid="JCS171637C27" ref-type="bibr">Meraldi and Nigg, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C28" ref-type="bibr">Mi et al., 2007</xref>), the focal adhesion scaffolding protein HEF1 (also known as NEDD9) (<xref rid="JCS171637C33" ref-type="bibr">Pugacheva and Golemis, 2005</xref>) and pericentrin (also called kendrin) (<xref rid="JCS171637C26" ref-type="bibr">Matsuo et al., 2010</xref>) have been found to negatively regulate Nek2 activity. PP1 binds directly to a KVHF motif in the non-catalytic C-terminal region of Nek2A (<xref rid="JCS171637C7" ref-type="bibr">Eto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C20" ref-type="bibr">Helps et al., 2000</xref>). Although whether the reduction of Nek2A activity caused by the PP1-mediated decrease in Nek2A autophosphorylation also contributes to the maintenance of centrosome integrity in interphase needs to be clarified, it is widely accepted that PP1Î³ at centrosomes antagonizes Nek2A activity by playing direct roles in the dephosphorylation of the linker proteins that are phosphorylated by Nek2A (<xref rid="JCS171637C25" ref-type="bibr">Mardin et al., 2011</xref>). HEF1 inhibits Nek2A activity and prevents its accumulation at centrosomes (<xref rid="JCS171637C33" ref-type="bibr">Pugacheva and Golemis, 2005</xref>), and pericentrin associates with Nek2A kinase and inhibits its kinase activity (<xref rid="JCS171637C26" ref-type="bibr">Matsuo et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is not yet clear how the localized Nek2A activity at the proximal ends of centrioles is regulated. In this study, we reveal that Cep85 interacts with Nek2A, localizes to the proximal ends of the centrioles and functions as a negative regulator of Nek2A to maintain the centrosome integrity in interphase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of Cep85 protein as a binding partner of Nek2A</title><p>Nek2A expression levels remain high in the S to G2 phase, however, its activity at the proximal ends of centrioles needs to be kept low to ensure that the centrosome is not to be separated precociously (<xref rid="JCS171637C23" ref-type="bibr">Mardin and Schiebel, 2012</xref>). In order to identify potential Nek2A-binding partners that might suppress Nek2A activity, we expressed a Flag-tagged kinase-dead mutant Nek2A in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells and used M2 agarose to affinity purify FlagâNek2A, followed by mass spectrometry analysis to determine the identities of Nek2A-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>A). Among the identified proteins, centrosomal protein 85âkDa (Cep85), also known as coiled-coil domain-containing protein 21 (CCDC21), was a particular interesting candidate. It was initially identified with other 21 proteins as new centrosomal components by complementary proteomics strategies (<xref rid="JCS171637C21" ref-type="bibr">Jakobsen et al., 2011</xref>). Except for its spindle pole association, to date, no other studies have been performed. Human Cep85 was predicted to contain two coiled-coil domains (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.171637/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S1A</uri>).

A recombinant GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal region, corresponding to amino acids 544â762 of human Cep85, was used as an antigen and the produced crude sera were purified by affinity immunoabsorption. This purified antibody could specifically recognize those proteins carrying the C-terminal portion of Cep85 including the wild-type (WT) protein and amino acids 544â762 (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.171637/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S1C</uri>) and could specifically immunoprecipitate MycâCep85 protein overexpressed in HEK293T cells (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.171637/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S1D</uri>). The specificity of this antibody to the endogenous Cep85 protein was also validated in an experiment with small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Cep85 depletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F6">Fig.Â 6</xref>AâC).</p><p>To verify the interaction between Cep85 and Nek2A, we first co-expressed Myc-tagged Cep85 and HA-tagged Nek2A in HEK293T cells and ascertained that Cep85 could be coimmunoprecipitated by Nek2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>B). We also noticed that Nek2A, once co-expressed with Cep85, caused a mobility shift in the Cep85 protein, suggesting that Cep85 might be phosphorylated by Nek2A. We also immunoprecipitated endogenous Cep85 protein from HEK293T cell lysates and found that Nek2A indeed coimmunoprecipitated with Cep85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>C). The same result was obtained when using U2OS cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>D), suggesting that endogenous Cep85 and Nek2A proteins physically interact and form a complex in cells. Furthermore, an <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pulldown assay revealed that a bacterially produced GST fusion Cep85 protein could specifically pull down HA-tagged Nek2A protein produced in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>E). These results confirm that Cep85 is a binding partner of Nek2A in cells. To define the Cep85-binding region in Nek2A, we generated two truncated mutants, D1 and D2, and performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>F).

The proximal end localization of Cep85 was further confirmed by the observation that Cep85 was colocalized with C-Nap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>A), which is known to associate specifically with the proximal ends of centrioles as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy (<xref rid="JCS171637C11" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al., 1998a</xref>).

To better visualize the Cep85 structure, we generated a U2OS cell line stably expressing centrin1âGFP to mark the centrioles and single immunostained with anti-Cep85 antibody. Confocal microscopy revealed that Cep85 formed a granule meshwork surrounding centrin during interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>C).

Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of Nek2A leads to premature separation of centrosomes, and depletion of Nek2A in conjunction with inhibition of Eg5 activity inhibits the disjunction of centrosome during mitosis (<xref rid="JCS171637C12" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C24" ref-type="bibr">Mardin et al., 2010</xref>). Given that Cep85 was identified as a Nek2A-interacting protein and colocalized with Nek2A at centrosomes, we reasoned that alteration of Cep85 protein levels might cause centrosome abnormalities by altering Nek2A in cells. We therefore established two systems to determine the functional significance of Cep85.</p><p>In order to ascertain whether upregulation of Cep85 expression levels would affect centrosome disjunction, we overexpressed Cep85 in U2OS cells and synchronized them at G1/S prior to releasing into M phase (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.171637/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S3A</uri>). In the absence of treatment with STLC, an inhibitor of Eg5, Cep85-expressing cells did not arrest at any specific cell cycle stages within 22âh; centrosomes could normally separate and migrate to form bipolar spindle poles exactly like the control cells (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.171637/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S3B</uri>). When treated with STLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>A), synchronized cells often arrested at prometaphase. In â¼80% of the control cells with no Cep85 overexpression, the centrosome disjunction occurred normally, and the distance between two centrosomes was over 2âÂµm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>BâE). In contrast, the two centrosomes in over 75% of Cep85-overexpressing cells remained in close proximity at a distance of less than 1âÂµm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>BâE). These results suggest that overexpression of Cep85 can prevent centrosome disjunction. We further confirmed this conclusion by performing rootletin immunostaining. During interphase, the linker protein rootletin remained at the centrosomes in both Cep85-overexpressing and non-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>K). During mitosis, rootletin still remained between two nonseparated centrosomes in Cep85-overexpressing cells; however, it completely disappeared in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>K). This phenomenon was exactly like those cells treated with siRNA to deplete Nek2A protein in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>FâJ), as also shown previously (<xref rid="JCS171637C24" ref-type="bibr">Mardin et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that Cep85 might counteract Nek2A activity. If this is true, then overexpressing Cep85 would alleviate effects of Nek2A overexpression on centrosomes. To verify this hypothesis, we performed rootletin immunostaining analysis. In contrast to the control cells, which retain rootletin at the centrosome in interphase, overexpressing Nek2A resulted in complete disappearance of rootletin at centrosomes. Remarkably, once Cep85 was co-expressed with Nek2A, the rootletin signal reappeared at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>L), indicating that Cep85 can antagonize Nek2A activity.

Thus Cep85 might play some roles that are opposite to Nek2A in maintenance of centrosome integrity in the S and G2 phases. However, this might simply occur through altering the centrosome structure or accumulation of Nek2A at centrosomes. To rule out these possibilities, we examined the localization and intensity of Î³-tubulin and Nek2A after both up- or down-regulation of Cep85. We found that neither up- nor down-regulation of Cep85 changed the intensity or centrosome localization of Î³-tubulin and Nek2A, although centrosome splitting revealed by staining either Nek2A or Î³-tubulin was easily detected in those Cep85-depleted cells (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.171637/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S4</uri>).

We thus decided to examine whether the NBD region in Cep85 was also fully functional and suppressed centrosome disjunction in cells. Consistently, WT Cep85 when overexpressed could efficiently suppress centrosome disjunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>AâF); those truncated mutants not containing the NBD, including M1, M9 and M10, completely lost their capacity to suppress centrosome disjunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>). However, the mutant M5, which contains the NBD alone and retains the full inhibitory effect on Nek2 kinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>C), only partly prevented centrosome disjunction. Compared to those cells expressing WT Cep85, where â¼80% of them display nonseparated centrosome, only â¼40% of M5-expressed cells exhibited nonseparated centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>). In addition, the mutant M7, containing the centrosome localization domain and partial NBD, did not demonstrate any significant inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>). Strikingly, the mutant M2 with these two domains joined together became fully functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>). The percentage of cells with nonseparated centrosome appeared to be â¼72%, close to that of WT (â¼80%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>F). Thus, both the Nek2A-binding and centrosome localization domains are strictly required for Cep85 to efficiently suppress centrosome disjunction in cells.

Further <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies confirmed the interaction of Cep85 and Nek2A. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that endogenous Cep85 and Nek2A colocalize at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>). Importantly, Cep85 has been shown to localize to the proximal ends of centrioles, where Nek2A also localizes and functions as a kinase to phosphorylate the proteinaceous linker connecting two mother centrioles (<xref rid="JCS171637C1" ref-type="bibr">Bahe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C11" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C23" ref-type="bibr">Mardin and Schiebel, 2012</xref>). These findings reveal that Cep85 is a bona fide Nek2A-binding partner in cells.</p><p>To our surprise, at first glance, transient overexpression of Cep85 in both synchronized and unsynchronized cells did not cause significant defect in cell cycle progression. However, once treated with Eg5 inhibitor STLC, most Cep85-expressing cells arrested at prometaphase displayed centrosome disjunction failure and retained rootletin between two nonseparated centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>). These results are exactly like those observed in cells with Nek2A depletion (<xref rid="JCS171637C24" ref-type="bibr">Mardin et al., 2010</xref>). Similar results have also been shown by other treatments leading to reduction of Nek2A activity, such as inhibiting Plk1 using SB2536, inhibiting Aurora A with VX-680 and depletion of Mst1 and Mst2, or Sav1 (<xref rid="JCS171637C25" ref-type="bibr">Mardin et al., 2011</xref><xref rid="JCS171637C24" ref-type="bibr">, 2010</xref>). By contrast, Cep85 depletion results in premature centrosome splitting and loss of rootletin at separated centrosomes in interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F6">Fig.Â 6</xref>), strikingly reminiscent of Nek2A hyperactivation (<xref rid="JCS171637C8" ref-type="bibr">Faragher and Fry, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C12" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C25" ref-type="bibr">Mardin et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, co-overexpression of Cep85 with Nek2A could prevent the loss of rootletin at centrosomes caused by Nek2A overexpression in interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>L). Thus, the results of the experiments with up- and down-regulation of Cep85 expression strongly suggest that Cep85 plays roles opposite to those of Nek2A in the maintenance of centrosome conjunction by suppressing Nek2A activity. Biochemically, we identified the region comprising amino acids 257â433 as the Nek2A-binding domain (NBD) in Cep85. Similar to WT Cep85, this domain is sufficient to bind to and inhibit Nek2A kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>). We currently do not know exactly how Cep85 can suppress Nek2A kinase activity after it binds to Nek2A through the NBD. We noticed that Cep85, once co-expressed with Nek2A in HEK293T cells, can be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>B), suggesting that Cep85 might be a substrate for Nek2A. However, in our <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays, we did not detect any incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P into a GSTâCep85 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>B), indicating that Cep85 might not be a substrate for Nek2A. Nevertheless, we found that Cep85 binds to the C-terminus of Nek2A outside of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>), which has also been reported to be a pericentrin-binding domain. Whether this binding would cause any structural changes in Nek2A, as has been proposed for pericentrin (<xref rid="JCS171637C26" ref-type="bibr">Matsuo et al., 2010</xref>), is certainly an interesting question and needs for further investigation. Interestingly, the NBD domain alone is not sufficient to efficiently prevent centrosome disjunction in cells, and an additional sequence carrying the centrosome localization domain (CLD) is also required for NBD to fully restore its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>). Therefore, our data suggest a mode of Cep85 action in which it forms a granule meshwork enveloping the proximal ends of centrioles through its centrosome localization domain, where it interacts with Nek2A through its NBD, suppressing the kinase activity of Nek2A, thereby preventing centrosome splitting in interphase.</p><p>Nek2A has been shown to be the major kinase responsible for the phosphorylation and dissociation of the centrosomal linker proteins (<xref rid="JCS171637C23" ref-type="bibr">Mardin and Schiebel, 2012</xref>). Its expression levels and kinase activity remain high in S to G2 phase (<xref rid="JCS171637C17" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>). Meanwhile, overexpression of Nek2A induces premature centrosome disjunction (<xref rid="JCS171637C8" ref-type="bibr">Faragher and Fry, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C12" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al., 1998b</xref>). Therefore, to ensure that the centrosome acts as a single MTOC in interphase, Nek2A kinase activity at centrosomes must be subject to strict control. Multiple levels of regulation have been reported to modulate Nek2A, including its expression, localization, and interaction with inhibitory proteins, like HEF1, pericentrin and PP1 (<xref rid="JCS171637C9" ref-type="bibr">Fry, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C23" ref-type="bibr">Mardin and Schiebel, 2012</xref>). For PP1, it has been demonstrated that PP1Î³ indirectly antagonizes Nek2A activity by dephosphorylating linker proteins rather than Nek2A <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="JCS171637C25" ref-type="bibr">Mardin et al., 2011</xref>). Considering that the expression levels and activity of Nek2A are rather high throughout the S and G2 phase of cell cycle, this indirect suppression of Nek2A by PP1Î³ is certainly necessary but might be inefficient and uneconomic. In conjunction with the action of PP1Î³, our model of Cep85 action provides a fairly efficient way to ensure that the two centrosomes will not be separated precociously. We propose that as Nek2A dynamically accumulates to the proximal ends of centrioles where Cep85 localizes, Cep85 binds to and traps it to form a kinase inactive Nek2AâCep85 complex. The low amount of Nek2A protein that might escape from the trap would bind to and phosphorylate the linker proteins, such as C-Nap1 and rootletin. Immediately, its interacting protein PP1Î³ will then dephosphorylate them to prevent centrosome splitting in interphase. Although HEF1 and pericentrin might also be involved in restraining Nek2A activity in interphase, it has been suggested that HEF1 could counteract the positive regulation of Nek2A through two Hippo pathway components to prevent the accumulation of Nek2A at centrosomes (<xref rid="JCS171637C23" ref-type="bibr">Mardin and Schiebel, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C33" ref-type="bibr">Pugacheva and Golemis, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, given that neither HEF1 nor pericentrin has been shown to predominantly localize to the proximal ends of centrioles, they might not be heavily involved in the regulation of Nek2A activity there. As both Cep85 and PP1Î³ interact with Nek2A and reside at centrosomes at the proximal ends of centrioles at the right time, it is likely that our proposed mechanism is crucial for maintaining centrosome integrity in interphase.</p><p>In our studies, we have clearly demonstrated that Cep85 can suppress Nek2A activity. We have also found that Cep85 protein exists in all the cell lines we tested but the levels are different in our preliminary studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS171637F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>). Given that Nek2A activity has been found to be elevated in many human tumors (<xref rid="JCS171637C6" ref-type="bibr">Cappello et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="JCS171637C18" ref-type="bibr">Hayward and Fry, 2006</xref>), it will be of great interest to examine the relevance of these two proteins by comparing the levels of Cep85 in primary cell lines with those in related cancer lines, as well as the levels in normal tissues with those in tumor samples, especially samples with high Nek2A activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids and constructs</title><p>Human Cep85 coding sequence (NCBI accession number: NM_022778.3) was amplified from a cDNA library prepared by reverse transcription of total RNA isolated from HEK293T cells and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.3-HA.
