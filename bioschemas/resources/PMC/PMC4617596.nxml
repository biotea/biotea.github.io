        <p>Ciliopathies are a large group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders caused by defects in primary cilia. Here we identified mutations in <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor Interacting Protein 1) in eight patients from five families with nephronophthisis (NPH) and retinal degeneration, two of the most common manifestations of ciliopathies. <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> encodes IFT54, a subunit of the IFT-B complex required for ciliogenesis. The identified mutations result in mild ciliary defects in patients but also reveal an unexpected role of IFT54 as a negative regulator of microtubule stability via MAP4 (microtubule-associated protein 4). Microtubule defects are associated with altered epithelialization/polarity in renal cells and with pronephric cysts and microphthalmia in zebrafish embryos. Our findings highlight the regulation of cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics as a role of the IFT54 protein beyond the cilium, contributing to the development of NPH-related ciliopathies.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Nephronophthisis (NPH) is an autosomal-recessive nephropathy characterized by massive interstitial fibrosis, tubular basement membrane thickening and cyst formation, leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during childhood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. NPH is a major manifestation of ciliopathies, a large group of diseases caused by dysfunction of the primary cilium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The cilium is a microtubule-based organelle present at the surface of almost all vertebrate cells, which senses flow changes and mediates signalling pathways essential during development and tissue homeostasis, such as Hedgehog, Wnt/PCP and cAMP/PKA signalling. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) selects cargos at the base of the cilium and transports axonemal components required for cilia assembly, and proteins involved in ciliary signalling. The IFT-B complex, which consists of 16 different proteins, mediates anterograde transport by associating with kinesin II and has been shown to be essential for cilium formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Retrograde transport is mediated by dynein 2 and the 6 subunits of the IFT-A complex, however, inactivation of most IFT-A subunits does not lead to major defects in ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
    <p>NPH and associated syndromes are clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases. To date, NPH-causing mutations have been identified in more than 20 genes (<italic>NPHP1â19;IFT140</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, accounting for about 50% of all cases presenting with NPH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Most of the NPHP-encoded proteins participate in ciliary function, either at the transition zone or as components of the IFT complex. All 6 IFT-A subunit encoding genes are frequently mutated in syndromic NPH, whereas mutations in only one IFT-B encoding gene, <italic>IFT172</italic>, have been detected so far<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
    <p><italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> encodes the IFT-B subunit, IFT54, and its inactivation is embryonic lethal and causes characteristic ciliopathy phenotypes, including neural developmental defects, polydactyly and microphthalmia in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and curved body axis, pronephric cysts and retinal degeneration in the <italic>elipsa</italic> zebrafish mutant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
    <p>Our study demonstrates that hypomorphic mutations in the IFT-B protein IFT54 cause NPH with extrarenal defects. We linked these mutations with mechanistic features previously reported for other ciliopathies, including decreased ciliary cAMP signalling, hyperacetylation of cytoplasmic microtubules and defects in the establishment of cell junctions and polarity. Most importantly, this work describes an extra-ciliary role of the IFT54 protein in the regulation of cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics by modulating expression of MAP4. These data highlight a putative new mechanism responsible for NPH and associated phenotypes.</p>

        <title>Identification of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations in NPH patients</title>
        <p>Linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing (WES) in parallel to targeted exome sequencing (âciliome')<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> conducted in 1,427 individuals with NPH revealed mutations in <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> in eight individuals from five unrelated families (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1aâg</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Three families carried three different homozygous missense mutations, whereas in one family, the affected individual NPH683â21 was compound heterozygous for a missense and a stop codon mutation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1aâd</xref>). Last, we identified a homozygous mutation in individual NPH1110-22 that creates a new donor splice site after exon 13, leading to a premature stop codon causing mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1e and 2aâd</xref>). All missense mutations were predicted to be damaging by Polyphen2, SIFT and/or PHRED2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Segregation of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations with the disease was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in all families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1aâe</xref>).</p>
        <p>All of these patients presented with tubulointerstitial nephritis characteristic of NPH (leading to ESRD between 3 and 16 years). Microscopic analyses of kidney sections revealed massive interstitial fibrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration, atrophic tubules with thickening of the basement membrane, dedifferentiated tubules as well as dilatation of proximal tubules (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1aâc</xref>). Consistent with SeniorâLÃ¸ken Syndrome, all patients with renal manifestation also developed early to late onset retinal dystrophy (between 2 months and 20 years) with infrequent occurrences of macular degeneration, nystagmus and strabismus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Four patients also presented with liver defects (cholestasis, hepatic fibrosis or Caroli disease) and six with skeletal anomalies (polydactyly, microdactyly, small femoral heads; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Two patients from family NPH579 presented with clinical features of BardetâBiedl Syndrome, i.e., developmental delay, retinal degeneration, polydactyly, obesity and hypogonadism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). These multisystemic defects are reminiscent of mutations in the <italic>IFT172</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, although certain features, namely the retinal, hepatic and skeletal defects, are also found with mutations in <italic>IFT-A</italic> genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p>
        <p>The identified pathogenic mutations localize either at the beginning of the C-terminal coiled-coil domain, known to bind IFT20, another component of the IFT-B complex, or at the N-terminal domain, within the calponin homology (CH) domain, involved in tubulin binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). As most patients carried either two missense mutations, a missense mutation in association with a truncating mutation or an alternative splice mutation giving rise to partial mRNA decay, it is likely that the function of the protein is partly preserved. Indeed, the phenotypes observed in the patients bearing <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations somewhat reconcile the organ involvement of loss-of-function animal models, but the milder phenotypes observed suggest that the identified mutations are hypomorphic.</p>

        <title><italic>In vivo</italic> analysis of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations in zebrafish</title>
        <p>To confirm the pathogenicity of the identified <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations, we injected wild type (WT) and mutated mRNA into both <italic>elipsa</italic> mutant and <italic>traf3ip1</italic> morphant zebrafish embryos. While injection of WT mRNA resulted in a partial rescue of the mutant phenotypes, injection of mutated mRNA constructs mimicking the human mutations could not rescue the curved body axis, glomerular cysts, dilated pronephric tubules, oval eye shape and loss of photoreceptors and even led to an exacerbation of the ocular phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2aâf</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4aâf</xref>). Notably, the most consistently severe phenotypes observed were those arising from injections with the construct mimicking the p.R155* (p.R154* in zebrafish), as could be expected for a truncating mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2aâf</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4aâf</xref>). These data further prove that mutations in <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> are causal for NPH and retinal degeneration.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title><italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations result in ciliary localization defects</title>
        <p>Having validated the damaging effects of the mutations <italic>in vivo</italic>, we next analysed their consequences on the localization of IFT54 within the cilia and on ciliogenesis. This study was conducted in several <italic>in vitro</italic> models, including patients' fibroblasts and <italic>Traf3ip1</italic> knock-down (KD) mIMCD3 cells re-expressing either WT or mutant forms tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>).</p>
        <p>GFPâIFT54âWT was found at the base and at the tip of cilia when transfected into fibroblasts and KD mIMCD3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). This localization was confirmed using a commercial anti-IFT54 antibody that specifically recognizes the human form of IFT54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Next, we investigated the precise localization of IFT54 at the base of cilia. It has been shown previously that IFT54 docks to the transition fibres through its interaction with FBF1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). As expected, IFT54 was present at the ciliary transition fibres/transition zone, based on its co-localization with the distal appendage protein Cep164 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In addition, it co-localized with Î³-tubulin at the proximal part of the centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). Remarkably, endogenous IFT54 in patients' fibroblasts and IFT54 mutant forms expressed in KD mIMCD3 cells were absent from the transition zone and from the tip of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3câg</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>), indicating that the mutations impair entry of IFT54 into the ciliary compartment.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we assessed the effects of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations on ciliogenesis in fibroblasts from patients. While there was no difference in the percentage of ciliated cells, cilia were significantly longer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6aâc</xref>). Consistently, the defects in ciliogenesis observed in <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-depleted zebrafish embryos and mIMCD3-KD cells were partially rescued by re-expression of IFT54 mutants, except p.R155* (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 4g and 5d</xref>). This suggests that the observed phenotype in patients as well as in zebrafish may not be caused by defects in ciliogenesis <italic>per se</italic>.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in the cilia formed in patients' fibroblasts, there was no obvious change in the localization of key ciliary proteins (IFT46, IFT140, Anks6 and Smoothened; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6dâg</xref>), suggesting no general defect in ciliary composition and trafficking. However, we noticed a clear decrease of adenylyl cyclase III (ACIII) staining in cilia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>). This defect in ACIII localization was associated with impaired translocation of PKA catalytic subunits from the cilium base to the cytoplasm on treatment with forskolin, an AC activator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c,d</xref>). This result links IFT54 to the regulation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, as observed for mutations in <italic>IFT172</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Nevertheless, the mild ciliary structural defects associated with hypomorphic mutations of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> seem insufficient to account for the large phenotypic spectrum of the patients and suggest that IFT54 may have an important extraciliary function.</p>

        <title>N-terminal mutations of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> impair binding to MAP4</title>
        <p>To gain insight into the underlying mechanism responsible for the deleterious effects of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations, we studied the impact of these mutations on known IFT54 interacting partners.</p>
        <p>IFT54 forms a peripheral IFT-B sub-complex through the interaction of its C-terminal coiled-coil domain with IFT20 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). In contrast to the two truncating alleles (p. R155* and p.M525Mfs3*), the missense mutations, including the C-terminal p.M520R, had little or no impact on IFT20 binding, indicating that the IFT54âIFT20 sub-complex is preserved in most patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>).</p>
        <p>The majority of the identified mutations are present in the N-terminal CH-domain, previously shown to be involved in the interaction with Î±-tubulin and potentially other cargoes for IFT transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Computational modelling of the N-terminal p.I17S and p.V125M/p.V125A substitutions predicted a disruption of two hydrophobic pockets of the CH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Consistently, introduction of the p.I17S or p.V125A/M mutations in this isolated CH-domain (1â133) generated insoluble (likely unfolded) recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8bâd</xref>). Moreover, circular dichroism and thermal denaturation experiments, using full-length IFT54 in complex with IFT20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8e</xref>), indicated that the CH domain of the IFT54 mutants is not accurately folded at 37âÂ°C, likely affecting IFT54 binding to Î±-tubulin <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, IFT54 can be found along cytoplasmic microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and we observed that structural defects incurred by N-terminal mutations effectively impaired this localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that the N-terminal mutations affect the stability of the CH domain of IFT54 and therefore inhibit its ability to bind to tubulin and/or other partners.</p>
        <p>Among several previously identified candidate partners of IFT54 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), we found that N-terminal mutations predominantly impaired the interaction with MAP4, while WT or the p.R155* mutant display normal interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). MAP4 is the major MAP in non-neuronal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> that stabilizes cytoplasmic microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. MAP4 is also known to localize into primary cilia where it acts as a negative regulator of ciliary length, counteracting the function of septins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Consistently, we found that ciliary MAP4 staining was drastically reduced in patients' fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>) suggesting that loss of interaction between MAP4 and IFT54 in N-terminal mutants results in ciliary mislocalization. This result indicates that MAP4 could be a cargo of IFT54 for ciliary import.</p>

        <title><italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations affect cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics</title>
        <p>MAP4 is well known to bind to cytoplasmic microtubules and regulate their stability, so we analysed if <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations could disturb MAP4 localization and expression. Unexpectedly, MAP4 staining was strongly increased along cytoplasmic microtubules in mutant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>), which correlates with an overall enhanced protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10bâd</xref>). As MAP4 mRNA remained unchanged in mutant conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10e</xref>), it is likely that IFT54 regulates MAP4 protein stability. Hence, mutations in <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> increase MAP4 expression and its recruitment to microtubules, which in turn is expected to result in their stabilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
        <p>We thus investigated whether <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations could affect cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics, by first assessing the level of acetylated Î±-tubulin, a marker of stable microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Hyperacetylation of Î±-tubulin was observed in mutant fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>), as well as in <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD mIMCD3 cells, and was restored by re-expression of IFT54-WT but not by the mutant forms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). In patients' kidney tubules, the increase in Î±-tubulin acetylation correlated with enhanced MAP4 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), indicating that <italic>in vivo</italic>, tubular lesions are associated with microtubule stabilization. We then evaluated the impact of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations on the resistance of microtubules to cold treatment, which induces their depolymerization. Microtubules positive for MAP4 and resistant to cold treatment were detected in fibroblasts and mIMCD3 mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11b</xref>), consistent with increased microtubule stability. Finally, we examined the level of EB1 staining at the microtubule plus-tips, which reflects the dynamics of growing ends of microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. EB1 staining at the plus-tips of microtubules was drastically reduced in mutant fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>), mimicking the overexpression of GFP-MAP4 in control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that mutant cells display an abnormal stability of cytoplasmic microtubules that is linked to the increased expression of MAP4.</p>
        <p>To further confirm these observations, we studied the consequences of <italic>Traf3ip1</italic> mutation on microtubule dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>, using an EB3-GFP fusion construct as a reporter of plus-tip dynamics in <italic>elipsa</italic> mutant and WT zebrafish. Mutant embryos displayed a significantly lower speed of EB3 comets, confirming slower rates of microtubule polymerization compared with heterozygous control siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g,h</xref>). Altogether, these data emphasize a novel role for IFT54 as a negative regulator of microtubule stability, likely through the regulation of MAP4.</p>

        <title>IFT54 is required for correct epithelial morphogenesis</title>
        <p>Microtubule network architecture is crucial for epithelial integrity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, hence we investigated the impact of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations on epithelialization. The microtubule network appeared disorganized in polarized <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD mIMCD3 cells, and was restored by re-expression of IFT54-WT but not by IFT54 mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11c</xref>). The reformation of tight junctions and cell polarity were assessed by trans-epithelial resistance (TER) measurement following Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6aâd</xref>). <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD cells presented a decreased TER and reduced Î²-catenin localization at cell junctions, both of which were partially rescued by re-expression of WT and the p.V125M mutant but not by the p.R155* or p.M520R mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). In addition, <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD cells and all cells re-expressing IFT54-mutant proteins appeared flatter than controls and displayed decreased expression of the apical marker Gp135 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,c,d</xref>). These results suggest that IFT54 mutant proteins may perturb the establishment of cell junctions and/or the targeting of apical proteins during epithelialization, as we previously reported for NPHP1 and NPHP4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further study epithelialization and polarity processes, we used a well-established three-dimensional (3D) spheroid culture system that reflects the biology of kidney tubular epithelial cells. When cultured in matrigel, mIMCD3 control cells formed single-lumen spheroids, whereas <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD cells formed abnormal structures with small lumens filled with dividing cells and/or surrounding misarranged nuclei, with markedly altered expression of the tight-junction component ZO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e,f</xref>). Normal lumen formation and ZO1 localization were restored by re-expression of IFT54-WT but not by any of the IFT54 mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e,f</xref>). These results demonstrate that in addition to its known function in ciliogenesis, IFT54 plays a key role in the early steps of epithelial morphogenesis, a process independent of cilia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Decreased MAP4 expression rescues TRAF3IP1 mutation defects</title>
        <p>Our data suggest that the epithelialization defects associated with <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations are mediated by the observed attendant increase in cytoplasmic MAP4 expression and microtubule stability. To validate this hypothesis, we first studied the consequences of overexpression of MAP4. A stable cell line overexpressing MAP4 displayed microtubule hyperacetylation and defects in cell-polarity establishment, associated with a loss of the apical marker Gp135 and of Î²-catenin at the cell junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12bâd</xref>). Finally, MAP4 overexpressing cells formed abnormal 3D structures with no lumens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12e</xref>). Thus, increased levels of MAP4 expression recapitulates the epithelialization and polarity defects observed in <italic>Traf3ip1</italic> mutant cells.</p>
        <p>To provide further evidence that <italic>TRAF3IP1-</italic>related defects were mediated by MAP4, <italic>map4</italic> was knocked down in zebrafish using morpholinos. Loss of MAP4 results in very high mortality rates, severe ventralization or curved body axis phenotypes in the vast majority of WT embryos (&gt;70%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In contrast, a much smaller proportion (&gt;20%) of <italic>elipsa</italic> embryos are fatally affected by loss of MAP4. More strikingly, 40% of <italic>map4</italic>-KD <italic>elipsa</italic> embryos showed a reduction in the severity of the curved body axis phenotype at 48âhpf and almost a third showed no increase in severity of phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). A 5-base-pair mismatch control morpholino had no effect on &gt;90% of injected <italic>elipsa</italic> embryos or WT siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). Therefore, our results indicate that the <italic>elipsa</italic> phenotype is partially induced through dysregulation of MAP4 expression.</p>
        <p>We next inactivated <italic>Map4</italic> by shRNA in mIMCD3 <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). The decreased expression of MAP4 in <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD cells and in cells re-expressing the mutants reduced microtubule acetylation to a level similar to that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). In addition, knocking down <italic>Map4</italic> rescued Gp135 expression in both <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD cells and in cells re-expressing the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). Finally, <italic>Map4</italic>-KD partially restored the formation of normal spheroids in <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD cells, and in cells re-expressing the mutant forms of IFT54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). Overall these results show that normalization of MAP4 overexpression can rescue to a large extent the cellular phenotype observed in <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD cells. It is noteworthy that depletion of MAP4 in control cells caused abnormal sphere formation similar to that seen when overexpressing MAP4 and mirroring our observations in WT zebrafish. This suggests that precise regulation of MAP4 expression level is essential for correct epithelialization of kidney collecting duct cells.</p>
        <p>Altogether, these results demonstrate that <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations lead to abnormal microtubule dynamics and altered cell polarity, via defective regulation of MAP4.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this work, we have identified mutations of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> as a cause of NPH and retinal degeneration, associated with liver fibrosis, skeletal abnormalities and obesity. We thus propose <italic>NPHP20</italic> as an alias for <italic>TRAF3IP1.</italic> Of the sixteen IFT-B components, IFT54 is only the fourth component demonstrated to be causative of human ciliopathies. Previous loss-of-function studies have also shown the importance of this anterograde IFT subunit, as loss of <italic>Traf3ip1</italic> is embryonic lethal with attendant neural, skeletal and ocular defects in mice, and loss of cilia, retinal degeneration, body axis curvature and pronephric cysts in <italic>elipsa</italic> mutant zebrafish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although IFT54 has been shown to be required for ciliogenesis, the patients' mutations identified in this study do not impair cilia formation. This is indicative of a hypomorphic effect of these mutations, that may explain the milder phenotype observed in patients compared with loss-of-function animal models. Analysis of ciliary composition from mutant fibroblasts did not reveal major defects, except for ACIII, which was strongly decreased and associated with a defective cAMP/PKA pathway. Defective cAMP/PKA signalling is a common feature of mutations in <italic>IFT</italic> genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and provides a potential explanation for the obesity observed in patients, a characteristic of an ACIII-deficient murine model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. It could also explain the increased cilia length observed in patient fibroblasts, as the ACIIIâcAMP pathway has been linked to cilia length regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p>
      <p>Because of this relatively mild phenotype, we investigated additional potential cargoes of IFT54 that could be affected by the identified hypomorphic mutations. After screening a large number of candidates from literature, we demonstrated that N-terminal mutations of <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> abrogate the interaction with MAP4 and suppress its ciliary entry, suggesting MAP4 as a cargo for IFT54. Since we have previously described MAP4 as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, the decreased ciliary expression of MAP4 may also be linked to the increased cilia length observed in patients' fibroblasts.</p>
      <p>Most surprisingly, although the level of ciliary MAP4 protein is decreased, we observed a strong increase in MAP4 staining along cytoplasmic microtubules coupled with an overall increase in protein expression. Thus it seems that IFT54 negatively regulates MAP4 protein levels and may inhibit recruitment of MAP4 to the microtubules, a process known to induce microtubule stabilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Indeed, in both our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models, we observed that mutations in <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> result in increased stabilization of microtubules. These defects in microtubule dynamics were associated with loss of apico-basal polarity in epithelialized kidney cells. Importantly, overexpression of MAP4 reproduces similar cellular defects while knock-down of <italic>Map4</italic> rescues <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations for most of the cellular phenotypes observed, demonstrating that IFT54 plays a role outside the cilia, by modulating MAP4 levels and thereby regulating cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics and cell polarity establishment/maintenance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although it is likely that IFT54 modulates MAP4 degradation, the exact mechanism by which IFT54 regulates MAP4 remains to be determined. As demonstrated for Septins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, it is possible that IFT54 competes with MAP4 for binding to the microtubules. Indeed, the association between the CH domain of IFT54 and MAP4 could be indirect through microtubules. Thus, N-terminal mutants of IFT54, which may have lower affinity for tubulin (as indicated by their impaired localization to microtubules and their unfolded CH domain), would increase the number of available binding sites for MAP4 on microtubules. As a consequence, MAP4 may be stabilized when bound to microtubules, promoting its accumulation. On the other hand, the p.M520R mutant still associates with microtubules and with MAP4. However, introduction of this mutation leads to increased MAP4 levels, suggesting the C-terminal domain of IFT54 may recruit an additional player required for MAP4 degradation. MAP4 has been shown to be phosphorylated by several microtubule affinity-regulating kinases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> as well as by PKA, resulting in MAP4 dissociation from the microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Thus, the low PKA activity in mutant cells could also provide an explanation for increased MAP4 levels along the microtubules.</p>
      <p>By competing with Septin2, MAP4 has been shown to impair the delivery of proteins from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, a process required for the establishment of polarized/columnar shape epithelia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In a similar manner, IFT54 could play a role in the transport of membrane and junction proteins along the microtubule network, with <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutations resulting in mistargeting of Gp135 and Î²-catenin. The subsequent defect in polarity establishment may lead to loss of differentiation and progressive degeneration of the epithelium, thus explaining the tubulo-interstitial lesions observed in NPH, the retinal degeneration and the development of hepatic fibrosis, common progressive features of the so-called âciliopathies'.</p>
      <p>In the course of this study, we observed that decreased MAP4 expression is deleterious for lumen formation in 3D-cultured control cells and is fatal to WT zebrafish embryos, whereas it appears to have a partial rescue effect on <italic>Traf3ip1</italic>-KD cells and <italic>elipsa</italic> mutants. In humans, MAP4 loss-of-function mutations have recently been associated with Seckel syndrome (microcephaly at birth, dwarfism, brachydactyly or cone-shaped epiphyses)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Conversely, we showed that overexpression of MAP4 results in similar epithelialization phenotypes to those observed in <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> mutant cells indicating that <italic>TRAF3IP1-</italic>dependent increase of MAP4 expression results in NPH, retinal degeneration and hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, fine regulation of MAP4 appears to be essential for proper tissue homeostasis.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our data highlight two not mutually exclusive functions of IFT54: first, as a regulator of ciliary composition; and second, as a negative regulator of cytoplasmic microtubule stability via MAP4. Since other NPHPs have been reported to localize along the cytoplasmic microtubule network, and hyperacetylation remains an unexplained observation in several ciliopathy models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, defective regulation of microtubule dynamics may be a general pathophysiological mechanism leading to diverse degenerative organ lesions, in particular NPH. Further investigation is needed to establish whether NPHPs share a common aetiology linked to MAP4 and ciliary cAMP signalling as described in our study. Such understanding could provide a new perspective for potential therapeutics for ciliopathies.</p>

        <title>Homozygosity mapping, exome sequencing and mutation calling</title>
        <p>Homozygosity mapping in families NPH302 and A4336 was performed using âHuman Mapping 250k NspI' array and parametric logarithm of odds scores were calculated with MERLIN software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> for NPH302, and GENEHUNTER 2.1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) ALLEGRO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> for A4336, assuming autosomal-recessive inheritance.</p>
        <p>WES in patients A4336-22 and NPH302-23 were performed as follow. In brief, genomic DNA was isolated from blood lymphocytes and subjected to exome capture using Agilent SureSelect human exome capture arrays (Life Technologies) followed by next generation sequencing on the Illumina sequencing platform. Ciliary exome-targeted sequencing was conducted in NPH579-22, NPH638-21 and NPH1110-22, using a custom SureSelect capture kit (Agilent Technologies) targeting 4.5âMb of 20,168 exons (1 221 ciliary candidate genes), including <italic>TRAF3IP1</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Briefly, Agilent SureSelect librairies were prepared from 3âÎ¼g of 300 genomic DNA samples sheared with a Covaris S2 Ultrasonicator according to manufacturer's instructions. The SOLiD molecular barcodes for traceable ID of samples were added at the end of the capture step. The Ovation Ultralow System (NuGEN Technologies) was used to prepare HiSeq2500 precapture barcoded libraries. The ciliome capture by hybridization was performed on a pool of 10 to 16 barcoded precapture libraries. Sequencing performed on SOLiD5500XL (Life Technologies) and HiSeq2500 (Illumina) was done on pools of barcoded ciliome libraries (64 barcoded ciliome libraries per SOLiD FlowChip and 16 ciliome libraries per lane of HiSeq FlowCell). Paired-end reads were generated (75+35 for SOLiD, 100+100 for HiSeq) and sequences were aligned to the reference human genome hg19 with Illumina's processing software ELAND (CASAVA 1.8.2), the BurrowsâWheeler Aligner (Illumina) or mapread (SoliD).</p>
        <p>Downstream processing for WES in NPH302-23 and ciliome in NPH579-22, NPH638-21 and NPH1110-22 was carried out with the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), SAMtools, and Picard Tools, following documented best practices ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/topic?name=best-practices">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/topic?name=best-practices</ext-link>). All variants were annotated using a software system developed by the Paris Descartes University Bioinformatics platform<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. The mean depth of coverage obtained was greater than Ã 90, and &gt;89% of the exome was covered at least Ã 15. Different filters were applied to exclude all variants located in non-exonic regions, pseudogenes, untranslated regions or known polymorphic variants with a frequency above 1%, that is present in databases such as dbSNP, 1000 genome projects and all variants identified by in-house exome sequencing (5,150 exomes and 1,020 ciliomes). The functional consequence of missense variants was predicted using SIFT ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sift.jcvi.org/www/SIFT_enst_submit.html">http://sift.jcvi.org/www/SIFT_enst_submit.html</ext-link>), CADD/PHRED2 ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/">http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/</ext-link>) and PolyPhen2 software ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/">http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/</ext-link>). For A4336-22, SAMtools37 was used to call single-nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion at targeted bases. Variants with minor allele frequencies &lt;1% in the Yale (1,972 European subjects), NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (4,300 European and 2,202 African American subjects), dbSNP (version 135) or 1,000 Genomes (1,094 subjects of various ethnicities) databases were selected and annotated for impact on the encoded protein and for conservation of the reference base and amino acid among orthologs across phylogeny. Sequence reads were mapped to the human reference genome assembly (GRCh37/hg19) using CLC Genomics Workbench (version 4.7.2) software (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Mutation calling was performed by geneticists/cell biologists, who had knowledge of the clinical phenotypes and pedigree structure, as well as experience with homozygosity mapping and exome evaluation, as in Boyden <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref></p>
        <p>Sanger sequencing using the primers described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> was performed to validate the NGS findings and the segregation of the mutation within all the families. To confirm segregation of the two heterozygous mutations (both located on exon 4) carried by patient NPH638-2 and for which parental DNA was not available, exon 4 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector. Sequencing of the independent clones revealed that the mutations were never found in the same PCR fragment, thus demonstrating that each of the mutations were on a different allele.</p>
