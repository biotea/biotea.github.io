        <p>Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that occurs in familial or sporadic fashion. Through whole exome sequencing in a Chinese pedigree with POI, we identified a novel homozygous missense mutation (ENST00000375755: c.1459Gâ&gt;âT, p.D487Y) in the MSH5 gene in two sisters with POI. The homologous mutation in mice resulted in atrophic ovaries without oocytes, and <italic>in vitro</italic> functional study revealed that mutant MSH5 impaired DNA homologous recombination repair. From sanger sequencing of MSH5 in 200 sporadic POI patients, we identified three heterozygous mutations (ENST00000375755: c.1057Câ&gt;âA, p.L353M; c.1459Gâ&gt;âT, p.D487Y and c.2107 Aâ&gt;âG, p.I703V). Considering the heterozygous p.D487Y carrier in the POI pedigree was fertile, the causality of the three heterozygous mutations in POI need more evidence. Our studies confirmed that perturbation of genes involved in DNA damage repair could lead to non-syndromic POI. The underlying mechanism-inability to repair DNA damage-will receive increasing attention with respect to POI.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure (POF [MIM 311360]), is a hypergonadotropic disorder characterized by cessation of menses before 40 years of age and elevated level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (<xref rid="ddx044-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Approximately, 1% of women in childbearing age are affected (<xref rid="ddx044-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). POI is heterogeneous in etiology, including chromosomal abnormalities and single gene mutations, as well as autoimmune, metabolic, infectious and iatrogenic factors. While evidence from genetic factors, provided by population and candidate gene studies, is responsible for the pathogenesis of about 25% of cases, most cases remain unexplained (<xref rid="ddx044-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Recently, some novel causative genes have been identified by whole exome sequencing (WES) in POI pedigrees, such as <italic>HFM1</italic> (MIM 615684), <italic>STAG3</italic> (MIM 608489), <italic>MCM8</italic> (MIM 608187), <italic>MCM9</italic> (MIM 610098) and <italic>CSB-PGBD3</italic> (MIM 609413) (<xref rid="ddx044-B3" ref-type="bibr">3â7</xref>). Interestingly, all of these genes are involved in DNA repair or meiosis, which thus proposes a plausible brand-new concept for POI pathogenesis-inability to repair DNA damage.</p>
      <p>
<italic>MSH5</italic> (MutS homologue 5) is a member of the MutS family, which is principally linked to mismatch repair (MMR). Among all the MSH homologs identified in eukaryotes, the MSH4-MSH5 heterodimers play an important role in homologous recombination (HR) repair for DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref rid="ddx044-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Meiotic crossing-over is processed by SPO11-dependent DSB and HR, hence, MSH5 is also involved in stabilizing and protecting the meiotic recombination intermediate (<xref rid="ddx044-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Here, we present an autosomal recessive causative mutation in <italic>MSH5</italic> responsible for two sisters with POI in a Chinese non-syndromic kindred.</p>

        <title>Homozygous missense mutation in <italic>MSH5</italic> identified in POI pedigree</title>
        <p>Two sisters (III4 and III5) from the non-consanguineous Han Chinese family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx044-F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), aged 31 and 29 years, experienced oligomenorrhea since menarche (14 and 13 years old), and amenorrhea occurred approximately 10 years later (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ddx044-T1">Table 1</xref>). Both of them have elevated serum FSH, infantile uteri, and atrophic ovaries devoid of follicles. Chromosomal abnormalities, <italic>FMR1</italic> premutation, autoimmune disorders, previous ovarian surgery or chemo-/radiotherapy were absent in any of the family members.

        <p>In this POI pedigree, two affected siblings (III4, III5), both parents (II3, II4), and one unaffected daughter (III6) had been chosen to perform WES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddx044-F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In an autosomal-recessive inheritance model, 2 nonsynonymous homozygous variants in <italic>MSH5</italic> (MIM 603382, chromosome 6p21.33) and <italic>ZNF391</italic> (<italic>Zinc Finger Protein 391</italic>, chromosome 6p22.1) were revealed. Sanger sequencing confirmed that neither of the two homozygous variants were present in unaffected family members and both of the variants were absent in 400 fertile women. The <italic>ZNF391</italic> variant (ENST00000244576: c.187Aâ&gt;âG, p.S63G) was predicted to be benign by Polyphen2, and the Serine residue mutated was not conserved among species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>ZNF391</italic> has not been related to any human disease and no mutation was found in 200 sporadic patients with POI. Therefore, the <italic>MSH5</italic> variant (ENST00000375755: c.1459Gâ&gt;âT, p.D487Y) remained as the only potential candidate for this POI family. Sanger sequencing for <italic>MSH5</italic> in sporadic cases with POI identified 3 additional heterozygous mutations (ENST000Â 00375755: c.1057Câ&gt;âA, p.L353M; c.1459Gâ&gt;âT, p.D487Y and c.2107 Aâ&gt;âG, p.I703V), which had not been reported in either the Exome Variant Server or 1000 Genomes database. Among them, p.L353M and p.D487Y located in the DNA-binding domain and the original residues were highly conserved among species from yeast to human, while p.I703V occurred at the less conserved residue located at the ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In a Han Chinese family having two siblings with non-syndromic POI, we identified an autosomal recessive mutation in <italic>MSH5</italic> (p.D487Y) by WES, which impaired DNA repair for DSBs. Furthermore, the mice carrying homologous mutation present with POI phenotype, indicating that p.D487Y in <italic>MSH5</italic> might be the causative mutation of POI pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>Oocyte genome is particularly vulnerable to ubiquitous external damage, such as DSBs and single-strand breaks (SSBs). Ability to repair DNA damage is essential to maintain the supply of oocytes necessary for reproduction. DSBs are likely the most detrimental damage, normally repaired by HR and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (<xref rid="ddx044-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ddx044-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The MSH4-MSH5 heterodimer is one of the crucial factors in HR by recognizing Holliday junctions and forming a hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp that embracing adjacent homologous duplex arms (<xref rid="ddx044-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the <italic>Msh5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> female mice, meiosis is arrested due to the disruption of chromosome pairing at prophase I, subsequently, resulting in progressive loss of oocytes and infertility (<xref rid="ddx044-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Mandon-PÃ©pin <italic>et al.</italic> identified a novel heterozygous mutation p.P29S (2/41, 4.9%) in the <italic>MSH5</italic> gene in 41 women with POI (<xref rid="ddx044-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); however, functional validation studies were lacking. In the current study, the homozygous mutation p.D487Y identified is located at a position that is highly conserved; surprisingly the variation of its homologous residue in yeast (Msh5 p.D527A) has been reported to result in poor spore viability (<xref rid="ddx044-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ddx044-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In our study, the <italic>Msh5<sup>D486Y/D486Y</sup></italic> mice were infertile with atrophic ovaries, confirmed the adverse effect of human MSH5 p.D487Y on oogenesis. Moreover, human cells overexpressing MSH5 p.D487Y showed diminished survival rate and remaining more DSBs unrepaired compared with cells overexpressing wild type MSH5, indicating the impaired function in the process of HR repair. As shown by RT-PCR, besides fetal ovary, MSH5 was also expressed in granulosa cells. These results suggested that perturbations in MSH5 might not only disturb meiosis in oocytes, but also affect HR repair in granulosa cells during mitosis, followed by accelerated follicle loss through atresia, finally causing POI.</p>
      <p>To determine the contribution of <italic>MSH5</italic> gene to sporadic POI, we screened <italic>MSH5</italic> by Sanger sequencing in 200 sporadic cases with POI and identified 3 heterozygous mutations (ENSÂ T00000375755: c.1057Câ&gt;âA, p.L353M; c.1459Gâ&gt;âT, p.D487Y and c.2107 Aâ&gt;âG, p.I703V). The carriers of p.L353M and p.D487Y suffered from oligomenorrhea since menarche occurred, whereas the carrier of p.I703V experienced amenorrhea at age of 24 just after spontaneous pregnancy. While mutation p.I703V located at the ATPase domain, mutations p.L353M and p.D487Y located at the DNA binding domain of MSH5 and were highly conserved among species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</xref>). However, they might not be responsible for POI pathogenesis due to heterozygosity. In support of this assumption, the mother of the proband (II4) in the POI pedigree, carried heterozygous p.D487Y as well. She gave birth to four children and had no sign of POI or early menopause. Our data suggest that the biallelic causal variants in <italic>MSH5</italic> are uncommon in idiopathic POI.</p>
      <p>Together with the findings in <italic>HFM1, STAG3, MCM8, MCM9</italic> and <italic>CSB-PGBD3</italic>, our studies in <italic>MSH5</italic> further confirmed that perturbation of genes involved in DNA damage repair could lead to non-syndromic POI. The underlying mechanism-inability to repair DNA damage-is plausible and will receive increasing attention with respect to POI.</p>

        <p>The human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were transiently transfected with wild type or mutant MSH5-GFP or MSH5-Flag plasmids, and were incubated in media containing Etoposide (ETO) (5Î¼g/ml) for 1âh at 37Â°C to induce DSBs, followed with normal media replacement and recovery for 2âh at 37Â°C. Phosphorylation of the Ser-139 residue of histone variant H2AX, forming Î³H2AX, is an early cellular response to DSBs, which here was used as a sensitive marker for DSBs. Immunofluorescence and western blot were performed to detect DNA damage and recovery degree by staining Î³H2AX. The clonogenic survival rate after ETO treatment was calculated in HeLa cells, in which endogenous MSH5 was silenced with siRNA and then wild type or mutant MSH5 was overexpressed.</p>
