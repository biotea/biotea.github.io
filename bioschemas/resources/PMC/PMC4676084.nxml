        <p id="P3">Centrioles are essential for ciliogenesis. However, mutations in centriole biogenesis genes have been reported in primary microcephaly and Seckel syndrome, disorders without the hallmark clinical features of ciliopathies. Here we identify mutations in the master regulator of centriole duplication, the PLK4 kinase, and its substrate TUBGCP6 in patients with microcephalic primordial dwarfism and additional congenital anomalies including retinopathy, extending the human phenotype spectrum associated with centriole dysfunction. Furthermore, we establish that different levels of impaired PLK4 activity result in growth and cilia phenoptyes, providing a mechanism by which microcephaly disorders can occur with or without ciliopathic features.</p>

    <p id="P4">Centrioles are microtubule-based structures that form the core of the centrosome and nucleate cilia and flagella. Centrioles are therefore key components of many cellular processes including cell division, signalling and motility<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Centriole number is tightly regulated during the cell cycle to ensure accurate chromosome segregation at mitosis<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. During G1 the cell possesses two centrioles, which are duplicated during S and G2. Pericentriolar material (PCM) then forms around each pair of centrioles forming two centrosomes which separate and move to opposite ends of the cell to coordinate bipolar spindle formation and chromosome segregation.</p>
    <p id="P5">A core set of evolutionary conserved proteins are required for centriole biogenesis (reviewed in ref<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>). Many of these components have been implicated in human microcephalic disorders<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Mutations in <italic>CPAP</italic>, <italic>CEP152</italic>, <italic>CEP135</italic>, <italic>CEP63</italic> and <italic>STIL</italic> have been identified in primary microcephaly, an autosomal recessive disorder of cerebral cortex size, whereas mutations in two of these genes (<italic>CPAP</italic> and <italic>CEP152</italic>) can also cause microcephalic primordial dwarfism, in which extreme reduction in brain size is seen alongside prenatal and postnatal reduction in body size. No ciliopathy-associated phenotypes have been reported in any of these cases.</p>

        <title>Identification of mutations in <italic>PLK4</italic> and <italic>TUBGCP6</italic></title>
        <p id="P7">A consanguineous family with seven affected individuals with microcephalic dwarfism from the Northern Territories of Pakistan was ascertained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Genome-wide linkage studies on this family by Illumina BeadChip SNP genotyping established a new disease locus of 11.7 Mb comprising 56 genes on chromosome 4 with a statistically significant LOD score of <italic>Z</italic>=4.7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a,b</xref>). Exome sequencing of one affected individual from this family identified a homozygous intronic mutation c.2811-5C&gt;G in Polo-like kinase 4 (<italic>PLK4</italic>), which was subsequently confirmed by capillary sequencing in this and other affected family members. This mutation was predicted to create a new splice acceptor site in intron 15, incorporating 4 bp of intronic sequence into the transcript, causing a frameshift and premature truncation of <italic>PLK4</italic>, p. Arg936Serfs*1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The variant was not present in 286 Pakistani controls or in 1000 Genomes and NHLBIGO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) public variant databases.</p>
        <p id="P8">Independently, exome sequencing was also performed on a 15 year-old African patient with extreme microcephaly, short stature, retinopathy and deafness (Patient P6, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). After common variant filtering (MAF&gt;0.005), analysis under a recessive model of inheritance identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in exon 5 of <italic>PLK4</italic>, c.1299_1303delTAAAG, (p.Phe433Leufs*6), which was confirmed by capillary sequencing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and was not detected in 364 control chromosomes. Additionally, this variant was not present in the 1000 Genome database and was reported in the ESP database with an allele frequency of 0.00016, in keeping with a causative mutation for a rare recessive disorder.</p>
        <p id="P9">Capillary resequencing of the coding exons and splice junctions of <italic>PLK4</italic> in 318 primary microcephaly and primordial dwarfism patients led to the identification of a second patient homozygous for the same c.1299_1303delTAAAG mutation. Strikingly, the two patients were from entirely distinct geographical regions: P6 from Madagascar and P7 from Iran. However, microsatellite genotyping of the region surrounding <italic>PLK4</italic> identified an ancestral haplotype shared by both patients, extending 2.9 Mb from 126.3 Mb to 129.2 Mb on chromosome 4 (NCBI build 19) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>) consistent with shared remote ancestry many generations previously.</p>
        <p id="P10">As PLK4 is a key regulator of centriole biogenesis<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and given the genetic mapping data with independent identification of distinct mutations that substantially disrupt gene function, we therefore concluded that <italic>PLK4</italic> was a novel disease gene.</p>
        <p id="P11">Phenotypically, patients displayed profound microcephaly (-11.6 s.d. +/â2.7) and substantial growth retardation of prenatal onset, with markedly reduced current height (-5.5 s.d. +/â 2.1) in keeping with the diagnosis of microcephalic primordial dwarfism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) on the primary microcephaly-Seckel syndrome spectrum<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Severe intellectual disability was evident in all cases, and in some individuals there were additional neurological deficits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>). Neuroimaging demonstrated marked reduction in cortical size with simplified gyral folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Cerebellar and brain stem size were also reduced with collections of increased cerebrospinal fluid evident, particularly in P2 and P7 in which large interhemispheric arachnoid cysts were seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2c,e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P12">Ocular anomalies were also frequently observed. In Family 1 eye size was reduced in some affected individuals, most prominently in P4, in which complete absence of one eye was seen (MRI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2c</xref>). In patient P6 detailed ophthalmological assessment was available; fundus examination revealed pale optic discs, thin retinal vessels and bilateral macular atrophy. The ERG was non-recordable, reflecting a severe generalized retinopathy. Subsequent exome sequencing of an unrelated patient with primordial dwarfism and retinopathy identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in <italic>TUBGCP6</italic> (c.4333insT, p.His1445Leufs*24). In this patient, the ERG also demonstrated complete absence of rod and cone function. Notably, TUBGCP6 is a direct phosphorylation target of PLK4<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, suggesting that these genes may act in the same cellular pathway to cause the microcephaly and retinopathy phenotypes. Subsequent screening of 12 additional patients with microcephaly and retinal dystrophy identified three further cases with <italic>TUBGCP6</italic> mutations, all of which were phenotypically similar to the <italic>PLK4</italic> patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>). As with Family 1, micropthalmia was also seen in Family 6. Identification of these mutations substantiates a previous case report of microcephaly and chorioretinopathy in an Amish patient in which a homozygous <italic>TUBGCP6</italic> anti-termination codon mutation was detected by exome sequencing<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Given prior publication on <italic>TUBGCP6</italic>, we focused subsequent investigation on the functional consequences of mutations in <italic>PLK4</italic>, given its central importance in centriole biogenesis<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and availability of <italic>PLK4</italic> patient primary cell lines.</p>

        <title>Transcriptional and protein consequences of <italic>PLK4</italic> mutations</title>
        <p id="P13">In Family 1, the c.2811-5C&gt;G mutation was predicted to create a new splice acceptor site, adding an additional 4 bp of intron 15 sequence to the transcript resulting in premature truncation of PLK4 protein in the last polo-box domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). RT-PCR confirmed that this mutation altered splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), with no residual wild-type transcript detectable in patient RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3a</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P14">In Families 2 and 3, the homozygous c.1299_1303delTAAAG mutation in exon 5 of <italic>PLK4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>) results in a frame shift that generates an early termination codon, p. Phe433Leufs*6, predicted to result in complete abrogation of protein function as key functional domains are lost. As <italic>Plk4</italic> is essential for mouse embryonic development<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> this was surprising and prompted further investigation. Splice site prediction (Alamut, Interactive Biosoftware) identified an alternative splice donor site 42 bp upstream of the deletion and so we postulated that alternative splicing might partially rescue PLK4 function, with use of this splice donor site bypassing the deletion, leading to an in-frame loss of 60 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). To confirm the existence of this alternative transcript in humans, we performed RT-PCR with primers in exon 5 and 6 that spanned the alternative and known splice donor sites in exon 5. Both splice forms, henceforth denoted FL and ALT respectively, were detected ubiquitously in adult tissues, fetal brain, retina, and neural progenitor stem cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a</xref>). Capillary sequencing of RT-PCR products confirmed the predicted splice junctions of ALT and FL transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4b</xref>). Notably, this alternative splice site was only present in apes and not conserved in other primates, as a single nucleotide substitution at this site results in a derived allele that creates a consensus splice site sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4c</xref>). Experimentally, RT-PCR of <italic>plk4</italic> in other vertebrates detected only one transcript establishing that alternative splicing of this region of exon 5 was specific to humans and apes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P15">The identification of an alternative transcript containing an internal 60 aa deletion that lay outside a known functional domain suggested that the 5 bp deletion would lead to reduced PLK4 activity rather than complete loss of PLK4 function. To address this, we first investigated the effect of this mutation on transcript levels by quantitative RT-PCR of <italic>PLK4</italic>(ALT) and <italic>PLK4</italic>(FL). As anticipated, <italic>PLK4</italic>(FL) transcript levels were substantially reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a</xref>), consistent with nonsense-mediated decay of the prematurely terminating transcript. In contrast, <italic>PLK4</italic>(ALT) was stably expressed in patient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5b</xref>), such that the total amount of <italic>PLK4</italic> transcript available to produce functional PLK4 enzyme in patient cells is reduced to 25.7 +/â 2.8% of control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P16">We next determined the consequences of Arg936Serfs*1 and Phe433Leufs*6 mutation on PLK4 protein in three patient cell lines. Western immunoblotting was performed to characterize the effects of the mutations on cellular levels of PLK4 protein. Two PLK4-specific bands were evident on immunoblotting with a published PLK4 antibody<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), corresponding to the FL and ALT isoforms. In the P6 and P7 fibroblasts the slower migrating band was absent, consistent with loss of the FL isoform from these cells. P1 fibroblast band intensity was markedly reduced, and appeared to have increased mobility relative to the FL band, in keeping with reduced protein size from the C-terminal truncation. Additionally, PLK4 accumulation at the centrosome was measured by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). As the immunofluorescence signal in primary fibroblasts was too weak to quantify, cells were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 prior to fixation to enhance PLK4 detection, permitting robust, reproducible measurements. Quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescent signal established that PLK4 levels were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.0001) with PLK4 protein levels 15+/â 0.02 %, 36 +/â 1 % and 42 +/â 0.08 % of control levels in P1, P6, P7 patient fibroblasts, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P17">We concluded that both mutations results in reduced levels of PLK4 protein in the cell. For the Phe433Leufs*6 mutation (P6, P7) this occurs as the consequence of nonsense mediated decay of the FL transcript and consequent loss of the FL protein. For the Arg936Serfs*1 mutation (P1), the frameshift occurs in the terminal exon, so nonsense mediated decay would not be expected. However, structural modelling of the terminal polo-box domain (PB3) indicates that this domain is substantially disrupted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3b</xref>). Therefore, the marked reduction of protein levels is likely due to consequent reduction in protein stability.</p>

        <title><italic>PLK4</italic> mutations impair centriole biogenesis</title>
        <p id="P18">Functional activity of both full length isoforms and mutant PLK4 proteins were assessed using an overexpression assay <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Enzyme activity, determined by the over-duplication of centriole number, was significantly impaired for both mutant proteins, indicating that such residual mutant protein would also be functionally impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>) In contrast, the PLK4(ALT) protein was as active as PLK4(FL), consistent with similar functionality in centriole duplication.</p>
        <p id="P19">Given the transcriptional and protein consequences of the mutations, centriole duplication would be predicted to be impaired but not lost in patient cells. As centriole number changes during the cell cycle, mitosis provides a convenient stage to quantify centriole number, with four centrioles normally present at this time. In keeping with reduced PLK4 function, patient fibroblasts had a statistically significant reduction in centriole number, with the number of prometaphase and metaphase cells containing fewer centrioles (two or less centrin foci) significantly increased compared to two control lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, P1, 12% (t-test, p=0.04); P6, 10.2% of cells (t-test, p=0.0004); P7, 5.8%, (p=0.04)). Further characterisation of the centriolar phenotype in mitotic cells from P6 established that cells with reduced centriole number predominantly had a single centriole pair (60%) or were cells with no centriole (25%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P20">As centrioles are key centrosomal components, centriolar depletion would be expected to impair mitotic spindle formation. Accordingly, normal mitotic spindle formation was affected in patient cells with reduced centriole number, with monopolar spindles most frequently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Delayed mitotic progression would therefore be predicted in these cells as a balanced bipolar spindle is required for efficient mitosis<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. At least some of these cells eventually progress through mitosis as both anaphase cells with a single centriole pair were observed (data not shown) and an increase in interphase cells without centrioles were seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>, P6: 3.9% p=0.03 and P7: 2.5% p=0.01). Mitotic spindle abnormalities can lead to mitotic errors, including chromosome segregation defects, cytokinesis failure, or cell death. However, no significant increase in cells with &gt;4N DNA content was observed by FACS analysis (data not shown) nor was increased cell death detected by Annexin V staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). Additionally chromosome segregation errors during anaphase were rarely observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) and interphase FISH also did not demonstrate a significant increase in aneuploidy or tetraploidy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P21">We therefore concluded that reduced PLK4 activity results in impaired centriolar duplication and leads to impaired mitotic spindle formation in a subset of cells. To address the developmental consequences of such cellular PLK4 dysfunction we next established a zebrafish model.</p>

        <title><italic>plk4</italic> depletion impairs mitosis and reduces zebrafish size</title>
        <p id="P22">As our cellular studies established that mutations reduced PLK4 levels, morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotides were used to deplete <italic>plk4</italic> in zebrafish, a system previously used to model primordial dwarfism due to mutations in <italic>ORC1</italic><sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Splice site-blocking MOs were designed to target splice donor and acceptor sites of exon 5 of zebrafish <italic>plk4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Titration of pooled MO oligonucleotides injected into 1-cell stage embryos permitted depletion of <italic>plk4</italic> transcript to 2-25% of control levels in 1 day post-fertilization (dpf) embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), with 0.5 ng <italic>plk4</italic> MO achieving transcript levels comparable to that seen in <italic>PLK4</italic> patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Overall body size was significantly reduced in 5 dpf <italic>plk4</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), with reduction in size correlating with level of transcript depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Reduction in embryo size was a consequence of reduced cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), with cell size remaining unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>). Such reduction in cell number was evident from early on in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), and could be the consequence of reduced cell proliferation or increased cell death. Reduced growth was a direct effect of <italic>plk4</italic> depletion rather than MO toxicity, as growth was rescued by co-injection of 150 pg of <italic>plk4</italic> mRNA with 1.5 ng <italic>plk4</italic> MO (p &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Co-injection of human <italic>PLK4</italic>(FL) and <italic>PLK4</italic>(ALT) mRNA both partially rescued the dwarfism phenotype indicating that both isoforms can functionally contribute to organism growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>), while both the Arg936fs*1 and Phe433Leufs*6 mutant forms of PLK4 did not rescue.</p>
        <p id="P23">To gain insight into the mechanism underlying reduced growth and cell number, <italic>plk4</italic> MO injected zebrafish embryos were disaggregated and embryonic cells examined by immunofluorescence and FACS. Centrin 3 immunostaining established that reduced <italic>plk4</italic> levels also impaired centriolar biogenesis during development, with the majority of mitotic cells having less than the expected 4 centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, 65% plk4 morphants versus 7% in control embryos, p=0.0004). We postulated that cell cycle progression would consequently be impaired so next performed cell cycle FACS which demonstrated a significant accumulation of phospho-histone H3 (pH3) positive cells in <italic>plk4</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, 3.9% versus controls &lt;0.56%, p&lt;0.05). Given the reduced cell proliferation in <italic>plk4</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>) this indicated a substantial delay in mitotic progression, also seen in <italic>stil</italic> mutant zebrafish<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, likely as the consequence of aberrant mitotic spindle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>) resulting from impaired centriole duplication. Spindle formation may additionally be compromised due to the role of Plk4 in acentriolar spindle formation<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P24">Increased apoptosis has been observed in other centriole biogenesis mutants<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and therefore TUNEL staining was also performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14</xref>). A low level of apoptosis was seen in 0.5 ng <italic>plk4</italic> MO fish, which increased at higher doses of morpholino suggesting that cell death also contributes to the decrease in cell number, although TUNEL positive cells were often localized to the tail region and did not precisely correlate with the broad increase in pH3 stained cells. Furthermore, unlike the partial rescue seen in <italic>stil</italic> mutant zebrafish with <italic>tp53</italic> depletion<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, no rescue in growth was seen in <italic>plk4</italic> morphant zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S15</xref>).</p>

        <title>Photoreceptor and ciliopathy phenotypes in <italic>plk4</italic> embryos</title>
        <p id="P25">Retinopathy occurs in patients with both <italic>PLK4</italic> and <italic>TUBGCP6</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and so we next utilised our <italic>plk4</italic> morphant model to investigate the basis of this phenotype. <italic>Plk4</italic> morphant zebrafish had impaired responses to visual stimuli, with 60% having impaired dark-light adaption even at low (0.5 ng) MO levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Immunohistological examination of the eyes demonstrated loss of photoreceptors, using the marker zpr-1<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, as well as a variable reduction in eye size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), consistent with the ophthalmological findings observed in <italic>PLK4</italic> and <italic>TUBGCP6</italic> patients. As cilia are key structures in the photoreceptors required for outer segment structure and function<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, immunostaining of cilia axonemes and basal bodies was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S16</xref>). This demonstrated reduced numbers of cells containing cilia in the photoreceptor layer, with absence of basal bodies correlating with absence of cilia. Cilia loss was a direct rather than toxic effect of <italic>plk4</italic> MO as it could be rescued by co-injection of <italic>PLK4</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P26">Additional, cilia-related phenotypes were observed on injection of higher doses of <italic>plk4</italic> MO oligonucleotides, as previously observed with <italic>cep152</italic> depleted zebrafish<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Notably, these were separable from the growth phenotype in a dose-dependent manner; with 0.5 ng <italic>plk4</italic> MO injections resulting in small but structurally normal fish, while at 1.5 ng and 3 ng, embryos with ciliopathy-associated phenotypes were generated, including hydrocephalus, renal cysts and ventral curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a-d</xref>). Furthermore, left-right asymmetry defects were detectable on injecting <italic>plk4</italic> MO into a transgenic reporter line (<italic>bre:egfp</italic>) that labels heart musculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>) and quantification of motile cilia in the Kuppferâs vesicle demonstrated a significant decrease in the proportion of cells with cilia in embryos injected with 3 ng <italic>plk4</italic> MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Likewise the number of ciliated cells was also decreased in serum-starved patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17</xref>). As many cells in <italic>plk4</italic> MO embryos had no remaining centrioles (25% 0 centrioles, 38% 1 centriole, 30% 2 centrioles), and cilia loss correlated with basal body absence in patient cells, we concluded that the cilia phenotype was likely directly attributable to absence of basal bodies.</p>

      <p id="P27">Here we identify mutations in <italic>PLK4</italic> and <italic>TUBGCP6</italic> in microcephalic dwarfism and using cellular and developmental systems establish that through reduction in centriole number, <italic>PLK4</italic> mutations result in growth and retinal phenotypes.</p>
      <p id="P28">The microcephaly and short stature seen in <italic>PLK4</italic> and <italic>TUBGCP6</italic> patients is comparable to that seen with previously reported centriolar biogenesis genes<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. However, additional developmental anomalies are also apparent, most prominently a generalised retinopathy that has not been reported with other primary microcephaly/Seckel syndrome genes. While a consistent feature in <italic>TUBGCP6</italic> patients, it remains to be established if retinopathy is an invariant feature of <italic>PLK4</italic> mutations, as geographical remoteness of Families 1 and 3 precluded detailed ophthalmological assessment and electroretinography. Mutations in the mitotic spindle binding motor kinesin, <italic>KIF11</italic>, also cause microcephaly and retinopathy, but this phenotype is dominantly inherited, manifesting as chorioretinopathy and retinal folds<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, seemingly distinct from the retinopathy reported here. TUBGCP6 is a direct phosphorylation target of PLK4, so this may define a new pathway with specialised function in photoreceptors. Alternatively, the retinal pathology may result from perturbed mitosis in the eye<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, or as a consequence of impaired cilia formation given the loss of photoreceptor cilia in the <italic>plk4</italic> zebrafish model.</p>
      <p id="P29">Although the biology of Plk4 has been intensively studied in recent years<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, the early embryonic lethality of the <italic>Plk4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mouse<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> has limited developmental studies in mammals. Haploinsufficient <italic>Plk4</italic><sup>+/â</sup> mice have not been reported to have microcephaly or reduced body size, but were found to exhibit increased rates of liver and lung cancer<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Although increased genome instability was thought to be due to cellular centrosome amplification and increased levels of tetraploidy, more recent studies on the same <italic>Plk4</italic><sup>+/â</sup> embryonic fibroblasts failed to demonstrate centrosome amplification or aneuploidy<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Additionally, centrosomal Plk4 protein levels were normal, despite a 50% decrease in transcript levels in <italic>Plk4</italic><sup>+/â</sup> cells, explained by the ability of PLK4 to regulate its own stability through auto-phosphorylation of a phosphodegron<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. In contrast, in <italic>PLK4</italic> patient cells a more substantial decrease in transcript levels (75%) impairs protein function, resulting in reduced centriole duplication. Therefore, human <italic>PLK4</italic> mutations appear to fall into a narrow window where autoregulation fails to fully compensate, but sufficient enzyme activity remains to prevent lethality (Model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P30">A single pair of centrioles at one spindle pole is most frequently seen in mitotic <italic>PLK4</italic> patient cells, suggesting that when centriole duplication fails the centrosome remains a highly stable structure. Acting as a single microtubular organising centre this results in a monopolar spindle<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, delaying mitotic progression. Such a configuration may be more challenging for mitosis even than acentriolar spindle assembly, however such mitoses can successfully resolve, as patient cells are seen without any centrioles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). This likely occurs by eventual formation of a bipolar spindle to permit chromosome segregation<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Although only a proportion of mitoses are affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), during development most patient cells would be expected to encounter monopolar spindle formation at some point over successive rounds of cell divisions. Such a reduction in mitotic and cell cycle efficiency could consequently be sufficient to cause significant dwarfism over the ~46 cell divisions required to produce the 10<sup>14</sup> cells of the human body. As mitotic delay can also promote cell death<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, this may also contribute to reduced organism size through depletion of cell number. Indeed, p53-mediated apoptosis resulting from mitotic arrest occurs in <italic>stil</italic> mutant zebrafish and <italic>cpap</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Increased apoptosis is also seen in <italic>plk4</italic> embryos, however as <italic>plk4</italic> embryo growth was not rescued in <italic>tp53</italic> null background, this suggests that additional pathways contribute to cell death in the absence of normal centrosome numbers.</p>
      <p id="P31">The disproportionate effect of mutations in <italic>PLK4,</italic> (and other primary microcephaly/ Seckel syndrome centrosomal genes), on brain size remains an important unanswered question, particularly as all are ubiquitously required for cell division. It may be that the specific requirement for coordination of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions in neural progenitor cells<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> is disrupted in <italic>PLK4</italic> patients due to abnormal spindle assembly. Alternatively, mitotic progression may be disproportionately impaired in neuroepithelial tissues <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> given high rates of proliferation in neurogenesis, a process that has a restricted developmental time frame. Thirdly, aberrant mitosis may itself promote cell death within the mammalian brain<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in this respect monopolar spindle formation can predispose to chromosome segregation failure<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, and while substantial levels of aneuploidy were not detected in <italic>PLK4</italic> patient fibroblasts, microcephaly can result from aneuploidy occurring during neurogenesis<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P32">Cilia phenotypes were only seen in zebrafish with substantial depletion of <italic>plk4</italic>, accompanied by marked body size reduction. Extrapolating to human development this may explain why cilia and growth defects have not been reported, as more extreme intrauterine growth restriction is unlikely to be viable. Separation of ciliopathic and growth phenotypes is likely explained by the different sensitivity of mitosis and ciliogenesis to impaired centriole duplication. Reduced centriole number will result in monopolar spindle formation, disrupting mitosis, while ciliogenesis may continue, with cilia loss only occurring when no centrioles remain, as a single centriole may be sufficient to generate cilia<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. However, many mitoses in <italic>PLK4</italic> patient cells have 2 centrioles at one pole and none at the other, and therefore it is more likely that the proportion of ciliated cells is reduced in a dose dependent manner, with cilia-dependent phenotypes only appearing when a critical level is reached (Model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>). Some decrease in ciliation of patient fibroblasts is seen, but this appears to be tolerated developmentally as there is a general absence of ciliopathy phenotypes in patients. Notably, a 100-fold reduction in cilia is needed to impair nodal flow and perturb L-R asymmetry in mouse embryos<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, demonstrating that developmental processes can be highly tolerant of reduced cilia number.</p>
      <p id="P33">Given the essential role of centrioles during mammalian development<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> the presence of truncating mutations in centriole biogenesis genes<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> is therefore surprising. Our identification of an alternative isoform that partially rescues PLK4 activity in the face of an intragenic frameshift deletion reconciles this disparity at least for this gene. It will be of interest to determine how centriole duplication is maintained with null mutations in other centriolar biogenesis genes.</p>
      <p id="P34">In summary, we report that mutations in <italic>PLK4</italic> and <italic>TUBGCP6</italic> cause microcephalic primordial dwarfism and a generalised retinopathy, extending the phenotype-spectrum associated with centriole biogenesis genes, identifying a new biological pathway for retinal dysfunction and establishing that PLK4 activity is differentially required for growth and cilia-dependent processes during development.</p>

        <title>Exome capture and sequencing</title>
        <p id="P36">Whole exome capture and sequencing was performed at the Cologne Center for Genomics (CCG) and at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI), UK. At the WTSI, DNA was sheared to 150 bp lengths by sonification (Covaris) prior to whole exome capture and amplification using the SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb kit (Agilent). Fragments were sequenced using an IlluminaHiSeq. 75 bp paired end sequence reads were aligned to the Genome Reference Consortium human build 37 reference sequence using BWA<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Single nucleotide variants were called using GenomeAnalysisTK and SAMtools whilst Indels were called using Dindel and SAMtools. Variants were then annotated with functional consequence using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Allele frequencies from the 1000 genomes<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> database were used for filtering of population variants. Datasets were analysed under a mode of autosomal recessive inheritance. At the CCG, we fragmented 1 Î¼g of DNA using sonification technology (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). Fragments were enriched using the SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.0 kit (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI, USA) and subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing instrument using a paired end 2 Ã 100 bp protocol. This resulted in 8.4 Gb of mapped sequences, a mean coverage of 89-fold, a 30x coverage of 87%, and a 10x coverage of 97% of target sequences. For data analysis, the Varbank pipeline v.2.3 and filter interface was used. Primary data were filtered according to signal purity by the Illumina Realtime Analysis (RTA) software v1.8. Subsequently, the reads were mapped to the human genome reference build hg19 using the BWA<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> alignment algorithm. GATK v1.6<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> was used to mark duplicated reads, to do a local realignment around short insertion and deletions, to recalibrate the base quality scores and to call SNPs and short indels.</p>
        <p id="P37">Scripts developed in-house at the CCG were applied to detect protein changes, affected donor and acceptor splice sites, and overlaps with known variants. Acceptor and donor splice site mutations were analysed with a Maximum Entropy model<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> and filtered for effect changes. In particular, we filtered for high-quality (coverage &gt;15; quality &gt;25) rare (MAF&lt;0.005) homozygous variants (dbSNP build 135, the 1000 Genomes database build 20110521, and the public Exome Variant Server, NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, Seattle, build ESP6500). We also filtered against an in-house database containing variants from 511 exomes from epilepsy patients to exclude pipeline related artefacts (MAF&lt;0.004). We validated variants of highest priority by conventional Sanger sequencing.</p>
