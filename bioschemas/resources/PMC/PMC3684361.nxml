        <title>Summary</title>
        <p id="P1">TET enzymes including TET1, 2 and 3 convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and regulate gene transcription<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.

    <p id="P2">Using protein affinity purification, we sought functional partners to the TET family enzymes. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that both TET2 and TET3 associate with OGT, a enzyme that catalyzes O-GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a and b</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. To confirm this interaction, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay with overexpressed TET1, 2, 3, and OGT. TET2 and TET3, but not TET1, associated with OGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). To study the endogenous interaction, we used mouse ES cells in which TET2, but not TET3, was expressed<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Again, TET2 associated with OGT endogenously in ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). To map the regions of interaction between TET2 and OGT, we generated a series of TET2 deletion mutants, and found that the C-terminal catalytic DSBH (double-strand beta-helix) domain of TET2 interacts with OGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). The tertiary structure of OGT has been examined<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. There are two major functional domains in OGT. One is the N-terminal regulatory domain that is composed of 13.5 tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR); the other is the C-terminal catalytic domain that transfers GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to Ser/Thr residues of the substrate. Using the internal deletion mutants, we found that TPR5 and 6 of OGT are required for the interaction with TET2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c, e, f</xref>). We also generated baculoviruses encoding TET2 catalytic domain (TET2CD) and OGT respectively. Co-infecting Sf9 cells with these two types of baculovirus, the recombinant proteins of SBP-tagged TET2CD and GST-tagged OGT could be co-purified at 1:1 stoichiometry from cell lysates, suggesting TET2 tightly binds OGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Moreover, the D4 and D5 mutants of OGT slightly reduced the interaction with TET2, indicating that other TPR repeats may also regulate the interaction between OGT and TET2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). In addition, recombinant TET3 catalytic domain also directly binds OGT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TET2 and TET3 form a complex with OGT both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
    <p id="P3">TET enzymes were originally identified as homologs of JBP1 and JBP2 in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, which are two thymidine hydroxylases involved in Î²-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil (aka Base J) synthesis<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Synthesis of J contains two steps in which it is directly converted from thymidine bases incorporated in DNA strands. In the first step JBP1 and JBP2 catalyze thymidine into hydroxymethyluracil (HOMedU). During the second step a yet unknown enzyme transfers a glucose residue onto the hydroxyl group of HOMedU to form J<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Next, we wondered whether OGT could catalyze the glycosylation on hydroxyl groups of 5hmC. To test this hypothesis, 5mC was incubated with recombinant TET2 and OGT <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, OGT failed to convert 5hmC into any novel base <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 3a and b</xref>). Co-expression OGT with TET2 in cells did not alter the TET2-dependent 5hmC synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Finally, we could not detect glycosylated 5hmC <italic>in vivo</italic> using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d, e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). These results suggested that OGT does not affect TET2-dependent 5hmC synthesis.</p>
    <p id="P4">Next, we asked if TET2 regulates the function of OGT. We fractionated ES cell lysates using different salt concentrations and pH levels. A subset of TET2 and OGT could only be eluted from the chromatin by 300 mM NaCl or 0.2 M HCl, indicating that these TET2 and OGT species tightly associate with the chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of TET2 by shRNA in ES cells abolished the chromatin-associated OGT, suggesting that TET2 may target OGT to chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). To verify this phenomenon, we used 293T cells stably expressing TET2. Since the exogenous TET2 level was much higher than the endogenous TET2 level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), the chromatin-bound OGT was significantly increased in 293T cells stably expressing TET2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). Moreover, since the D2 mutant of OGT abolished the interaction with TET2, only wild type OGT but not the D2 mutant existed in the chromatin fraction, suggesting that interaction with TET2 is important for the chromatin localization of OGT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). In addition, knockdown of OGT by shRNA did not significantly affect the chromatin retention of TET2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that TET2 recruits OGT to the chromatin.</p>
    <p id="P5">Recently, it has been shown that histones can be modified by OGT at different sites<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Particularly, OGT regulates GlcNAcylation of histone H2B at Serine112 <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Since TET2 targets OGT to chromatin, we wondered whether TET2 regulates OGT-dependent H2B GlcNAcylation. With a specific antibody for H2B S112 GlcNAc, we found that H2B S112 GlcNAc was significantly reduced in TET2-depleted ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Moreover, TET2 also regulates other histone GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Concurrent with TET2 overexpression inducing OGT association with chromatin, H2B S112 GlcNAcylation was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, the TET2 enzymatic dead mutant (H1382Y/D1384A) that still interacted with OGT also increased H2B S112 GlcNAcylation, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of TET2 is not required for the regulation of H2B GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Moreover, only wild type OGT but not the enzymatic dead mutant of OGT (G482S) nor the D2 mutant that lacking the interaction with TET2 could induce H2B S112 GlcNAcylation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that the interaction between TET2 and OGT is important for OGT-dependent histone glycosylation <italic>in vivo</italic>. To examine the mechanism by which TET2 boosts the enzymatic activity of OGT, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> glycosylation assay using wild type OGT and its D2 mutant. With histone octamers as the substrate, both wild type OGT and the D2 mutant only weakly glycosylate histones. The enzymatic activity of wild type OGT was indistinguishable with that of the D2 mutant as both protein can auto-glycosylate themselves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Moreover, supplementation of TET2 did not affect the enzymatic activity of either wild type OGT or the D2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). However, when mono-nucleosomes were used as the substrates, supplementation of recombinant TET2 significantly increased the enzymatic activity of wild type OGT but not the D2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), suggesting that the interaction with TET2 facilitates OGT to recognize the substrate. Although H3 and H4 were glycosylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, only GlcNAcylated H2A and H2B could be clearly detected in this <italic>in vitro</italic> glycosylation assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). One possibility is that glycosylated H2A and H2B suppresses H3 and H4 glycosylation by OGT. Alternatively, the glycosylation sites on H3 and H4 either in the histone octamer or as mono-nucleosomes are not well exposed to the enzyme. In contrast to many other enzymes, OGT only efficiently glycosylates the substrates that it associates with<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Thus, it is likely that TET2 recognizes the chromatin and recruits OGT to the chromatin, and the chromatin-associated OGT glycosylates nucleosomal histones at its vicinity. Consistently, only TET2 but not OGT recognizes double-stranded DNA or mono-nucleosome with 5mC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">To examine the distribution of OGT and TET2 on the chromatin of ES cells, we performed genome-wide ChIP sequencing analysis (ChIP-seq) using anti-OGT, anti-H2B S112 GlcNAc and anti-mTET2 antibodies. We validated our ChIP-seq results using ChIP-qPCR to examine 45 different loci that represent a broad range of ChIP-seq fragment counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). Next, we compared the TET2 target genes with a published hmeDIP database<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, and found that 47 % of hmC positive genes are bound by TET2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14a</xref>). The majority of the TET2 target genes are associated with high and intermediate density CpG promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14b, c</xref>), which are also positive for H3K4me3<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14d</xref>). Gene Ontology analysis showed that OGT, H2BS112G and TET2 are involved in a variety of basic cellular processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). The analysis showed that OGT and H2B S112 GlcNAc display a significant overlap of target genes with TET2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and similar binding profiles to TET2 at transcriptional start sites (TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). Moreover, the binding sites of OGT, H2B S112 GlcNAc and TET2 have the highest density around TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Knockdown of TET2 significantly suppressed the recruitment of OGT to tested target genes and reduced the level of H2B S112 GlcNAc at those loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of OGT had little effect on TET2 at these loci, suggesting that OGT does not contribute to the recruitment of TET2 to these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Next, we asked if there was a correlation between TET2-mediated OGT targeting and the targeted gene transcription levels. In wild type ES cells, we found that genes that were occupied by OGT and TET2 and enriched with H2B S112 GlcNAc were associated with high levels of transcription in ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>). Moreover, we examined alterations to the gene transcription profile in TET2 knockdown ES cells. The percentage of down-regulated genes that were occupied by OGT, H2B S112 GlcNAc and TET2 was significantly higher than that of genes not occupied by OGT, H2B S112 GlcNAc and TET2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>). To validate these results, we performed qPCR to confirm the down-regulation of a number of OGT, H2B S112 GlcNAc and TET2 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>). In addition, we reconstituted TET2-depleted ES cells with the H1382Y/D1384A mutant that abolishes the enzymatic activity of TET2. The H1382Y/D1384A mutant could not restore 5hmC at the TSS of a set of the TET2 and OGT common target genes. However, the H1382Y/D1384A mutant restored H2B S112 GlcNAc and partially rescued the TET2 and OGT target gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19</xref>). These results indicate that OGT-dependent histone GlcNAcylation contributes to TET2-dependent gene transcription.</p>
    <p id="P7">Taken together, in this study, we have shown that TET2 and OGT form a complex, which might regulate gene transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>). Besides TET2, TET3 also interacts with OGT. Like TET2, TET3 might also target OGT to chromatin for gene transcription regulation. Due to the different tissue distribution<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, it is TET2 that targets OGT to the chromatin and regulates H2B GlcNAcylation in ES cells. Recently, it has been reported that H2B GlcNAcylation is associated with active TSS and positively regulate transcription<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. However, 5hmC enriched regions are associated with both transcriptional activation and repression<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Since TET1 is associated with the Sin3A complex, a transcriptional repression complex, it is likely that TET1-dependent 5hmC is associated with transcriptional repression<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In contrast, TET2 exists in a totally different complex with OGT but not Sin3A. Thus, the TET2/OGT complex might be involved in transcriptional activation in ES cells. Further analysis on each individual 5hmC enriched locus could distinguish the identity of 5hmC in transcription regulation. Moreover, OGT also affects other histone modifications during mitosis<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. It is possible that chromatin remodeling regulated by histone GlycNAcylation could be a general phenomenon in other biological processes. In addition to the transcription activation, OGT is also involved in transcription repression<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Thus, TET2 is only one of the functional partners of OGT. OGT in other complexes may play an important role in gene silencing<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p>

        <title>TET2 forms a complex with OGT</title>
        <p><bold>a</bold>, Purification of TET2 and TET3-associated proteins. TET2 and TET3-associated proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry and are shown in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>. <bold>b</bold>, OGT interacts with TET2 and TET3 but not TET1. SBP tagged TET1-3 were expressed and examined with indicated antibodies. The whole cell lysates (WCL) was used as the input. <bold>c</bold>, OGT interacts with TET2 endogenously in ES cells. Irrelevant IgG was used as the IP controls (Con). PALB2 was used as the negative control. <bold>d</bold>, The DSBH domain of TET2 interacts with OGT. Deletion mutants of TET2 mutants were expressed. The F3 mutant with the DSBH domain (catalytic domain) interacts with OGT. <bold>e</bold>, TPR5 and 6 of OGT interacts with TET2. The D2 mutant of OGT that is deleted TPR5 and 6 abolished the interaction with TET2. <bold>f</bold>, OGT directly binds TET2. Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding SBP-OGT and/or GST-TET2 catalytic domain (TET2CD). The protein complex was purified by streptavidin beads or GST beads and examined by coomassie blue staining.</p>

        <title>TET2 enhanced histone glycosylation</title>
        <p><bold>a</bold>, Down-regulation of TET2 impairs H2B GlcNAcylation in ES cells. H2B GlcNAcylation was examined by IP with anti-H2B antibody and Western blot with anti-GlcNAc antibody (RL2) or anti-H2B S112 GlcNAc antibody. Histogram shows the relative level of H2B S112 GlcNAc in TET2 down-regulated cells compared to that in control shRNA treated cells. <bold>b</bold>, Up-regulation of wild type TET2 or TET2 enzymatic dead mutant (H1382Y/D1384A) induced H2B S112 GlcNAcylation in 293 cells. <bold>c</bold>, The interaction between OGT and TET2 is important for H2B GlcNAcylation and H2B S112G GlcNAcylation. Wild type OGT, the enzymatic dead mutant of OGT (G482S) and the D2 mutant were expressed in 293T cells. H2B GlcNAcylation and H2B S112 GlcNAcylation were examined. <bold>d</bold>, TET2 facilitated OGT-dependent histone glycosylation in mono-nucleosome but not in recombinant core histones. Tritium-labeled GlcNAc was incorporated into the histones in the <italic>in vitro</italic> GlcNAcylation assay. All error bars denote s.d., n=3.</p>

        <p><bold>a</bold>, Venn diagram shows a significant overlap between OGT, H2B S112 GlcNAc and TET2 target genes. <bold>b</bold>, Mean distribution of tags at gene TSS (Â± 4 kb). <bold>c</bold>, Examples of OGT, H2B S112 GlcNAc and TET2 ChIP-seq results in mouse ES cells. <bold>d</bold>, ChIP-qPCR was performed to examine TET2, OGT and H2B S112 GlcNAc in control, TET2 knockdown or OGT knockdown cells (shCon, shTET2 and shOGT). <bold>e</bold>, The expression of TET2 and OGT common target genes is higher than average gene expression in ES cells. Data analysis was explained in the Material and Method. Boxplots show median, 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile expression levels in ES cells. <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.00001. <bold>f</bold>, Loss of TET2 or OGT is associated with the reduced expression of their common target genes. All error bars denote s.d., n=3.</p>
