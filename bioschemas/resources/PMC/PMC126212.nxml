          <p>The cyclic AMP specific phosphodiesterase, PDE4D5 interacts with the Î²-propeller protein RACK1 to form a signaling scaffold complex in cells. Two-hybrid analysis of truncation and mutant constructs of the unique N-terminal region of the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE4D5 were used to define a domain conferring interaction with the signaling scaffold protein, RACK1.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Truncation and mutagenesis approaches showed that the RACK1-interacting domain on PDE4D5 comprised a cluster of residues provided by Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 together with a series of hydrophobic amino acids, namely Leu-29, Val-30, Leu-33, Leu-37 and Leu-38 in a 'Leu-X<sub>aa</sub>-X<sub>aa</sub>-X<sub>aa</sub>-Leu' repeat. This was done by 2-hybrid analyses and then confirmed in biochemical pull down analyses using GST-RACK1 and mutant PDE4D5 forms expressed in COS cells. Mutation of Arg-34, to alanine, in PDE4D5 attenuated its interaction with RACK1 both in 2-hybrid screens and in pull down analyses. A 38-mer peptide, whose sequence reflected residues 12 through 49 of PDE4D5, bound to RACK1 with similar affinity to native PDE4D5 itself (K<sub>a</sub> circa 6 nM).</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>cAMP is a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates numerous key physiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Its levels are determined both by controls on its rate of synthesis through adenylyl cyclase activity and its rate of degradation through cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A large multigene family encodes many proteins that exhibit PDE activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Of these, the PDE4 cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases have attracted considerable attention as inhibitors that are selective for them have behavioral, anti-inflammatory and smooth-muscle relaxant activity in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. PDE4 enzymes can be differentiated from other cyclic nucleotides phosphodiesterase (PDE) families on the basis of sequence differences in their catalytic region and by their ability to be specifically inhibited by the drug, rolipram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. They are also characterized by unique regulatory regions located in the amino-terminal half of the proteins, called Upstream Conserved Regions 1 and 2 (UCR1 and UCR2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. 'Long' PDE4 isoforms exhibit both UCR1 and UCR2, whilst 'short' isoforms lack UCR1 and 'super-short' isoforms lack UCR1 and have a truncated UCR2. In long PDE4 isoforms, UCR1 and UCR2 appear to interact with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] in order to form a regulatory module that mediates the functional outcome of phosphorylation by PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The mammalian PDE4s comprise a large family of isoforms, encoded by four different genes (<italic>PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C</italic>, and <italic>PDE4D</italic>), with additional diversity being generated by alternative mRNA splicing and the use of alternative promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A characteristic feature of these different isoforms is their unique N-terminal regions, which are believed to play a key role in the intracellular targeting of these isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For example, the different N-terminal regions of PDE4A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and PDE4A4/5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] determine distinct patterns of intracellular targeting. Thus PDE4A1 is an exclusively membrane-associated species that is targeted to the Golgi, whilst PDE4A4/5 is localised to perinuclear and cell cortical regions in COS7 cells.</p>
      <p>PDE4D5 is one of five different isoforms encoded by the <italic>PDE4D</italic> gene and is found in a variety of tissues and cell types, including the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. PDE4D5 can be distinguished from other PDE4D isoforms by the presence of a unique amino-terminal region of 88 amino acids, which is highly conserved among mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have recently demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] that this PDE4D isoform can interact with the WD-repeat signalling "scaffold" protein, RACK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This was done using independent methods to demonstrate that RACK1 and PDE4D5 interact; namely two-hybrid screening, pull-down assays with recombinant RACK1, binding studies with purified recombinant proteins, and also by co-immunoprecipitation of native, endogenously expressed RACK1 and PDE4D5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Native forms of these two proteins thus interact in a variety of different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. RACK1 is a 36 kDa WD-repeat protein that was first identified as a protein that could bind to certain protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms subsequent to their activation by either diacylglycerol or phorbol esters such as PMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, RACK1 has also been shown to interact with other proteins such as the Î²-subunit of integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the common beta-chain of the IL-5/IL-3/GM-CSF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the Epstein-Barr virus cytoplasmic A73 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and SRC family tyrosyl protein kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus RACK1 appears to act as a scaffold or anchor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] as do other WD-repeat proteins such as GÎ² and Î² '-COP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p>
      <p>Previously, it has been shown that a small cluster of 4 amino acids in the unique N-terminal region of PDE4D5 is needed for its interaction with RACK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Here, using a program of deletion and mutagenesis strategies we show that a much more extensive surface within the unique N-terminal region of PDE4D5 is needed, involving a series of hydrophobic amino acids extending from Leu-29 to Leu-38. We call this the <underline>RA</underline>CK1 <underline>I</underline>nteraction <underline>D</underline>omain, RAID1 and suggest that it forms a helical region able to interact with RACK1.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Long PDE4 isoforms are characterised by the presence of two blocks of sequence, called UCR1 and UCR2, located between the conserved catalytic unit and the extreme N-terminal region that is unique to each isoform (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The unique amino-terminal region of PDE4D5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) consists of a block of 88 amino acids that has no homology with any of the other four PDE4D isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] that this region of PDE4D5 is necessary and sufficient for it to bind to RACK1, thus explaining why PDE4D5 uniquely amongst the PDE4D isoforms is able to interact with RACK1. Within the PDE4D5 N-terminal region we discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] that the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping of amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was crucial in allowing PDE4D5 to bind to RACK1. The discovery of this essential group of amino acids was achieved through a strategy of progressive N-terminal deletions and subsequent point mutations within the 88 residue N-terminal region of PDE4D5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p>

        <title>Mapping of the site for RACK1 interaction within the unique N-terminal region of PDE4D5</title>
        <p>Using an ELISA assay, we confirmed previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], that PDE4D5 interacted with RACK1 with a K<sub>a</sub> of 4 â 12 nM (range; n = 5 separate experiments). In contrast to this, using both ELISA and TNT competition assays, we failed to observe any binding to RACK1 of a 5-mer peptide (sequence = NPWLN) that contained the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which we had previously identified as being pivotal for interaction of PDE4D5 with RACK1. Indeed, we were further surprised to discover that a 16-mer peptide (PEVDNPHCPNPWLNED), representing residues 13 to 28 of PDE4D5 and thus also containing the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), showed little if any interaction with RACK1 (K<sub>a</sub> &gt; 1 Î¼M; n = 5).</p>
        <p>These data suggested to us that amino acids in addition to those within the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping might be involved in allowing the efficient binding of PDE4D5 to RACK1. We thus set out to try and identify such determinants. The discovery of the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping was based upon a strategy of progressive N-terminal deletions of the 88 residue N-terminal region of PDE4D5, followed by scanning mutagenesis of amino acids Pro-21 through Glu-27. Thus any additional RACK1-interacting residues must be C-terminal to the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping. To evaluate this we instigated a strategy of progressive C-terminal truncation of the unique N-terminal region of PDE4D5 in a 2-hybrid screen. We have previously confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] the fidelity of such an approach by using a variety of independent biochemical analyses, including co-immunoprecipitation, pull down assays with GST-RACK1 and the binding of purified components. The full N-terminal region of PDE4D5 interacted with RACK1, as did the 12â88 N-terminal truncate in this 2-hybrid analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, the C-terminally truncated construct, encompassing residues 12 through 28 of PDE4D5, failed to interact with RACK1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), despite the fact that such a region contained the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping. Such a result indicates strongly that additional residues, located C-terminal to the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping, are required for PDE4D5 to bind to RACK1. Further truncation analyses demonstrated that a C-terminal truncate, containing residues 12 through 49 of PDE4D5, was able to bind to RACK1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This suggests that certain amino acids, located within positions 27 through 49 in the sequence of PDE4D5, are also required for RACK1 interaction.</p>

        <p>Previously we have shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] that Glu-27 was not involved in RACK1 interaction. Here then we set out to determine which specific amino acids in the 28 through 49 region of PDE4D5 are necessary for the interaction with RACK1. Again, a 2-hybrid assay was used to test for the effect of individual mutations on the interaction. Each amino acid in this region was separately mutated to alanine except for the hydrophobic amino acids that were changed to aspartate and Ser-32 that was changed to both alanine and aspartate. This analysis highlighted a single residue, Leu-33, whose mutation to either aspartate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) or glutamate (not shown) ablated the interaction with RACK1. No other single mutations in the 28 through 49 region of PDE4D5 served to ablate interaction with RACK1 (data not shown), although we did observe a marked reduction in interaction with the Arg34Ala mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p>

        <p>We noted, however, that the region C-terminal to the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping contained a series of three leucine residues interposed by three amino acids in the repeat sequence Leu-29, X<sub>aa</sub>, X<sub>aa</sub>, X<sub>aa</sub>, Leu-33, X<sub>aa</sub>, X<sub>aa</sub>, X<sub>aa</sub>, Leu-37. This is reminiscent of hydrophobic repeat motifs that are found in amphipathic helical regions where coiled-coil forms of protein â protein interactions occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This repeat in PDE4D5 contains Leu-33, which we show here (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) to be essential for PDE4D5 to interact with RACK1. As Leu-29 and Leu-37 both have hydrophobic residues immediately adjacent to them, namely Val-30 and Leu-38, we surmised that our inability to ablate interaction with RACK1 using single mutations might be due to contributions from these adjacent hydrophobic residues. We thus set out to evaluate whether mutation of these hydrophobic pairs would disrupt interaction with RACK1. Indeed the mutation of the Leu-29:Val-30 pair, to either aspartate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) or to glutamate (not shown), served to ablate interaction with RACK1. Similarly, mutation of the Leu-37:Leu38 pair, to either aspartate or to glutamate, also ablated interaction with RACK1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This suggests to us that these repeated hydrophobic residues are important in the binding of PDE4D5 to RACK1. We did note, however, that Leu-25, within the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping, is also located three residues N-terminal to Leu-29 and thus falls within a repeating Leu, X<sub>aa</sub>, X<sub>aa</sub>, X<sub>aa</sub>, Leu unit. However, previously we have shown that, unlike other residues within the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping, the mutation of Leu-25 to alanine did not ablate binding to RACK1. In this study we additionally mutated Leu-25, to either aspartate or to tryptophan, with no ablation of RACK1 interaction as assessed by 2-hybrid analysis (data not shown). Thus Leu-25 does not appear to be essential for interaction with RACK1 in the way that either the surrounding residues in the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping are or as Leu-33 has been shown to be (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also explored various other pairs of amino acids through their simultaneous mutation to alanine; predominantly to evaluate residues that might be involved in charge-charge or hydrogen bonding interactions. These were the pairs Arg-34/Glu-35, Gln-39/His-40, Glu-41/Lys-42, Ser-43/Thr-45 and Arg-47/Lys-48. Of these, only the double mutant, involving Arg-34/Glu-35, attenuated the interaction. This reduction in signal was clearly less than the ablated signal seen, for example, with the Leu33Asp mutation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, the apparent reduction in signal was comparable to that seen with the single Arg34Ala mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; right panel). In contrast to this, the single Glu35Ala mutant showed a similar signal to the control, wild-type PDE4D5 construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This suggests that Arg-34 and not Glu-35 plays a role in mediating the interaction between PDE4D5 and RACK1.</p>
        <p>We wished to provide independent confirmation that residues in addition to those forming the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping were important in the interaction between PDE4D5 and RACK1. To do this, the various Leu33Asp, Leu37Asp:Leu38Asp, Leu37Glu:Leu38Glu and Arg34Ala mutants were created in a VSV epitope-tagged version of PDE4D5 and transiently expressed in COS7 cells. Extracts from these cells were then subjected to a pull-down assay with GST-RACK1 as done before by us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) demonstrated that all of these mutations disrupted the interaction between PDE4D5 and RACK1. These data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) are consistent with the two-hybrid results (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) in highlighting an additional region of interaction within the unique N-terminal region of PDE4D5 that is essential for interaction with RACK1.</p>

        <p>Whilst the 12â38 truncate of PDE4D5 contained both the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping and the essential hydrophobic ridge, it failed to bind to RACK1 in the 2-hybrid screen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the final two residues of this truncated segment, namely Leu-37 and Leu-38, are together essential for allowing interaction with RACK1. It is thus highly likely that either steric influences or disruption of appropriate helix formation through replacement with 'foreign' residues, immediately C-terminal to Leu-37 and Leu-38 in the 2-hybrid construct, underpins this observation.</p>
        <p>A 38-mer peptide, comprising residues 12â49 of PDE4D5, contains both the previously identified Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and also the novel leucine repeat unit shown also to be crucial for RACK1 to bind to PDE4D5. This peptide bound to RACK1 with similar affinity<sup>1</sup> (K<sub>a</sub> of 6.4 Â± 1.2 nM (Mean Â± SD; n = 3 separate experiments) to that reported for PDE4D5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This is consistent with the 2-hybrid screen done in this study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which indicated that the construct expressing amino acids 12 to 49 of PDE4D5 interacted with RACK1 in a similar fashion to full length PDE4D5. Thus the core PDE4D enzyme does not have any profound effect on the functional capability of the N-terminal region of PDE4D5 to interact with RACK1.</p>

        <p>Molecular modeling studies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>), as well as the protein structure prediction programs, PHD and SSpro (data not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], suggest that the <underline>RA</underline>CK1 <underline>I</underline>nteracting <underline>D</underline>omain <underline>1</underline>, RAID1 that we have identified here in PDE4D5 is likely to form a helical structure. In this the essential hydrophobic residues (Leu-29, Val-30, Leu-33, Leu-37, Leu-38) is suggested to provide a distinct hydrophobic ridge along one face of an amphipathic helix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). This hydrophobic ridge (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>) appears to comprise 3 key sticky 'patches', with 'patch 1' formed by Leu-29 and Val-30, 'patch 2' by Leu-33 and 'patch 3' by Leu-37 and Leu38. Destruction of any one of these patches in its entirety suffices to ablate interaction with RACK1. However, single mutations, to the charged amino acid aspartate, within either patch 1 or patch 3 are not sufficient to ablate interaction of PDE4D5 with RACK1.</p>

        <p>At the N-terminal 'head' of this proposed hydrophobic ridge is found the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping that is also essential for interaction of PDE4D5 with RACK1. Leu-25 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>) appears at first glance to form a simple continuation of this hydrophobic ridge into the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping. However, its mutagenesis to a range of charged and aromatic amino acids did not affect the ability of PDE4D5 to interact with RACK1, suggesting that Leu-25 has little or no role in determining the interaction between these two proteins. Thus the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping and the proposed hydrophobic ridge that encompasses Leu-29, Val-30, Leu-33, Leu-37 and Leu-38 appear to form two discrete units within RAID1 that are each essential for PDE4D5 to bind to RACK1.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have defined here a sub-domain, which is located within the unique 88 amino acid N-terminal region of PDE4D5, that allows PDE4D5 to bind to the signaling scaffold protein, RACK1. This region was defined using independent methodologies of 2-hybrid assays and biochemical pull-down assays. We propose calling this region RAID1, for RACK1 Interacting Domain 1. RAID1 is located in the N-terminal half of this 88 amino acid isoform-specific region of PDE4D5, extending from Asn22 to Val30. It consists of a small cluster of amino acids, namely the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], together with a series of hydrophobic amino acids, namely Leu-29, Val-30, Leu-33, Leu-37 and Leu-38 in a 'Leu-X<sub>aa</sub>-X<sub>aa</sub>-X<sub>aa</sub>-Leu' repeat.</p>
      <p>The WD-repeat protein G<sub>Î²</sub>, illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>, interacts with the G<sub>Î³</sub> protein through coiled-coil interactions between the N-terminal regions of each subunit, and through helical and non-helical segments of the G<sub>Î³</sub> C-terminus, interacting largely with propeller blades 5â7 at the C-terminus of G<sub>Î²</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Hydrophobic surfaces play a large role in these interactions. Using a truncation strategy coupled with a reverse 2-hybrid screen, we [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] have demonstrated that the C-terminal region of RACK1 plays a crucial role in conferring the binding of PDE4D5. Indeed, various single amino acid mutations in this region of RACK1 serve to ablate the binding of PDE4D5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Using colour coding of modeled RACK1 repeats 5â7 we identify here regions of particular polarity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>) as well as those that have been implicated through mutagenesis in binding PDE4D5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>). Whilst RACK1 lacks an equivalent to the N-terminus of G<sub>Î²</sub>, which mediates the helical coiled-coil interactions with G<sub>Î³</sub>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] these mutagenesis data and surface properties indicate that PDE4D5-RACK1 interactions may occur in a manner generally akin to that for the C-terminal regions of G<sub>Î³</sub> and G<sub>Î²</sub>. We have attempted to explore this possibility in the model shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref>. The starting point for the model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref>) is placement of RAID1, modeled as a helix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>), adjacent to the mutagenesis-implicated groove on RACK1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>). Of the other major surface regions highlighted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>, that to the far right, by comparison with Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>, forms internal interactions and the upper central green feature is due to a single extended residue, R245, which would appear to be sufficiently flexible as to allow, in principle, an interaction with E35 in the PDE4D5 N-terminal region. Having placed the core segment of RAID1 in the model, we note that a second helical segment, containing a positively charged region of the PDE4D5 N-terminus, could be positioned to interact with a negatively charged region of RACK1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). Thus Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref> shows both segments of the model, with a short connecting loop that mediates a change in helical direction. We note that in overall terms the model has similarities with G<sub>Î²</sub>-G<sub>Î³</sub> binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], using helical segments binding into grooves and intervening turns. The reverse direction of the RAID1 polypeptide chain relative to G<sub>Î³</sub>, on the propeller surface, results from docking the positively charged RAID1 segment into a negatively charged part of the RACK1 model. Since the role of this part of RAID1 in binding is not clear, we regard this element of the modeling as secondary to the primary location of the amphipathic RAID1 helix in the RACK1 groove having the identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] multiple binding mutants. This primary docking could in fact be accomplished with either direction of polypeptide chain, so that we assign less weight to our suggestion of RAID1 running opposite to G<sub>Î³</sub> than to the proposed binding groove for the core RAID segment. Interestingly, Sondek and Siderovski ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]), based on the established interaction between G<sub>Î²</sub> and G<sub>Î³</sub>, used 3D-modeling analyses to propose that protein-protein interaction involving the C-terminal region of Î²-propeller proteins may be directed by putative <underline>G</underline>-protein <underline>G</underline>amma-<underline>L</underline>ike (GGL) motifs on the binding partner. Indeed, they went on to suggest that the Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping, in the unique N-terminus of PDE4D5, might resemble such a GGL domain and therefore bind to the C-terminal region of RACK1 in a similar region to that where G<sub>Î²</sub> and G<sub>Î³</sub> have been shown to interact. Thus, by analogy with the GGL model ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]), Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 may represent a common core motif as seen with homologous proteins. If this is the case then the specificity of interaction must come from additional structural motifs that either enhance or reduce interaction with particular Î²-propeller proteins. On this basis, we suggest that the leucine-rich region, which we have identified in the present study, may serve primarily to direct specificity for interaction of RAID1 with RACK1 rather than other Î²-propeller proteins. The existence of this type of "structural conditioning" would mean that a particular family of Î²-propeller proteins could have different specificity with regards to their protein-binding partners. Additionally, for each Î²-propeller protein there may be a family of proteins that can even interact at one 'site'. From the 3D-models presented in this study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) we can see that WD 5â7 of RACK1 contains a range of different interaction sites and therefore may accommodate a range of possible interactors; including those that bind weakly by only interacting with a small part of the surface, and those that interact strongly, like RAID1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), which interact with multiple determinants over an extended surface.</p>
      <p>We also noted, however, that mutation, to alanine, of the positively charged residue, Arg-34 ablated PDE4D5 interaction with RACK1 in pull-down studies and severely attenuated interaction in 2-hybrid screens. This indicates that Arg-34 is also important in defining the binding of PDE4D5 to RACK1. Arg-34 is proposed as being located within the helix that contains the hydrophobic ridge and is adjacent to the negatively charged Glu-35. In our model it is possible that Arg-34 could either interact directly with RACK1, perhaps through Asp-294, adjacent in the model, or perhaps by virtue of non-polar interactions mediated by the aliphatic part of an arginine sidechain. Whilst, potentially, it could also stabilise a bound helical segment through interaction with Glu-35 we consider this to be unlikely as the Glu35Ala mutation interacts with RACK1 akin to wild-type PDE4D5.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Thus, an amphipathic helical conformation is suited to the part of PDE4D5 that we show here is essential for its binding to RACK1, namely Leu-29, Val-30, X<sub>aa</sub>, X<sub>aa</sub>, Leu-33, Arg-34, X<sub>aa</sub>, X<sub>aa</sub>, Leu-37, Leu-38. This helix may provide the driving force for an initial interaction between PDE4D5 and RACK1 that is then further stabilized through the correct presentation of the essential Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 grouping. The structural model that we propose may describe such an interaction suggests that binding of PDE4D5 to RACK1 may involve interactions that are akin to those seen for the binding of the G<sub>Î³</sub> protein to G<sub>Î²</sub> in terms of helix/groove nature and overall location. This interaction may thus allow PDE4D5 to be recruited into a signaling scaffold complex where RACK1 acts as an adaptor. Our definition of the interaction domain, RAID1 should aid in the design of reagents aimed at disrupting the interaction between PDE4D5 and RACK1 so as to use them to gain insight into the physiological function of such interaction in intact cells. Certainly, the targeting of PDE species is likely to contribute to the generation of compartmentalised cAMP responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Indeed, there is currently much interest in identifying anchor proteins for protein kinase A (AKAPs) that, seemingly, serve to sample gradient of cAMP within cells, leading to the selective activation of specific PKA isoforms that are associated with particular signalling functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p>

They were then incubated with anti-VSV monoclonal antibody diluted in 1:5000 (v/v) in 1 % (v/v) low-fat milk powder in TTBS (TBS plus 0.1 % (v/v) Tween 20) for 3 h at room temperature. Detection of the bound antibody was with anti-mouse IgG peroxidase (Sigma) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham).</p>

        <title>Measurement of protein concentrations</title>
        <p>Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], using BSA as a standard.</p>

        <title>ELISA binding assay</title>
        <p>A modification of the method described previously by us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] was used. High binding ELISA plates were treated with 100 Î¼l of MBP-PDE4D5, MBP alone or various peptides at a concentration of 1 Î¼M in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (Sigma C-3041) for 16 h at 4Â°C. The plates were then blocked in 5% (w/v) low-fat milk powder in above buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with 200 Î¼l/well wash buffer (TBS + 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20) before being incubated for 2 h, at room temperature, with 100 Î¼l GST-RACK1 solution in TBS. The GST-RACK1 solution was formed from a range of dilutions over the concentration range 50 pM â 2 Î¼M. Plates were then washed as above with protein complex formation being detected by the addition of anti-RACK1 monoclonal antibody followed by peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgM. These antibodies were both used at 1:2500 in TBS for 1 h at room temperature with a wash step in between. Immunoreactivity was visualized by adding ABTS solution (0.4 mM 2,2'-azino-bis [3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid] in 50 mM sodium citrate pH 4.0 plus 36 Î¼l 30% (vol/vol) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> just prior to use) and quantified using an MRX plate reader set at a wavelength of 405 nm.</p>

        <title>Molecular modeling</title>
        <p>A comparative model of RACK1 was constructed with the program Modeller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], using bovine transducin G<sub>Î²</sub> as the structural template. The G<sub>Î²</sub> subunit was extracted from a G protein heterotrimer structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] with coordinate file identifier 1 got in the protein structural data bank. The underlying sequence alignment between RACK1 and the G<sub>Î²</sub> template followed that given previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], except for WD repeats 6 and 7 where the sequence match is less clear and structural factors were used to make small adjustments. In particular, putative Î²-strands in RACK1 were identified through alignment of stretches of non-polar residues with the known Î²-strands of the G<sub>Î²</sub> subunit, which are also predominantly non-polar. This adjustment aligned W339, N340 of G<sub>Î²</sub> with W310, Q311 of RACK1. Analysis of the RACK1 comparative model in terms of binding the N-terminal region of PDE4D5 focussed on WD repeats 5â7. Molecular surfaces were drawn for WD repeats 5â7 that lack the start of WD repeat 5, since this region would form the outer Î²-strand of an otherwise absent propeller 4, and is therefore unlikely to exhibit structural order in the experimental WD repeat 5â7 construct. The N-terminal region of PDE4D5 implicated in binding to RACK1 by mutational analysis was modelled as mainly Î±-helical polypeptide, with the potential for non-helical linker regions. Binding surfaces on RACK1 and PDE4D5 were assigned from the mutation affects on binding, and their combination in a general model for complexation used these data as well as overall complementarity of surface shape and polarity. Computer programs QUANTA (Accelrys) and Swiss-PDB Viewer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] were used for manipulation and display.</p>
