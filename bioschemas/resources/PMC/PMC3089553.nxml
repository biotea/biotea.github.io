      <abstract>
        <p>Nuclear proteins typically contain short stretches of basic amino acids (nuclear localization sequences; NLSs) that bind karyopherin Î± family members, directing nuclear import. Here, we identify CTNNBL1 (catenin-Î²-like 1), an armadillo motif-containing nuclear protein that exhibits no detectable primary sequence homology to karyopherin Î±, as a novel, selective NLS-binding protein. CTNNBL1 (a single-copy gene conserved from fission yeast to man) was previously found associated with Prp19-containing RNA-splicing complexes as well as with the antibody-diversifying enzyme AID. We find that CTNNBL1 association with the Prp19 complex is mediated by recognition of the NLS of the CDC5L component of the complex and show that CTNNBL1 also interacts with Prp31 (another U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP-associated splicing factor) through its NLS. As with karyopherin Î±s, CTNNBL1 binds NLSs via its armadillo (ARM) domain, but displays a separate, more selective NLS binding specificity. Furthermore, the CTNNBL1/AID interaction depends on amino acids forming the AID conformational NLS with CTNNBL1-deficient cells showing a partial defect in AID nuclear accumulation. However, in further contrast to karyopherin Î±s, the CTNNBL1 N-terminal region itself binds karyopherin Î±s (rather than karyopherin Î²), suggesting a function divergent from canonical nuclear transport. Thus, CTNNBL1 is a novel NLS-binding protein, distinct from karyopherin Î±s, with the results suggesting a possible role in the selective intranuclear targeting or interactions of some splicing-associated complexes.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CTNNBL1<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>4</sup></xref> (catenin-Î²-like 1) was first identified as a widely expressed nuclear protein with predicted structural homology to Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Although speculated, based on overexpression assays, to play a role in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), the function of CTNNBL1 remains unknown. Protein association studies might, however, be indicative of cellular pathways in which CTNNBL1 may function. CTNNBL1 was found associated with the Prp19-CDC5L-PLRG1 RNA splicing complex (also known as the NTC or 19 complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). We encountered CTNNBL1 in a screen for proteins interacting with the antibody-diversifying enzyme AID, finding that CTNNBL1-deficient chicken DT40 B cells exhibited a reduced frequency of immunoglobulin V gene conversion and somatic mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Here, to gain possible insight into CTNNBL1 function, we have investigated the molecular basis of its interactions. We show that CTNNBL1 interaction with its known partners (the Prp19-CDC5L complex and AID) is mediated by recognition of NLS motifs. We additionally identify RNA-splicing factor Prp31 as a new CTNNBL1 interactor, with recognition also occurring through its NLS. We show that CTNNBL1 uses its central armadillo (ARM) domain to bind NLS-containing partners, analogous to the karyopherin Î± family of NLS-binding proteins (for review, see Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Our results reveal that CTNNBL1 differs from karyopherin Î±s both in its interactions with import factors as well as in its pattern of NLS preferences, indicating that it represents a novel type of NLS-binding protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The construction of expression plasmids is shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.208769/DC1">supplemental Table S1</ext-link>.

Whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspending washed cell pellets (â¼10<sup>6</sup> cells) in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.208769/DC1">supplemental Table S2</ext-link>). Cleared lysates (diluted 1:2 in lysis buffer) were incubated with antibodies against CDC5L (BD Biosciences) or GFP (Abcam) followed by precipitation with anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads (eBioscience) or protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech). FLAG- or HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) or anti-HA agarose (Roche Applied Science) and elution with 3ÃFLAG peptide (Sigma) or 3ÃHA peptide (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were visualized in Western blots using HRP-conjugated antibodies to HA (Roche Applied Science), FLAG (Sigma), GFP (Abcam), or GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Endogenously expressed CDC5L and Prp19 were detected using monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences). Endogenous CTNNBL1 from 293T cells was detected using anti-CTNNBL1 antiserum as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) whereas His-CTNNBL1 was detected using a monoclonal anti-CTNNBL1 antibody (Abcam).</p><p>For pull downs from whole cell extracts, glutathione-Sepharose (25 Î¼l/reaction) was preincubated with GST-tagged protein (1 h, 4 Â°C), washed, and then incubated with 293T cell lysate (500 Î¼l) as described above. To detect interactions <italic>in vitro</italic>, purified GST-NLS chimeric protein (typically 5â20 Î¼g) was incubated with 15 Î¼g of His-tagged CTNNBL1, CTNNBL1(Î1â76), or karyopherin Î± in a final volume of 30â200 Î¼l prior to purification on glutathione-Sepharose and SDS-PAGE. <italic>In vitro</italic> interactions between GST-tagged nuclear transport factors and CTNNBL1 were assayed as above except that (because of the different yields of different recombinant GST-tagged transport factors) the GST transport factors were first purified by elution off glutathione-Sepharose and then bound back to glutathione-Sepharose (following dialysis) at a consistent stoichiometry of 250 Î¼g of GST transport factor/100 Î¼l of glutathione-Sepharose.</p></sec><sec><title>Mass Spectrometry</title><p>Whole cell lysates of 293T cells that had been transfected with either FLAG-CTNNBL1 or FLAG-APOBEC2 were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2-agarose.

To test whether the mechanism of nuclear import is important in facilitating the physiological function of nuclear AID (for example by facilitating subnuclear targeting to the immunoglobulin locus), we fused an SV40 NLS (which is classically imported into the nucleus by karyopherin Î± but shows little binding to CTNNBL1) to the C termini of import-deficient AID mutants (R24W and V18S/R19V). The SV40 NLS fusion allowed efficient nuclear accumulation of the otherwise import-deficient AID mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>).

These structural differences correlate with a substantial difference in NLS binding specificity.</p><p>There are also striking parallels as well as differences when it comes to comparing the N-terminal regions (as opposed to the ARM domains) of CTNNBL1 and karyopherin Î±s. Karyopherin Î±s contain an Î±-helical N-terminal domain that mediates binding to the HEAT repeats of karyopherin-Î² and which also binds back to the karyopherin Î± ARM domain. CTNNBL1 also contains an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal region, but one that is distinct from that of the karyopherin Î±s. Rather than binding karyopherin Î², this N-terminal region contains a conserved bipartite NLS that binds karyopherin Î±s. Thus, the CTNNBL1 interaction with the karyopherin system is the same as that of other NLS-containing import cargoes.</p><p>What insights do these results this give to CTNNBL1 function? CTNNBL1 could be an adapter for nuclear import, binding selective cargo in the cytoplasm and mediating its nuclear import through interaction with karyopherin Î±s and thence karyopherin Î² and Ran. If CTNNBL1 does fulfill such a role, it would raise questions about how cargo release and CTNNBL1 shuttling are themselves regulated. Although we observed no difference in the subcellular distribution of CDC5L NLS-tagged fusion proteins in CTNNBL1<sup>+/+</sup> and CTNNBL1<sup>â/â</sup> cells, AID nuclear accumulation does appear to be somewhat diminished in the absence of CTNNBL1, supporting a partially redundant role for CTNNBL1 in the nuclear import or accumulation of some cargoes.</p><p>The alternative possibility is that CTNNBL1 may function solely within the nucleus. Indeed, even the classical karyopherins have roles in processes other than nuclear import/export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Thus, CTNNBL1 might simply be an evolutionarily deviant karyopherin family member that uses the flexible ARM domain as a protein:protein recognition motif. The NLS in the CTNNBL1 N-terminal domain may therefore function merely to facilitate the import of CTNNBL1 into the nucleus.</p><p>The restricted nature of CTNNBL1 interactors identified is intriguing: the antibody mutator AID and two RNA splicing factors, CDC5L and Prp31. The snRNPs are assembled in the cytoplasm but then pass to the nucleus where they move to Cajal bodies and associate with other factors to form splicing-competent particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It is likely within the Cajal body that Prp31 acts to assist formation of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). CDC5L forms part of the Prp19-containing complex which ubiquitylates Prp3, thereby stabilizing the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Conceivably, CTNNBL1 might play a role in stabilizing interactions between snRNP components within the nucleus. The interaction with AID might similarly reflect a role in AID localization or association with spliceosomal components.</p><p>Testing these ideas will require genetic approaches. However, although CTNNBL1 deficiency yields early embryonic lethality in mice suggesting a critical role in development (A. Chandra; M. S. Neuberger and C. Rada, unpublished data), no robust phenotype (apart from a reduction in the frequency of immunoglobulin gene conversion) has been identified following CTNNBL1 gene ablation in immortalized vertebrate B cell lines or in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>5</sup></xref> This is despite the fact that CTNNBL1 splice factor partners are essential genes. It might well be that even if CTNNBL1 is implicated in the trafficking or association/localization of selected RNA splicing factors, other proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic> karyopherins) might nevertheless be able to substitute for CTNNBL1 in its absence. Indeed, many organisms have multiple karyopherin Î± genes with different paralogs being essential in different tissues and with their deficiencies therefore leading to embryonic lethality at different stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). A likely way forward may therefore be to identify other gene deficiencies that cause CTNNBL1, loss to yield a robust phenotype, either using a candidate approach or by a screen for synthetic lethality in fission yeast.</p></sec>
