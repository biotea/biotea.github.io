      <abstract>
        <p>PEP-19 is a small protein that increases the rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C-domain of calmodulin (CaM) by an unknown mechanism. Although an IQ motif promotes binding to CaM, an acidic sequence in PEP-19 is required to modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and to sensitize HeLa cells to ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Here, we report the NMR solution structure of a complex between PEP-19 and the C-domain of apo CaM. The acidic sequence of PEP-19 associates between helices E and F of CaM via hydrophobic interactions. This allows the acidic side chains in PEP-19 to extend toward the solvent and form a negatively charged surface that resembles a catcher's mitt near Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop III of CaM. The topology and gradients of negative electrostatic surface potential support a mechanism by which PEP-19 increases the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C-domain of CaM by âcatching' and electrostatically steering Ca<sup>2+</sup> to site III.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor protein that is highly conserved and essential for the survival and function of all eukaryotic cells. CaM consists of globular N- and C-domains connected by a flexible linker that allows structural diversity in target protein recognition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The C-domain of vertebrate CaM binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> with slightly greater affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>Ca50</sub>â2âÎ¼M) than the N-domain (<italic>K</italic><sub>Ca50</sub>â10âÎ¼M)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, but the most striking difference is that the rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> association and dissociation at the C-domain are at least 30- to 150-fold slower than for the N-domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C-domain is rate-limiting for CaM to attain the fully Ca<sup>2+</sup>-saturated state. Clearly, proteins that could potentially modulate or tune the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding properties of CaM would enhance its ability to sense diverse Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that vary greatly in amplitude and frequency. Our search for such regulators of CaM signalling led us to a small, intrinsically disordered protein called PEP-19.</p>
    <p>PEP-19 has no known intrinsic activity other than binding selectively to the C-domain of CaM via an IQ motif (IQXXXR(GX)XXX). Although originally identified in the central nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, PEP-19 mRNA is also found in human bladder, kidney, prostate, uterus, thyroid, cardiac and adrenal tissues. Consistent with its role as a regulator of CaM signalling or RCS protein, PEP-19 exerts broad effects on diverse cellular processes. For example, PEP-19 null mice show a dramatic reduction in long-term plasticity at synapses between granule cell parallel fibres and Purkinje cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, as well as altered cardiac excitability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Overexpression of PEP-19 in PC12 cells increases neurite outgrowth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and premature neuronal differentiation is seen in transgenic mice with three copies of the PEP-19 gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In addition, PEP-19 has anti-apoptotic activity when expressed in PC12 and HEK293T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, and it provides protection against Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload in cortical neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Finally, PEP-19 sensitizes HeLa cells to ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p>
    <p>We discovered that PEP-19 has the remarkable ability to increase both the Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> rates at the C-domain of CaM up to 40-fold with little effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and that this property is dependent on an acidic sequence located adjacent to the IQ motif. Moreover, the acidic sequence is required for PEP-19 to sensitize HeLa cells to ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Deleting or mutating the acidic sequence by, for example, converting Pro37 to Gly (PEP(P37G)) does not prevent PEP-19 from binding to CaM, but greatly decreases its ability to both modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to C-domain of CaM and to sensitize HeLa cells to ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. This demonstrates that simply binding to CaM does not account for all the biological activities of PEP-19, and that tuning Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM via the cooperative properties of its acidic sequence and IQ motif is an important mechanism by which PEP-19 impacts at least some CaM signalling pathways.</p>
    <p>The ability of PEP-19 to increase the rate-limiting association of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with the C-domain of apo CaM has the potential to regulate the temporal binding of CaM to a wide spectrum of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent target proteins. This led us to determine the NMR solution structure of the PEP-19:apo C-CaM complex to reveal the molecular mechanism by which PEP-19 modulates the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to C-CaM. The structure, coupled with analysis the mutant PEP(P37G), demonstrate the importance of properly orienting the acidic residues in PEP-19 within the complex to increase the negative electrostatic surface potential (ESP), and electrostatically steer Ca<sup>2+</sup> to site III in the C-domain of CaM.</p>

        <title>Use of C-CaM to study interactions between PEP-19 and CaM</title>
        <p>We focused our structural analysis on interactions between PEP-19 and apo CaM since increasing the rate-limiting association of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with the C-domain of CaM has the potential to increase its rate of association with other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent target proteins. We used the isolated C-domain of CaM (C-CaM) since we showed previously that PEP-19 binds preferentially to the C-domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, and that PEP-19 has the same effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding properties of both intact CaM and C-CaM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The extent of preferential binding of PEP-19 to the C-domain of apo CaM is emphasized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>. PEP-19 has essentially no effect on backbone amide chemical shifts in the N-domain of apo CaM with an average change of only 0.007âp.p.m. for residues 3â73. In contrast, the average chemical shift perturbation across residues 81â148 in the C-domain of CaM is 0.27âp.p.m. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref> show that the PEP-19 has the essentially same effects on the pattern and magnitude of backbone amide chemical shifts in both intact apo CaM and apo C-CaM, which suggests that the conformational change is also the same. Moreover, these changes are maximal at 1:1 molar ratio of PEP-19 to CaM or C-CaM. These data demonstrate that C-CaM is a valid structural model for the interaction between PEP-19 and CaM.</p>

        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref> shows that association with apo C-CaM has no effect on amide chemical shifts of residues 1â29 in <sup>15</sup>N-labelled PEP-19, but large changes are observed for residues 30â58, which span both the acidic sequence and core IQ motif (see full spectra in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The open bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> indicates that Glu38 to Ala58 in PEP-19 are predicted to adopt Î±-helical secondary structure on binding to apo C-CaM based on the chemical shift index (CSI). Although binding to apo C-CaM causes large amide chemical shift changes for residues 30â36 in the acidic sequence of PEP-19, the CSI assigns this region to neither Î±-helix nor Î²-sheet secondary structure. Heteronuclear <sup>15</sup>N{<sup>1</sup>H} nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) for free PEP-19 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> are predominantly negative, which is consistent with a highly flexible, intrinsically disordered protein. The <sup>15</sup>N{<sup>1</sup>H} NOE values for residues Phe30âAla36 in PEP-19 bound to apo C-CaM, show a gradual increase from 0 to 0.8, then the <sup>15</sup>N{<sup>1</sup>H} NOE values remain high for residues Glu38âAla58, which is consistent with a well-ordered Î±-helix.</p>

        <title>Structural features of apo C-CaM bound to PEP-19</title>
        <p>On the basis of the CSI and TALOS, secondary structural elements in apo C-CaM bound to PEP-19 include helix E (aa 81â92), helix F (aa 102â111), helix G (aa 118â128), helix H (aa 138â146), Î²-strand III (aa 99â101) and Î²-strand IV (aa 135â137). Residues 93â104 and 129â140 form Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loops III and IV, respectively. The global backbone conformation of apo C-CaM bound to PEP-19 conforms to a semi-open state, with a shallow hydrophobic groove to accommodate the helical IQ motif of PEP-19. Pairwise structural alignments show that the closest structural relatives to apo C-CaM bound to PEP-19 are structures of semi-open CaM bound to other IQ motif peptides and proteins. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> shows an overlay of backbone structures for C-CaM bound to intact PEP-19 and those of C-CaM derived from the crystal structures of CaM bound to the IQ motif in the cytoplasmic domain of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) or the IQ region of myosin V<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The structures are shown without PEP-19 or the IQ peptides to emphasize spatial similarity of the 4 helices in C-CaM. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> compares helical angles for Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites III and IV in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and apo CaM versus the semi-open conformation of apo CaM bound to PEP-19 or the IQ peptide from the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Interestingly, the semi-open conformation in these complexes is largely due to a conformational change in site III since the helical angles of site III in apo CaM bound to either PEP-19 or the IQ peptide from Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 are essentially identical to free Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound CaM.</p>
        <p>Two experiments argue against the semi-open conformation of apo C-CaM as the primary molecular mechanism by which PEP-19 increases the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> association. First, a peptide encompassing the IQ motif of PEP-19, but lacking the acidic sequence, does not increase the Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Second, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> shows that the IQ peptide from the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (aa 1,901â1,927), which lacks an acidic sequence but clearly induces a semi-open conformation in the C-domain of CaM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, has little effect on the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> association.</p>
        <p>Although the helical angle for site III of apo CaM bound to PEP-19 is more similar to Ca<sup>2+</sup> CaM, the backbone conformation and side chain orientations for residues 93â104 in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop III are much more similar to free apo CaM. The conformation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop III in the PEP-19:apo C-CaM complex is fairly well defined with 85 medium and long range NOEs, and appears to be stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds involving the side chain oxygens of Asp93 and backbone amides of residues 94â99 (also see the âDiscussion' section). In contrast, only 18 medium and long range NOEs are observed in loop IV. This is consistent with amide line broadening observed for residues 129â134 due to chemical exchange, which was also seen for apo CaM bound to the IQ motif peptide of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p>

        <title>Interaction between C-CaM and the helical portion of PEP-19</title>
        <p>PEP-19 binds to C-CaM in a parallel orientation with the N-terminal residues interacting with helices E and F of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site III, while the C-terminal residues interact with helices G and H in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site IV. The average total buried surface area is 2,157âÃ<sup>2</sup> for the five lowest energy conformers in the ensemble. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref> summarizes residues in the helical portion of PEP-19 that form intermolecular NOEs with residues in C-CaM. The majority of NOEs arise from hydrophobic interactions involving non-polar atoms in Thr39, Ala42, Ala43, Ala45, Ile46, Gln47, Phe50 and Phe53 in PEP-19. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3b</xref> shows that these residues (red) are predominantly located on one surface of the helical segment in PEP-19. They are deeply buried in the complex, with 89% of their side chain surfaces excluded from solvent, which allows them to form hydrophobic interactions primarily with Phe89, Phe92, Val108, Met109, Met124, Met144 and Met145 in C-CaM, which line the shallow hydrophobic groove (see grey side chains in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In addition to these hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions include hydrogen bonds between Gln47 in the IQ dipeptide of PEP-19 and backbone atoms of Ile112 and Glu114 in the linker between helices F and G in apo C-CaM, as well as ionic bonds between the side chains of Arg51 in PEP-19 and Glu114 in C-CaM.</p>
        <p>The importance of these residues for binding to CaM is supported by a study using synthetic peptides that span residues 36â60 in the IQ motif of PEP-19 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Peptides with Ile46 and Gln47 changed to Gly, as well as the single mutations A42D, F50G, R51K, K56A and K57A all inhibited their ability to inhibit CaM activation of nNOS at low Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Similarly, introducing the mutations Q47N and S48T effectively prevented intact PEP-19 from binding to CaM, and from conferring resistance to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated cytotoxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p>

        <title>Interactions between C-CaM and the acidic loop in PEP-19</title>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4a</xref> show that the acidic sequence in PEP-19 (aa 30â40 in red) associates with Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site III. Residues 30â36 in PEP-19 form an extended coil structure that runs between helices E and F of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site III. The coil segment terminates at Pro37, and residues 38â40 of the acidic sequence form the N terminus of the Î±-helix in PEP-19. The buried surface between the acidic sequence and C-CaM is 725âÃ<sup>2</sup>, which is 30% of the total buried surface area in the complex.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref> shows that the side chains of Phe30, Ile32 and Met34 of PEP-19 form a hydrophobic plug that inserts between helices E and F of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site III to stabilize the extended coil segment of PEP-19. The side chains of these three residues account for 89% of the buried surface area in the acidic sequence of PEP-19. A total of 39 intermolecular NOEs are observed between C-CaM and the side chains of Phe30, Ile32 and Met34 in PEP-19. This extensive network of NOEs is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, which shows selected planes acquired from F<sub>1</sub>-filtered, F<sub>3</sub>-edited NOESY-HSQC using <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N PEP-19 bound to unlabelled C-CaM. The HÎ´1 of Ile32 in PEP-19 shows intermolecular NOEs to Val91, Phe92, Glu104 and His107 in C-CaM. The HÉ of Met34 in PEP-19 shows intermolecular NOEs to Phe92, His107, Val108, Asn111 and Leu112 in C-CaM (see grey side chains in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Most of these residues in C-CaM also form intermolecular NOEs with residues in the helical portion of PEP-19, especially Ile46 of the IQ dipeptide. This network of hydrophobic interactions may provide allosteric communication between the acidic loop and helical region of PEP-19 bound to apo C-CaM.</p>

However, the side chains of Asp31, Asp33 and Glu38 lie along the surface of the acidic sequence that opposes helix E and the first three residues in loop III of C-CaM (aa 93â95). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5c</xref> shows that the acidic residues in PEP-19 combine with Glu84, Glu87, Asp93 and Asp95 in C-CaM to form a large surface with significant negative ESP. This contrasts with the more neutral ESP shown for free apo CaM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>. A view of loop III from another angle in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> shows a foci of negative ESP is also formed from the side chains of Asp93 and Glu104.</p>

        <title>Effects of PEP(P37G) mutation on the acidic sequence</title>
        <p>We showed previously that replacing Pro37 with Gly (PEP(P37G)) greatly inhibits the ability of PEP-19 modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM, and to sensitize HeLa cells to ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref> shows that Pro37 terminates the helical segment of PEP-19, and intramolecular NOEs show that Pro37 and Ala36 interact with neighbouring residues to stabilize the transition between helical and coiled segments in PEP-19. Thus, a plausible hypothesis is that conversion of Pro37 to Gly confers a high degree of flexibility that inhibits residues 30â36 from properly interacting with CaM. To test this hypothesis, we used chemical shift perturbation mapping and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) to determine the effects of mutation of Pro37 on the structure and position of the acidic sequence.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref> shows that conversion of Pro37 to Gly causes relatively small amide chemical shift perturbations in free PEP-19 that are restricted to residues near Pro37. In contrast, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref> shows that when bound to apo C-CaM, large chemical shift differences between PEP-19 and PEP(P37G) extend the length of the acidic sequence from Asp31 to Glu40. In addition, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref> shows significantly reduced amide <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift dispersion for Asp31 to Glu40 in PEP(P37G) versus PEP-19 when bound to C-CaM, which suggests that the mutation destabilizes the acidic sequence. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>, which shows that residues 30â40 in PEP(P37G) bound to apo C-CaM have the greatest decrease in <sup>15</sup>N{<sup>1</sup>H} NOEs relative to the native complex.</p>
        <p>We next used PRE to determine if mutation of Pro37 to Gly in PEP-19 increases the distance between the acidic sequence and apo C-CaM. As described in the âMethods' section, Asp31 in both PEP-19 and PEP(P37G) was converted to Cys as a site for covalent modification with PROXYL to yield spin-labelled PEP-19SL and PEP(P37G)SL, respectively. The PRE effect was measured as the normalized cross-peak intensity ratio (<italic>I</italic><sub>ox</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>red</sub>) of each amide in the oxidized and reduced states. The grey bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> show the PRE effect on backbone amides in <sup>15</sup>N-labelled apo C-CaM bound to PEP-19SL. Similar to Battiste and Wagner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, a PRE effect was indicated by <italic>I</italic><sub>ox</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>red</sub> ratios of &lt;0.85 (see dashed horizontal line). The pattern of amide <italic>I</italic><sub>ox</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>red</sub> ratios correlates well with the location of the spin label on residue 31 near Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop III. Residues with amide <italic>I</italic><sub>ox</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>red</sub> ratios &lt;0.2, or that are broadened beyond detection by the oxidized spin label, include Asp93, Lys94 and Asp95, which are the first three residues in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop III, and Ile100 through Val108, which form Î²-strand III and extend into helix F. The <italic>I</italic><sub>ox</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>red</sub> ratios of &lt;0.5 are seen for Gly96 to Tyr99 in loop III. A significant PRE effect is also seen for Gln135 and Val136, which is consistent with the location of these two residues in a short beta strand in site IV that forms a beta sheet with residues in site III.</p>
        <p>The coloured vertical lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> show differences in <italic>I</italic><sub>ox</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>red</sub> for <sup>15</sup>N-labelled apo C-CaM when bound to PEP(P37G)SL versus PEP-19SL. A red line indicates that the distance between the corresponding backbone amide in C-CaM and the spin label bound to Cys31 is increased by mutation of Pro37 to Gly. Conversely, a blue line indicates a decreased distance. Large increases in <italic>I</italic><sub>ox</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>red</sub> ratios are seen for residues in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop III, helix F and Î²-strand IV when apo C-CaM is bound to PEP(P37G)SL versus PEP-19SL. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6b</xref> shows the position of these amide protons in the solution structure of the PEP-19:apo C-CaM complex. Taken together, these data demonstrate that conversion of Pro37 to Gly destabilizes the interaction between the acidic sequence and apo C-CaM, to increase the average distance between the acidic sequence and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site III, thus altering the orientation of the acidic side chains in PEP-19 relative to C-CaM, and likely affecting the negative ESP near Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site III.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report here the first structure of a complex between apo CaM and a protein that regulates the activity of CaM, instead of a target protein that is regulated by CaM. Our goal was to identify molecular mechanisms by which PEP-19 modulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM. We focused on the apo state since increasing the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to apo CaM by PEP-19 has the potential to regulate the temporal binding of CaM to a wide spectrum of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent target proteins. Structural features of the acidic sequence of PEP-19 were of special interests since it is necessary to both modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM and to sensitize HeLa cells to ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p>
      <p>First, this is fuzzy complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> since residues 1â29 in PEP-19 remain disordered when bound to apo C-CaM. Although this disordered sequence is not required to modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, it may interact with other cellular proteins since residues 10â20 have a high propensity to form a Î²-turn based on analysis with ProtScale ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/protscale/">http://web.expasy.org/protscale/</ext-link>). Second, the IQ motif (residues 38â58) adopts a regular Î±-helix that lies along the shallow hydrophobic groove in semi-open apo C-CaM. Finally, and most significantly, residues 30â37 of the acidic sequence in PEP-19 adopt an extended coil that associates with helices E and F in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site III of CaM primarily via a hydrophobic plug formed from Phe30, Ile32 and Met34 in PEP-19, which allows the acidic residues to extend toward the solvent.</p>
      <p>To gain mechanistic insights from the structure, it is important to discuss the characteristics of cooperative Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to sites III and IV in CaM. Structural dynamics at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels support the idea that the first Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds preferentially to site IV, but with rapid <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> rates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Since the overall rate of association of two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to the C-domain is slow, binding the second Ca<sup>2+</sup> to site III is rate-limiting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> but locks both Ca<sup>2+</sup> in place. The slow kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to site III may be due to an intra loop network of hydrogen bonds that surround the carboxyl group of Asp93 at position 1 in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop III, which must rearrange to allow the side chain of Asp93 to coordinate Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Association of the acidic sequence with Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site III places it in logical position to enhance the rate-limiting association of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with the C-domain. However, there are no structural features of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop III in the PEP-19:apo C-CaM complex that would clearly account for the increased rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> association. In particular, the intra loop hydrogen bonds persist in the PEP-19:apo C-CaM complex, since side chain oxygens of Asp93 are within 2â3âÃ from backbone amides of residues 94â99. Instead, we hypothesize that the primary mechanism for increasing the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> association involves increasing the negative ESP to steer Ca<sup>2+</sup> to site III.</p>
      <p>As described in the results section, acidic residues derived from C-CaM and PEP-19 generate a large surface with significant negative ESP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref> shows that the topology of this surface includes a channel formed between the side chains of Glu84 and Glu87 in C-CaM and Glu38 in PEP-19. The channel leads to a basin that resembles a catcher's mitt that is surrounded by Asp31, Asp33 and Glu38 from PEP-19, and Asp93 and Asp95 from C-CaM. This region of negative ESP could stabilize an initial encounter complex between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the PEP-19:apo C-CaM complex and allow transient two-dimensional diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is guided by the channel and basin surface topology and electrostatic gradients. An additional important feature is the location of Asp93, which is the first ligand for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in loop III. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref> shows that the backbone oxygen and beta protons of Asp93 contribute to formation of the negatively charged basin. As illustrated by the green arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>, we propose that electrostatic gradients and surface topology funnel or steer Ca<sup>2+</sup> to Asp93, and that this helps overcome the energy barrier presented by the intra loop hydrogen bonding network involving Asp93, thereby increasing the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and transition to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound form. Similar electrostatic steering to Asp93 and Glu104 may be supported by the negative ESP shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is well established that electrostatic interactions can increase the rate of protein-protein and protein-ligand association by orders of magnitude<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A specific role for ESP in modulating the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM by PEP-19 is supported by several observations, including our mutation analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Mutation of Asp31 or Asp33 to Ala, or Pro37 to Gly all significantly inhibit the ability of PEP-19 to modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, but mutation of Asp35 has little effect. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>, which shows that Asp31 and Asp33 surround the negatively charged basin, while Aps35 extends away from site III. Mutation of Pro37 to Gly has the greatest effect on the ability of PEP-19 because it destabilizes the interaction between the acidic sequence and site III of CaM, thereby affecting the relative position of multiple acidic residues. A causal relationship between negative ESP and fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> rates is also supported by EF-hands I, II and IV, which all have fast rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> association<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and all have extensive negatively charged ESP near the respective loops as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>. Finally, Martin <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> showed that acidic residues greatly affect the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> association with EF-hand motifs even though they do not directly participate in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. In this case, neutralization of acidic residues in the first EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site of calbindin 9K decreased the Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> by 45-fold. We propose that PEP-19 achieves the inverse by adding negative charge to increase the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> association.</p>
      <p>It is well known that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinity of CaM can be drastically increased on binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent target peptides and proteins due to stabilizing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound form and decreasing the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dissociation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The data presented here provide an additional molecular mechanism to modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM that may be shared by other proteins. Neurogranin (Ng), for example, is a small IQ motif protein that also binds to CaM in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and has an acidic sequence near its IQ motif. We showed that Ng increases the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dissociation from the C-domain of CaM to a similar extent as PEP-19, but has a lesser effect on the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> association<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Thus, Ng decreases the affinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C-domain of CaM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref> compares acidic sequences that extend N-terminal from the IQ dipeptide of PEP-19 and Ng. Positions corresponding to Phe30, Ile32 and Met34 in PEP-19, which anchor the acidic sequence to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site III in CaM, are also hydrophobic residues in Ng. On the basis of this, we predict that the global structure of the Ng:apo C-CaM complex will be very similar to the PEP-19:apo C-CaM complex. However, the distribution of acidic residues in Ng and PEP-19 are different, which we predict confers different Ca<sup>2+</sup> tuning properties. Another potential use of the acid/IQ motif is not as free regulator of CaM signalling, but as a module within the context of a larger Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent CaM target protein. In this scenario, the acidic/IQ motif would provide a docking site for apo CaM to modulate overall Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity, and allow CaM to reversibly transition to an adjacent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent site to regulate protein activation/inactivation in response to specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.</p>
      <p>In summary, the structure reported here shows a novel mode of interaction between apo CaM and a regulator of CaM signalling, and provides a molecular mechanism for modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM that may be shared by other proteins. From a broader perspective, the high content of polar and charged residues in intrinsically disordered proteins makes them well suited to modulate ligand binding by changing the surface topology and electrostatic potential on binding to target proteins.</p>
