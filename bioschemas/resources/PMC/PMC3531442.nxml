        <p>Endoglin (ENG), a co-receptor for several TGFÎ²-family cytokines, is expressed in dividing endothelial cells alongside ALK1, the <italic>ACVRL1</italic> gene product. <italic>ENG</italic> and <italic>ACVRL1</italic> are both required for angiogenesis and mutations in either gene are associated with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangectasia, a rare genetic vascular disorder. ENG and ALK1 function in the same genetic pathway but the relative contribution of TGFÎ² and BMP9 to SMAD1/5/8 activation and the requirement of ENG as a co-mediator of SMAD phosphorylation in endothelial cells remain debated. Here, we show that BMP9 and TGFÎ²1 induce distinct SMAD phosphorylation responses in primary human endothelial cells and that, unlike BMP9, TGFÎ² only induces SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in a subset of immortalized mouse endothelial cell lines, but not in primary human endothelial cells. We also demonstrate, using siRNA depletion of <italic>ENG</italic> and novel anti-ENG antibodies, that <italic>ENG</italic> is required for BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling in all human and mouse endothelial cells tested. Finally, anti-ENG antibodies that interfere with BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling, but not with TGFÎ²1/pSMAD3 signaling, also decrease <italic>in vitro</italic> HUVEC endothelial tube formation and inhibit BMP9 binding to recombinant ENG <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our data demonstrate that BMP9 signaling inhibition is a key and previously unreported mechanism of action of TRC105, an anti-angiogenic anti-Endoglin antibody currently evaluated in clinical trials.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Endoglin (ENG), a dimeric membrane glycoprotein also known as CD105, is differentially expressed at the surface of hypoxic or dividing endothelial cells (EC) and is expressed in the endothelium of virtually all solid tumors <xref rid="pone.0050920-Dallas1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050920-NolanStevaux1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. ENG can associate with a number of Type I and Type II TGFÎ² receptors and is defined as a Type III TGFÎ² co-receptor based on its homology to TGFBR3 (a.k.a. betaglycan) and its ability to bind diverse TGFÎ²-family cytokines including Activin, TGFÎ²1, BMP2, BMP7 and BMP9/10, in vitro <xref rid="pone.0050920-Castonguay1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> or in cell culture assays <xref rid="pone.0050920-Bernabeu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the key angiogenic function of ENG is linked to the function of the ALK1 receptor, the product of the <italic>Activin-like Receptor Kinase 1</italic> gene (<italic>ACVRL1</italic>) also preferentially expressed in EC <xref rid="pone.0050920-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050920-Urness1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. First, most individuals affected with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangectasia (HHT), an autosomal-dominant genetic disorder leading to severe vascular malformations, carry heterozygous mutations in either <italic>ENG</italic> (HHT type 1) or <italic>ACVRL1</italic> (HHT type 2) <xref rid="pone.0050920-Bailly1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Second, homozygous <italic>Eng</italic> and <italic>Alk1</italic> mutant mouse embryos closely phenocopy each other and die at day 11.5 from severe vascular malformations attributed to defective angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0050920-Sorensen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, ALK1 binds to ENG <xref rid="pone.0050920-Blanco1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and phosphorylates ENG in its cytoplasmic domain <xref rid="pone.0050920-Koleva1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Thus ALK1 and ENG function in the same genetic and biochemical pathways and result in the phosphorylation and activation of the SMAD1/5/8 sub-family of transcription factors in EC <xref rid="pone.0050920-Lamouille1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050920-David1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While genetic evidence clearly identifies ENG and ALK1 as co-receptors required for angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis, the ligand involved in mediating these endothelial functions is less well defined. TGFÎ² and BMP9 have both been proposed to be the key cytokine upstream of ALK1/pSMAD1/5/8 signaling in EC. Several observations support the TGFÎ² hypothesis: first, early studies showed that ENG is associated with TGFÎ² receptor type II in primary EC <xref rid="pone.0050920-Cheifetz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050920-Yamashita1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>; second, TGFÎ² was shown to trigger SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in mouse embryonic endothelial cells (MEEC) and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) <xref rid="pone.0050920-Goumans1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; and third, <italic>ENG</italic> is required for TGFÎ²/ALK1-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 in MEECs <xref rid="pone.0050920-Lebrin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These observations suggested a model whereby HHT is a TGFÎ²-dependent disease <xref rid="pone.0050920-Lebrin2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0050920-LopezNovoa1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>More recent evidence, however, indicates that BMP9 and BMP10, two highly related members of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein family, are the key cytokines upstream of ALK1/pSMAD1/5/8 signal transduction in EC. BMP9 and 10 were shown to induce ALK1-dependent SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in primary EC <xref rid="pone.0050920-David1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050920-Scharpfenecker1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. BMP9 and BMP10 appear to be the cognate ligands of ALK1 since BMP9 only associates with ALK1 and no other ALK receptor <xref rid="pone.0050920-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and ALK1 only binds to BMP9 and BMP10 but not to TGFÎ²1-3 or any other of the 26 ligands of the TGFÎ² family <xref rid="pone.0050920-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition, BMP9 is the factor in human plasma responsible for serum/plasma-induced SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in human micro-vascular endothelial cells from the dermis (HMVECd), a primary EC type <xref rid="pone.0050920-David2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Taken together, these observations support a model where HHT results from a deficit in BMP9-10 signaling <xref rid="pone.0050920-Bailly1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, a recent study showing that BMP9 and TGFÎ² cooperate to induce EC proliferation while antagonizing each other at the level of SMAD1/5/8 activation <xref rid="pone.0050920-Cunha1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> illustrates the ongoing and still unresolved debate surrounding the relative importance of TGFÎ² and BMP9 to SMAD1/5/8 activation in EC <xref rid="pone.0050920-Bailly1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050920-Pardali1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0050920-vanMeeteren1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Existing studies are also at odds regarding the importance and requirement of ENG for ALK1/pSMAD1/5/8 signaling in EC. For example, while ENG was shown to potentiate ALK1/pSMAD1 signaling in EC <xref rid="pone.0050920-David1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and to be required for TGFÎ²/SMAD1/5/8 signaling in MEECS <xref rid="pone.0050920-Lebrin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, a more recent study showed that ENG depletion, using an <italic>ENG</italic> siRNA, did not affect BMP9/SMAD1/5/8 signaling in human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPAEC) <xref rid="pone.0050920-Upton1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To better understand the mechanism of ENG inhibition that elicits an anti-angiogenic response, we analyzed the requirement of ENG for endothelial SMAD activation. Using primary human ECs, we demonstrate that SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation is achieved through BMP9, not TGFÎ² signaling, and that TGFÎ² induces a parallel, ENG-dependent, âcanonicalâ SMAD2/3 phosphorylation response in ECs. We also show, using siRNA and selective ENG-neutralizing antibodies that ENG is required for optimal BMP9 signal transduction in all human and mouse ECs tested. Finally, we find that these ENG-neutralizing antibodies induce profound defects in endothelial tube formation <italic>in vitro</italic>, thus identifying BMP9 signaling inhibition as a previously unreported mechanism of action of potentially therapeutic anti-angiogenic anti-ENG antibodies.</p>

A Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) capture Elisa assay was developed to detect phosphorylated SMAD1 and total SMAD1 in protein extracts. Fifty high density 96-well plates were custom-coated by MSD using 500 Î¼g of a monoclonal anti-SMAD1 antibody (Santa Cruz #sc-81378). Two different detection antibodies were used to detect phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 (Cell Signaling Technology #9511) and total SMAD1 (Cell Signaling Technology #9743). Detection was conducted using the recommended MSD's protocol and buffers. In brief, HUVECs were lifted with Accutase (Invitrogen #A1110501), washed 2x in PBS and plated in a 96-well plate at 2500 cells/well in 25 Î¼l of EBM medium (Lonza #CC-3121). After 3 hours of serum starvation, antibodies were added to the wells in 25 Î¼l of EBM. After 1 hour, 2.5 Î¼l of BMP9 (2 ng/ml) was added to each well.

        <title>BMP9, but not TGFÎ²1, induces SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in primary human EC</title>
        <p>To understand the role of ENG in endothelial cell signaling, we first tested the ability of TGFÎ²1 and BMP9 to induce SMAD phosphorylation in primary human ECs. First, we stimulated HUVECs with increasing levels of TGFÎ²1 or BMP9 following serum-starvation, to minimize base-line SMAD1/5/8 and SMAD3 phosphorylation detected in the presence of serum. Whereas TGFÎ²1 induced SMAD3 phosphorylation in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), it was not capable of triggering SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). BMP9, however, elicited a SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation response in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), indicating that the non-canonical âcross-overâ TGFÎ²1/pSMAD1/5/8 pathway <xref rid="pone.0050920-NolanStevaux1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> previously described in MEECS and BAEC <xref rid="pone.0050920-Goumans1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> was not operative in this primary EC type. Using quantitative PCR, we confirmed the up-regulation of the <italic>SMAD6</italic> mRNA upon BMP9 stimulation and of the <italic>SERPINE1</italic>/<italic>PAI-1</italic> mRNA upon TGFÎ²1 stimulation of HUVECs (Fig. S1), genes previously reported to be strongly induced in endothelial cells by BMP9 <xref rid="pone.0050920-David1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> or TGFÎ² <xref rid="pone.0050920-Goumans1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, respectively. To facilitate the assessment of SMAD1 phosphorylation (the SMAD from the SMAD1/5/8 sub-group whose mRNA is the most abundant in HUVECs by quantitative PCR â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), we developed a high throughput MSD assay to detect total and phosphorylated SMAD1 in cellular extracts (see Materials and Methods). We detected a clear dose-dependent BMP9/pSMAD1/5/8 response in HUVECs by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), as well as a dose-dependent BMP9/pSMAD1 response using our MSD assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Using this assay, we tested the response of four primary human EC types to BMP9 and TGFÎ²1 (HUVEC, HMVECd, HAEC and HPAEC). Again, we observed a robust BMP9/pSMAD1 but no TGFÎ²1/pSMAD1 response in each of these primary human EC types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

Levels of ENG, pSMAD1/5/8, SMAD1 and Î²-Actin in the total cell extracts were measured by western blotting.

        </fig>
        <p>We then tested the ability of antibodies raised against human or mouse ENG to block BMP9-induced phosphorylation of SMAD1 in HUVECs and mouse MS1 cells, respectively. We identified 72 human ENG-binding monoclonal antibodies and 230 mouse Eng-binding monoclonal antibodies. Out of these, 4 anti-human ENG antibodies (â¼6%) and 16 anti-mouse Eng antibodies (â¼7%) met our threshold for BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling inhibition in their respective EC type. We sub-cloned antibody M999, a Rat IgG2a anti-human ENG antibody with the ability to decrease BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling by &gt;60% in HUVECs, HAECs and HPAECs, when pre-incubated for 30 minutes prior to BMP9 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g002">Fig. 2BâC</xref>). The BMP9-blocking activity of M999 was comparable to that of cSN6j, a mouse/human chimeric antibody containing the published V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> sequences of the SN6j anti-ENG monoclonal antibody <xref rid="pone.0050920-Seon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> cloned in a human IgG2 antibody backbone (see Materials and Methods). A similar chimeric antibody called TRC105 was derived from the same monoclonal antibody SN6j but in a human IgG1 backbone and was recently tested in a Phase I clinical trial <xref rid="pone.0050920-Seon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. BMP9/pSMAD1 inhibition by the ENG-binding antibodies was not as pronounced as that of Ab3209, an anti-BMP9 neutralizing antibody serving as positive control, which inhibited BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling by &gt;80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g002">Fig. 2BâD</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also sub-cloned a Rat anti-mouse Eng antibody (M1043), which blocked BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling by â¼65% in MS1 cells, unlike two other sub-cloned mouse Eng-binding antibodies of the same isotype (M1041 and M1042), which have no effect on BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling and thus belong to the much larger group of anti-ENG antibodies that bind to their target but have no effect on BMP9 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Thus, Endoglin is required for BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling in human and mouse ECs.</p>

In this assay, GFP-labeled HUVECs co-cultured with unlabeled human dermal fibroblasts mimic angiogenesis by forming <italic>in vitro</italic> tubular vascular networks in the presence of Fetal Calf Serum and brain extracts, and in response to recombinant VEGF or bFGF. We observed that cSN6j, an anti-ENG antibody that inhibited BMP9 signaling in HUVECs by â¼60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), efficiently decreased HUVEC tube formation driven by VEGF (&gt;70% inhibition) or bFGF (&gt;60% inhibition), as measured by the density of Branch Points in the vascular network <xref rid="pone.0050920-Evensen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In this experiment, Suramin, a small molecule blocking multiple Receptor Tyrosine Kinases served as a positive control for tube formation inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). We also observed that M999, a second BMP9-interfering anti-ENG antibody, and cSN6j had comparable effects on HUVEC tube formation as a BMP9-neutralizing antibody (Ab3209) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>), indicating that BMP9 signal blockade through ENG neutralization phenocopies BMP9 signaling inhibition achieved with a BMP9-neutralizing antibody. The phenotypic effects of the M999 (anti-ENG) and Ab3209 (anti-BMP9) antibodies on endothelial tube formation can be visualized relative to control antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Finally, we observed that SN6h, another ENG-binding antibody that did not interfere with BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>), did not significantly impact HUVEC tube formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>), whereas TRC105, a chimeric antibody derived from SN6j and cloned in an IgG1 backbone (similar to the TRC105 antibody currently tested in the clinic) recapitulated the effect of the cSN6j antibody and inhibited both BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>) and HUVEC tube formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>).</p>

        <p>The relative contribution of BMP9 and TGFÎ² to SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in endothelial cells (EC) remains a matter of debate <xref rid="pone.0050920-NolanStevaux1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050920-David3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050920-vanMeeteren2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Our data strongly indicate that TGFÎ²1 does not trigger SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in primary ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The only primary EC type where TGFÎ²1/pSMAD1/5/8 has been described to date was bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) <xref rid="pone.0050920-Goumans1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; but that result has not be replicated <xref rid="pone.0050920-Scharpfenecker1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050920-Shao1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

        <title>Endoglin is required for the modulation of BMP9 and canonical TGFÎ² signaling in EC</title>
        <p>A second area of uncertainty in the field is whether ENG is a required co-mediator of BMP9/pSMAD1/5/8 signaling. ENG is required in MEEC <xref rid="pone.0050920-Lebrin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0050920-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> for TGFÎ²/pSMAD1/5/8 signaling. ENG is also capable of enhancing BMP9/pSMAD1/5/8 in primary HMVECds <xref rid="pone.0050920-David1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and TGFÎ²/pSMAD1/5/8 in immortalized human HMEC cells <xref rid="pone.0050920-Blanco1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In contrast, another study showed that ENG depletion by a siRNA had no impact on BMP9/pSMAD1/5/8 activation in primary HPAECs <xref rid="pone.0050920-Upton1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Here, we show that depletion of ENG by seven independent siRNA leads to a dramatic decrease in BMP9/pSMAD1/5/8 output in HUVECs and that a subset of anti-ENG antibodies is capable of inhibiting BMP9/pSMAD1/5/8 signaling in several mouse and human EC types, including HPAEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, we provide definitive evidence that ENG is required for optimal BMP9 signaling in all interrogated EC types.</p>
        <p>A third area of debate in the field is whether ENG is a required co-mediator of TGFÎ²/pSMAD2/3 signaling in ECs. In one report, immortalized MEEC expressing reduced levels of ENG displayed decreased SMAD2 phosphorylation in response to TGFÎ² <xref rid="pone.0050920-Goumans1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, but in another, immortalized HMEC cells transfected with an ENG siRNA exhibited elevated TGFÎ²/pSMAD2/3 signaling output <xref rid="pone.0050920-Blanco1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Here, we find that ENG depletion using multiple siRNAs against ENG leads to decreased TGFÎ²1/pSMAD3 signaling in primary HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Our data, obtained in primary HUVECs, support a model in which ENG is a positive co-mediator of canonical TGFÎ²1/pSMAD3 signaling in normal ECs. Supporting this model, ENG antibodies that inhibit TGFÎ²/pSMAD2 signaling have been reported <xref rid="pone.0050920-GazitBornstein1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, but their effect on BMP9 signaling was not explored. A direct comparison of âpureâ BMP9-blocking and âpureâ TGFÎ²-blocking ENG antibodies should enable a clearer delineation of the respective contributions of the BMP9/pSMAD1/5/8 and the TGFÎ²1/pSMAD2/3 signaling cascades to physiological EC function. In addition, to establish if tumor-associated ECs behave like primary endothelial cells with regards to their BMP9 and TGFÎ² signaling capabilities, a clear next step in the field would be to isolate patient-derived tumor ECs and test their respective pSMAD1/5/8 and pSMAD2/3 outputs in response to BMP9 and TGFÎ² stimulation.</p>

        <title>BMP9 signaling inhibition is a mechanism of action of anti-angiogenic ENG antibodies</title>
        <p>Because of the confusion surrounding the ENG/ALK1 signaling pathway, the signaling mechanism of action of anti-angiogenic ENG antibodies is not well understood <xref rid="pone.0050920-Seon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. While it is clear that soluble ENG can serve as a sink for BMP9/10 and thus inhibit BMP9 signaling in primary EC <xref rid="pone.0050920-Castonguay1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, it wasn't established if anti-angiogenic ENG antibodies influenced BMP9 signaling. Here, we show for the first time that a small subset of ENG-binding antibodies inhibit BMP9/ALK1/pSMAD1/5/8 signaling and do not affect canonical TGFÎ²1/ALK5/pSMAD3 signaling in HUVECs.</p>
        <p>In addition, we show that the BMP9 signal inhibition obtained with anti-ENG antibodies is sufficient to significantly block <italic>in vitro</italic> HUVEC tube formation to a similar degree as a BMP9-neutralizing antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

Our data obtained with ENG-neutralizing antibodies reinforce this notion that partial loss of ENG-dependent signaling is sufficient to impinge angiogenesis. Because TRC105, the chimeric anti-ENG antibody based on the SN6j sequence currently in clinical trials, is a human IgG1 antibody, it is capable of eliciting an Antibody Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity (ADCC) response on ENG-expressing ECs <xref rid="pone.0050920-Seon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and this functionality is thought to contribute to the anti-angiogenic mechanism of action of this antibody <xref rid="pone.0050920-Tsujie1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, our data strongly support a model whereby BMP9 signaling inhibition is also part of the anti-angiogenic mechanism of action of TRC105, since this antibody is capable of blocking BMP9 signaling and vessel formation in an <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenesis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

A recent publication demonstrating that BMP9 signaling inhibition is also a mechanism of action of an anti-ALK1 anti-angiogenic antibody currently in clinical trial supports our observation that BMP9 is the key cytokine signaling upstream of the ENG/ALK1/pSMAD1/5/8 pathway <xref rid="pone.0050920-vanMeeteren3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> in endothelial cells.</p>

        <title>TRC105 and M999 inhibit endogenous BMP9 in tube formation assays</title>
        <p>Antibodies M999 and TRC105 phenocopy the anti-BMP9 neutralizing antibody in the HUVEC tube formation assay, suggesting that endogenous levels of BMP9 in the media used in the tubulogenesis assay is sufficient to drive tube formation in the absence of extrinsic BMP9. In our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays detecting pSMAD1/5/8 upon BMP9 stimulation, the cells were always starved and therefore showed very little endogenous pSMAD1/5/8 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). However, FCS on its own is capable of inducing SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation (Fig. S4). Several studies have demonstrated that endogenous BMP9 mediates most of the SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation activity detected in serum and plasma: BMP9 concentration was measured to be â¼7.5 ng/ml in human serum <xref rid="pone.0050920-David2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and â¼2 ng/ml in mouse plasma <xref rid="pone.0050920-Bidart1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In addition, FCS <xref rid="pone.0050920-vanMeeteren3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and rat serum <xref rid="pone.0050920-Bidart1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> were shown to contain endogenous activity triggering SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in HUVEC and in rat aortic cells, respectively, which could be neutralized in each case with the same anti-BMP9 antibody used in this study. We conclude that in the tubulogenesis assays presented here, just as in a previously-described HUVEC sprouting assay <xref rid="pone.0050920-vanMeeteren3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, endogenous BMP9 contained in the FCS used at 2% concentration is sufficient to promote HUVEC tube formation and is inhibited by ENG or BMP9 antibodies.</p>
        <p>We also note that the clear inhibition of endothelial tube formation with antibodies M999 and TRC105 occurs in the context of a media containing FBS, indicating that these ENG targeting antibodies can disrupt endothelial cell function in the presence of physiological levels TGFÎ²1. Based on the levels of TGFÎ²1 found in normal human serum (40 to 180 ng/ml) <xref rid="pone.0050920-Wakefield1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, we extrapolate that tube formation occurring in 2% FBS happens in the presence of 0.8 to 3.6 ng/ml of TGFÎ²1, a concentration comparable to the bio-active concentration of TGFÎ²1 found in normal human plasma, reported to range from 1.7 to 3.2 ng/ml <xref rid="pone.0050920-Wakefield1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Our study demonstrates that endogenous TGFÎ²1 found in FCS is not capable of preventing endothelial tube formation disruption by anti-ENG antibodies.</p>

        <title>Binding properties of TRC105 and inhibition of BMP9 binding to recombinant ENG</title>
        <p>Our data indicate that a distinct region of the ENG orphan domain is involved in BMP9 signaling inhibition but does not affect TGFÎ² signaling. The ENG orphan domain is defined as the portion of the protein located between amino acids E26 and I359 <xref rid="pone.0050920-Llorca1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, which binds to BMP9 <xref rid="pone.0050920-Castonguay1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050920-Alt1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The binding regions of SN6h, SN6j and SN6 have been previously mapped to the orphan domain: SN6h binds between A119 and G230, SN6j/TRC105 between P231 and E276 and SN6 between Y277 and P338 <xref rid="pone.0050920-She1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Since TRC105 and M999 compete with each other for ENG binding, they likely recognize overlapping epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Moreover, among the four anti-ENG antibodies tested, only M999 and TRC105 inhibit BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling in EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>), whereas SN6 and SN6h do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g004">Fig. 4F</xref> and Fig. S5). In addition, the blocking of BMP9 signaling by TRC105 and M999 is directly correlated with their ability to inhibit the binding of BMP9 to recombinant ENG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Thus, the P231-E276 region of the orphan domain of ENG appears to be structurally important for BMP9 binding to ENG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050920-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, our work clearly outlines the requirement for ENG in mediating parallel BMP9/ALK1/pSMAD1/5/8 and TGFÎ²1/ALK5/pSMAD3 signaling pathways in primary human endothelial cells and implicates BMP9 signaling inhibition as a mechanism of action of a subset of anti-ENG antibodies, including M999, a novel anti-ENG antibody and TRC105, currently in clinical development.</p>

<bold>SN6 does not affect BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling in HUVECs.</bold> HUVECs were dispensed in each well of a 96-well plate (2500 cells/well) and incubated in serum free media for 3 hours. Antibodies were added to the cells at various concentrations 1 hour prior to stimulation with BMP9 (0.1 ng/ml) (+) or PBS (â) for 30 min. After cell lysis, levels of pSMAD1 normalized for levels of total SMAD1 were monitored using a SMAD1/pSMAD1 MSD assay. The following antibodies were used: mIgG1k (mouse IgGik isotype control), SN6 (mouse IgG1k anti-human ENG monoclonal antibody), TRC105 (human IgG1 anti-human ENG monoclonal antibody). Results are the mean +/â standard deviation of technical triplicates (Îâ=âP value&gt;0.05).</p>
