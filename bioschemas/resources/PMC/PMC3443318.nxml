        <p id="P2">Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a dominantly inherited congenital malformation disorder caused by mutations in the cohesin-loading protein NIPBL<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> for nearly 60% of individuals with classical CdLS<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and in the core cohesin components SMC1A (~5%) and SMC3 (&lt;1%) for a smaller fraction of probands<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In humans, the multi-subunit complex cohesin is comprised of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21 and a STAG protein to form a ring structure proposed to encircle sister chromatids to mediate sister chromatid cohesion (SCC)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> as well as play key roles in gene regulation<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. SMC3 is acetylated during S-phase to establish cohesiveness of chromatin-loaded cohesin<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and in yeast, HOS1, a class I histone deacetylase, deacetylates SMC3 during anaphase<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Here we report the identification of HDAC8 as the vertebrate SMC3 deacetylase as well as loss-of-function <italic>HDAC8</italic> mutations in six CdLS probands. Loss of HDAC8 activity results in increased SMC3 acetylation (SMC3-ac) and inefficient dissolution of the âusedâ cohesin complex released from chromatin in both prophase and anaphase. While SMC3 with retained acetylation is loaded onto chromatin, ChIP-Seq analysis demonstrates decreased occupancy of cohesin localization sites that results in a consistent pattern of altered transcription seen in CdLS cell lines with either <italic>NIPBL</italic> or <italic>HDAC8</italic> mutations.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P3">Human SMC3 is acetylated by ESCO1 and ESCO2, homologues of yeast ECO1 and has been shown to be important for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Using a monoclonal antibody specific for acetylated SMC3 (SMC3-ac)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, we found that although total SMC3 levels remain stable throughout the cell cycle, SMC3-ac rapidly disappears during mitosis suggesting coordinated deacetylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">We therefore used RNA interference-based screening of all known human HDACs and Sirtuins to identify HDAC8 as the vertebrate SMC3 deacetylase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Loss of HDAC8 activity using either <italic>HDAC8</italic> RNAi or the HDAC8-specific inhibitor PCI-34051 (PCI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) does not alter cell cycle progression, but clearly increases SMC3-ac in both soluble and chromatin fractions throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref> lanes 4 and 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> lanes 18-22, 29-33, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref> lanes 22-28 and 36-42). Nearly all of HDAC8 is present in the soluble fraction in both asynchronous and synchronized cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,e</xref>). These data indicate that HDAC8 is present and active throughout the cell cycle, and that soluble SMC3-ac is its deacetylation target, similar to Hos1 in yeast<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Notably, the increase of SMC3-ac in the soluble fraction in the absence of HDAC8 activity implies that SMC3-ac is able to dissociate from chromatin but fails to be deacetylated. In addition, we unexpectedly observed few sister-chromatid cohesion defects with loss of HDAC8 activity alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">To understand the role of HDAC8 in genome-wide regulation of cohesin dynamics, we performed ChIP-Seq analysis of synchronized HeLa cells transfected with control or <italic>HDAC8</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and immunoprecipitated with either an anti-RAD21 antibody to detect total cohesin or with an anti-SMC3-ac antibody. Although total cellular cohesin shows no decrease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>), and there is a high degree of overlap between SMC3-ac, cohesin and CTCF<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> localization sites in treated and untreated cells, high read numbers and tight correlations between experimental replicates enabled us to identify a 17% loss of total cohesin localization peaks with reduced HDAC8 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d-h</xref>). Furthermore, despite using conditions that increase total SMC3-ac more than two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>), we note a 16% loss of SMC3-ac localization sites with HDAC8 reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5f-g</xref>). Finally, we found that in both control and HDAC8-depleted cells, SMC3-ac preferentially localizes to downstream regions of genes relative to the distribution of RAD21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5f-g</xref>). Together, this data demonstrates decreased occupancy of cohesin localization sites with the loss of HDAC8 activity, an observation similarly noted for <italic>NIPBL</italic> haploinsufficient CdLS cells<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P6">With the known role of cohesin regulation in CdLS and the observations that reduction of either HDAC8 or NIPBL lead to decreased cohesin occupancy of localization sites, we hypothesized that <italic>HDAC8</italic> mutations may cause CdLS. We screened this X-linked gene in 154 individuals with CdLS negative for mutations in <italic>NIPBL</italic>, <italic>SMC1A</italic> and <italic>SMC3</italic>, as well as <italic>RAD21</italic>, <italic>STAG2</italic>, <italic>ESCO1</italic>, <italic>ESCO2</italic> and <italic>MAU2/SCC4</italic>. We identified four <italic>de novo</italic> missense mutations and one <italic>de novo</italic> nonsense mutation in <italic>HDAC8</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In addition, one familial mutation (c.1001A&gt;G; p.H334R) was identified in a boy, his mildly affected sister and his unaffected mother, where the mutant allele was inactivated in her blood. This mutation was also one of the <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in an unrelated girl. None of the mutations were seen in 290 ethnically matched control chromosomes or in 629 individuals of the 1000 Genomes Project<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Despite the small numbers and the varied clinical features in females due to random X-inactivation, these children demonstrate growth, cognitive and facial features consistent with those caused by mutations in <italic>NIPBL</italic> (âclassicalâ CdLS). Both expression studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>) and X-inactivation studies (data not shown) demonstrate complete skewing toward the normal allele in the blood of females with <italic>HDAC8</italic> mutations, indicating strong selection against the mutation. This limited the number of cell lines available for subsequent studies. However, immunoblotting demonstrated minimal HDAC8 protein expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from a hemizygous boy with a p.G320R mutation as well as the skin fibroblasts from a female Lyonized to express a p.H180R mutant allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), indicating protein instability in each case. Consistent with this, assessment of SMC3-ac demonstrates increased levels in both the p.G320R LCLs and the p.H180R fibroblasts, while the total amount of SMC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) and cell cycle distribution for the LCLs are unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">We expressed the HDAC8 missense mutations in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified and assayed each for deacetylase activity. These data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) demonstrate that the p.H180R mutation severely abrogates HDAC8 deacetylase activity, and demonstrate significant activity losses for the p.G320R, p.T311M and p.H334R mutations, consistent with high conservation of each residue and position in the structure of HDAC8âsubstrate complexes <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6c-e</xref>). Finally, purified wild type, but not mutant HDAC8, can rescue the SMC3 overacetylation seen in <italic>HDAC8</italic> mutant LCLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6g,h</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">We have previously demonstrated that mutations in <italic>NIPBL</italic>, the primary cause of CdLS, result in consistent, reproducible changes of genes expressed from LCLs derived from individuals with CdLS<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Using Nanostring multiplex expression analysis to avoid variation introduced by PCR or RNA amplification-based assessments and a previously validated 32-gene CdLS classifier set<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, we compared expression of LCLs from the male with the p.G320R mutation and from two girls (with the p.H180R and p.H334R mutations) who express only the normal allele in these cells, to 10 normal controls and 12 LCLs with loss of function <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutations. In this assay, the aggregate 32-gene LCL expression profile of the single male with an <italic>HDAC8</italic> mutation strongly correlates with that seen of <italic>NIPBL</italic>-mutant cell lines, while the profile for the two female lines, which express the wild type allele, correlates with normal controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that loss of HDAC8 activity results in widespread transcriptional dysregulation as seen in <italic>NIPBL</italic>-mutated CdLS cells. The loss of cohesin binding sites in both <italic>HDAC8</italic> RNAi-depleted HeLa cells and <italic>NIPBL</italic>-mutant LCLs<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> was also noted in the p.G320R HDAC8 mutant LCLs and fibroblasts derived from the girl with the p.H180R mutation, where small but consistent changes in transcriptional dysregulation were also noted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs 6a</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">8</xref>). Together these data suggest that loss of HDAC8 activity leads to a common pathogenic mechanism for âclassicalâ CdLS that converges on the reduction of bound cohesin complexes.</p>
    <p id="P9">To further understand the endogenous effect of HDAC8 loss on cohesin, we compared each cohesin subunit in chromatin-bound and unbound fractions in the LCLs with a hemizygous p.G320R mutation versus control LCLs and unexpectedly noted accumulation of RAD21 fragments in HDAC8 mutant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>, lanes 2,4,6). Using a RAD21 N-terminal-specific antibody, we verified accumulation of the RAD21 N-terminal separase cleavage fragment (RAD21-N) in mutant LCLs, HDAC8 RNAi treated HeLa cells and HDAC8-mutated fibroblasts expressing catalytically inactive HDAC8 versus wild type HDAC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). The accumulation of this cleavage fragment in the chromatin-bound fraction of HDAC8-mutant cells suggests that it may remain bound to the cohesin complex, so we assessed whether RAD21-N co-immunoprecipitates with other cohesin subunits. In HDAC8 mutant cells, RAD21-N co-immunoprecipitates with SMC1A, SMC3, STAG1, and STAG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), strongly suggesting that without functional HDAC8, the cleaved N-terminus of RAD21 remains attached to the cohesin complex, presumably via acetylated SMC3<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. To further confirm that clearance of cleaved RAD21 is dependent on HDAC8, we performed complementary analyses in synchronized HeLa cells with or without the HDAC8 inhibitor PCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). These data demonstrate the appearance of the N-terminal and C-terminal RAD21 fragments upon entry into mitosis (marked by H3S10-P) and activation of separase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, lanes 9-12 and 21-24) as well as their persistence in both soluble and chromatin fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> lanes 18-20) when most cells are in G1 phase (data not shown). In contrast, in untreated cells, these cleavage products are predominantly detected in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> lanes 2-4), and largely disappear 3 h post-release.</p>
    <p id="P10">We also made several observations regarding HDAC8 activity in the prophase removal of cohesin<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Loss of HDAC8 activity does not disrupt the prophase pathway of cohesin removal from chromatin, as demonstrated by a consistent reduction of chromatin-bound cohesin in the presence of metaphase inhibitors in either control or PCI-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, lanes 13 and 17 vs. 21-24). However, HDAC8 activity is necessary following prophase removal since, in metaphase inhibitor-treated cells, soluble SMC3-ac is markedly increased in the presence of PCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, lanes 9-12). Finally, with WAPAL depletion, which diminishes prophase removal of cohesin<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, we noted that SMC3-ac is substantially increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9e</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P11">To test whether other cohesion-promoting proteins might remain associated with SMC3-ac in the absence of HDAC8 activity, we analyzed HeLa and patient-derived cells, which also demonstrated increased retention of Sororin<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and RAD21-N, but not WAPAL, on soluble SMC3-ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9d</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that HDAC8 is necessary for deacetylation of SMC3 following its removal from chromatin in both prophase and anaphase pathways to allow proper dissolution of pro-cohesive elements and allow for recycling of ârefreshedâ cohesin for the following cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">In summary, this work demonstrates that HDAC8 functions as a vertebrate SMC3 deacetylase to facilitate renewal of cohesin following its removal from chromatin in prophase or anaphase and that loss of HDAC8 activity results in decreased cohesin at localized sites to cause both cellular and clinical features of CdLS.</p>

Gel-purified amplified DNA between 100 and 150bp was sequenced on the Applied Biosystems SOLiD platforms (SOLiD 3 and 5500) to generate single-end 50-bp reads. Sequenced reads of both ChIP and WCE were aligned to the human genome (UCSC hg19) using Bowtie<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> allowing 3 mismatches in the first 28 bases per read (ân3 option). All duplicate reads and those without unique alignment were removed from further analysis. Sequencing, read and mapping data are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>. We further analyzed only uniquely aligned reads. Each aligned read was extended to a predicted fragment length of 150bp. Reads were summed in 10bp bins along the chromosome for ChIP and WCE, respectively. To facilitate comparison of detected peaks between different ChIP experiments, we normalized the read number of each bin per million uniquely mapped reads for that chromosome for both ChIP and WCE samples (i.e. read number for each bin * 1,000,000 / total number of reads mapped onto reference genomes). This value was further smoothed with a 500bp width (50 bins). Scanning the genome with a 300 bp (30 bin) sliding window, a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed to estimate the enrichment p-value for each window. The fold enrichment (ChIP/WCE) for each window was also calculated. To call peaks, we employed stringent criteria to identify windows which satisfied both fold enrichment &gt; 3.0 and p-value &lt; 1e-4 criteria for candidate binding sites<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. To further eliminate uncertain sites, we removed the regions with low ChIP reads using the criteria: 1). the average number of ChIP reads in region / the average number of ChIP reads in the genome &lt; 3.0 or 2). the maximum read intensity in ChIP bins was less than 0.2 per million reads mapped.

Multiply aligned reads were divided equally amongst all locations (N-times matched reads were weighted as 1/N reads). Reads that aligned to reference database more than 10 times were discarded.

        <title>HDAC8 is an SMC3 deacetylase</title>
        <p><bold>a,</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with <italic>HDAC8</italic> siRNA (Lanes 1-4) or incubated with 25 Î¼M PCI, the HDAC8-specific inhibitor (Lanes 5-9) for the indicated times. Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-SMC3-ac, SMC3 and HDAC8 antibodies. Numbers beneath SMC3-ac bands indicate quantification of SMC3-ac levels normalized to SMC3 levels and the 0 hour time point. <bold>b,</bold> Acetylated SMC3 was prepared by co-immunoprecipitation with SMC1A from HeLa cell chromatin extracts. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with recombinant purified HDAC8 or mutant HDAC8 protein at 30Â°C for 1 h and analyzed by immunoblotting as in (a). <bold>c,</bold> Unsynchronized HeLa cells transfected with <italic>HDAC8</italic> siRNA for 48 h were fractionated into soluble and chromatin fractions and immunoblotted as in (a). <bold>d,</bold> HeLa cells were synchronized by double thymidine arrest and released into the presence or absence of 25 Î¼M PCI for the indicated time and verified by FACS analysis for cell cycle progression. <bold>e,</bold> Cell extracts of the PCI-treated cells in (d) were fractionated into soluble and chromatin fractions and were analyzed by immunoblotting as in (a). Histone H3 Serine 10 phosphorylation (H3S10P) is a marker of prophase and the onset of mitosis.</p>
