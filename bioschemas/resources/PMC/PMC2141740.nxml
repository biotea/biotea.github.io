      <abstract>
        <p>Abstract. Transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) signaling involves interactions of at least two different receptors, types I (TÎ²RI) and II (TÎ²RII), which form ligand-mediated heteromeric complexes. Although we have shown in the past that TÎ²RII in the absence of ligand is a homodimer on the cell surface, TÎ²RI has not been similarly investigated, and the site of complex formation is not known for either receptor. Several studies have indicated that homomeric interactions are involved in TGF-Î² signaling and regulation, emphasizing the importance of a detailed understanding of the homooligomerization of TÎ²RI or TÎ²RII. Here we have combined complementary approaches to study these homomeric interactions in both naturally expressing cell lines and cells cotransfected with various combinations of epitope-tagged type I or type II receptors. We used sedimentation velocity of metabolically labeled receptors on sucrose gradients to show that both TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII form homodimer-sized complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum, and we used coimmunoprecipitation studies to demonstrate the existence of type I homooligomers. Using a technique based on antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of receptors carrying different epitope tags, we have demonstrated ligand-independent homodimers of TÎ²RI on the surface of live cells. Soluble forms of both receptors are secreted as monomers, indicating that the ectodomains are not sufficient to mediate homodimerization, although TGF-Î²1 is able to promote dimerization of the type II receptor ectodomain. These findings may have important implications for the regulation of TGF-Î² signaling.</p>

  <body>
    <p>T<sc>ransforming</sc> growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²)<sup>1</sup> is a multipotent cytokine involved in a wide range of biological functions including cell growth, apoptosis, production of extracellular matrix, wound healing, and differentiation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Three high-affinity transmembrane receptors for TGF-Î² were identified, first through cross-linking of radiolabeled ligand and later by cDNA cloning: the type I (TÎ²RI, 55 kD), type II (TÎ²RII, 75 kD), and type III (280 kD) receptors (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII appear to be the signaling receptors, while the type III receptor presents ligand to TÎ²RII and I (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII are serine-threonine kinases with cysteine-rich extracellular domains and 41% identity between their kinase domains (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In the absence of TÎ²RI, the type II receptor can bind TGF-Î² but does not transduce signal (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). On the other hand, TÎ²RI can be cross-linked to radiolabeled TGF-Î² only in the presence of TÎ²RII (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The TÎ²RII kinase is constitutively active (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and autophosphorylation on several serine residues regulates its activity and interactions with TÎ²RI (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The binding of TGF-Î²1 to TÎ²RII mediates the formation of a heteromeric complex of TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII and the phosphorylation of specific serine residues in TÎ²RI by TÎ²RII (36, 43, 44; Wells, R., L. Gilboa, Y. Henis, and H. Lodish, manuscript in preparation). This phosphorylation activates TÎ²RI kinase activity and promotes its interactions with downstream effector molecules, including members of the SMAD family (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p>
    <p>Both the type II (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and the type III (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) TGF-Î² receptors form ligand-independent homooligomers (probably dimers) on the cell surface. That this is functionally important for the type II receptor is shown by studies demonstrating that homooligomerization of TÎ²RII is involved in both positive and negative regulation of signal transduction via intermolecular autophosphorylation of specific serine residues (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). So far, there is no direct physical evidence for TÎ²RI homomeric complexes. Two lines of evidence, however, suggest that the TGF-Î² receptor signaling complex contains at least two type I receptors: chimeric proteins with the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor and the cytoplasmic domain of a constitutively active TÎ²RI mutant are not active unless dimerized by Epo (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and functionally complementary TÎ²RI mutants falling into two classes, termed kinase defective and activation defective, have been isolated (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p>
    <p>We report here a detailed investigation of TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII homooligomer formation. We have studied cell lines that express native TGF-Î² receptors as well as cells cotransfected with various combinations of epitope-tagged receptors using several complementary approaches: sucrose gradient velocity centrifugation to determine the size of the receptor complexes, coimmunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence copatching studies to detect receptor oligomerization on the surface of live cells. We show that both TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII form homodimers in the ER and that the extracellular region alone is insufficient for dimerization of either receptor. Our results further demonstrate that, similar to the type II receptor (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), TÎ²RI forms ligand- and DTT-independent homooligomers on the surface of live COS7 cells. These results have important implications for our understanding of the events involved in TGF-Î² signaling.</p>

        <p>TGF-Î²1 was supplied by Celltrix Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA) and R &amp; D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) and was radioiodinated for affinity labeling of tagged receptors as described (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). For affinity labeling of soluble receptors, radioiodination was modified as described (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). 9E10 (Î±-myc) mouse ascites, which recognizes a specific c-myc sequence (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), was purchased from Harvard Monoclonals (Boston, MA). 12CA5 (Î±-HA) mouse ascites, which recognizes an epitope of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), was from BAbCO (Richmond, CA). IgG fractions were prepared from mouse ascites by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). F (abâ²)<sub>2</sub> fragments were generated by pepsin digestion, following the protocol of Kurkela et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Fluorophore-labeled affinity-purified antibodies and Cy3-streptavidin were obtained from <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="jackson">Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories</named-content> (West Grove, PA). All the F (abâ²)<sub>2</sub> preparations were reduced by mercaptoethanol and alkylated with iodoacetamide to generate monovalent Fabâ² fragments (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). To eliminate possible traces of IgG, the Fabâ² preparations were treated with protein AâSepharose (for 12CA5 or goat IgG) or protein GâSepharose (for 9E10 IgG). The resulting Fabâ² were free of contamination by F (abâ²)<sub>2</sub> or IgG, as judged by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions.</p>

        <title>Epitope Tagging of TÎ²RI</title>
        <p>Epitope tagging was performed according to Kolodziej and Young (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) using site-directed mutagenesis on uracil-containing single-stranded phagemids (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The human TGF-Î²RI (ALK5) cDNA (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) was inserted into the SV-40 expression vector pcDNA-I (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) via HindIII and NotI sites on the polylinker. Using this vector, which also carries an M13 origin of replication, single-stranded phagemids were grown in a dut<sup>â</sup> ung<sup>â</sup>
<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain (CJ236/P3; Invitrogen Corp.) with M13K07 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) as helper phage. Site- directed mutagenesis on this template was performed with mutagenic oligonucleotides encoding the epitope-tag sequence flanked by the sequences corresponding to nucleotides 66â81 (on the 5â² end) and 82â97 (3â² end) of the human TÎ²RI (counting the A of the methionine codon of the cDNA as 1). The tag sequences used encoded either the HA epitope YPYDVPDYA or the human c-myc epitope EQKLISEEDL. Each tag was inserted in-frame, nine bases downstream of the putative signal peptide sequence. Double-stranded pcDNA-I preparations with inserts of wild-type TÎ²RI or the epitope-tagged receptors were digested by XbaI, cutting in two places (at the 3â² of the polylinker and at position 706 in the TÎ²RI coding sequence). The 1.6-kb piece from the wild-type, untagged receptor encoding most of the coding region of the cDNA was ligated with the 4.9-kb piece from the myc- or HA-tagged NH <sub>2</sub>-terminal TÎ²RI sequences and the cloning vector pcDNA-I. The resulting constructs contained as insert all of the TÎ²RI coding region, most of which was derived from the wild-type, untagged receptor clone, and the NH <sub>2</sub>-terminal region (including the tag) derived from the tagged receptor clone. The coding regions derived from the tagged cDNAs were verified by DNA sequencing.</p>

        <title>Construction of HA-tagged Soluble Receptors</title>
        <p>To construct an HA-tagged secreted form of the TÎ²RII ectodomain (II-SF), a HindIII-PstI fragment of the full-length HA-tagged TÎ²RII (TÎ²RII-HA; 12) containing the 5â² region of the ectodomain was ligated into a PstI-HindIII fragment of the type IIâsecreted receptor (containing the 3â² region of the ectodomain) in pcDNA-I (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). For the experiments below, the construct was moved into the vector pcDNA-I/Amp (Invitrogen Corp.) via the HindIII-XbaI sites of the multiple cloning region.</p>
        <p>A secreted form of TÎ²RI was constructed by using PCR to insert a stop codon at the 5â² end of the transmembrane domain, just upstream of a PvuII site, replacing Leu<sup>126</sup>. The mutated cDNA was then cut with EcoRI (at the insertion site on the 5â² end) and PvuII and was inserted into the EcoRI and EcoRV sites of pcDNA-I/Amp (untagged I-SF). The HA-tagged full-length receptor was cut with HindIII (in the vector) and XhoI (cuts in the ectodomain sequences). The fragment containing the HA-tag was inserted into a backbone of the untagged I-SF cut with HindIII and XhoI (partial digest, with cut in the ectodomain), to yield the HA-tagged secreted form of TÎ²RI (I-SF). The sequence in regions derived from PCR amplification was confirmed by sequencing.</p>

The medium was replaced with fresh starvation medium supplemented with 0.2 mM oxidized glutathione (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="boehringer">Boehringer Mannheim Corp.</named-content>, Indianapolis, IN) and 0.5 mCi/ml of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and [<sup>35</sup>S]cysteine (Express; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="nen">New England Nuclear</named-content>, Beverly, MA) and incubated at 37Â°C for 15 or 30 min.

Gradients were centrifuged in an SW60 rotor (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="beckman">Beckman Instruments</named-content>, Fullerton, CA) at 60,000 rpm for 8 h at 4Â°C. 250-Î¼l fractions were removed sequentially from the top of each gradient using a hand-held pipettor. To analyze size standards, 25-Î¼l aliquots were removed from each fraction and were separated by 8â15% gradient SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie blue staining. The remainder of each fraction was brought to 0.5 ml (1 ml for +SDS samples) with IP buffer (0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, in PBS, pH 8.0) and immunoprecipitated with (<italic>a</italic>) 10 Î¼l/ml of a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the COOH-terminal 16 amino acids of TÎ²RII (Î±-IIC; reference <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>); (<italic>b</italic>) 15 Î¼l/ml of a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain of TÎ²RI (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>); or (<italic>c</italic>) 1 Î¼l/ml Î±-HA ascites.

Beads were rinsed twice with IP buffer (with 0.5% SDS for type II receptor immunoprecipitations) and once with PBS and eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Control immunoprecipitants (from lysates treated identically, but not run on gradients) were eluted into 0.5% SDS and one half of each was digested overnight at 37Â°C with endoglycosidase H (Endo H; Genzyme Corp., Boston, MA; 100 mIU/ml) in the presence of 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.

After washing twice with cold HBSS/Hepes/ BSA, the cells were incubated in the same buffer (4Â°C, 2 h) with normal goat IgG (200 Î¼g/ml) to block nonspecific binding.

        <title>TÎ²RI Forms Homodimers in the ER</title>
        <p>Two different experiments in the literature have provided functional evidence that TÎ²RI forms homooligomers within the signaling complex and that this oligomerization is functionally relevant (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The oligomeric structure of TÎ²RI either in the ER or the plasma membrane has not been thoroughly characterized, however, and there is no conclusive evidence for physical interactions between TÎ²RI polypeptides in the absence of ligand and the type II receptor. We therefore used sucrose gradient velocity centrifugation of metabolically labeled receptors to determine relative complex size. This approach was chosen since chemical cross-linking of TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII has not been possible (data not shown). We used L6 rat myoblasts, which are TGF-Î² responsive and which express both of the signaling receptors but lack the type III TGF-Î² receptor that may form complexes with TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII and could therefore complicate size determinations. L6 cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min, conditions under which all labeled TÎ²RI is Endo H sensitive (41; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). Endo H sensitivity was used as a marker for localization in the ER since only proteins in the ER and early Golgi carry the high mannose sugars, which are susceptible to the enzyme. Labeled L6 cells were lysed in a buffer containing octyl-POE and analyzed by velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients in the same detergent, with or without SDS (see Materials and Methods). Octyl-POE was chosen as the detergent for several reasons: (<italic>a</italic>) It is nonionic; (<italic>b</italic>) it has a density of 1; (<italic>c</italic>) it has a high CMC; and (<italic>d</italic>) it is freely miscible in aqueous solutions, enabling analysis of the migration of detergent-solubilized proteins rather than of micelles. </p>
        <p>Receptors from cells lysed and run in the presence of 0.5% SDS yielded a peak at fractions 4â5, corresponding to 50 kD, as determined by size marker analysis carried out for each individual gradient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). This is compatible with the molecular mass of the monomeric receptor, predicted to be 53 kD. Receptors from cells not treated with SDS migrated with a peak in fractions 6â8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>, B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>), consistent with a size of 120 kD. Although absolute size determinations from a gradient can be inaccurate for detergent-solubilized membrane proteins, the size of this complex compared with the SDS-treated monomers is consistent with TÎ²RI dimers. TÎ²RI from cells labeled similarly but chased for 4 h (such that labeled TÎ²RI carried mature N-linked oligosaccharides and was at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi or beyond; reference <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) migrated with similar velocity. We conclude that TÎ²RI forms dimer-sized complexes in the ER. Similar results were obtained with Mv1Lu cells (not shown) and with COS7 cells transfected with tagged or untagged TÎ²RI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and data not shown), demonstrating the generality of TÎ²RI dimerization. The similarity between COS7 cells and the naturally expressing cell lines regarding TÎ²RI dimerization indicates that overexpression in COS cells does not affect dimerization. This allowed us to use COS7 cells for immunofluorescence copatching studies, which require receptor density at the cell surface high enough to be visualized by immunofluorescence. </p>

        <title>Coimmunoprecipitation Studies Identify Ligand- and DTT-independent TÎ²RI Homooligomers</title>
        <p>The velocity sedimentation experiments described above demonstrate that TÎ²RI forms complexes of a size expected for a dimer. However, it is also possible that TÎ²RI associates with another protein of roughly the same size. To demonstrate that TÎ²RI indeed forms homooligomers, we performed coimmunoprecipitation studies on cells cotransfected with two TÎ²RI forms, each carrying a different epitope tag. HA or myc epitopes were inserted at the ectodomain NH<sub>2</sub> terminus, three amino acids downstream of the putative signal sequence cleavage site. They were introduced at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus to enable immunofluorescence copatching studies (see next section). Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> demonstrates that the tagged receptors were expressed at the surface of COS7 cells and labeled by <sup>125</sup>IâTGF-Î²1 similar to untagged TÎ²RI. Very low levels of TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII were observed in control cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lane <italic>5</italic>) or with TÎ²RI cDNA in the same vector (lane <italic>4</italic>). These low levels may be attributed to the native receptor population in COS7 cells. Cotransfection of TÎ²RI (tagged or untagged) together with TÎ²RII resulted in a significant increase in the labeling of TÎ²RI (lanes <italic>1â3</italic>). The insertion of the epitope tags did not eliminate receptor signaling, as tested by cotransfection with p3TP-Lux (a construct that carries the luciferase gene under a TGF-Î² response element) into L17 cells that lack endogenous TÎ²RI activity (not shown). Furthermore, in the sedimentation velocity studies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the tagged TÎ²RI was able to form dimer-sized complexes, as observed for the untagged receptor. </p>
        <p>We used the tagged type I receptors in coimmunoprecipitation experiments designed to confirm that the dimer-sized TÎ²RI complexes observed in the sedimentation velocity studies did in fact represent dimers and to determine whether exposure to ligand or DTT influence TÎ²RI homooligomers. The latter experiment was motivated by the observation that cross-linking of iodinated TGF-Î²1 to TÎ²RI in the presence of TÎ²RII is eliminated by pretreatment of cells with DTT (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), an effect that may involve disruption of the TÎ²RI/TÎ²RII heterooligomeric structure (Rodriguez, C., R. Lin, P.E. Scherer, and H.F. Lodish, manuscript in preparation). </p>
        <p>COS7 cells were cotransfected with TÎ²RI-HA and TÎ²RI-myc and lysates were immunoprecipitated with Î±-HA antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and the blots were analyzed with Î±-myc antibodies followed by biotinylated GÎ±M and streptavidinâhorseradish peroxidase. The results show that TÎ²RI-myc coprecipitates with TÎ²RI-HA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, lane <italic>5</italic>, and <italic>B</italic>, lane <italic>2</italic>). Preincubation of cells with TGF-Î²1 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, lane <italic>6</italic>, and <italic>B</italic>, lane <italic>3</italic>), DTT (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, lane <italic>7</italic>), or both (lane <italic>8</italic>) did not change the quantity of TÎ²RI-myc coprecipitated with TÎ²RI-HA. Blots from control cells, singly transfected with TÎ²RI-HA, were not stained by Î±-myc, showing the specificity of the blotting antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, lane <italic>4</italic>). Transfection with TÎ²RI-myc alone was used as control for the immunoprecipitating antibody, Î±-HA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, lane <italic>3</italic>). A positive control of cells singly expressing TÎ²RI-myc, where Î±-myc was used both for immunoprecipitation and blotting, is depicted in lanes <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). The type I receptors appear in two bands (â¼59 and 53 kD; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, lane <italic>1</italic>). The upper band is <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated TÎ²RI since treatment of the precipitated receptors with <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F led to disappearance of the 59-kD band, leaving only the lower band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). The 53-kD band in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic> gets somewhat distorted and swept downward in the coprecipitation lanes because of the presence of high amounts of the Î±-HA antibody used for precipitation (seen in the lowest band). This antibody, unlike Î±-myc, runs very close to the lower TÎ²RI band. When the gels are run under nonreducing conditions (providing better separation from the antibody band), this distortion disappears (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). These results demonstrate that TÎ²RI forms homooligomers that are unaffected by TGF-Î²1 or DTT and are stable in the presence of detergents. </p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence Copatching Experiments Show Ligand-independent TÎ²RI Homodimers on the Surface of Live COS7 Cells</title>
        <p>The experiments described in the former sections suggest that TÎ²RI forms dimer-sized complexes and that at least some of them are caused by homooligomer formation. To measure the TÎ²RI oligomeric structure at the native cell membrane, we performed immunofluorescence copatching studies (for method description see Methods and reference <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These studies have the advantage that they are performed on live cells (without any possible interference by detergents), measure the bulk of cell surface receptors on coexpressing cells only, and supply a semiquantitative measure for oligomer size. In this method, a tagged receptor at the surface of live, unfixed cells is forced into patches by a double layer of bivalent IgGs. The second receptor, which carries a different tag, is labeled by antibodies coupled to another fluorophore. The samples are then examined to explore whether the second receptor is swept into the same micropatches or whether the two receptors congregate in separate patches. The experiment is performed in the cold to avoid internalization. If the two fluorophores used are Cy3 (red emission) and fluorescein (green emission), then mutual patches appear yellow, while separate patches are either red or green. It is therefore possible to count the percentage of mutual and of separate patches, thus obtaining a semiquantitative determination of the level of complex formation and of complex size (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It should be noted that the tags (HA and myc) and antibodies used in the current studies do not mediate receptor complex formation or nonspecific sweeping into mutual patches since similar experiments using the same tags and antibodies did not show copatching between TÎ²RII and TÎ²RIII (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
        <p>COS7 cells cotransfected with TÎ²RI-HA and TÎ²RI-myc were subjected to successive incubations with different antibodies to mediate patching and fluorescent labeling of the tagged receptors, as specified under Materials and Methods. Typical results are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. The labeling procedure is fully specific, as can be seen in the inset of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, showing control cells singly transfected with TÎ²RI-myc and subjected to the same labeling procedure; the cells exhibit Cy3 labeling and almost no fluorescein labeling, which would be associated with TÎ²RI-HA. In all cells expressing both TÎ²RI-myc and TÎ²RI-HA, â¼50% of the patches were yellow. This indicates that the majority of TÎ²RI at the cell surface resides in dimers. Statistically, this is the percentage expected to reside in mutual complexes in the case of a dimer since only half of the dimers would carry two different tags (see Discussion). Preincubation with ligand (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic>) or DTT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>, C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>) did not alter the percentage of mutual (<italic>yellow</italic>) patches formed by the antibodies. It should be noted that 50% copatching is not a pattern that is commonly observed in such experiments; thus, no copatching was detected for coexpressed TÎ²RII and III (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and only a low percentage of copatching is observed for TÎ²RI/TÎ²RII in the absence of ligand (Wells, R.G., L. Gilboa, Y.I. Henis, and H.F. Lodish, manuscript in preparation). The results presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> suggest that all (or most of) the type I receptors appear as ligand-independent dimers on the surface of live cells and that this structure is not altered by preincubation with DTT. </p>

        <title>TÎ²RII Forms Homodimers in the ER</title>
        <p>Homooligomerization of TÎ²RII might have an important role in TGF-Î² signal transduction. We have previously used immunofluorescence copatching to show that TÎ²RII forms small homooligomers on the surface of live COS7 cells (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), similar to TÎ²RI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). To determine whether TÎ²RI homooligomerization occurs in the ER, we performed velocity centrifugation experiments with metabolically labeled, Endo Hâsensitive type II receptors. The experiments used L6 cells as described above for TÎ²RI, except that a shorter labeling pulse (15 min) was required to give a TÎ²RII population entirely sensitive to Endo H (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>A</italic>; reference <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>)<bold>.</bold> Velocity centrifugation of TÎ²RII from cells lysed and run in the presence of 0.5% SDS yielded a peak at fractions 4â6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic>), consistent with a monomeric TÎ²RII. Receptors from lysates lacking SDS migrated with a peak at 150 kD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>), consistent with the ER form being a dimer. Metabolically labeled Endo Hâresistant receptor, measured after a 2 h chase, migrated at the same point (data not shown), consistent with our immunofluorescence copatching experiments in COS7 cells (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Similar results were obtained with COS7 cells transiently expressing TÎ²RII (tagged or untagged) as well as with Mv1Lu (not shown), confirming that dimerization of TÎ²RII is not cell type specific. These findings show that the type II receptors form homodimers in the ER, which are then transported, presumably in this form, to the cell surface. </p>

        <title>The Ectodomains of TÎ²RII and TÎ²RI Are Monomeric, but TGF-Î²1 Can Induce Dimerization of II-SF</title>
        <p>To determine whether the ectodomain of either signaling receptor is responsible for the homodimerization we have observed, we performed sucrose gradient velocity centrifugation studies on the secreted ectodomains of both receptors. The soluble exoplasmic domain of TÎ²RII is efficiently secreted and has binding characteristics equivalent to the full-length receptor (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). I-SF is also efficiently secreted, suggesting that it is correctly folded; however, it cannot be cross-linked to ligand in the presence or absence of II-SF and likely requires transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains for full interaction with the type II receptor and for ligand binding (Wells, R.G., L. Gilboa, Y.I. Henis, and H.F. Lodish, manuscript in preparation). COS7 cells were transfected with a plasmid carrying an epitope-tagged form of the soluble type II receptor (II-SF), and the media from metabolically labeled cells were separated on detergent-free sucrose gradients. In the absence of ligand, II-SF peaked at fractions 3â4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>), predicted by size markers to be 20 kD, consistent with a monomer. The truncated receptor has complex and heterogeneous N-linked glycosylation, accounting for the multiple labeled bands. The same receptor, when collected from the media of unlabeled cells and cross-linked to <sup>125</sup>IâTGF-Î²1, migrated as a 60â65-kD protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>), consistent with a dimeric receptor bound to the ligand. This dimerization did not occur if detergent (1% Triton X-100) was added (not shown). </p>
        <p>Analogous experiments were conducted on the soluble form of TÎ²RI (I-SF), described under Materials and Methods. The results are depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. Metabolically labeled I-SF migrated with a peak at fractions 3â6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), consistent with a monomer of molecular mass around 24 kD. The broad peak suggests that some I-SF migrated faster, and there could be some I-SF dimers present. These results demonstrate that the exoplasmic domains of both TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII are mainly monomeric and are not sufficient for dimerization by themselves. II-SF, however, can form dimers upon TGF-Î²1 binding. </p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>TGF-Î² elicits a broad spectrum of effects, ranging from control of cell growth and extracellular matrix composition to differentiation and cell death (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). TGF-Î² signal transduction requires two cell surface receptors, TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII, which are serine-threonine kinases (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). A substantial amount of evidence attests to interactions between TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII upon ligand binding (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Homomeric interactions of TGF-Î² receptors, however, have not been investigated in detail, especially for TÎ²RI. Although there are clear indications that homomeric interactions of type I and type II TGF-Î² receptors are important functionally for signal transduction and regulation, there has thus far been no physical evidence for TÎ²RI homooligomerization, and the cellular site of TÎ²RII homooligomerization is not known (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In the current studies, we combined several complementary approaches to investigate this issue: (<italic>a</italic>) sedimentation velocity studies to determine the size of metabolically labeled receptor complexes; (<italic>b</italic>) coimmunoprecipitation experiments on coexpressed, differentially tagged forms of TÎ²RI to explore homooligomer formation; and (<italic>c</italic>) immunofluorescence copatching studies on cells coexpressing differentially tagged TÎ²RI forms to establish the existence of receptor homodimers at the surface of intact cells.</p>
      <p>Sedimentation velocity experiments on metabolically labeled TÎ²RI demonstrated that the receptors migrate as a complex whose size corresponds to a dimer. This complex was observed in the ER of several cell types, from naturally expressing L6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) or Mv1Lu cells to transiently expressing COS7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This indicates that the dimer-sized complex formed is not affected by the level of expression. The fact that the complex size fits a TÎ²RI dimer does not necessarily point to the existence of such dimers since some other cellular protein of a similar size can be associated with the receptor. This issue can be resolved by the use of other methods (coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence copatching) to demonstrate that TÎ²RI does indeed form homodimers and to establish independently the existence of TÎ²RI dimers at the cell surface. The latter experiments require the expression of epitope-tagged receptors at levels high enough for good fluorescence visualization, and they were therefore performed in COS7 cells. The use of the overexpressing COS cells is justified in view of the similar complex size found in centrifugation studies for TÎ²RI expressed transiently in COS cells or naturally in the other cell types. Furthermore, similar results were obtained in the copatching studies on COS7 cells expressing either high (â¼200,000 receptors/cell at the surface) or low (â¼20,000) receptor levels (determined as described in reference <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
      <p>The coimmunoprecipitation studies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) using tagged TGF-Î² type I receptors clearly demonstrate physical association between TÎ²RI polypeptides. Thus, the complexes formed are relatively stable and withstand, at least partially, the detergent solubilization and immunoprecipitation conditions. Together with the centrifugation velocity studies, which point to a dimer-sized complex, these results suggest that the complex is indeed a homodimer of TÎ²RI.</p>
      <p>Coimmunoprecipitation experiments do not provide a measure for the percentage of receptors that reside in oligomers since only part of the cell population (â¼40%, as determined by immunofluorescence) coexpresses the two differently tagged receptors. Immunofluorescence copatching studies circumvent this problem by selecting only coexpressing cells for analysis; they also provide an independent means to determine the size of the receptor oligomers and, most importantly, do so at the surface of live cells. By coexpressing HA- and myc-tagged TÎ²RI, we have observed that â¼50% of the patches were dyed yellow (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), implying that the majority of TÎ²RI at the surface of COS7 cells is homodimeric. The reasoning is as follows: For monomers, each type of tagged receptor would be swept into separate patches by the respective antibody, yielding no copatching. In the case of a dimer, only half of the dimers would be composed of receptors carrying different tags; these will be swept mostly into copatches, while the great majority of uniformly tagged dimers will reside in either green or red patches. For trimers and tetramers, the expected percentage of complexes carrying different tags is 75 and 87.5%, respectively. Clearly, the results of the copatching experiments are in good agreement with the receptors being dimeric. They provide an independent proof for the homodimeric nature of the dimer-sized complex observed in the centrifugation experiments.</p>
      <p>The copatching experiments, as well as the coimmunoprecipitation studies, show that TÎ²RI dimers are unaffected by the presence of TGF-Î²1 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>); this is not surprising since TÎ²RI does not bind TGF-Î²1 in the absence of TÎ²RII. Interestingly, the dimeric structure of TÎ²RI is not disrupted by pretreatment of the cells with DTT under conditions known to eliminate TGF-Î²1 binding to these receptors (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the homooligomeric complex of the type I receptors can withstand whatever structural alteration is mediated by the DTT treatment, and which interferes with the ability of TÎ²RI to be cross-linked to TGF-Î²1 in the presence of TÎ²RII (reference <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>; Rodriguez, C., R. Lin, P.E. Scherer, and H.F. Lodish, unpublished results).</p>
      <p>Sedimentation velocity studies analogous to those performed on TÎ²RI were conducted on TÎ²RII (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These experiments establish that TÎ²RII appears in dimer-sized complexes, which are formed in the ER. Together with previous studies using immunofluorescence copatching (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and coimmunoprecipitation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which demonstrate that TÎ²RII chains interact with each other, we can conclude that TÎ²RII appears both in the ER and at the cell surface as a dimer. The copatching studies (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) indicate that the dimeric nature of TÎ²RII is not altered after TGF-Î²1 binding. Moreover, the inherent tendency of TÎ²RII to form dimers is independent of expression level, as indicated by the similar results obtained in sedimentation velocity studies performed on naturally expressing cell lines and on overexpressing COS cells.</p>
      <p>To explore the role of the exoplasmic domain in promoting homodimerization, the soluble exoplasmic domains of TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII secreted by COS7 cells were analyzed by sedimentation velocity experiments (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In both cases, the receptors migrated primarily as monomers, indicating that these domains are insufficient to promote dimerization of either receptor. TGF-Î²1 induced dimerization of II-SF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), which binds ligand (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), in agreement with a report that TGF-Î²2 and TGF-Î²3 also promote dimerization of the ectodomain (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The ligand-mediated homomeric interactions of II-SF, however, are disrupted by the presence of nonionic detergent, indicating that they are significantly weaker than in wild-type TÎ²RII (data not shown). Accordingly, the intact TÎ²RII is dimeric in the absence of ligand and does not require ligand binding for dimerization. An immediate conclusion is that the cytoplasmic and/or transmembrane domains of TÎ²RII must have a major contribution to the homomeric interactions. This conclusion is in accord with the report (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) that the cytoplasmic domains of TÎ²RII overexpressed in 293 cells can form homooligomers. There is, however, evidence that the ectodomains of both receptors also contribute to the homomeric interactions since chimeras composed of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of TÎ²RI or II and the ectodomain of the Epo receptor required dimerization by Epo to interact (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Taken together, it seems likely that several domains scattered throughout the receptors contribute to the homomeric interactions. In the case of TÎ²RII, it appears that ligand binding can enhance the interactions between the ectodomains.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have combined several methods to characterize homooligomer formation of TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII. The findings demonstrate that both receptors exist as homodimers that form in the ER and persist at the cell surface. The roles of homooligomerization and its involvement in the mechanism(s) of TGF-Î² signaling should be further explored. It appears, however, that for TÎ²RI the homodimerization has a critical role in signal transduction (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), and for TÎ²RII it is involved in modulating signaling (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The variety of biological responses mediated by TGF-Î² ligands raises the possibility that an intricate equilibrium between various homo- and heterocomplexes, which can be affected by the binding of various ligands, plays a role in regulating those responses.</p>

        <p>The type I receptor forms homodimers in the ER of L6 cells. L6 cells were pulse-labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-Express for 30 min, cooled, and derivatized with iodoacetamide. After lysis in MNT buffer containing octyl-POE (with or without 0.5% SDS), samples were centrifuged on sucrose gradients, and the collected fractions (numbered 1 to 15, with 1 at the top of the gradient) were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-TÎ²RI antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (see Materials and Methods). Endo H treatment (not shown) of control material confirms that all of the labeled material is Endo H sensitive, representing the ER form. (<italic>A</italic>) SDS (0.5%) was included in the lysis buffer and in the gradient. Migration of the receptor is consistent with monomers. (<italic>B</italic>) SDS was not present. Samples were treated with Endo H before SDS-PAGE. Migration of the receptor is consistent with dimers. (<italic>C</italic>) Graphical representation of the quantified bands. Values were normalized to the peak fraction. Numbers at the top represent the protein size predicted by markers to migrate at each peak.</p>

Cells were incubated with 100 pM of <sup>125</sup>IâTGF-Î²1, and bound ligand was cross-linked to cell surface receptors. Detergent extracts of the transfected cells were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and exposed to an x-ray film. Positions of molecular weight markers and of TÎ²RI and TÎ²RII are indicated. Cells that were singly transfected with wild-type TÎ²RI or TÎ²RI-myc did not show labeling above the background of mock-transfected cells, as shown for TÎ²RI-HA (lane <italic>4</italic>). Note that under the transient expression conditions, many cells also express singly either TÎ²RI or II, and the relative labeling intensities of the two receptor types vary between experiments.</p>

COS7 cells were transiently transfected with TÎ²RI-myc (<italic>IM</italic>), TÎ²RI-HA (<italic>IH</italic>), or both (<italic>IM</italic>+<italic>IH</italic>), as indicated at the bottom of each lane. Immunoprecipitation was either with Î±-myc or Î±-HA, as indicated at the top of the gel. Blotting was always with Î±-myc, followed by biotinylated GÎ±M, streptavidinâhorseradish peroxidase, and ECL. All lanes were loaded with immunoprecipitates derived from the same amounts of cell lysates (three 10-cm dishes), except where both immunoprecipitation and blotting were with Î±-myc (1/3 of the above lysate in <italic>A</italic>, lane <italic>1</italic>; 1/18 in <italic>A<bold>,</bold></italic> lane <italic>2</italic> and in <italic>B</italic>, lane <italic>1</italic>). (<italic>A</italic>) Effects of ligand and/or DTT treatment. The gels were run under reducing conditions. In lanes <italic>6</italic> and <italic>8</italic>, the cells were preincubated with 250 pM TGF-Î²1 (2 h, 4Â°C). In lanes <italic>7</italic> and <italic>8</italic>, the cells were pre-treated with DTT (see Materials and Methods). TÎ²RI appears in two bands, around 59 and 53 kD. The nonspecific band at the bottom of lanes <italic>3â8</italic> is a component of the Î±-HA antibodies used for the immunoprecipitation in these lanes (see text). (<italic>B</italic>) Effect of <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F. The 59-kD band collapses to 53 kD, indicating that it represents <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated receptors. The immunoprecipitates were treated with <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F as described under Materials and Methods. The gel was run under nonreducing conditions. In lane <italic>3</italic>, the cells were preincubated with 250 pM TGF-Î²1. The band seen at 62 kD under these conditions is a nonspecific band. (The specific 59-kD band disappears).</p>

        <p>Copatching of epitope-tagged TÎ²RI on the surface of live cells. COS7 cells were transiently cotransfected with TÎ²RI-myc and TÎ²RI-HA (<italic>AâD</italic>) or with TÎ²RI-myc alone (<italic>A</italic>, <italic>inset</italic>). They were labeled in the cold consecutively by a series of antibodies to mediate patching and fluorescent labeling, as described under Materials and Methods. After this labeling procedure, TÎ²RI-myc is labeled by Cy3 (<italic>red</italic>), TÎ²RI-HA by FITC (<italic>green</italic>), and patches containing both tags are yellow. The labeling specificity is demonstrated by the exclusive labeling with Cy3 (<italic>red</italic>) of cells expressing only TÎ²RI-myc (<italic>A</italic>, <italic>inset</italic>) and by the existence of separately labeled patches (only red or only green) in the coexpressing cells. For each experiment, the patches on 20â30 cells were counted on the computer screen to determine the percentage of double-labeled (<italic>yellow</italic>) patches. Flat cell regions were selected for counting, avoiding the region of the nucleus that is out of focus and contains more nonspecific staining. The percentage of copatching was 46 Â± 5% in all cases except for the control. (<italic>A</italic>) No DTT treatment, no preincubation with ligand. (<italic>Inset</italic>) Transfection with TÎ²RI-myc only. (<italic>B</italic>) Incubation with 250 pM TGF-Î²1; the ligand was added together with the normal goat IgG preincubation and kept in during all successive incubations. (<italic>C</italic>) DTT-treated cells, no ligand. Pretreatment with DTT was done as described under Materials and Methods, before incubations with the antibodies. (<italic>D</italic>) DTT-treated cells, incubation with 250 pM TGF-Î²1. Bars, 20 Î¼m. </p>
