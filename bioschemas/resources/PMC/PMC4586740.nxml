        <p>Interleukin-4 boosts the capacity of dendritic cells to present endogenous antigens on MHC II and to resist bacterial infection through a mechanism shown to be partially dependent on RUFY4 expression.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Autophagy is a key degradative pathway coordinated by external cues, including starvation, oxidative stress, or pathogen detection. Rare are the molecules known to contribute mechanistically to the regulation of autophagy and expressed specifically in particular environmental contexts or in distinct cell types. Here, we unravel the role of RUN and FYVE domainâcontaining protein 4 (RUFY4) as a positive molecular regulator of macroautophagy in primary dendritic cells (DCs). We show that exposure to interleukin-4 (IL-4) during DC differentiation enhances autophagy flux through mTORC1 regulation and RUFY4 induction, which in turn actively promote LC3 degradation, Syntaxin 17âpositive autophagosome formation, and lysosome tethering. Enhanced autophagy boosts endogenous antigen presentation by MHC II and allows host control of <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> replication in IL-4âtreated DCs and in RUFY4-expressing cells. RUFY4 is therefore the first molecule characterized to date that promotes autophagy and influences endosome dynamics in a subset of immune cells.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells rely on autophagy to survive diverse cellular insults such as nutrient depletion, accumulation of protein aggregates, damaged mitochondria, or intracellular bacteria (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Deretic et al., 2013</xref>). Autophagy describes different eukaryotic mechanisms of protein degradation, which result in the transfer to and the degradation of organelles or cytosolic material in the lysosomes (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hamasaki et al., 2013b</xref>). Macroautophagy (here referred as autophagy) is controlled by specialized Atg factors that promote the genesis of autophagosomes, substrate recruitment, lysosomeâautophagosome fusion, and final degradation of autolysosome contents. One of the earliest steps of autophagy involves the activation of the ULK1âATG13âFIP200 protein complex at the surface of the ER for recruitment of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34), together with the Vps15âBeclin1âATG14 complex (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Mizushima, 2010</xref>). Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)<italic>P</italic>) formation by VPS34 is absolutely required for autophagosome formation, and one of the major upstream regulators of this step is the mTORC1 complex, whose inactivation induces autophagic flux through ATG1/ULK1 activation in response to metabolic changes, starvation, or rapamycin treatment (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Like other membrane trafficking steps, autophagy is regulated by Rab GTPases, soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimideâsensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), and tethering complexes. The role of Rab7 in autophagosome-lysosome fusion has been extensively studied (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Tabata et al., 2010</xref>), whereas the Qa-SNARE Syntaxin 17 (STX17) has been proposed to mediate both autophagosome formation and fusion with lysosomes by binding to its partners SNAP29 and VAMP8 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Itakura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Hamasaki et al., 2013a</xref>). In their active form, GTPases and SNAREs are anchored to intracellular vesicles, subsequently regulating recruitment of various effector proteins in cooperation with the accumulation of specific lipids like PtdIns(3)<italic>P</italic>. RUN and FYVE domainâcontaining proteins (RUFYs), which contain an N-terminal RUN domain, shown to interact with small GTPases (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Callebaut et al., 2001</xref>), and a PtdIns(3)<italic>P</italic>-interacting C-terminal FYVE domain, are good candidate effectors capable of controlling endocytosis or autophagy (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Birkeland and Stenmark, 2004</xref>). A member of the RUFY family, the FYVE and coiled-coil domain containing 1 (FYCO1) has been demonstrated to bind LC3/ATG8, PtdIns(3)<italic>P</italic>, and Rab7 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pankiv et al., 2010</xref>), linking autophagosomes to microtubule plus endâdirected molecular motors.</p><p>Antigen presentation mostly consists of the direct presentation of proteasome-degraded cytosolic peptides by MHC class I and the presentation of internalized exogenous proteins by MHC class II. The closely related autophagy and endocytic degradative pathways are particularly important for the orchestration of immunity by dendritic cells (DCs) because MHC IIârestricted antigen presentation is heavily dependent on endo/lysosomal proteolytic processing to achieve efficient peptide presentation to naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Honey and Rudensky, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, cytosolic proteins have also been shown to use autophagy to transit from the cytosol to endosomes and enter the MHC IIârestricted presentation pathway (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">MÃ¼nz, 2012</xref>), whereas endosomal function and exogenous antigen MHC II presentation are altered in <italic>Atg</italic>-deficient DCs (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). DCs are activated through microbial pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which results in unmatched T cell priming capacities (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kawai and Akira, 2008</xref>). Autophagy functions in many aspects of innate immune signaling (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Deretic et al., 2013</xref>) and can be enhanced by microbial stimulation, as shown for RAW264.7 macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Delgado et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, DCs exposed to microbial stimuli and various polarizing cytokines offer a unique model to study autophagy regulation and identify novel factors controlling this function in mammalian cells.</p><p>We focus here on the regulation of autophagy in DCs responding to LPS and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) in vitro. We show that autophagy flux is reduced during the stimulation of primary DCs by LPS. This inhibition is a consequence of mTORC1 activation after TLR stimulation and results in a clear reduction of endogenous MHC IIârestricted antigen presentation and accumulation of neosynthetized misfolded proteins in DCâaggresome-like induced structures (DALISs). We further demonstrate that IL-4âmediated differentiation of DCs is able to considerably augment basal autophagy flux, promoting endogenous antigen presentation and reducing the ability of the intracellular pathogen <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> to replicate.

Autophagic flux inhibition in mDCs could therefore contribute to DRiP aggregation with p62 and LC3. Consistent with this hypothesis, the serine 403 phospho form of p62, which is increased upon autophagy inhibition and has enhanced affinity for polyubiquitinated proteins (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>), was found enriched in DALISs (Fig. S2 A).

IL-4 was identified as the top predicted upstream regulator followed closely by IL-13 and STAT6, confirming the pertinence of our analysis. This prediction was mostly influenced by genes representing the hallmark of alternative versus classical macrophage activation, including <italic>Arginase 1</italic> and antiânematode and -fungal resistance genes such as chitinases (e.g., <italic>Chi3l4</italic>) and RNases (e.g., <italic>Ear11</italic>).

Strikingly, RUFY4 mRNA could only be detected in IL-4âDCs and not in macrophages, nor after short-term IL-4 exposure, suggesting that RUFY4 expression, which coincides with increased autophagy, is linked to both long-term IL-4 exposure and GM-CSFâinduced differentiation.</p><p>Given this information, we explored in which physiological situations RUFY4 expression could be detected in DCs. In addition to bridging innate and adaptive immunity, lung DCs can also mount Th2 immune responses to harmless allergens, such as house dust mite (HDM) allergen and, in this way, contribute to immunopathology (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Plantinga et al., 2013</xref>). Among DC subsets, CD11b<sup>+</sup> conventional DCs (cDCs) and MoDCs were identified as important players in the allergic cascade, with CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs being the principal subset inducing Th2 cellâmediated immunity characterized by the production of large quantities of IL-4 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Plantinga et al., 2013</xref>). Repeated HDM allergen inhalations by mice, followed by lung DC subset isolation, were performed to analyze RUFY4 expression. Comparative qPCR performed on the different DC subsets isolated from control or allergic mice demonstrated that RUFY4 mRNA expression was strongly augmented in CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs of HDM-stimulated lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>), whereas lower expression was detected in the CD103<sup>+</sup> DC subset and allergic conditions did not augment RUFY4 mRNA expression in this cell type.

Cotransfection of RUFY4 and LC3 confirmed that RUFY4-induced Stx17-positive organelles are autophagosomes that actively recruit LC3, a phenomenon strongly amplified by starvation and CQ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 I</xref>). The functionality of the RUN and FYVE domains present in RUFY4 was examined by microscopy. In the absence of the RUN domain, little difference was found with control cells, confirming our biochemical data and indicating that the RUN domain is absolutely critical for RUFY4 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>).

In many occurrences, high levels of FYVE-less expression also promoted the collapse of large tubular and vesicular membrane structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>), with no apparent codistribution with LAMP1 and RAB7.</p><p>Given the active recruitment of RAB7 to RUFY4-positive organelles upon transfection, we investigated whether these two molecules could interact. Immunoprecipitation of transfected myc-tagged RUFY4 followed by immunoblot detection demonstrated that RUFY4 is able to interact biochemically with Rab7 but not Rab9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 F</xref>). In agreement with confocal microscopy, interaction with Rab7 was not detected with the functional mutants, confirming that RUFY4 mediates part, but not all, of its effects through RAB7. By electron microscopy, lysosome and late endosome clustering in response to RUFY4 expression was detected in areas close to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). These electron-dense organelles were found in juxtaposition to enlarged autophagosome-like organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>), which were formed of an apparently continuous reticular network of double membranes carrying ribosomes on their cytosolic side and sometimes round electron-dense structures internally, possibly representing ferritin granules (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kishi-Itakura et al., 2014</xref>). The formation of these structures reached a paroxysm in FYVE-less mutantâtransfected cells, in which giant reticulated âautophagosome-likeâ structures likely to be formed from ER membranes and containing different types of organelles and cytosolic material could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Thus, RUFY4 exerts its function by regulating the membrane dynamic of autophagosome growth, probably in liaison with Rab7 and other Rab activity. Moreover, RUFY4 also promotes the clustering and tethering of lysosomes, which could facilitate fusion with autophagosomes.

As expected, we observed in GM-CSF DCs an increase in the number of intracellular bacteria up to 48 h after inoculation, demonstrating that <italic>B. abortus</italic> is able to replicate within GM-CSF DCs. However, a completely different situation was observed with IL-4âDCs, which considerably reduced <italic>B. abortus</italic> replication at a late time of infection. As expected, this difference was not observed upon IL-4 addition at the time of infection (Fig. S4 E) and did not reflect the inability of IL-4âDCs to internalize bacteria because equivalent CFU formation was found immediately after inoculation, indicating an equal capacity to uptake <italic>B. abortus</italic>. To further evaluate the contribution of RUFY4 to prevent <italic>B. abortus</italic> replication, we transfected the different RUFY4 mutants in HeLa cells and monitored replication by microscopy at 6 h after infection. RUFY4 expression strongly prevented bacterial replication, whereas expression of the mutants did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 F</xref>). In cells expressing the mutants, no difference in bacterial replication could be observed with control HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 F</xref>), suggesting that the positive regulation of RUFY4 on autophagy is key in preventing infection. Therefore, IL-4 and RUFY4 have anti-intracellular bacteria activity, a situation that is likely to have a physiopathological relevance in different infection contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s15"><title>Discussion</title><p>Few studies have addressed how IL-4 changes DC functional specificity (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wells et al., 2005</xref>). Our work reveals that DCs differentiated in the presence of IL-4 display considerable functional differences with âtraditionalâ GM-CSFâdifferentiated cells, both at the transcriptional level and, perhaps more importantly, at the posttranslational level. We showed that autophagy and associated functions are positively influenced by IL-4 with the consequence of augmenting the processing of endogenous antigens and their MHC IIârestricted presentation, which is normally decreased upon microbial sensing by DCs. Our data highlight that in addition to a reduction in mTOR activity, IL-4âdependent transcriptional activation of several genes, including <italic>rufy4</italic>, is likely required for maintaining a relatively high basal autophagic flux in cells exposed to IL-4. Independently of its immunological relevance, our work reveals for the first time the implication of RUFY4 in augmenting autophagy flux, promoting late endosomal and autophagosome membrane dynamic and preventing <italic>B. abortus</italic> replication in vitro.</p><p>The ability of DCs to present the same antigens on both MHC I and MHC II molecules in the absence of costimulatory molecules could confer them with the ability to simultaneously anergize autoreactive CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery. Conversely, the reduction of autophagy-dependent MHC II presentation upon DC activation could focus presentation on captured exogenous antigens, while preventing untimely activation of autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The efficient autophagy-dependent MHC II presentation previously reported in human MoDCs (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2007</xref>) can be explained by the presence of IL-4 in the differentiation media and underlines the importance for monocytes of the nature of the cytokines and inflammatory mediators present at recruitment sites in vivo. Indeed, the presence or absence of Th2 cytokines will drive DC differentiation with relatively equivalent cell surface phenotypes but with very different cell biology and functional abilities, as observed in the lungs of asthmatic mice (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Plantinga et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The signal cascade responsible for IL-4 induction of autophagy remains to be clarified, in particular in its capacity to prevent mTOR phosphorylation of ULK1 upon LPS detection. Upon IL-4 ligation, IL-4RÎ± heterodimerizes with the gamma common chain (Î³c) and signals via the insulin receptor substrate-1/2 (IRS-1/2) and STAT6 pathways (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Heller et al., 2008</xref>). Although STAT6 is involved in IL-4âinduced gene expression, IRS-1 signaling activates the type I PI3K pathway and subsequently the Akt/mTOR pathway, suggesting that IL-4, like LPS or other TLR agonists, could inhibit autophagy. However, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto et al. (2006)</xref> have reported that activation of IRS-2 leads to an autophagy-mediated clearance of accumulated poly-Q proteins, which occurs despite the activation of mTOR. IRS-2 recruitment by IL-4RÎ± could promote autophagy and change the balance among different transduction cascades. It has also been recently reported that upon viral infection of DCs, a decrease of the intracellular concentration of free arginine and a corresponding increase in citrulline occurs (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ravindran et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the deacetylated tRNA-sensing eIF2Î± kinase GCN2 was proposed to control autophagy and to regulate DC function. As these results were obtained with cells differentiated with IL-4, it is tempting to speculate that mTOR reprogramming and autophagy induction could be linked to arginase-1 expression, which by decreasing cytosolic amino acids concentration could influence mTOR activity.</p><p>The <italic>Rufy4</italic> gene is located on chromosome 1 in mouse (Chr 2 in human), and its promotor region contains several potential STAT6 consensus binding sites (TRANSFAC database). <italic>Rufy4</italic> is immediately adjacent to the <italic>CXCR2</italic> gene, which is also strongly up-regulated by IL-4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>), indicating that this area of the genome is transcriptionally active upon GM-CSFâ and IL-4âinduced differentiation. <italic>Rufy4</italic> has appeared relatively late in evolution (reptile) and is clearly not part of the core autophagy machinery characterized in yeast (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Deretic et al., 2013</xref>). Together with Rab7, RUFY4 is likely part of a regulatory module required for the fine tuning of autophagy in specific immune cells. RUFY4 overexpression increases autophagic flux, probably by stimulating both autophagosome generation and facilitating tethering with lysosomes. The association of RUFY4 with Rab7 and PtdIns(3)<italic>P</italic>-containing organelles is very similar to what is observed with Rubicon, whose overexpression leads to abnormal morphology of late endosomes. Rubicon mediates the simultaneous interaction between the Beclin 1âVps34 and Rab7 (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Tabata et al., 2010</xref>) and negatively regulates autophagosome and late endosome fusion (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Matsunaga et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, Rufy4 and Rubicon could compete for the same effectors, such as Rab7, and have opposite effects for the control of autophagy.</p><p>Our in vitro experimental conditions mimic the differentiation in DCs of monocytes exposed or not to IL-4 for a relatively long period. Cells grown in these conditions initiate transcription programs linked to their long-term functional differentiation and not to a rapid response to a cytokine stimulus. This difference is also illustrated by the strong expression of RUFY4 mRNA in lung macrophages and not in other tissue-resident macrophages or those differentiated in vitro with M-CSF. (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that long-term exposure to a particular combination of cytokines in a given tissue environment contextualizes the basal cellular functions of resident immunocytes (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Ginhoux and Jung, 2014</xref>). This situation could increase resistance to intracellular bacterial infection at potential sites of entry, as suggested by the relative protection conferred by RUFY4 against <italic>B. abortus</italic> infection. The reason of this inhibition remains to be established; however, the rapid kinetics of bacterial clearance suggests that exacerbated xenophagy could be key for this process. Our observations suggest the existence of a need for enhanced autophagy and endosome traffic in the frame of Th2 immune responses, including the MHC II presentation of cytosolic antigens and the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. Whether a deregulation of autophagy could contribute to the exacerbation of allergic diseases, such as asthma, that are critically dependent on IL-4 and DCs will have to be investigated in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s16"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s17"><title>Mice</title><p>Male C57BL/6 or CB6F1 mice 7â8 wk old were purchased from Charles River.
