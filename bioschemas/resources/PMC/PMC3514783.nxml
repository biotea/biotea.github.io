        <p>SIMPLE functions with the ESCRT machinery to promote endosome-to-lysosome trafficking, and this function is impaired by Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseaseâassociated mutations.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Mutations in small integral membrane protein of lysosome/late endosome (SIMPLE) cause autosomal dominant, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 1C. The cellular function of SIMPLE is unknown and the pathogenic mechanism of SIMPLE mutations remains elusive. Here, we report that SIMPLE interacted and colocalized with endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) components STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 on early endosomes and functioned with the ESCRT machinery in the control of endosome-to-lysosome trafficking. Our analyses revealed that SIMPLE was required for efficient recruitment of ESCRT components to endosomal membranes and for regulating endosomal trafficking and signaling attenuation of ErbB receptors. We found that the ability of SIMPLE to regulate ErbB trafficking and signaling was impaired by CMT-linked SIMPLE mutations via a loss-of-function, dominant-negative mechanism, resulting in prolonged activation of ERK1/2 signaling. Our findings indicate a function of SIMPLE as a regulator of endosomal trafficking and provide evidence linking dysregulated endosomal trafficking to CMT pathogenesis.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common inherited neurological disorder affecting the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martyn and Hughes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parman, 2007</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying CMT pathogenesis remain unclear, and currently there is no effective treatment to stop the progression of this debilitating disease. Small integral membrane protein of lysosome/late endosome (SIMPLE), also known as lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF factor (LITAF), is a ubiquitously expressed, 161âamino acid protein of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moriwaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Street et al., 2003</xref>). Our recent study reveals that endogenous SIMPLE is an early endosomal membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2011</xref>) rather than a lysosomal/late endosomal protein, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moriwaki et al., 2001</xref>). To date, eight distinct point mutations in SIMPLE have been identified as the genetic defects for causing dominantly inherited CMT type 1C (CMT1C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Street et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saifi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Latour et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerding et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, elucidation of the cellular function of SIMPLE and the functional consequences of SIMPLE mutations is essential for a mechanistic understanding of CMT pathogenesis.</p><p>Endocytic trafficking is crucial to the function and survival of all eukaryotic cells. Cell surface receptors are endocytosed upon ligand binding and then targeted to the early endosome. Once they arrive at the early endosome, the endocytosed receptors are either recycled to the cell surface or sorted to intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies for delivery to the lysosome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>). Ligand-induced lysosomal degradation of cell surface receptors is a major mechanism that attenuates signaling of activated receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waterman and Yarden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>). Ample evidence indicates that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, composed of ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III complexes, plays a central role in the endosomal sorting of internalized cell surface receptors to the lysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roxrud et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henne et al., 2011</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate ESCRT function and confer temporal and spatial control to the endosome-to-lysosome trafficking process remain poorly understood.</p><p>SIMPLE contains a PSAP tetrapeptide motif that is predicated to bind TSG101, a subunit of the ESCRT-I complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pornillos et al., 2002</xref>). Although SIMPLE has been shown to interact with TSG101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shirk et al., 2005</xref>), the functional significance of the SIMPLEâTSG101 interaction has not yet been examined, and the question of whether SIMPLE has a role in regulation of endosomal sorting and trafficking remains unexplored. SIMPLE also contains a cysteine-rich (C-rich) domain, which is hypothesized to be a putative RING finger domain with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moriwaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saifi et al., 2005</xref>), but whether or not SIMPLE has an E3 ligase function remains to be determined.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the biochemical function and cellular role of SIMPLE and assessed the functional consequences of CMT1C-linked SIMPLE mutations. Our results revealed that SIMPLE functions with the ESCRT machinery in the control of endosome-to-lysosome trafficking and signaling attenuation. Furthermore, we found that CMT1C-linked SIMPLE mutants are loss-of-function mutants that act in a dominant-negative manner to impair endosomal trafficking, leading to prolonged ERK1/2 signaling downstream of ErbB activation. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of SIMPLE action in normal physiology and in CMT pathogenesis, and have important implications for understanding and treating peripheral neuropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>SIMPLE interacts and colocalizes with STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 on early endosomes</title><p>To gain insights into the cellular function of SIMPLE, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens for SIMPLE-binding proteins using full-length human SIMPLE as bait. A positive clone isolated from the screens encodes the N-terminal 315 amino acids of STAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We further examined the identified interaction by using an in vitro binding assay with purified recombinant proteins and found that SIMPLE interacted directly with STAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that SIMPLE coprecipitated with STAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), confirming the interaction of SIMPLE with STAM1 in transfected cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>SIMPLE associates and colocalizes with STAM1 and Hrs.</bold> (A) Domain structure of rat STAM1 (STAM1) and the SIMPLE-interacting clone isolated from yeast two-hybrid screen (Y2H).

We then performed in vitro binding assays and found that SIMPLE did not directly interact with Hrs, though it interacted with Hrs when STAM1 was present (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201204137/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). Furthermore, SIMPLE had no effect on the interaction of Hrs with STAM1 (Fig. S1 A), which indicates that SIMPLE and Hrs do not compete for STAM1 binding. Together, these results indicate that SIMPLE is able to form a ternary complex with STAM1 and Hrs via a direct interaction with STAM1.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the colocalization of SIMPLE with STAM1 and Hrs by double immunostaining analysis and found a significant overlap in the distribution of endogenous SIMPLE with STAM1, Hrs, and the early endosome marker Rab5 but not with the ER marker KDEL or the late endosome and lysosome marker LAMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, EâG</xref>; and Fig. S1 B), which indicates that a subpopulation of SIMPLE colocalizes with ESCRT-0 components in HeLa cells. Furthermore, triple labeling analysis showed that SIMPLE colocalized with STAM1 and TSG101 on EEA1-positive early endosomes but not on LAMP2-positive late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. S1, C and D). These results, together with our biochemical data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, BâD</xref>), indicate that SIMPLE associates with STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 on early endosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>SIMPLE does not function as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase</title><p>We were initially intrigued by the hypothesis that SIMPLE might be an E3 ligase because its C-rich domain was thought to be a putative RING finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moriwaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saifi et al., 2005</xref>). However, our sequence analysis showed that the C-rich domain of SIMPLE is unlikely to be a RING finger domain because it lacks a key His residue and is interrupted by an embedded transmembrane domain (TMD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). We found that deletion of the TMD from SIMPLE completely disrupted the membrane association of SIMPLE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201204137/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>), which indicates that the TMD is responsible for anchoring SIMPLE to the membrane. We tested whether SIMPLE has an E3 ligase function by performing in vitro ubiquitination assays and found that SIMPLE had no detectable E3 ligase activity for auto-ubiquitinating (Fig. S2 D) or ubiquitinating STAM1 or TSG101 (Fig. S2, E and F). In contrast, the positive control RING finger protein parkin showed robust E3 ligase activity under the conditions of our in vitro ubiquitination assay (Fig. S2 C). Our coimmunoprecipitation analyses revealed that SIMPLE was unable to interact with the E2 enzymes UbcH5, UbcH7, and UbcH8 in HeLa cells (Fig. S2, GâI). These results provide evidence that SIMPLE does not function as an E3 ligase.</p></sec><sec><title>SIMPLE functions in the regulation of endosome-to-lysosome trafficking and signaling attenuation</title><p>To identify SIMPLE function, we depleted endogenous SIMPLE in HeLa cells by stable transfection of SIMPLE-targeting shRNAs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201204137/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S3, A and B</ext-link>). Immunofluorescence confocal microscopic analyses showed that, in SIMPLE-depleted cells, EEA1-positive early endosomes were significantly larger than those in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, AâC</xref>). In addition, SIMPLE depletion caused clustering of early endosomes in the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and D</xref>). Because the apparent mean diameter of early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>) was near the lateral resolution limit of the confocal microscope, the actual sizes of the early endosomes could not be accurately measured by the confocal microscopy. Therefore, we performed super-resolution imaging analysis of early endosomes by using 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schermelleh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with the enhanced resolving power of 3D-SIM, we found that early endosomes labeled by EEA1 had a considerably smaller size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, EâG</xref>) than the one suggested by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, AâC</xref>). In the SIM images of SIMPLE-depleted cells, EEA1-positive early endosomes were often found in small clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>, arrows), and EEA1-positive vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>, arrowhead) resembling the enlarged endosomes in Hrs- or STAM-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanazawa et al., 2003</xref>) were occasionally observed. Quantitative analysis indicated a significant increase in the sizes of individual early endosomes in SIMPLE-depleted cells compared with the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, EâG</xref>). The endosomal enlargement and clustering induced by SIMPLE depletion are similar to the endosomal morphological phenotypes caused by depletion of STAM, Hrs, or TSG101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanazawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doyotte et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Razi and Futter, 2006</xref>), which suggests that SIMPLE may participate in ESCRT-mediated endosomal trafficking.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>SIMPLE depletion alters endosomal morphology.</bold> (AâD) Immunofluorescence confocal microscopic analysis (A) with anti-EEA1 antibody (green) and DAPI (blue), and quantification of endosome diameter (B), endosome area (C), and the relative extent of endosome dispersion (D) show altered endosomal morphology and distribution in shSIMPLE-transfected HeLa cells compared with the shCTRL-transfected control.

Binding of EGF to EGFR at the cell surface causes endocytosis of the ligandâreceptor complex and subsequent sorting at the early endosome for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mellman, 1996a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>). We found that EGF-induced EGFR degradation was significantly decreased in SIMPLE-depleted cells compared with the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>), which indicates that SIMPLE is required for ligand-induced lysosomal degradation of EGFR. Texas redâconjugated EGF (TR-EGF) endocytosis assays revealed that SIMPLE-depleted cells internalized a similar amount of TR-EGF compared with the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and E</xref>), which indicates that SIMPLE is not involved in EGF-induced endocytosis of ligand-receptor complexes. To determine if SIMPLE depletion affects trafficking of EGFâEGFR complexes after endocytosis, we used a pulse-chase trafficking assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>) in which cells were allowed to internalize TR-EGF for 15 min and the fate of internalized TR-EGF was monitored after a 1-h chase period. We found that SIMPLE-depleted cells retained significantly more internalized TR-EGF than the control cells after the 1-h chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and F</xref>), and the internalized EGF was partly accumulated in EEA1-positive early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>).

Analysis of the kinetics of EGF-dependent activation of MAP kinases (ERK1/2) revealed that SIMPLE depletion had no apparent effect on the onset phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation but significantly altered the inactivation phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, leading to prolonged activation of ERK1/2 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, G and H</xref>). Thus, SIMPLE is required for the attenuation of EGFR-activated MAP kinase signaling. The observed defects in EGFR trafficking and signaling caused by SIMPLE depletion are similar to the phenotypes seen upon depletion of ESCRT-0 or ESCRT-I subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bache et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doyotte et al., 2005</xref>), and provide functional evidence supporting a role of SIMPLE in the regulation of endosomal sorting and trafficking.</p></sec><sec><title>SIMPLE promotes recruitment of STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 to membranes</title><p>Our finding that SIMPLE is an early endosomal membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2011</xref>) that interacts and colocalizes with STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and Fig. S1, C and D) raises the possibility that SIMPLE may participate in the recruitment of these ESCRT subunits to endosomal membranes. To examine this possibility, we performed subcellular fractionation analysis to assess the effects of SIMPLE depletion on membrane association of endogenous STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 in HeLa cells. We found that, in the control cells, a small pool of these ESCRT components were associated with membranes under the normal cell culture condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, AâD</xref>), which is in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bache et al., 2003a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>). In response to EGF stimulation, more STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 proteins were recruited to membranes in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, AâD</xref>). SIMPLE depletion resulted in significant decreases in the levels of membrane-associated STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 under both the normal and EGF-stimulated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, AâD</xref>), which indicates that SIMPLE is essential for efficient recruitment of these ESCRT components to membranes. We found that SIMPLE depletion did not cause any significant change in the steady-state level of STAM1, Hrs, or TSG101 (Fig. S3, CâF), which indicates a lack of effect of SIMPLE depletion on the stability of these ESCRT proteins. Collectively, these results suggest that the impaired endosome-to-lysosome trafficking in SIMPLE-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) is caused by reduced membrane recruitment of STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 rather than reduced levels of these ESCRT proteins.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>SIMPLE undergoes EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and is required for efficient association of STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 with membranes.</bold> (A) Postnuclear supernatant (T) from untreated or EGF (100 ng/ml for 15 min)-treated HeLa cells expressing the indicated shRNAs were separated into cytosol (C) and membrane (M) fractions.

Our findings reveal that SIMPLE is a novel regulator of endosome-to-lysosome trafficking.</p><p>Current models of endosomal sorting propose that Hrs, which is localized to the early endosome via an interaction with phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P), recruits STAM1 from the cytosol to form the ESCRT-0 complex on the endosomal membrane. The ESCRT-0 initiates the sorting process by concentrating ubiquitinated cargo in the clathrin-coated microdomain of the endosome. Hrs uses its PSAP motif to bind TSG101, leading to recruitment of ESCRT-I, -II, and -III complexes to facilitate cargo transport into multivesicular bodies for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roxrud et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henne et al., 2011</xref>). However, previous studies have shown that STAM1 can localize to the endosomal membrane in fibroblast cells derived from Hrs knockout mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanazawa et al., 2003</xref>) and that depletion of Hrs only inhibits membrane association of TSG101 by 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bache et al., 2003a</xref>), which suggests that additional mechanisms exist to mediate membrane association of STAM1 and TSG101. Interestingly, our analyses show that the early endosomal membrane protein SIMPLE binds directly to both STAM1 and TSG101 and that SIMPLE is required for efficient membrane association of these proteins. Furthermore, mutation of the TSG101-binding PSAP motif of SIMPLE causes an inhibition of ligand-induced EGFR endosome-to-lysosome trafficking. Together, these results indicate that the direct interaction of SIMPLE with STAM1 and TSG101 provides a mechanism for mediating membrane recruitment of these ESCRT proteins to facilitate endosomal sorting.</p><p>Although SIMPLE and Hrs both interact physically with STAM1 and TSG101 and are required for their membrane recruitment, our rescue experiments reveal that SIMPLE and Hrs have nonredundant roles in regulating endosome-to-lysosome trafficking. Unlike Hrs, SIMPLE does not contain any motif or domain for binding clathrin and ubiquitin, and is thus unlikely to directly mediate cargo sorting. Furthermore, unlike Hrs, which forms a 1:1 heterodimeric complex with STAM1 both in the cytosol and on membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bache et al., 2003b</xref>) and has an essential role in maintaining the stability of STAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanazawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mizuno et al., 2004</xref>), SIMPLE is an early endosomal membrane protein and has no influence on the stability of STAM1. Previous studies have shown that, although the interaction of Hrs with PI(3)P is involved in recruiting Hrs to the early endosomal membrane, Hrs is predominantly localized to endosomal regions that contain little PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gillooly et al., 2003</xref>), which suggests that additional mechanisms exist to mediate membrane association of Hrs. Interestingly, our analyses reveal that, although SIMPLE does not directly interact with Hrs, SIMPLE is able to form a ternary complex with STAM1 and Hrs via direct binding to STAM1, and that SIMPLE is required for efficient membrane association of Hrs, supporting a role for SIMPLE in mediating membrane recruitment of Hrs. Our finding of the ability of SIMPLE to self-associate and to recruit STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 to the endosomal membrane suggests that SIMPLE may promote the assembly of higher order (multimeric) structures of ESCRT-0 and/or assembly of a âsupercomplexâ of ESCRT machinery on the membrane to facilitate cargo sorting.</p><p>Endosome-to-lysosome trafficking of cell surface receptors is a major mechanism for controlling the intensity and duration of signal transduction in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waterman and Yarden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>). ESCRT-mediated endosomal sorting of signaling receptors has been shown to play a crucial role in attenuation of signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wegner et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with the essential role of SIMPLE in regulation of endosomal sorting and trafficking, our study reveals that SIMPLE is required for efficient attenuation of ERK1/2 signaling downstream of EGF-activated EGFR. In addition, SIMPLE is also required for efficient attenuation of ERK1/2 signaling downstream of NRG1-activated ErbB2/ErbB3 receptors. Our findings indicate that SIMPLE acts as a regulator of cell signaling by mediating ligand-induced receptor degradation.</p><p>The importance of SIMPLE is underscored by the linkage of SIMPLE mutations to autosomal dominant CMT1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Street et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saifi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Latour et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerding et al., 2009</xref>). We have recently shown that SIMPLE is a posttranslationally inserted, early endosomal membrane protein and that CMT1C-linked SIMPLE mutations impair the membrane insertion of SIMPLE, causing it to mislocalize from the endosomal membrane to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). The present study is the first to examine the functional consequences of CMT1C-linked SIMPLE mutations. Our finding of the inability of SIMPLE W116G and P135T mutants to rescue the SIMPLE depletion phenotype indicates that the CMT1C-linked SIMPLE mutants are loss-of-function mutants that are incapable of facilitating endosome-to-lysosome trafficking. This finding is consistent with the notion that mutation-induced mislocalization removes SIMPLE from its site of action, causing a loss of SIMPLE function in regulating endosomal trafficking. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that SIMPLE W116G and P135T mutants retain the ability to bind STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101 and exert a dominant-negative effect on their membrane recruitment and endosome-to-lysosome trafficking. These results support the model that the mislocalized SIMPLE mutants in the cytosol compete with endogenous SIMPLE for binding STAM1, Hrs, and TSG101, thus acting in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit membrane recruitment of these ESCRT proteins and thereby impair endosomal sorting and trafficking. Collectively, these findings support a loss-of-function, dominant-negative pathogenic mechanism by which heterozygous SIMPLE mutations cause autosomal dominant CMT1C.</p><p>Our study reveals a link between dysregulated endosome-to-lysosome trafficking and the pathogenesis of demyelinating CMT. We have shown that SIMPLE is a ubiquitously expressed protein with high abundance in Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). The fact that SIMPLE mutations cause demyelinating peripheral neuropathy in human CMT1C patients suggests that, compared with other cell types, Schwann cells are particularly vulnerable to defects in endosomal trafficking. Consistent with this notion, mutations in several ubiquitously expressed regulators of endosome-to-lysosome trafficking, such as MTMR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2008</xref>), MTMR13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolis et al., 2007</xref>), and FIG4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rutherford et al., 2006</xref>), have been identified as the genetic defects for causing demyelinating forms of CMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolino et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Senderek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chow et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, dysregulation of endosome-to-lysosome trafficking may be a common pathogenic mechanism in several demyelinating CMT diseases. Our analyses reveal that SIMPLE plays an essential role in the regulation of NRG1-induced ErbB degradation and signaling attenuation in Schwann cells. Furthermore, SIMPLE mutations cause dysregulation of NRG1-ErbB signaling, leading to prolonged ERK1/2 activation. These results, together with the reports that persistent ERK1/2 activation leads to demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nave and Salzer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quintes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Syed et al., 2010</xref>), suggest a pathogenic pathway by which SIMPLE mutations cause dysregulated NRG1-ErbB signaling in Schwann cells and thereby trigger demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration, leading to peripheral neuropathy. In conclusion, our findings obtained from this work have filled a critical gap in our knowledge about the function of SIMPLE in cells, and have provided new insights into the pathogenic mechanism of CMT1C-linked SIMPLE mutations in peripheral neuropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The cDNAs encoding human SIMPLE WT, CMT1C-linked mutants, and SIMPLE deletion mutants were generated by conventional molecular biological techniques, and were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
