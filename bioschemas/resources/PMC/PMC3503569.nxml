          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Sterile Alpha Motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a recently identified host factor that restricts HIV-1 replication in dendritic and myeloid cells. SAMHD1 is a dNTPase that presumably reduces the cellular dNTP levels to levels too low for retroviral reverse transcription to occur. However, HIV-2 and SIV encoded Vpx counteracts the antiviral effects of SAMHD1 by targeting the protein for proteasomal degradation. SAMHD1 is encoded by a multiply spliced mRNA and consists of 16 coding exons.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Here, we identified two naturally occurring splice variants lacking exons 8â9 and 14, respectively. Like wildtype SAMHD1, both splice variants localize primarily to the nucleus, interact with Vpx, and retain some sensitivity to Vpx-dependent degradation. However, the splice variants differ from full-length SAMHD1 in their metabolic stability and catalytic activity. While full-length SAMHD1 is metabolically stable in uninfected cells, both splice variants were inherently metabolically unstable and were rapidly degraded even in the absence of Vpx. Vpx strongly increased the rate of degradation of full-length SAMHD1 and further accelerated the degradation of the splice variants. However, the effect of Vpx on the splice variants was more modest due to the inherent instability of these proteins. Analysis of dNTPase activity indicates that neither splice variant is catalytically active.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>HIV-2 and many SIV isolates encode an accessory protein, Vpx, that is required for replication in myeloid cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. HIV-1 does not encode a <italic>vpx</italic> gene; interestingly, however, the presence of Vpx enhances replication of HIV-1 in monocyte-derived macrophages, dendritic cells, and the differentiated THP-1 cell line
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] suggesting the presence of a Vpx-sensitive host restriction factor. Also, Vpx was shown to rescue HIV-1 but not HIV-2 or SIV from an interferon-induced antiviral state
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A Vpx-sensitive restriction factor was recently identified as Sterile Alpha Motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), which was found to be targeted for proteasomal degradation by Vpx
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mutations in the SAMHD1 gene have been implicated with Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS), a disease that is associated with increased production of interferon-alpha and thus mimics congenital virus infections
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This suggests SAMHD1, along with other AGS-associated proteins (e.g. TREX1 and RNASEH2), may be involved in the regulation of the innate immune response
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, SAMHD1 was shown to contribute to the restriction of HIV-1 in resting CD4+ T cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. SAMHD1 has recently been shown to possess dGTP-dependent dNTPase activity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and the current hypothesis is that SAMHD1 is able to deplete the intracellular pool of dNTPs in susceptible cell types to levels below that required for reverse transcription, thus resulting in restriction of HIV-1 replication
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>Here, we describe the identification and characterization of two SAMHD1 splice variants that are expressed naturally together with full-length SAMHD1 in a variety of cell types. The splice variants identified either lack exons 8â9 (Î8-9), eliminating a C-terminal portion of the HD domain, or exon 14 (Î14). Like wildtype SAMHD1, the Î8-9 and Î14 splice variants exhibit nuclear localization, and they interact with Vpx. However, unlike wildtype SAMHD1, which is stable in the absence of Vpx, both splice variants are inherently unstable and are rapidly degraded even in the absence of Vpx. Pulse/chase analyses confirmed that Vpx had a strong impact on the degradation of full-length SAMHD1. Addition of Vpx also increased the turnover of the splice variants. However, this effect was more modest because of the inherent instability of these proteins in the absence of Vpx. Neither splice variant exhibited dNTPase activity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, suggesting they also lack antiviral activity. The identification of SAMHD1 splice variants exposes a potential regulatory mechanism that could enable a cell to control its dNTPase activity at a post-transcriptional level.</p>

        <title>Cloning and expression of SAMHD1 splice variants</title>
        <p>To characterize SAMHD1 and its role in restricting lentiviral replication, we cloned SAMHD1 from the mRNA pool of PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. SAMHD1 specific cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 either in untagged form or with an N-terminal HA tag. Interestingly, in addition to the complete 16-exon gene encoding the 626 residue full-length SAMHD1 protein, we identified two splice variants lacking exons 8 plus 9 (corresponding to residues 285â354) or exon 14 (residues 502â536), respectively (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). To confirm the presence of these splice variants in differentiated THP-1 cells, splice-junction specific primers were designed for the selective amplification of alternatively spliced mRNA (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). SAMHD1 WT, Î14, and Î8-9 plasmid DNAs were used as specificity controls. As expected, the primer set F<sub>14</sub>/R<sub>14</sub> specific for SAMHD1Î14 showed a PCR product with SAMHD1Î14 DNA as template but not when the wildtype plasmid was used (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C, lanes 2 and 3). The Î8-9 primer set F<sub>8/9</sub>/R<sub>8/9</sub> showed similar specificity for the Î8-9 construct (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C, lanes 5 and 6). Importantly, when cDNA from PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells was used as a template, both primer sets amplified a band of appropriate size indicating the splice variants are genuinely present in the mRNA pool of these cells (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C, lanes 1 and 4). Similar results were observed for SAMHD1 mRNA from 293 T cells and primary CD4+ T lymphocytes (data not shown). Notably, HeLa cells express very low amounts of SAMHD1; and, consistent with this, splice variants were not identified in these cells (data not shown). Thus, expression of SAMHD1 splice variants is not a unique property of THP-1 cells but was found in other SAMHD1-positive cell lines and primary human T cells tested.</p>

        <p>Differential splicing might be an important mechanism for the cell to regulate SAMHD1 and its functions. Therefore, we set out to study the functional properties of the splice variants as compared to the wildtype protein. For this purpose, we generated a polyclonal antibody to SAMHD1 (SAM416) using recombinant protein purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> as previously described
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The antibody readily identified wildtype SAMHD1 and its splice variants by immunoblotting (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D) and immunocytochemistry (see Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Interestingly, transfection of constant levels of plasmid DNAs yielded significant differences in the expression level of the splice variants relative to the full-length protein. In particular, SAMHD1Î14 consistently yielded a lower signal than the wildtype protein in immunoblot analyses (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D, lane 2). This was unlikely due to differential recognition by SAM416 since N-terminally HA-tagged constructs detected with an anti-HA antibody showed similar differences in signal intensities (data not shown). </p>

        <title>SAMHD1 splice variants exhibit the same nuclear localization as the wildtype protein</title>
        <p>While wildtype SAMHD1 localizes almost exclusively to the nucleus
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], mutants associated with AGS cause the protein to be at least partially localized to the cytoplasm
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], suggesting a possible correlation between SAMHD1 nuclear localization and function. However, recent evidence has suggested that while SAMHD1 nuclear localization may not be strictly required for HIV-1 restriction, it may be important for the initiation of Vpx-dependent degradation of SAMHD1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Immunocytochemistry of untagged wildtype SAMHD1 transfected into HeLa cells confirmed the nuclear localization of SAMHD1 (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel B). Similarly, SAMHD1Î14 and Î8-9 revealed exclusively nuclear localization in the vast majority of transfected cells (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels C and D). This indicates that sequences encoded by exons 8â9 and 14 are not critical for determining the subcellular distribution of SAMHD1. Indeed, a KRPR nuclear localization sequence has recently been mapped to the N-terminus of SAMHD1

        <title>SAMHD1 splice variants interact with Vpx</title>
        <p>Vpx has been shown to render monocytic cells permissive to HIV-1 infection by binding to and causing the proteosomal degradation of SAMHD1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In order to determine whether SAMHD1Î14 and Î8-9 are subject to Vpx-dependent degradation, SAMHD1 WT, Î14, and Î8-9 were transfected into HeLa cells together with increasing amounts of Vpx from SIV<sub>mac239</sub>. To adjust for the lower expression of the splice variants, amounts of transfected DNA were modified to achieve comparable expression of wildtype SAMHD1 and the splice variants in the absence of Vpx (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, lanes 1, 4, and 7). Immunoblot analysis showed that levels of wildtype SAMHD1 were effectively reduced in Vpx expressing cells (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, compare lanes 1 &amp; 2). In contrast, Vpx had a more subtle effect on the steady-state expression of SAMHD1 splice variants (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, compare lanes 4 and 5, and 7 and 8). In particular, SAMHD1Î8-9 steady-state expression appeared to be much less affected by Vpx than the wildtype protein (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 7 and 8). Interestingly, the effects of Vpx on SAMHD1 levels did not increase at higher levels of Vpx (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, compare lanes 2 and 3, 5 and 6, 8 and 9) suggesting that Vpx is saturating in our system even at the lowest level tested. </p>

        <p>To investigate whether the less pronounced effect of Vpx on the expression of SAMHD1 splice variants was due to a lack of protein-protein interaction, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed employing N-terminally HA-tagged SAMHD1 variants, which were cotransfected into HeLa cells together with Vpx (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). To minimize effects due to SAMHD1 degradation, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 4 h prior to cell lysis. Consistent with previous reports
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], wildtype SAMHD1 interacted with Vpx as indicated by the co-immunoprecipitation of Vpx in the SAMHD1 pulldowns (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, bottom panel, lane 1). Interestingly, both SAMHD1 splice variants also interacted with Vpx as indicated by the efficient co-immunoprecipitation of Vpx (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, lanes 2â3). Vpx was not pulled down by HA antibodies in the absence of SAMHD1 (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, lane 4) attesting to the specificity of the assay. These results indicate that regions in SAMHD1 missing in the splice variants are not strictly required for Vpx binding. This is consistent with recent data suggesting a C-terminal region of SAMHD1 is involved in the interaction with Vpx

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A in the presence of Vpx are due to differential sensitivity to Vpx-dependent degradation, pulse-chase analyses were performed and proteins were immunoprecipitated with SAM416 antibody as detailed in Methods (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Note that in this experiment equal amounts of SAMHD1 vectors were transfected. Protein bands were quantified by PhosphorImage analysis (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). We found that wildtype SAMHD1 was metabolically stable in the absence of Vpx with no apparent loss of protein during the 2 h observation period (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B WT, open circles). However, in the presence of Vpx, SAMHD1 was rapidly degraded with a half-life of ~25 minutes (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B WT, closed circles). Interestingly, at the pulse time point, the signals obtained for the splice variants were comparable to those of wildtype SAMHD1 (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, lanes â0â). This suggests that differences in steady state levels observed in Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A are not due to differences in mRNA stability or protein expression. Instead, both the Î14 and Î8-9 splice variants were inherently unstable even in the absence of Vpx and had half-lives of ~45 and ~35 min, respectively (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B Î8-9 &amp; Î14, open circles). Co-expression of Vpx further increased their rate of degradation (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B, Î8-9 &amp; Î14, closed circles). Because of the inherent instability of the SAMHD1 splice variants, the differences in degradation kinetics in the presence or absence of Vpx were less pronounced than in the wildtype protein. However, the half-lives of ~20-30 minutes for the splice variants, which result from the combined effects of their instability plus the additional impact of Vpx, are very similar to the 25 minutes half-life observed for wildtype SAMHD1 in the presence of Vpx.</p>

        <title>SAMHD1 splice variants lack dNTPase activity</title>
        <p>Several studies have recently proposed that the HIV-1 restrictive activity of SAMHD1 is due to its ability to cleave dNTPs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This activity is thought to reduce the dNTP pool to a level insufficient to support reverse transcription of the retroviral genome, as also suggested by Kim <italic>et al.</italic> 2012
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Based on these findings, we next determined the dNTPase activity of our SAMHD1 splice variants. In order to do so, HA-SAMHD1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from transfected HeLa cells using HA beads. As before, experimental parameters were adjusted to yield comparable levels of protein to use in the assay (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, lanes 1â3). As a control, a catalytically inactive mutant, SAMHD1 AA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], was constructed as detailed in Methods and included in this analysis (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, lane 4). Immunoprecipitates were used directly in a dTTPase assay as detailed in Methods using the conditions described by Lahouassa <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In our assay, SAMHD1 dNTPase activity results in the release of triphosphate (PP<sup>32</sup>P) from Î±-<sup>32</sup>P]-dTTP, which was separated from uncleaved dTTP by thin layer chromatography. As expected, wildtype SAMHD1 exhibited catalytic activity (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, lane 1), and this activity was enhanced in the presence of unlabeled dGTP (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, lane 2). The catalytically inactive SAMHD1 AA variant failed to release more than background levels of triphosphate from the dTTP substrate even when dGTP was added (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, compare lanes 7â8 and 9â10). Of note, neither SAMHD1 Î14 (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, lanes 3â4) nor Î8-9 (lanes 5â6) was able to release triphosphate in this assay indicating that these splice variants are catalytically inactive. </p>

        <p>To assess the ability of our splice variants to restrict HIV-1 infection, we stably transduced U937 cells using a lentiviral vector system containing the indicated splicing variants ( Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1A). Wild type SAMHD1 clearly restricted HIV-1 infection of U937 cells ( Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1B). In contrast, neither one of the two splice variants inhibited HIV-1 infection ( Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1B). Of note, expression of the splice variants was poor when compared to the wild type protein ( Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1A). When wildtype SAMHD1 expression was reduced to levels comparable to those observed for the splice variants by titrating the transducing vector, no restriction of HIV-1 was observed even with wild type SAMHD1 (data not shown). Therefore, the results from this experiment do not conclusively prove or disprove restriction capacity of the SAMHD1 splice variants. However, since dNTPase activity of SAMHD1 appears to be required for its antiviral activity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], our results would suggest that the Î14 and Î8-9 splice variants lack restricting activity.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Nearly 90% of human gene sequences consist of introns that must be removed through splicing (for review see
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]). Alternative splicing allows the production of different proteins from a single gene. Indeed, about 80% of genetic variability introduced through alternative splicing falls within open reading frames
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Recent genome-wide analyses of alternative splicing indicate that up to 70% of human genes may have alternative splice forms, suggesting that alternative splicing together with various posttranslational modifications plays a major role in expanding proteome complexity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Proteins produced by alternative splicing can differ from the full-length product in their biophysical and biological properties at the level of protein stability, protein modification, intracellular localization, or surface expression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, alternative splicing is a fundamental aspect of post-transcriptional gene regulation in eukaryotic cells with significant functional implications.</p>
      <p>The 3.2 kb SAMHD1 mRNA (NM_015474) consists of 16 exons that have to be post-transcriptionally spliced from the 62 kb pre-mRNA. Recently, a G to A mutation in the SAMHD1 gene was found in patients with cerebral vasculopathy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The mutation localized to the exon 12 splice-acceptor site and resulted in the skipping of exon 13. Cell lines carrying this defect in SAMHD1 failed to show SAMHD1 expression suggesting that the exon 13-deficient splice variant was highly unstable
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. While the splicing defect observed in cerebral vasculopathy patients was not caused by alternative splicing but, instead, was induced by a genetic mutation, it nevertheless exemplifies the dramatic effects variation in splicing can have on the biophysical and biomedical properties of the resulting protein.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the exon 13 skipping associated with cerebral vasculopathy, the splice variants identified in our study are caused by alternative splicing. Consequently, the proteins expressed from the alternatively spliced mRNAs would be co-expressed together with full-length SAMHD1 protein. Interestingly, the production of these splice variants is not limited to THP-1 cells. In fact, both the Î8-9 and Î14 variants were identified in other SAMHD1-expressing cells analyzed, including primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the 293 T cell line (data not shown). This suggests that production of SAMHD1 splice variants is a general property of SAMHD1 gene expression and thus may have functional significance. The regions missing in the splice variants identified in this study are visualized in Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> on a representation of the published crystal structure of SAMHD1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Active site residues are depicted in red. The region that is encoded by exons 8 and 9 is shown in green and encompasses alpha helix 11, which contributes Asp<sub>311</sub> to the active site. As mutation of this residue to alanine has been shown to render SAMHD1 catalytically inactive
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], it is not surprising that SAMHD1 Î8-9, in which this whole region is missing is inactive. Why the Î14 splice variant is catalytically inactive is less obvious. Exon 14 is part of the C-terminal domain of SAMHD1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], distinct from the active site, and there is only partial structural information available for this region (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, light blue). It is possible that part of this region lies on top of the active site cavity and may be required for SAMHD1 function. However, it is also possible that removal of exon 14 sufficiently changes or destabilizes the structure to impact the active site and/or the more distal allosteric dGTP binding region of SAMHD1. </p>

      <p>The fact that our SAMHD1 splice variants are catalytically inactive but retain the ability to bind Vpx, raises the possibility that these proteins might act as decoys for full-length SAMHD1 and interfere with the ability of Vpx to target the functional protein. Interference studies are currently in progress to experimentally test this possibility. However, given the inherent instability of the two splice variants identified in our study, it seems more plausible to speculate that alternative splicing of the SAMHD1 pre-mRNA is a regulatory mechanism employed by the cells to modulate expression and function of catalytically active SAMHD1 at a post-transcriptional level. This view is supported by our finding that both splice variants can be identified in multiple cell types. Because of its inherent dNTPase activity, SAMHD1 is likely to be involved in regulating the cellular dNTP levels. In non-dividing cells, such as terminally differentiated macrophages or dendritic cells, there is no active host DNA replication and SAMHD1 activity contributes to keeping the cellular dNTP level low. This might in fact explain, at least in part, the resistance of non-dividing cells to infection by HIV-1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In contrast, in actively dividing cells, e.g. immortalized cell lines such as 293 T or HeLa or in undifferentiated THP-1 cells, expression of an active dNTPase might be counterproductive. Still, we noted that the levels of SAMHD1 in differentiated (non-dividing) and undifferentiated (dividing) THP-1 cells are indistinguishable (data not shown) suggesting that dNTP levels in these cells may be regulated by other yet to be identified mechanisms.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>While the SAMHD1 splice variants identified here are less stable than the full-length protein, it is possible that these or other yet to be identified forms of SAMHD1 may have functional roles in specific cell types or under specific conditions. In any case, characterization of different SAMHD1 splice variants, like those described here, not only yields important insight into potential functional differences of these proteins but also helps characterize the regions in SAMHD1 involved in dNTPase activity, HIV-1 restriction, and Vpx-dependent inactivation.</p>

        <p>cDNA was generated from total RNA from PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells using a Superscript III kit and an oligo dT primer (Invitrogen).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The reverse primer also contained a stop codon to prevent expression of the C-terminal vector HA tag. This strategy led to the generation of pcDNA-SAMHD1 WT encoding the full-length protein as well as pcDNA-SAMHD1Î14 and pcDNA-SAMHD1Î8-9, encoding splice variants lacking exons 14 and 8â9, respectively. N-terminally HA-tagged SAMHD1 constructs were generated from the untagged constructs using similar Bmt1/Xba1 primers with an N-terminal HA tag included in the forward primer (5<sup>â²</sup> AA CTA GCT AGC GAA ACC ATG TAT CCA TAT GAC GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT TGT ACA CAG CGA GCC GAT TCC GAG CAG 3<sup>â²</sup>). An active site mutant (SAMHD1 AA) was created by introducing a H206A/D207A double alanine mutation into wildtype SAMHD1 using Quikchange mutagenesis (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies). Plasmid pCMV-Vpx<sub>mac239</sub> was constructed by replacing the <italic>Sal</italic>I/<italic>Not</italic>I <italic>vif</italic> insert in pVif-HA

A portion of the reaction products was separated out on polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Sigma) using 0.8 M LiCl as the mobile phase.</p>

          <p> Antiviral activity of naturally occurring splice variants of SAMHD1. Human monocytic U937 cells were transduced using a lentiviral vector system (pCDH; Systems Biosciences, Mountain View CA) expressing wild-type (WT) or the indicated splicing variants of SAMHD1. (<bold>A</bold>) Stable cell lines were selected by culturing for 4 days in the presence of 400 ng/ml of puromycin. SAMHD1 expression was then analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-SAMHD1 antibodies. The blot was then reprobed with antibodies to GADPH, which served as a loading control. (<bold>B</bold>) Differentiated U937 cells expressing the indicated protein were challenged with increasing amounts of HIV-1-GFP. Infection was determined by measuring the percentage of GFP-positive cells using a flow cytometer. As control, U937 cells stably transduced with the empty vector pCDH were challenged with HIV-1-GFP. Infection experiments were performed three times and a representative result is shown.</p>
