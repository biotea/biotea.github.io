      <abstract>
        <p><bold>OBJECTIVEâ</bold>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a gluconeogenic enzyme that is upregulated in islets or pancreatic Î²-cell lines exposed to high fat. However, whether specific Î²-cell upregulation of FBPase can impair insulin secretory function is not known. The objective of this study therefore is to determine whether a specific increase in islet Î²-cell FBPase can result in reduced glucose-mediated insulin secretion.</p>
        <p><bold>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSâ</bold>To test this hypothesis, we have generated three transgenic mouse lines overexpressing the human FBPase (huFBPase) gene specifically in pancreatic islet Î²-cells. In addition, to investigate the biochemical mechanism by which elevated FBPase affects insulin secretion, we made two pancreatic Î²-cell lines (MIN6) stably overexpressing huFBPase.</p>
        <p><bold>RESULTSâ</bold>FBPase transgenic mice showed reduced insulin secretion in response to an intravenous glucose bolus. Compared with the untransfected parental MIN6, FBPase-overexpressing cells showed a decreased cell proliferation rate and significantly depressed glucose-induced insulin secretion. These defects were associated with a decrease in the rate of glucose utilization, resulting in reduced cellular ATP levels.</p>
        <p><bold>CONCLUSIONSâ</bold>Taken together, these results suggest that upregulation of FBPase in pancreatic islet Î²-cells, as occurs in states of lipid oversupply and type 2 diabetes, contributes to insulin secretory dysfunction.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Type 2 diabetes is characterized by a chronic elevation of plasma glucose concentration, causing complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Although insulin resistance may be the initiating defect, hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes results from a relative deficiency of circulating insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). Progressive deterioration in Î²-cell function is likely to result from exposure to the diabetic milieu (i.e., hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia), thus setting up a positive feedback loop in which hyperglycemia and/or hyperlipidemia impairs Î²-cell function, leading to further hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>).</p>
    <p>Chronic high fatty acid exposure results in increased basal and blunted glucose-mediated insulin secretion and reduced Î²-cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). This is associated with the pancreatic Î²-cells undergoing adaptive changes such that genes that are highly expressed under normal conditions, for example, insulin, PDX-1, and GLUT2, are underexpressed and genes that are poorly expressed in the pancreatic Î²-cells, such as hexokinase I, glucose-6-phosphatase, c-Myc, and acetate dehydrogenase, are shown to be upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>).</p>
    <p>One of the genes that is upregulated in Î²-cell lines under conditions of high fatty acid exposure is fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), a regulated enzyme in the gluconeogenic pathway that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. FBPase is abundant in the liver and the kidneys but is poorly expressed in the pancreatic Î²-cells under normal conditions. In addition, FBPase was upregulated fivefold in islets from the diabetes-susceptible obese BTBR mouse compared with the diabetes-resistant C57BL/6 mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). We have previously shown that FBPase is upregulated in the liver of mice or rats fed a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>) and in the New Zealand Obese (NZO) mouse, an obese model of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). We have recently demonstrated that transgenic mice with specific overexpression of FBPase in the liver displayed increased glycerol gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>).</p>
    <p>From the abovementioned studies, it is evident that upregulation of FBPase is induced by fatty acids. However, whether an increase in FBPase alone can be detrimental to cellular function and in particular to Î²-cell insulin secretory rates has not been investigated.</p>
    <p>To determine whether an increase in FBPase impairs insulin secretion, we generated both transgenic mice and stably transfected pancreatic Î²-cell lines (MIN6) overexpressing the human FBPase (huFBPase) gene. We demonstrated that overexpression of FBPase in Î²-cells results in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which is associated with decreased glucose metabolism, resulting in reduced cellular ATP levels and cell proliferation.</p>

      <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
      <p>MIN6 cells were obtained from Prof. Jun-ichi Miyazaki (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The RIP7 expression vector was provided by Prof. Thomas Kay (St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, Australia). The FBPase primary antibody was a gift from Dr. Hideo Mizunuma (Akita University, Akita, Japan). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Gene Works (Hindmarsh, South Australia, Australia). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin were from Invitrogen Australia (Mount Waverley, Victoria, Australia).</p>

        <title>Human islet preparation.</title>
        <p>Human islets were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Briefly, pancreata were removed from heart-beating deceased donors and disaggregated by infusing the ducts with cold Liberase enzyme (Liberase Human Islet; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Dissociated islets and acinar tissue was separated on a continuous Biocoll (Biochrom, Berlin) density gradient (polysucrose 400 and amidotrizolic acid).</p>

        <title>Generation of transgenic construct.</title>
        <p>Standard molecular biology techniques were used to generate the transgenic construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Pancreatic Î²-cell specificity of transgene expression was directed by a segment of the rat insulin II gene promoter (RIP), generated by PCR amplification of the RIP7 expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). The amplified fragment included a 659-bp promoter/enhancer region, the first exon and intron of the rat insulin II gene, a <italic>Cla</italic>I cloning site in the second exon, and the class II E<sub>â</sub> poly A terminator sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). This fragment was then ligated into a pUC-based expression vector, designated the insulated transgenic vector, in which the promoter fragment was flanked on each side by two tandem copies of the chicken Hyper-Sensitive-4 (HS4) insulator sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). The huFBPase fragment was generated by PCR amplification of the human liver cDNA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>) and ligated into the <italic>Cla</italic>I cloning site. The complete DNA sequence of the insulated RIP-huFBPase plasmid was determined, and expression of huFBPase was confirmed by transient transfection in a Î²TC3 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>) and Western blot analysis. The insulated RIP-huFBPase expression fragment (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) was separated from the pUC-19 backbone by <italic>Avr</italic>II and <italic>Spe</italic>I restriction enzyme digestion and gel purification.</p>

        <title>Transgenic mice.</title>
        <p>Transgenic mice were generated at the Central Microinjection Service of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (Parkville, Victoria, Australia) by injecting the insulated RIP-huFBPase DNA fragment (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) into the pronuclei of C57BL/6 fertilized oocytes, following established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Offspring were genotyped for the presence of the transgene by PCR amplification of tail DNA using a forward primer from the RIP promoter (5â²-CCTAAGTGACCAGCTACAGTC-3â²) and a reverse primer from the coding region of huFBPase (5â²-GCTGGGTCAACTCGCCCGTG-3â²). Primers amplifying a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragment of 650 bp were included as an internal control for the PCR analysis. PCR reagents were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The amplified DNA products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel.</p>
        <p>Physiological studies were carried out on third- and fourth-generation heterozygous mice. Control mice for all experiments were the transgene-negative littermates. Mice were fed ad libitum with a standard rodent laboratory diet and kept under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (light on at 0700 h).</p>

        <title>RNA and cDNA preparation.</title>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted from tissues and cultured cells using the Chomczynski and Sacchi procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). RNA was treated with DNaseI (RNase-free; Ambion) before cDNA synthesis using 2 Î¼g RNA and random primers with the Promega Reverse Transcription kit.</p>

        <title>Real-time PCR analysis.</title>
        <p>Primers were designed for SYBR-green real-time PCR using the Primer-Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers for Î²-actin (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_007393">NM_007393</ext-link>) were forward, 5â²-CGTGAAAAGATGACCCAGATCA-3â², and reverse, 5â²-CACAGCCTGGATGGCTACGT-3â². The primers for total FBPase were homologous to both mouse (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_019395">NM_019395</ext-link>) and human (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_000507">NM_000507</ext-link>) liver FBPase sequences. The sequences were forward, 5â²-AGC CTT CTG AGA AGG ATG CTC-3â², and reverse, 5â²-GTC CAG CAT GAA GCA GTT GAC-3â². The transgene-specific primers for RIP-huFBPase mRNA but not the endogenous mouse FBPase sequence were forward, 5â²-GTG TTG ACG TCC GTG TCG AA-3â², and reverse, 5â²-ACC AGC TAC AGT CGG AAA CCA-3â². All primer sets were designed to amplify a product spanning an exon-intron boundary of the genomic DNA.</p>
        <p>Each sample was run in triplicate for each set of primers (i.e., FBPase and Î²-actin). Gene expression was determined using ABI PRISM 7900 HT system (Applied Biosystems). The relative quantification comparative <italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub>, also known as the ÎÎ<italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub> method using the ABI sequence detection software (SDS), was used.</p>

        <title>Western blot analysis.</title>
        <p>FBPase protein levels were determined by immunoblotting as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). Protein lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PolyScreen PVDF membrane; Perkins Elmer), and probed with the appropriate secondary antibody by standard protocols. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Bioscience).</p>

        <p>The intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). A bolus of glucose (1 g/kg) was injected via a carotid artery catheter and blood was sampled at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after the injection. Plasma was stored at â20Â°C for future glucose and insulin analysis.</p>

        <title>Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test.</title>
        <p>The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). A bolus of glucose (2 g/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and blood was sampled at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the injection.

        <title>Islet isolation and culture.</title>
        <p>Islets were isolated from the pancreas by collagenase digestion as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). After islets were freed from exocrine tissue, they were hand-picked under a stereomicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and transferred for overnight culture in RPMI 1640 with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), in a 37Â°C humidified atmosphere of 95% air:5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        <p>After overnight culture, batches of islets were preincubated for 90 min in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB) with 2.8 mmol/l glucose. Triplicate batches of five islets were then transferred to tubes containing 1 ml KRBB supplemented with 2.8 mmol/l in the absence or presence of 10 mmol/l <sc>l</sc>-arginine or 20 mmol/l glucose. After a 60-min incubation of the islets at 37Â°C, tubes were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, and 0.5-ml supernatant was removed for insulin analysis. The remaining 0.5 ml containing the islets was treated with 0.18 mol/l HCl/95% ethanol followed by sonication to determine insulin content.</p>
        <p>Insulin levels were determined with a double antibody radioimmunoassay using a rat-specific insulin antibody and rat insulin as a standard (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO).</p>

        <title>Transient transfection.</title>
        <p>Cells were seeded into six-well plates at 2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well 2 days before transfection.

      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>To confirm the literature reports that FBPase is upregulated by lipid oversupply, we first assessed the pancreatic FBPase levels in a naturally occurring obese animal model, the NZO mouse; in a diet-induced obesity animal model, the C57BL/6 mouse fed a 60% fat diet for 16 weeks; and in the diabetic C57BL/KsJ/-<italic>db/db</italic> mouse. We found that both the NZO and high-fatâfed C57BL/6 mice had a twofold increase in pancreatic FBPase protein levels, whereas there was a 3.5-fold increase in FBPase mRNA levels in <italic>db/db</italic> mice compared with their respective controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>To determine whether patients with type 2 diabetes have elevated FBPase, pancreatic islets were isolated from three diabetic and six age-matched (50.6 Â± 3.4 vs. 51 Â± 4.4 years) and BMI-matched (26.5 Â± 0.5 vs. 27.8 Â± 4.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) control subjects as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). FBPase mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR and were corrected for expression using the housekeeping gene TATA-box binding protein. FBPase levels were increased by twofold in the human diabetic islets (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Taken together, these data support previous experimental evidence that FBPase is upregulated by lipid oversupply/diabetes in animal models and suggests for the first time that islet FBPase may also be increased in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p>To determine whether a specific upregulation of FBPase in islet Î²-cells can result in defective insulin secretion, transgenic mice were generated. A construct was generated with the human liver FBPase cDNA, driven by the minimal (654 bp) RIP and flanked by the chicken HS4 (cHS4) insulator sequences (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). To test whether this construct expressed protein, it was transiently transfected into the immortalized pancreatic Î²-TC3 cell line. Immunoblotting of transiently transfected cells showed a band immunoreactive with the anti-FBPase antibody at the expected size of 37 kDa (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), confirming that the construct was capable of producing FBPase. The RIPII-huFBPase chimeric gene was microinjected into mouse embryos, and four founder mice (on the C57BL/6 genetic background) were obtained. One of the lines did not express the transgene and was therefore excluded from further analysis. The studies presented here were performed using three transgenic mouse lines denoted 1, 32, and 44. The three lines expressed the transgene at different levels. The highest expresser (line 1) exhibited an â¼9 times higher transgene mRNA level than the lowest expresser (line 44), as estimated by real-time PCR (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). No expression of the transgene was detected in the liver, muscle, and brain of the transgenic mice (data not shown). Immunoblotting confirmed line 1 as the highest expresser of FBPase, followed by lines 32 and 44, whereas very low levels of FBPase protein were detected in the pancreata of negative littermate mice (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Although it is not quantitative, immunohistochemistry of FBPase transgenic and negative littermate pancreata showed islet FBPase staining in the same region as insulin immunostaining, suggesting Î²-cellâspecific expression of the transgene in the transgenic mice, whereas the negative littermate mice showed no islet FBPase staining (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p>
      <p>Body weight of the three FBPase transgenic lines was not different to the negative littermates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Fasting plasma glucose levels were not different, except for a slight increase in line 44 compared with the negative littermate mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). However, fasting plasma insulin concentrations were significantly lower in all three FBPase transgenic lines compared with negative littermates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Pancreatic insulin content was comparable between transgenic mice and that of the negative littermate mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>When subjected to an IVGTT, all three lines showed a significant impairment in insulin secretion (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Consequently, the area under the insulin curve was reduced in all three transgenic lines compared with the negative littermates (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Glucose tolerance was significantly impaired only in line 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), which had the highest expression of FBPase and most significant defect in insulin secretion compared with the negative littermates.</p>
      <p>Insulin secretion was also determined in vitro in isolated islets from line 32 and the data presented in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>. In response to high glucose, line 32 transgenic islets secreted significantly less insulin compared with negative littermate islets. Furthermore, in response to arginine, which is proposed to act distal to the ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel by directly depolarizing the plasma membrane, there was no difference in insulin release between transgenic and negative littermate islets.</p>
      <p>To investigate the biochemical mechanism by which FBPase upregulation resulted in significantly reduced glucose-mediated insulin secretion, transgenic cell lines (MIN6) overexpressing the huFBPase gene were generated and characterized as follows. The FBPase and pPGK-puro constructs were stably transfected into MIN6 cells. Eighteen colonies, which grew in puromycin, were selected and checked for FBPase expression and protein levels. From this screen, three colonies were chosen to be more extensively studied: a colony that had no FBPase expression but grew in puromycin as a result of the pPGK-puro transgene, a colony with relatively low expression, and a colony with relatively high expression of FBPase (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). FBPase enzyme activity was also assayed and shown to be elevated in the high-expressing cells compared with the low-expressing cells (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the parental and pPGK-puro cells had undetectable activity, concurring with the immunoblotting data (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p>
      <p>To determine whether the overexpression of FBPase affected insulin secretory function, the parental MIN6, pPGK-puro, and the two overexpressing cell lines were incubated with basal glucose (2.8 mmol/l), high glucose (16.8 mmol/l), or high glucose plus a cocktail of secretagogues (arginine, IBMX, and carbachol), and insulin release was determined. All cell lines released similar levels of insulin under basal conditions, although there was a trend for insulin secretion to be lower in the FBPase-transfected cells (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>), reflecting the lower basal plasma insulin levels in the transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Both the parental MIN6 and pPGK-puro cells showed increases in insulin secretion in response to high glucose and high glucose plus the secretagogue cocktail, respectively (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, FBPase-overexpressing cells did not increase insulin release in response to 16.8 mmol/l glucose and showed a much-blunted response to glucose plus the cocktail secretagogue compared with the parental cell line (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). Insulin content was determined and found to be not significantly different in the transfected cells compared with the parental MIN6 (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Therefore, overexpression of FBPase significantly reduced glucose-mediated insulin secretion, reproducing and confirming what was found in vivo in the transgenic mice overexpressing FBPase in Î²-cells.</p>
      <p>A mechanism by which increased FBPase may reduce insulin secretion is by decreasing glucose utilization and energy production. Because islets from patients with type 2 diabetes have markedly decreased expression of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>), increased FBPase would be expected to further impair glycolysis. Therefore, glucose utilization and glycolytic intermediates were measured. All cell lines had comparable glucose utilization when cultured at basal (2.8 mmol/l) glucose concentrations (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>left</italic>). However, in response to high (16.8 mmol/l) glucose, glucose utilization (assessed using 5-<sup>3</sup>H-glucose) was significantly lower in cells overexpressing FBPase compared with the parental and pPGK-puro controls (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Furthermore glucose oxidation (measured using [U-<sup>14</sup>C]glucose) was reduced in the high-overexpressing FBPase compared with the parental MIN6 cells when incubated with both 2.8 and 20 mmol/l glucose (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). FBPase catalyzes the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and is opposed by PFK-1 in the glycolytic pathway. Overactivity of FBPase would be expected to result in overabundance of the product and a reduction of the substrate. <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7<italic>C</italic></xref> shows that the substrate (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate) was lower and the product (fructose-6-phosphate) was higher in the FBPase-overexpressing cell lines compared with the parental MIN6 cells.</p>
      <p>To determine whether the decrease in glucose utilization caused a reduction in energy levels, cellular ATP levels were measured and found to be comparable among the four cell lines at basal (2.8 mmol/l) glucose (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>D</italic></xref>). However, with high (16.8 mmol/l) glucose culture, the FBPase-overexpressing cell lines showed decreased ATP levels compared with the parental and control cell lines (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>D</italic></xref>). Together, these data suggest that decreased glucose utilization and energy production may be responsible for the reduced insulin secretion, in Î²-cells overexpressing the human liver FBPase gene.</p>
      <p>A reduction in energy availability may affect cell growth. To study this, the proliferation rate of the four cell lines was determined over 7 days. There was an increase in cell number in all cell lines over the 7-day test period (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>). However, the cell lines overexpressing FBPase showed a slower rate of cell proliferation compared with the parental and the pPGK-puro control cell lines, respectively (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>). This difference in cell proliferation was particularly pronounced at days 5 and 7.</p>
      <p>To confirm that the reduction in growth rate was due to a deficiency in energy availability secondary to reduced rate of glycolysis, cells were supplemented with sodium pyruvate to a final concentration of 2.5 mmol/l. As can be seen in <xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>, pyruvate supplementation normalized growth rates at 5 and 7 days in the low-expressing and at 5 days in the high-expressing FBPase-MIN6 cells. These data further support the assertion that increased expression of FBPase results in impaired cellular function by reducing energy availability.</p>
      <p>To investigate whether pyruvate stimulation improves the insulin secretory function of FBPase-overexpressing MIN6 cells, the parental and low-expressing cells were pretreated with pyruvate (to a final concentration of 2.5 mmol/l), and insulin secretory function was determined at basal glucose (2.8 mmol/l) concentrations. We chose the low-expressing cell line because we have shown in <xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref> that in this cell line, 2.5 mmol/l pyruvate supplementation rescued the cell proliferation defects in FBPase-overexpressing cells. In concordance with these data, pyruvate stimulation also resulted in significantly higher insulin secretory rates in the FBPase-transfected cells, compared with control cells transfected with the puromycin gene only (insulin content 68.3 Â± 2.6 vs. 16.4 Â± 1.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 4, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Islet Î²-cell dysfunction is a key characteristic of patients with type 2 diabetes that results in hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia, in conjunction with the dyslipidemia, which is often present in patients with type 2 diabetes, can further exacerbate the defects in insulin secretion. A number of studies have shown that FBPase is upregulated in response to high glucose or fatty acid conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). Importantly, direct evidence for the stimulatory effect of fat on FBPase expression has been provided in vitro using pancreatic Î²-cell lines incubated with palmitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). Although the mechanism for this induction is not known, we speculate that fatty acids increase the transcription of the FBPase gene. We have extended these results and have shown here that in obese (NZO) or diabetic (C57BL/KsJ-<italic>db-db</italic>) mice and in a high-fatâfed mouse model, there is a two- to threefold increase in pancreatic/islet FBPase levels. Furthermore, we show for the first time that increased FBPase expression has direct relevance to human disease because its expression was increased twofold in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes. These studies, however, do not provide any information on whether this increase in FBPase has functional consequences in islet Î²-cells. To determine whether overexpression of FBPase impairs insulin secretion, we generated three lines of transgenic mice with different levels of islet FBPase overexpression. We demonstrated that insulin secretion in response to glucose was reduced in a dose-dependent manner with greater overexpression, causing more severe impairment of secretion. Interestingly, despite a reduction in insulin secretion in all three transgenic lines tested, glucose tolerance was impaired only in line 1 with the highest FBPase overexpression and the greatest reduction in secretion. This probably reflects the robust nature of the mouse and that a severe reduction in insulin secretion is required before it affects glucose tolerance. All of this suggests that upregulation of islet FBPase by high glucose/lipid levels can result in reduced glucose-mediated insulin secretion in vivo. Using MIN6 cells, an in vitro Î²-cell model, we went on to show that the most likely mechanism by which FBPase overexpression impairs insulin secretion is a reduction in glycolytic flux resulting in reduced energy production. Arginine-induced secretion was not impaired in the transgenic islets. Because arginine acts by directly depolarizing the plasma membrane, this result suggests that the secretory machinery is functioning appropriately and supports the notion of decreased glycolytic flux as the cause of reduced insulin secretion in the transgenic mice.</p>
      <p>Many mechanisms for Î²-cell dysfunction and death have been proposed, including high glucoseâinduced oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), fatty acidâinduced defects in secretion and activation of apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>), islet amyloidâmediated Î²-cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). Some of these may be inherent defects that are exposed when the islet is stressed with obesity and excess nutrients. It is clear from our own data and that of other researchers that the upregulation of FBPase is a consequence of the diabetic milieu. The question then arises: What role does this particular abnormality play in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes? We show in this study that FBPase is not normally expressed at high levels in the islet. Furthermore, we and others have shown that this enzyme is upregulated by fat. Noting this, together with the data in this report that a specific upregulation of FBPase causes impaired insulin secretion, we suggest that the obese/diabetic milieu of increasing lipidemia stimulates the expression of islet FBPase, which contributes to the deteriorating function of the Î²-cell, resulting in further diminution of insulin release.</p>
      <p>We show in this report that FBPase expression is increased in patients with type 2 diabetes and that a specific increase in this gene can lead to impaired insulin secretory function. However, this is not the only protein whose expression is altered in diabetes. It has been shown that there are &gt;200 genes upregulated in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes compared with control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>), and Busch et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>) have shown that &gt;100 genes are overexpressed &gt;1.9-fold when MIN6 cells are cultured in high-fat conditions (including FBPase). One approach to determine the functional consequences would be to systematically inhibit each of the overexpressed genes in diabetes and to determine whether cellular function is improved. Although for most genes, this would have to be done in vitro using, for example, siRNA technology, for FBPase, this can now be done in vivo because specific inhibitors of this enzyme have been developed as therapeutic targets to treat type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). MB06322 (CS-917) is one such compound that efficiently inhibits the enzyme and reduces gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes and in vivo in ZDF rats, resulting in a substantial lowering of plasma glucose levels in these diabetic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). It would be of interest to determine whether this or other compounds that inhibit islet FBPase can improve insulin secretory function and the diabetic phenotype of animal models, such as the ZDF rat or C57BL/KsJ-<italic>db/db</italic> mouse, or even in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p>It is of interest that reduction in glycolytic rate and the ensuing reduction in ATP levels resulted in a slowing of Î²-cell growth in vitro. It is important to note that the insulin secretory experiments were performed after 24 h of seeding the same amount of cells, a time that there was no difference in cell number regardless of whether FBPase was expressed (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). We therefore do not believe that differences in cell number can explain the blunting in glucose-mediated insulin release with FBPase overexpression. As stated above, we provide evidence that the decreased insulin release is due to reduced glycolytic flux.</p>
      <p>Taken together, we have demonstrated that obese and hyperglycemic mice and patients with type 2 diabetes display an increase in the expression of pancreatic islet FBPase. We consequently generated transgenic mice and cell lines with a specific increase in islet Î²-cell FBPase, and these were shown to have reduced insulin secretion associated with impaired glucose metabolism and ATP generation. This study identifies islet FBPase as a possible therapeutic target for the improvement of insulin secretory function in type 2 diabetes.</p>

        <p>Glucose- and nonâglucose-induced insulin secretion in FBPase transgenic MIN6 cells. <italic>A</italic>: The cells were incubated in KRBB containing 2.8 mmol/l glucose, 16.8 mmol/l glucose, or 16.8 mmol/l glucose plus a cocktail of secretagogues, including 10 mmol/l arginine, 0.1 mmol/l IBMX, and 5 Î¼mol/l carbachol for 1 h. Medium was taken to determine levels of insulin secretion. <italic>B</italic>: Total cellular insulin content was determined by lysing the cells with 0.18 mol/l HCl/95% ethanol, followed by sonification. Insulin secretion was then expressed as relative to total cellular insulin content of cells. Results are presented as means Â± SE of three independent experiments. *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 compared with parental MIN6 cells.</p>
