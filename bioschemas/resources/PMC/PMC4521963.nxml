      <abstract>
        <p>The coagulation factor XIII(FXIII) is a plasma circulating heterotetrameric protransglutaminase that acts at the end of the coagulation cascade by covalently cross-linking preformed fibrin clots (to themselves and to fibrinolytic inhibitors) in order to stabilize them against fibrinolysis. It circulates in the plasma as a heterotetramer composed of two homomeric catalytic Factor XIIIA<sub>2</sub> (FXIIIA<sub>2</sub>) and two homomeric protective/carrier Factor XIIIB<sub>2</sub> subunit (FXIIIB<sub>2</sub>). Congenital deficiency of FXIII is of two types: severe homozygous/compound heterozygous FXIII deficiency which results in severe bleeding symptoms and mild heterozygous FXIII deficiency which is associated with mild bleeding (only upon trauma) or an asymptomatic phenotype. Defects in the <italic>F13B</italic> gene (Factor XIIIB subunit) occur more frequently in mild FXIII deficiency patients than in severe FXIII deficiency. We had recently reported secretion-related defects for seven previously reported <italic>F13B</italic> missense mutations. In the present study we further analyze the underlying molecular pathological mechanisms as well as the heterozygous expression phenotype for these mutations using a combination of in vitro heterologous expression (in <italic>HEK293T</italic> cells) and confocal microscopy. In combination with the <italic>in vitro</italic> work we have also performed an <italic>in silico</italic> solvated molecular dynamic simulation study on previously reported FXIIIB subunit sushi domain homology models in order to predict the putative structure-functional impact of these mutations. We were able to categorize the mutations into the following functional groups that: (1) affect antigenic stability as well as binding to FXIIIA subunit, that is, <italic>Cys5Arg</italic>, <italic>Cys316Phe</italic>, and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic> (2) affect binding to FXIIIA subunit with little or no influence on antigenic stability, that is, <italic>Ile81Asn</italic> and <italic>Val401Gln</italic> c) influence neither aspects and are most likely causality linked polymorphisms or functional polymorphisms, that is, <italic>Leu116Phe</italic> and <italic>Val217Ile</italic>. The <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> mutation was the only mutation to show a direct secretion-based defect since the mutated protein was observed to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Factor XIII deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder that results from the deficiency of coagulation FXIII, a hetero-tetrameric protransglutaminase molecule that functions by cross-linking preformed fibrin clots to provide them mechanical stability and resistance to fibrinolysis (Lorand etÂ al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>). The plasma circulating FXIII is composed of two catalytic FXIIIA<sub>2</sub> subunits and two protective FXIIIB<sub>2</sub> subunits. While the homozygous inherited form of this deficiency caused by <italic>FXIIIA</italic> (OMIM #613225) or <italic>FXIIIB</italic> (OMIM #613235) gene mutations is rare (1 in 4â6 million), the milder heterozygous form is more frequent (Biswas etÂ al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Biswas etÂ al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Only recently, focus has shifted to the mild/heterozygous form of this deficiency that is associated with mild or even an asymptomatic phenotype (unless the affected individual is exposed to some kind of a trauma, for example, perioperative settings, accident etc.). Four publications from our group in the past 5Â years have shown that inherited mild or heterozygous deficiency does have clinical relevance (Biswas etÂ al. 2010; Ivaskevicius etÂ al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2010a</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Biswas etÂ al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). One key observation from these articles is that the FXIIIB subunit mutations, which are rarely reported in the severe homozygous form of FXIII deficiency, occur at almost equal proportion when compared with the frequency of FXIIIA subunit mutations in mild heterozygous FXIII deficiency (Ivaskevicius etÂ al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>). It is secreted as a homodimer into the plasma where it associates with the FXIIIA<sub>2</sub> subunit to form the FXIIIA<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> heterotetramer (Radek etÂ al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). It is secreted in excess of the FXIIIA<sub>2</sub> subunit in the plasma. Therefore, there is always free FXIIIB subunit aside from the complexed one circulating in the plasma. Despite early achievements investigating FXIIIB secondary structural elements and structural domains (Ichinose etÂ al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>), progress on structure/function studies of this noncatalytic subunit have been slow and there are no high-resolution x-ray-based crystal/NMR structures for FXIIIB<sub>2</sub> dimers, or for the FXIIIA<sub>2</sub>-bound conformation in FXIIIA<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> tetramers. Based on gel filtration chromatographic data, the FXIIIB subunit appears to form a physiological dimer (Souri etÂ al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). High sequence homologies with proteins from the complement system suggest that the monomeric B subunit is composed of ten Sushi domains, each comprising â¼60 amino acid residues and also designated in the literature as complement control protein (CCP) modules, or as short consensus repeats (SCR) (Ichinose etÂ al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). Knowledge of the structural interfaces between individual FXIIIB<sub>2</sub> subunit dimers as well as for the intermolecular interfaces of the FXIIIA<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> heterotetramer has only recently started to emerge (Katona etÂ al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The sushi domain folds into a small and compact hydrophobic core enveloped by six <italic>Î²</italic>-strands which are stabilized by two disulfide bridges on either end of this domain. All sushi structures share the relative structural orientation of the <italic>Î²</italic>-2 and <italic>Î²</italic>-4 strands. The other strands vary in topology relative to this central conserved core especially at the interdomain interfaces (Gaboriaud etÂ al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). There are more than 25 high-resolution structures for this highly conserved domain type and additional Sushi domain-containing protein (Soares etÂ al. <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In a recent article we have reported homology-based models for all ten sushi domains of the FXIIIB subunit based on the templates of complement factor H (CFH) sushi domains (Biswas etÂ al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We have so far reported 12 unique mutations in the FXIIIB<sub>2</sub> subunit from patients with heterozygous (mild) FXIII deficiency of which seven were missense mutations. In an earlier article using heterologous in vitro expression we had shown that almost all reported FXIIIB subunit missense mutations showed differences in secretion rate, with the highest impact being observed for two mutations affecting structural disulfide bonds and one mutation involving a Proline428 residue (Biswas etÂ al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, a few questions remained unanswered from this article which we have now attempted to answer in our present study. These questions are: (1) Do the differences in secretion rates correspond to a genuine secretion defect, that is, is there intraorganellar accumulation/aggregation or are they simply a reflection of the influence that the mutations have on the rate of biosynthesis and folding? (2) Does the in vitro expression data of the <italic>F13B</italic> mutations correlate with the heterozygous patient phenotype? (3) Which mutations are most likely to affect binding to the FXIIIA<sub>2</sub> subunit without compromising the antigenic stability of the FXIIIB<sub>2</sub> subunit? (4) What are the likely structure-functional correlations for these mutations? In our present study we have used a combination of heterologous <italic>in vitro</italic> expression, confocal microscopy and molecular dynamic simulation (MD) on homology-based models to address these questions.</p>

        <p>Site-directed mutagenesis for the seven FXIIIB missense mutations were performed on a mammalian expression pEZ-MO1-<italic>FXIIIB</italic> vector using the Gene Tailor site-directed mutagenesis kit (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). The seven FXIIIB mutant variants [pEZ-MO1-FXIIIB-p.Cys5Arg (<italic>F13Bc.73T&gt;C</italic>), pEZ-M01-FXIIIB-p.Cys316Phe (<italic>F13Bc.1007G&gt;T</italic>), MO1-FXIIIB-p.Ile81Asn (<italic>F13B</italic>c.302T&gt;A), MO1-FXIIIB-p.Leu116Phe (<italic>F13B</italic>c.406C&gt;T), MO1-FXIIIB-p.Val217Ile (<italic>F13Bc</italic>.709G&gt;A), MO1-FXIIIB-p.Val401Glu (<italic>F13B</italic>c.1262T&gt;A), MO1-FXIIIB-p.Pro428Ser (<italic>F13B</italic>c.1342C&gt;T)] were expressed in <italic>HEK 293T</italic> cells (DSMZ [Institute of DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Germany]) in homozygous and heterozygous forms, that is, mutations or the wild type was expressed alone (homozygous), mutations were cotransfected with the wild type (heterozygous). Culturing of the cells was done in 10Â cm dishes with Dulbeccoâ²s modified Eagles medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 0.1% Fungizone (Life Technologies) at 37% in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For transfection 2.7Â ÃÂ 10<sup>6</sup> million cells were seeded out into 6-well plates with DMEM (with FBS) without supplements and transfected with wild-type and mutated DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies). Co-transfection of the variants was done at a 4:0.5 ratio with a pCMV-LacZ Vector (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Lay, France) containing the <italic>LacZ</italic> gene for normalizing the antigen values. All samples (supernatant and lysed cells) were collected 36Â h after media change. The extracellular medium was centrifuged at 14,000<italic>g</italic> to remove cell debris and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by incubation with 260Â <italic>Î¼</italic>L nondenaturing lysis buffer ânative M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent bufferâ (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) containing 25Â mmol/L bicine pH 7.6 for 10Â min incubation and centrifuged at 14,000<italic>g</italic> for 5Â min at 4Â°C. Both extracellular medium and cell lysates were stored at â80Â°C for later analysis. Each transfection set was performed in triplicate and repeated a minimum of three times(total <italic>n</italic>Â &gt;Â 9). Total FXIIIB<sub>2</sub> and FXIIIA<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> antigen levels were evaluated for the expression supernatants using ELISA kits (Technoclone, Vienna, Austria).</p>

        <p>For confocal microscopy 270000 <italic>HEK293T</italic> cells were seeded on 12-mm Poly-<sc>d</sc>-Lysine coated coverslips (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) in 24-well cell culture plates. The cells were transiently transfected with the Wild-type pEZ-MO1-FXIIIB and the seven FXIIIB mutant variants using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. After 24Â h cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10Â min and at room temperature. After washing with PBS and blocking (90% PBS azide [0.1% sodium azide], 10% FBS, 0.1% Triton-X100) incubation with 2.5Â <italic>Î¼</italic>g/mL primary antibody diluted in PBS azide (1% FBS, 0.1% Triton-X100) against the FXIIIB subunit (mouse monoclonal IgG) and the cell compartments ER (IgG rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin; Abcam, Cambridge, England) and Golgi (rabbit anti-TGn46; Sigma, Hamburg, Germany) was done. Signal detection was performed using an IgG Alexa Fluor 488 IgG goat anti-mouse (Life technologies) against the FXIIIB subunit and an IgG goat anti-rabbit Alexa Flour 594 (Life technologies) against the ER and Golgi compartment. After washing the treated cells and Dapi (Life technologies) staining for nucleus visualization the samples were embedded with VectaShield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, United Kingdom) and stored at 4Â°C for visual imaging with the Olympus Fluo View FV 1000 confocal microscope, Hamburg, Germany.</p>

        <title>Image analysis</title>
        <p>Colocalization analysis was performed using plugins embedded in the image visualization and analysis software ImageJ 1.43m (Schneider etÂ al. <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Analysis was performed on a similar sized symmetrical region of interest (ROI) selected for each dye. Background levels were subtracted from each ROI before calculating the degree of colocalization (to a range of one standard deviation). Each colored image was split into the respective RGB (red, green, blue) channels. The comparative degree of colocalization for the wild-type and mutant variants was calculated as mean Pearsonâs and Manderâ²s R coefficients on the red and green channels using the embedded colocalization analysis plugin at default settings. The colocalization highlighter plugin was used also with default setting (50% threshold values for both channels) to further visualize the co-localized pixels rendered as white. Since Pearsonâs and Manderâ²s R coefficient showed good correlation (Manderâ²s R was almost consistently higher than Pearsonâs correlation coefficient), therefore only Pearsonâs correlation coefficient was used for comparing relative degree of colocalization between the mutant variants and wild-type (Adler and Parmryd <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). A minimum of <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 10 ROIâ²s were evaluated for each pairwise comparison.</p>

        <title>Expression and reconstitution study</title>
        <p>Constant amount of the recombinant FXIIIA<sub>2</sub> subunit (Zedira, Darmstadt, Germany) (0.75Â <italic>Î¼</italic>g) was added to a final volume of 200Â <italic>Î¼</italic>L of transfection product (wild type as well as mutants), that is, the secreted medium for reconstituting the heterotetramer. In the event of a significant difference in the beta galactosidase reporter levels between the particular mutant and wild type the mixing volumes would have been altered to allow for differences in transfection efficiency. Since this set of expression and reconstitution showed no significant differences in beta galactosidase reporter levels the mixing volumes were not altered. Postincubation the mix was evaluated for FXIIIA<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> heterotetrameric antigen levels. The results are normalized against total FXIIIB<sub>2</sub> antigen levels previously evaluated to give a representation of the respective variantâs ability to form a heterotetramer, which are compared against the wild type. This ability we name as the comparative tetramerization potential (CTP) or potential percentage (CTPP). It is calculated by the following formula:

        <title>Proteasomal inhibition</title>
        <p>Typical 36Â h transfection and collection with the wild type and different variants was performed as described above. The only difference was that after 24Â h of transfection 10Â mmol/L Lactacystin (to a final concentration 10Â <italic>Î¼</italic>mol/L) was added to the cell medium. Therefore, the cells were incubated with 10Â <italic>Î¼</italic>mol/L of Lactacystin for a period of 12Â h. This analysis was done only one time in triplicates.</p>

        <title>Structural and sequence conservation analysis</title>
        <p>Two different types of multiple sequence alignments were generated to evaluate the conservation of residues on which the mutations have been reported and their neighboring residues. The first alignment was generated by aligning individual FXIIIB sushi domain sequences with its near homolog CFH sushi domain amino acid sequences. Since elaborate functional information exists for the CFH sushi domains, this alignment helped us to functionally evaluate FXIIIB sushi domains with respect to functional definitions for CFH sushi domains (Perkins etÂ al. <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kopp etÂ al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). A more elaborate multiple sequence alignment was generated by first downloading sushi domain amino acid sequences of 50 mammalian proteins (Soares etÂ al. <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and then aligning them with the ten FXIIIB sushi domain sequences in order to look for overall sequence conservation and identity. Alignment was done on Jalview 2.7 using MAFFT, L-insi-1 accuracy-based parameters (Waterhouse etÂ al. <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Katoh and Standley etÂ al. <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In addition to sequence conservation analysis, structural conservation of the FXIIIB subunit sushi domains was evaluated by submitting their homology-based models individually to the PROBIS server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://probis.cmm.ki.si/">http://probis.cmm.ki.si/</ext-link>) (Konc and Janezic <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2010a</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>).</p>

        <title>MD simulation analysis</title>
        <p>Previously published homology-based models were used as a primer for the MD simulation study (Biswas etÂ al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The previously generated models were first refined by a short solvated refinement simulation run of 500Â ps on YASARA version 13.9.8 (Krieger etÂ al. <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Individual sushi domain models were housed in a simulation cell 2Â ÃÂ 7.5Â Ã larger than the model on each axis. The simulation cell was filled with water to a density of 0.997Â g/L. The YASARA YAMBER03 force field derived originally from the AMBER force field was imposed. Periodic boundary conditions were used for the simulation run. The structure with the lowest energy from the simulation run was used for further study. Each of the refined sushi domain models (wild type) on which the mutations occur were individually run for a period of 25Â ns with a different force field (AMBER03) than the one used for model refining. The remaining simulation protocol was similar to the one used for model refining. The same protocol was employed for a 25-ns run for sushi domains on which the individual missense variants were introduced and optimized for the best possible rotamer (using SCRWL parameters) (Krivov etÂ al. <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The simulation trajectories were analyzed for DCCM (dynamic cross-correlation matrices), C-alpha backbone RMSDs (root mean square deviation), RMSF (root mean square fluctuation), radius of gyration, surface electrostatic potential, accessible surface area and other variable components. These analyses were performed for the complete trajectory as well as for the simulation-averaged structure. The simulation variables were compared between the wild-type and mutated sushi domains. All image rendering and structural analysis (of the simulation trajectories as well as the simulation averaged structures) was done using YASARA version 13.9.8 and SWISS-PDB viewer (Guex etÂ al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Difference in folding free energies between mutant and wild-type structures were calculated using the following web servers: Imut 2.0, SDM, McSM, DUET, ERIS (Capriotti etÂ al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Yin etÂ al. <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Worth etÂ al. <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Pires etÂ al. <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) and also with the FOLDX plug in embedded in YASARA (Van Durme etÂ al. <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The simulation averaged structures for both the wild type and mutants were used as an input for these web servers as well as for FOLDX-based calculations. The PIPSA web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pipsa.eml.org/pipsa/">http://pipsa.eml.org/pipsa/</ext-link>) was used to calculate the surface electrostatic potential distances between wild type and mutated sushi domain (once again the simulation averaged structures were used as an input) (Richter etÂ al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p>

        <title>Heterologous expression of FXIIIB subunit variants in homozygous and heterozygous forms</title>
        <p>The results of heterologous expression of the FXIIIB subunit wild type and mutations in homozygous form showed a pattern that was published recently (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>) (Biswas etÂ al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Three of the mutations (<italic>Cys5Arg</italic>, <italic>Cys316Phe</italic>, and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic>) showed quite low levels of secreted FXIIIB subunit (mean levels ranging between 0.29 and 2.74Â <italic>Î¼</italic>g/mL) Another variant showed moderately reduced levels than the wild type (<italic>Val401Glu</italic>; mean level 3.65Â <italic>Î¼</italic>g/mL), three other variants (<italic>Ile81Asn</italic>, <italic>Leu116Phe</italic>, <italic>Val217Ile</italic>) showed levels close to that of the wild type (4.82Â <italic>Î¼</italic>g/mL). The heterozygous coexpression with the wild type for all variants afforded some degree of correction for the mutated expression phenotype. In fact in some of the variants (<italic>Ile81Asn</italic>, <italic>Leu116Phe</italic>, <italic>Val217Ile, Cys316Phe</italic>, and <italic>Val401Glu</italic>) the coexpressed phenotype FXIIIB<sub>2</sub> antigen levels (4.2â6.66Â <italic>Î¼</italic>g/mL) were quite similar to the wild type (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>) except for <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic> which reached only 1.22â3.87Â <italic>Î¼</italic>g/mL FXIIIB antigen levels.</p>

The <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> variant showed similar levels of colocalization for ER (difference <italic>PÂ </italic>=Â 0.96; Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>A) but very low levels of colocalization for Golgi (lowest amongst all mutations; difference <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.001) (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>B). The degree of colocalization was also quite low in both ER and Golgi for the mutations <italic>Cys316Phe</italic> and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic>. <italic>Ile81Asn</italic> and <italic>Val401Glu</italic> showed similar levels of colocalization in ER and lower but only borderline significant levels of colocalization in Golgi indicating that their secretion paths follow similar fates as that of wild type. The <italic>Val217Ile</italic> mutant shows significantly lower levels of colocalization for both ER and Golgi (but not of the order of other high impact mutations like <italic>Cys316Phe</italic> and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic>) which might account for the slight difference in secreted antigen levels for this mutant when compared with the wild type.</p>

        <title>Structural and sequence conservation analysis</title>
        <p>Sequence alignment with CFH sushi domains as well as with sushi domains from 50 different mammalian proteins (containing sushi domains) suggest a number of consistently conserved residues aside from the cysteines which form the backbone structural disulfide bonds of the sushi domains [Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>A(1) and (2)]. Interestingly most of these sequence conserved residues are hydrophobic (Proline, Tryptophan) in character suggesting a role for these residues either in binding/functional interactions or maintaining the hydrophobic core of their respective sushi domains. Structural alignment of the sushi domains differs from their sequence alignment in certain segments. We observed sequence conserved residues occurring in regions of structural variability in the FXIIIB sushi domains. This was quite frequent for the residues on the variable length loops connecting the sushi domain beta strands (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>B). The two reported cysteine missense mutations occur in highly conserved structural cores of their sushi domains and show practically no variability at all (structurally as well as sequence identity based). The Pro428 residue is also highly conserved. Only in the 13th factor H sushi domain it is substituted by another residue, which turns out to be a hydrophobically similar and small Val residue [Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>A(2)]. The Ile81 residue occurs in a semiconserved sequence but a structurally variable region of the FXIIIB subunit S2 sushi domain. The Ile residue in the multiple sequence alignment with CFH sushi domain varies on most occasions to a hydrophobically similar Val residue [Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>A(2)]. Only in sushi domains 14 of CFH we observe an Asn residue similar to the reported mutation (<italic>Ile81Asn</italic>). However, sushi domain 14 has no designated role in proteinâprotein interactions for CFH protein, therefore this sushi domain might be functionally redundant (Perkins etÂ al. 2011). In the larger multiple alignment this residue is poorly conserved but most of the variant residues are also hydrophobic in character. The Leu116 residue is located in a highly conserved sequence stretch (VQCLSDG) within which the Leu residue is the most poorly conserved residue. Interestingly, this residue varies between polar and nonpolar residues almost consistently between the various sushi domains in both the larger as well smaller (with CFH) multiple sequence alignments. The Val217 residue is a highly conserved residue and it aligns with the Val401 residue (on which another mutation <italic>Val401Glu</italic> has been reported) from sushi domain 7. The difference between the two mutations is that one is to a hydrophobically similar Ile residue and the other results in a negatively charged polar Glu residue.</p>

        <title>MD simulation analysis for FXIIIB subunit sushi domain mutations on the FXIIIB subunit sushi domain homology-based models</title>
        <p>A number of subtle as well as wide-ranging differences were observed during the analysis of the simulation trajectories/simulation averaged structures of individual mutations modeled on their respective homology modeled sushi domains. The <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> mutation showed deviation in structure indicated by higher RMSD values than its wild-type sushi domain 1 for the entire simulation time (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>A). Simulation RMSF values showed wide differences in flexibility upon mutation on neighboring hydrophobic variable length loops (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>B). Differences in cross-correlation maps were also observed especially in areas of surface exposure for the sushi domain 1 (Fig. S2). A number of hydrophobic patches were detected in the simulation averaged structure for the <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> mutation when compared with the wild type (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>A). Differences in surface electrostatic potentials for the simulation averaged structures (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>B) were observed for all mutations except for <italic>Leu116Phe</italic> and <italic>Val217Ile</italic> (not shown here). In fact the differences in calculated surface electrostatic potential between the wild-type and the mutated domain was the highest for the <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> mutation while the other mutations also showed modest to high differences (Table S1). The mutation to an Arg residue breaks the disulfide bond but also results in the gain of hydrogen bonds with Met29 (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>B). The mutation also results in the gain of accessible surface area for the mutated Arg residue side chain instead of the completely buried wild-type Cys residue (Table S2). Two other mutations, <italic>Cys316Phe</italic> and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic> also show higher RMSD values when compared with the wild type but not of the order of <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>A). The <italic>Cys316Phe</italic> mutation in particular behaves close to the wild type for most of the simulation time. However, this mutation does show differences in RMSD values from that of its wild-type sushi domain when approaching the end of the stipulated simulation time, indicating a slower and lower impact mutation than the <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> mutation. The <italic>Pro428Ser</italic> mutation showed consistently higher RMSD values than the wild type during the entire simulation. The <italic>Cys316Phe</italic> and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic> mutations showed a number of differences in the cross-correlation maps (Fig. S2) indicating an impact on the correlated motion and therefore relative orientation of individual residues on the sushi domain surface. The mutation <italic>Cys316Phe</italic> showed one small hydrophobic patch when compared with the wild type (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>A; Table S3). This hydrophobic patch is dominated by the mutated surface exposed Phenylalanine (Phe316) which lies next to a Lys362 residue which is also surface exposed in the mutated sushi domain in comparison to its wild-type domain where it is partially buried (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>E). This hydrophobic patch is a likely target for the ubiquitin system for the clearance of this misfolded mutant variant by the proteasomal degradation pathway (since ubiquitin attaches itself to surface lysine residues) Mattiroli and Sixma etÂ al. <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>. The <italic>Pro428Ser</italic> mutation shows conspicuous hydrophobic patches all over its sushi domain (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>A). The mutated Ser428 residue seems to mimic the wild-type Proresidue since there is no observable loss or gain of surface accessible surface area or a distinct change in backbone secondary structure of the residue (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>C). However, the interaction profile of the simulation averaged structure shows that this mutation leads to the loss as well as gain of several hydrogen bonds/salt bridges (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>D). This might be principally responsible for altering the native fold and exposing the observed hydrophobic patches. The simulation run for the <italic>Val401Glu</italic> mutation does not show remarkable changes in RMSD (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>A). The average RMSDs though do show small differences between the wild type and mutant (0.113Â Ã). The RMSF values for <italic>Pro428Ser</italic> and <italic>Cys316Phe</italic> mutations show small changes in flexibility in regions spread across the sushi domains (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>B). The mutations <italic>Ile81Asn</italic> and <italic>Val401Glu</italic> also show differences in RMSF values between the mutated and the wild-type sushi domains suggesting influences on domain flexibility. The other two mutations (<italic>Leu116Phe</italic> and <italic>Val217Ile</italic>) do not show any remarkable differences in RMSD or RMSF values (data not shown here). The free energy calculations made across different servers consensually suggest a destabilizing influence for almost all mutations except for <italic>Leu116Phe</italic> and <italic>Val217Ile</italic> (Table S4). Our simulation analysis agrees best with the results obtained with the FoldX tool, Eris and Imut 2.0 server in that the two Cys mutations and one Pro mutation seem to have the highest impact on domain stability. The <italic>Val401Glu</italic> mutation also had high destabilizing free energy values across almost all free energy evaluation servers tested in this study.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The missense mutations investigated in our study have been reported in heterozygous form in patients with mild FXIII deficient phenotype. The occurrence of heterozygous mutations is a phenomenon not uncommon to sushi domain-containing proteins as was earlier observed by Goodship (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and Dragon-Durey etÂ al. (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) in CFH proteins. The heterozygous form of expression in our study conclusively demonstrates that these mutations can be classified into three major types: (1) Mutations which show influence on antigenic stability (and therefore are partially corrected for their phenotype when coexpressed with the wild type) (2) Mutations which have no influence on antigenic stability and therefore their impact is limited to interference in proteinâprotein interactions (i.e., dimer/heteromer assembly) and (3) Mutations which influence antigenic stability as well as binding interactions. The two cysteine mutations, <italic>Cys316Phe</italic> and <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> and the proline mutation, <italic>Pro428Ser</italic> clearly belong to the first as well as last group. In our earlier study we had observed differential rate/pattern of secretion for almost all FXIIIB missense mutations investigated (Biswas etÂ al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the current study, we have gone a step further to look for intracellular accumulation followed by possible downregulation of these mutations by the unfolded protein response. Amongst the high impact mutations, only <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> was observed to accumulate within the ER following which the mutant protein is cleared off by the unfolded protein response of the cell. This was clearly demonstrated since on one hand almost equivalent amount of protein was observed colocalized with the ER for the mutated protein (when compared with the wild type), almost none to nonsignificant amounts of protein was observed in the Golgi indicating an immediate response from the quality control system of the cell. The structural analysis also demonstrated that the mutation most likely results in structural destabilization (high RMSDs) and strong hydrophobic patches on the surface of the protein/domain which will elicit a strong unfolded protein response. As a result almost no protein is observed in the secreted medium for the <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> mutation. The influence of the unfolded protein response on the mutated protein is further demonstrated when upon inhibition of the proteasome (by Lactacystin) we observe a correction of the expression phenotype. The other two high impact mutations <italic>Cys316Phe</italic> and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic> do not seem to have an accumulative influence on the respective variant proteins as no accumulation is seen in either ER or Golgi. However, structural analysis does show the presence of hydrophobic patches as well as a destabilizing influence (high RMSDs) on their respective domains. This is further supported by the fact that while the mutated variants are observed in both Golgi and ER, their amounts are significantly reduced. This suggests that these mutations do elicit a weak unfolded protein response (in comparison to <italic>Cys5Arg</italic>) which leads to reduced protein secretion. The highest difference in post-Lactacystin-induced antigenic values was observed for <italic>Pro428Ser</italic>. While some antigen from all three of these mutations (<italic>Cys5Arg</italic>, <italic>Cys316Phe</italic>, and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic>) does get secreted into the medium, this variant protein is still likely to be nonfunctional owing to altered surface electrostatics which will prevent its association with the FXIIIA<sub>2</sub> subunit and therefore also influence heterotetramer assembly. This is further demonstrated by the low CTP values for the <italic>Pro428Ser</italic> and <italic>Cys316Phe</italic> mutations (the <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> mutation was not evaluated as explained before owing to very low antigenic values). The high degree of structural and sequence conservation and the <italic>in silico</italic> calculated folding energy values observed for the wild-type residues corresponding to these three mutations (<italic>Cys5Arg</italic>, <italic>Cys316Phe</italic>, and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic>) lend further credence to the idea that these mutations primarily have a destabilizing effect on the protein. Furthermore, our confocal analysis confirms that amongst these three mutations, <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> is the only true accumulative/secretion-based defect resulting in ER accumulation and subsequent degradation. Interestingly, although <italic>Cys5Arg</italic> and <italic>Cy316Phe</italic> both break structural disulfide bonds their detailed expression/confocal phenotype (one results in accumulation/degradation while other shows no accumulation/lower rate of degradation) is different. This dichotomy has been observed in cysteine mutations from the sushi domains of CFH protein also. Saunders etÂ al. (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) tabulated that amongst eight reported cysteine substitutions which break structural disulfide bonds, six resulted in the loss of stability/incorrect folding and reduced antigen levels. The other two mutations, <italic>p.Cys630Trp</italic> (<italic>c.1890T&gt;G</italic>) and <italic>p.Cys1043Arg</italic> (<italic>c.3127T&gt;C</italic>) in the 11th and 17th sushi domains, respectively, showed normal antigen levels. Therefore, we hypothesize that in spite of forming structural disulfide bonds; cysteines in FXIIIB subunit (and other sushi domain-containing proteins) are likely to show strong functional diversity. The mutations <italic>Ile81Asn</italic> and <italic>Val401Glu</italic> both show near wild-type-like phenotype and slightly attenuated level phenotype, respectively, in terms of secretion/confocal phenotype. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis did not show any major implications for these two mutations on the stability of their respective sushi domains. What both mutations clearly show are changes in the surface electrostatic potential for their respective domains. Previous literature suggests that sushi domain interactions are primarily electrostatic mediated and that sushi domains can be classified into functional groups on the basis of their surface electrostatic properties (Soares etÂ al. <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This coupled with the fact that both show reduced CTPP values (when compared with the wild type) suggests that these mutations primarily influence binding to the FXIIIA<sub>2</sub> subunit and therefore FXIIIA<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> heterotetramer assembly since native PAGE ruled out any impaired dimer formation (data not shown; although a qualitative effect cannot be ruled out). Previous literature suggests that sushi domain interactions are primarily electrostatic mediated and that sushi domains can be classified into functional groups on the basis of their surface electrostatic properties (Soares etÂ al. <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The <italic>Val401Glu</italic> mutation might additionally have a mild destabilizing effect in addition to influencing binding to the FXIIIA subunit (as evidenced by differences in average RMSDs from the wild type, minor gain of accessible surface area, radius of gyration over the wild type and folding free energy calculations). The sushi domain 2 of the FXIIIB subunit on which the <italic>Ile81Asn</italic> mutation occurs has now been conclusively shown to participate in interaction with the FXIIIA subunit (Katona etÂ al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The interface region for this sushi domain shown in this study is proximal to our reported mutation. Sushi domain 7, on which the <italic>Val401Glu</italic> mutation occurs has so far showed no role in FXIIIA subunit interaction or FXIIIB subunit dimerization (Souri etÂ al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, since the entire heterotetramer assembly is assumed to be cooperative in nature the participation of other domains has not been ruled out as yet. This mutation results in the replacement of a highly sequence and structurally conserved non polar residue with a negatively charged Glu residue which explains for the difference in the electrostatic potential surface observed for the mutated sushi domain from the wild-type sushi domain. This also explains the reduced CTPP values from our study for the <italic>Val401Glu</italic> mutation which further confirms its impact on heterotetramer assembly.</p>
      <p>The remaining two mutations, <italic>Leu116Phe</italic> and <italic>Val217Ile</italic> are observed to be pathologically neutral in terms of secretion, structural and functional stability. No effect on heterotetramer assembly was observed for these two mutations. Low degree of sequence and structural conservation further supports the neutral status of these two mutations. Minor influences on the rate of biosynthesis still cannot be ruled out for these two variant within the current experimental set up. Even in the event of a minor influence, these variants are most likely candidate functional polymorphisms rather than true causative mutations.</p>
      <p>We have therefore using a host of functional, structural/computational analysis successfully determined the underlying molecular mechanisms for the causality of seven FXIIIB subunit variants which we had earlier reported in heterozygous form from patients with mild FXIII deficiency. We found that three of these mutations (<italic>Cys5Arg</italic>, <italic>Cys316Phe</italic>, and <italic>Pro428Ser</italic>) cause antigenic instability as well as reduced binding to FXIIIA subunit, two (<italic>Ile81Asn</italic> and <italic>Val401Glu</italic>) cause impaired FXIIIA subunit binding while maintaining antigenic stability. Only one mutation in the entire lot (<italic>Cys5Arg</italic>) showed a true accumulative/secretion-based defect while two (<italic>Leu116Phe</italic> and <italic>Val217Ile</italic>) others seem to have neutral status.</p>

        <p><bold>Figure S1.</bold> Proteasomal inhibition by lactacystin. The bar graphs in this image represent the difference in FXIIIB antigen values with and without lactacystin treatment (Proteasome inhibition). The wild type is represented by dark black bar while all the other mutations are represented by dark gray bars. A dotted black line marks the difference in antigenic level (i.e., for the wild type) above which any observation would be considered an effect on proteasome due to the mutation.</p>
        <p><bold>Figure S2.</bold> DCCM map for simulation trajectories. This image depicts the DCCM (dynamic cross-correlation matrices) map of each mutationâs simulation trajectory compared with its wild-type sushi domain simulation trajectory. The yellow regions show positive correlation (proportional to its intensity) and the blue regions shows negative correlation.</p>
        <p><bold>Figure S3.</bold> Confocal microscopy images for all variants. This image shows the co-localization pattern for all missense mutations with ER and Golgi in comparison with the wild type. The image coding is the same as in the main FigureÂ 2.</p>
