        <p>Factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH) catalyzes the Î²-hydroxylation of an asparagine residue in the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), a modification that negatively regulates HIF transcriptional activity. FIH also catalyzes the hydroxylation of highly conserved Asn residues within the ubiquitous ankyrin repeat domain (ARD)-containing proteins. Hydroxylation has been shown to stabilize localized regions of the ARD fold in the case of a three-repeat consensus ankyrin protein, but this phenomenon has not been demonstrated for the extensive naturally occurring ARDs. Here we report that the cytoskeletal ankyrin family are substrates for FIH-catalyzed hydroxylations. We show that the ARD of ankyrinR is multiply hydroxylated by FIH both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in endogenous proteins purified from human and mouse erythrocytes. Hydroxylation of the D34 region of ankyrinR ARD (ankyrin repeats 13â24) increases its conformational stability and leads to a reduction in its interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (CDB3), demonstrating the potential for FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation to modulate protein-protein interactions. Unexpectedly we found that aspartate residues in ankyrinR and ankyrinB are hydroxylated and that FIH-catalyzed aspartate hydroxylation also occurs in other naturally occurring AR sequences. The crystal structure of an FIH variant in complex with an Asp-substrate peptide together with NMR analyses of the hydroxylation product identifies the 3<italic>S</italic> regio- and stereoselectivity of the FIH-catalyzed Asp hydroxylation, revealing a previously unprecedented posttranslational modification.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>4</sup></xref> was originally identified as a negative regulator of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), a transcription factor that mediates the hypoxia response in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation of an asparagine (Asn) residue in the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (CAD) of human HIF-Î± reduces the interaction between HIF and the transcriptional coactivator proteins p300/CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), thereby reducing the expression of HIF-regulated genes. The dependence of FIH on oxygen for catalysis enables it to act as a sensor for hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). FIH not only catalyzes the Î²-hydroxylation of Asn residues in HIF-Î± isoforms but also of ankyrin repeat domain (ARD)-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.193540/DC1">supplemental Scheme 1</ext-link>). In contrast to its âswitch-likeâ role in HIF regulation, the role(s) of Asn hydroxylation of the ubiquitous ARD proteins is unknown; it has been proposed that the extent of ARD hydroxylation regulates the amount of FIH available for HIF hydroxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>The ankyrin repeat domain comprises a variable number of â¼33 residue ankyrin repeats (ARs) that are arranged into a helix-loop-helix-Î²-hairpin/loop conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). ARDs are predicted to be present in &gt;300 proteins encoded by the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and are involved in a range of processes including signaling, development, epigenetic regulation, and cellular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). To date most studies on FIH-catalyzed ARD hydroxylations have involved signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), where several Asn hydroxylation sites have been identified <italic>in vivo</italic>, with incomplete and widely varying levels of hydroxylation (5â96%) being observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Proteomic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and biochemical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) suggest that ARD hydroxylation might be widespread.</p><p><italic>Trans</italic>-Prolyl-4 hydroxylation of the extracellular matrix protein collagen occurs extensively in (Pro-Pro-Gly)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> motifs and stabilizes the collagen triple helix structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Crystallization studies on ARD proteins have shown that Asn hydroxylation does not alter the stereotypical ankyrin fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, solution studies have revealed that Asn hydroxylation stabilizes consensus ARD proteins with respect to unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The question then arises as to whether ARD proteins that have a structural role in cells undergo Asn hydroxylation. The human cytoskeletal ankyrin family, which serve as adapters linking a variety of integral membrane proteins to the spectrin-cytoskeleton, includes three members: ankyrinR, ankyrinB, and ankyrinG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). All three ankyrins contain 24 ARs in their membrane binding domains. Here we show that peptide fragments derived from ankyrinR, ankyrinB, and ankyrinG are substrates for FIH. We demonstrate that the ankyrinR ARD undergoes multiple FIH-catalyzed Asn hydroxylations both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Hydroxylation of ankyrinR D34 causes its stabilization and may modulate its interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (CDB3). Unexpectedly, we found that FIH catalyzes the aspartate (Asp) hydroxylation of ankyrinR and ankyrinB. Using biochemical assays, NMR, and crystallographic analyses, we show that FIH also hydroxylates Asp residues in other AR sequences to generate the novel 2<italic>S</italic>,3<italic>S</italic>-hydroxyaspartate product. Taken together the results expand the scope of FIH-catalyzed post-translational modifications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Plasmid</title><p>pGEX-KG D34 (ankyrinR aa 402â827, ARs 13â24) was a kind gift from P.

The D34 region of the AnkyrinR ARD contains a high affinity binding site for band 3 and recapitulates the binding properties of the full ARD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), whereas the D2 region (ARs 7â12) also contains a band 3 binding site of lower affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).

Indeed, in ARDs aspartate is the second most common residue at the target hydroxylation position after asparagine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.193540/DC1">supplemental Fig. S32</ext-link>), suggesting that FIH-catalyzed Asp hydroxylation of ARDs could be common. Previous studies on the selectivity of FIH with respect to hydroxylation of the HIF-1Î± C-terminal transcriptional activation domain have found that substitution of an Asp residue for the hydroxylated Asn residue (Asn-803) does not allow for hydroxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), at least with a peptide fragment of HIF-1Î±. Consistent with this, we did not observe hydroxylation of the 18-residue D34 peptide fragment containing Asp-695 despite clear evidence for hydroxylation at this site within the ARD. The collected results support the proposal that both the sequence of individual ankyrin repeats and secondary/tertiary structure considerations play roles in determining whether particular Asn or Asp residues in an ARD protein are substrates for FIH.</p><p>Another 2OG oxygenase, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) Asp/Asn hydroxylase (Î²-Asp/Asn hydroxylase (AspH or BAH)) has been found to catalyze Î²-hydroxylation of both Asp and Asn residues in EGF-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). This enzyme produces hydroxy-Asp/Asn residues with the 2<italic>S</italic>, 3<italic>R</italic>-stereochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). In contrast, FIH produces Î²-hydroxyasparagine residues with the 2<italic>S</italic>, 3<italic>S</italic>-stereochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). NMR analysis of a hydroxylated Asp-substrate peptide indicates that hydroxylation occurs at the Î²-carbon position of the target Asp residue. Crystallographic analyses with the FIH Q239H variant demonstrate that the hydroxylated Asp residue adopts a similar conformation at the FIH active site as the hydroxylated Asn residue in ARDs and in HIF-1Î±CAD, supporting the proposal that FIH catalyzes 3<italic>S</italic>-hydroxylation of Asp residues. 3<italic>S</italic>-Hydroxylation of aspartic acid has not been previously identified as a post-translational modification.</p><p>The observation that FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation of D34 results in stabilization of its conformation supports the proposal based on work with consensus ARD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) that Asn hydroxylation stabilizes the ARD folds of naturally occurring proteins. The combined crystallographic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and CD/DSC analyses reveal that hydroxylation does not change the stereotypical ARD-fold but causes stabilization via a process involving formation of a new hydrogen bond with the side chain of the residue at the â2 position relative to the hydroxylated asparagine. In all but one of the ankyrinR/D34 Asn residues observed to be hydroxylated by FIH, an appropriate residue at the â2 position for hydrogen bonding with the introduced alcohol was present. The exception (Asn-464) is present in a KVN sequence and was observed to be hydroxylated to a high level in recombinant D34, although we were unable to determine whether this site is hydroxylated <italic>in vivo</italic> due to limitations of the proteomic analyses. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that the stabilizing effect of hydroxylation on D34 results from the same mechanism proposed for the consensus ARD-proteins. However, for the consensus ARD proteins the hydroxylation occurred to a high level (&gt;90%) at one or two sites. In contrast, it is likely that the hydroxylation-induced stabilization observed for D34, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, results from multiple hydroxylations. These results raise the possibility of ankyrin repeat hydroxylation not only regulating the structure of localized region of ARD proteins and, hence, protein-protein interactions involving specific regions but of multiple hydroxylations âfine-tuningâ the overall biophysical properties of ARD-proteins, including the spring-like behavior of some ARDs, a property proposed to be associated with mechano-transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).</p><p>Hydroxylation of ARD proteins has been previously shown to weaken their protein-protein interactions with FIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), a property that may regulate the amount of FIH available to hydroxylate HIF-Î±. To test whether the multiple incomplete hydroxylations observed for ankyrinR have the potential to modify a known protein-protein interaction, we investigated the effect of FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation on the binding of D34 and D12 regions to band 3. Treatment with FIH (but not a catalytically inactive variant) reduced the binding of D34, but not D12, to CBD3. Interestingly, these observations suggest that the consequences of AR hydroxylation within subdomains of the same ARD can be different. Together with experimental analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), structural models for the interaction of ankyrinR with CDB3 tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) imply that the D34 region is more important for binding than the D12 region. It is possible that FIH-catalyzed multiple hydroxylations of D34 have a greater effect on CDB3 binding than that of D12, at least in part because the D34 hydroxylation sites make closer contact with CDB3. Although the physiological significance of the observed reduction in CBD3 binding to hydroxylated D34, if any, is unclear, the results demonstrate the potential for multiple, but incomplete, ARD hydroxylations to modulate protein-protein interactions. In this regard, it is also of interest that recent work has shown that the extent of folding of the ARD protein IÎºBÎ± regulates its binding to the transcriptional activator nuclear factor ÎºB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>).</p></sec>
