      <abstract>
        <p>A mutation in the <italic>BRI2/ITM2b</italic> gene causes loss of BRI2 protein leading to familial Danish dementia (FDD). BRI2 deficiency of FDD provokes an increase in amyloid-Î² precursor protein (APP) processing since BRI2 is an inhibitor of APP proteolysis, and APP mediates the synaptic/memory deficits in FDD. APP processing is linked to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis, which is consistent with a common mechanism involving toxic APP metabolites in both dementias. We show that inhibition of APP cleavage by Î²-secretase rescues synaptic/memory deficits in a mouse model of FDD. Î²-cleavage of APP yields amino-terminal-soluble APPÎ² (sAPPÎ²) and Î²-carboxyl-terminal fragments (Î²-CTF). Processing of Î²-CTF by Î³-secretase releases amyloid-Î² (AÎ²), which is assumed to cause AD. However, inhibition of Î³-secretase did not ameliorate synaptic/memory deficits of FDD mice. These results suggest that sAPPÎ² and/or Î²-CTF, rather than AÎ², are the toxic species causing dementia, and indicate that reducing Î²-cleavage of APP is an appropriate therapeutic approach to treating human dementias. Our data and the failures of anti-AÎ² therapies in humans advise against targeting Î³-secretase cleavage of APP and/or AÎ².</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Amyloid deposition of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide characterises Alzheimer disease (AD). AÎ² derives from sequential cleavage of amyloid-Î² precursor protein (APP) by Î²- and Î³-secretases (Cole &amp; Vassar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">2007</xref>; De Strooper et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1A</xref>). Interestingly, mutations in either <italic>APP</italic> or the Î³-secretase genes <italic>PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic> cause familial AD (FAD; Bertram et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2010</xref>; St George-Hyslop &amp; Petit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2005</xref>). Mutation of <italic>BRI2</italic>/<italic>ITM2b</italic> causes familial Danish dementia (FDD), an AD-like familial dementia with amyloid deposits. In normal individuals the immature BRI2 precursor (imBRI2) is cleaved by convertases in the Golgi into mature BRI2 (mBRI2) and a carboxy-terminal 23 amino acid peptide (Bri23). mBRI2 is transported to the plasma membrane and Bri23 is secreted. In the Danish kindred, the presence of a 10-nt duplication one codon before the normal stop codon produces a frame-shift in the BRI2 sequence generating a larger-than-normal precursor protein called BRI2ADan. Cleavage by convertases releases the amyloid subunit that comprises the last 34 COOH-terminal amino acids (ADan) and mBRI2. ADan accumulates into amyloid plaques, which contain both AÎ² and ADan (Choi et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2004</xref>; Vidal et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2000</xref>).</p>

      <p>Since amyloidogenic peptides are believed to cause dementias (Hardy &amp; Selkoe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2002</xref>), transgenic mice carrying mutant <italic>APP</italic>, <italic>PSEN1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> or <italic>BRI2</italic>/<italic>ITM2b</italic> are used to model these dementias, as over-expression is necessary to reproduce amyloidosis (Jucker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2010</xref>). However, over-expression of mutant genes might produce harmful effects unrelated to dementias and lead to erroneous information concerning the pathogenesis and therapy of human diseases. The clinical failures of compounds efficacious in transgenic models support this hypothesis (Ganjei, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2010</xref>). To avoid artefacts of over-expression, we generated a knock-in mouse model of FDD (FDD<sub>KI</sub>) that, like FDD patients (Vidal et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2000</xref>), is heterozygous for one mutated FDD allele of <italic>BRI2</italic>/<italic>ITM2b</italic> (Giliberto et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2009</xref>). FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice develop progressive synaptic and memory deficits due to loss of mBri2, with no amyloidosis (Tamayev et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2010b</xref>). mBRI2 binds mature APP and inhibits APP processing (Fotinopoulou et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2005</xref>; Matsuda et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2005</xref>; Matsuda et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2008</xref>; Matsuda et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1B and C</xref>); owing to the loss of mBRI2, APP processing is increased in FDD (Matsuda et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2011b</xref>; Tamayev et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2011</xref>). Remarkably, memory and synaptic deficits of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice require APP (Tamayev et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2011</xref>), providing genetic evidence that APP and BRI2 functionally interact, and that APP mediates FDD neuropathology.</p>

        <title>The BRI2 domain that binds APP and inhibits APP processing maps to amino acids 74â102</title>
        <p>To test if the loss of mBRI2 in FDD impairs memory via toxic APP metabolites resulting from processing, we searched for BRI2-derived peptides that replicate the inhibitory function of BRI2 on APP-cleavage. mBRI2 interacts with mature APP and Î²-carboxyl-terminal fragments (Î²-CTF), and increases the levels of Î²-CTF by inhibiting its Î³-cleavage (Matsuda et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2005</xref>; Matsuda et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1B and C</xref>). The inhibitory domain was previously mapped to the extracellular region of BRI2 (amino acids 74â131; Matsuda et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2005</xref>). To define it further, HeLa cells were co-transfected with APP (HeLa-APP) and myc-tagged BRI2 fragments progressively deleted from the COOH-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1D</xref>). APP and BRI2 constructs were expressed at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1D</xref>). Binding to APP/Î²-CTF and Î²-CTF accumulation were progressively abolished particularly between positions 102 and 93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1D</xref>). The levels of Î±-Tubulin were similar in all transfected cells and Î±-Tubulin was not precipitated by anti-myc, further underlying the specificity of the mBRI2/mAPP interaction. In addition, the BRI2 deletion constructs that bind APP also reduced the levels of both sAPPÎ² and sAPPÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1D</xref>). To corroborate these effects on APP processing, BRI2 constructs were co-expressed with an APP-Gal4 fusion construct and a luciferase-reporter under the control of a Gal4-dependent promoter. APP-Gal4 is a fusion of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 to the cytoplasmic domain of APP. Cleavage of APP-Gal4 releases the APP intracellular domain (AID)-Gal4 fusion-protein that drives luciferase expression (Gianni et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1E</xref>). BRI2 blocked most AID-Gal4 release-dependent luciferase activation, but C-terminal deletion again from position 102 to 93 progressively lost this inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1E</xref>). Thus, the functional domain of BRI2 mapped from amino acids 74 to 102.</p>

        <title>A BRI2-derived peptide binds APP and inhibits Î²-cleavage of APP</title>
        <p>We tested if peptides spanning this domain duplicated BRI2's function. Two overlapping peptides N3 and N8 strongly reduced Î²-cleavage and moderately decreased Î±-processing of APP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2A</xref>). Mutagenesis of N3 showed that replacing any of amino acids 3â10 with Alanine reduced the inhibitory activity of N3 on Î²-cleavage of APP, showing the functional importance of these residues. However, replacing either the first or second residue (N3-1A/N3-2A) actually resulted in a stronger inhibitor of APP processing by Î²-secretase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2B</xref>). Notably, Î±-cleavage of APP is inhibited by N3, unaffected by N3-2A and, probably, increased by N3-1A. It is possible that these three peptides bind APP differently thereby reducing (N3), unaffecting (N3-2A) or increasing (N3-1A) access of Î±-secretase to the APP-docking/cleavage site. However, the mechanism underlying this potentially useful difference remains to be investigated.</p>

        <p>Since N3-2A has a strong and specific inhibitory activity on Î²-cleavage of APP, we further analyse the effects of N3-2A on APP processing. We measured the levels of APP-CTFs in HEK293-APP cells treated with N3-2A, control peptide N1 or media alone. APP-CTFs are rapidly turned over in cells by Î³-secretase. Thus, to reduce the confounding effects of APP-CTFs' turnover, we performed a parallel experiment in which cells were treated with the Î³-secretase inhibitor (GSI) compound-E. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2C</xref>, N3-2A reduces the levels of Î²-CTF as compared to cells treated with either media alone or N1, which is consistent with the inhibition of Î²-cleavage of APP. The Î±-secretase-derived APP-CTF, Î±-CTF, is not altered by N3-2A, again consistent with the fact that N3-2A does not change the levels of sAPPÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2C</xref>). Similar data where obtained in HeLa-APP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>To better characterize the mechanism of action of N3-2A, we tested whether this peptide binds APP. To this end, HeLa-APP cells were cultured with or without N3-2A fused to a C-terminal Flag epitope (N3-2A-F). After 2 h of incubation, cell lysates were precipitated with Î±-Flag-agarose-beads and co-precipitated molecules were eluted with a Flag-peptide. Like BRI2, N3-2A-F binds mature APP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2D</xref>). Specificity of this interaction was confirmed by showing that untagged N3-2A could compete for binding to APP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2E</xref>), and that peptides that do not inhibit APP processing (N4-F or the single amino acid N3 mutant N3-4A-F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2A and B</xref>), did not bind APP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2F</xref>). To determine whether these biological properties of N3-2A, described in cancer cell lines over-expressing APP, are conserved when using brain cells expressing endogenous APP, we tested if N3-2A-F binds endogenous APP from freshly isolated murine brain cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2G</xref>, N3-2A-F/endogenous APP complexes are readily detectable.</p>
        <p>N3-2A-F/APP complexes were detected only in metabolically active cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2D</xref>). To determine how cell metabolism influences formation of N3-2A/APP complexes, HeLa-APP cells were surface-biotinylated, and cultured with N3-2A-F. After incubation, half of the cells were treated with a reducing reagent, which removes biotin from plasma membrane but not from internalised proteins (+red). N3-2A-F/APP complexes were isolated and further precipitated with streptavidin-beads. In the non-reduced (-red) sample most of APP bound to N3-2A-F was biotinylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2H</xref>), suggesting that N3-2A-F binds APP on the cell surface. In the reduced sample, N3-2A-F/APP complexes were found both in intracellular compartments (biotinylated APP) and on the plasma membrane (non-biotinylated APP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2H</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that part of plasma membrane N3-2A-F/APP complexes are internalised.</p>
        <p>BRI2 binds the region of APP comprising the Î²-cleavage site, thereby blocking access of this protease to APP, while Î²-secretase is still active on other substrates (Fotinopoulou et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2005</xref>). N3-2A did not inhibit the activity of purified Î²-secretase, while the well-characterized Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2I</xref>), indicating that N3-2A has a mechanism of action similar to BRI2 and blocks Î²-cleavage of APP but not Î²-secretase. Thus, we will refer to N3-2A as a modulator of Î²-cleavage of APP (MoBA). It should be noted that unlike full-length BRI2, MoBA does not bind Î²-CTF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2D and E</xref>) and does not overtly inhibit Î±-processing of APP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2B</xref>). These data suggest that N3-2A/MoBA interferes predominantly with processing of APP by Î²-secretase and does not modulate Î³-cleavage of Î²-CTF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2J</xref>).</p>

        <title>Inhibiting Î²-, but not Î³-, cleavage of APP rescues the LTP deficit of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice</title>
        <p>Long-term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic plasticity phenomenon that underlies memory, is defective in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice. To examine the effect of MoBA on LTP, hippocampal slices were perfused with MoBA for 60 min before inducing LTP. Both at 1 ÂµM or 10 nM concentrations MoBA reversed the LTP deficit of FDD<sub>KI</sub> samples and did not alter LTP in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3A</xref>). N6, which does not inhibit APP processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2A</xref>), did not rescue LTP of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3A</xref>). Since perfusing hippocampal slices with a 50 nM concentration of Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV for 1 h before inducing LTP exhibited the same effect of MoBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2B</xref>), it is reasonable to conclude that MoBA ameliorates LTP of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice by inhibiting Î²-cleavage of APP and not by unrelated mechanisms.</p>

        <p>Inhibition of Î²-cleavage of APP could rescue LTP preventing AÎ² production, which is considered the primary mediator of synaptic abnormalities in AD. However, inhibition of Î³-secretase by perfusing hippocampal slices with a 1 nM concentration of the GSI compound-E for 1 h before inducing LTP did not ameliorate synaptic plasticity deficits of FDD<sub>KI</sub> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3B</xref>). We verified that compound-E was active by measuring APP-CTFs in the hippocampal slices, which increased when Î³-secretase was inhibited. APP-CTFs levels were significantly increased in samples treated for 3 h with compound-E as compared to untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3C</xref>). Therefore, it is very unlikely that Î³-secretase-derived APP metabolites (such as AÎ², P3 and AID, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1A</xref>) underlie this synaptic plasticity abnormality in FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice. Overall, these findings indicate that Î²-cleavage of APP during LTP prompts the synaptic plasticity deficits of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice and suggest that <italic>de novo</italic> produced sAPPÎ² and/or Î²-CTF and not AÎ², are the synaptic-toxic APP species.</p>

        <title>Inhibiting Î²-, but not Î³-, cleavage of APP rescues the memory deficit of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice</title>
        <p>We next tested the role of APP processing in the aging-dependent memory deficits of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice (Tamayev et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2010b</xref>). A cannula was surgically implanted in the lateral ventricle of a cohort of 8-month-old FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice and WT littermates. Five weeks after surgery, we analysed the effect of Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV, MoBA and GSI on the memory deficits of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice in a longitudinal study. Memory was analysed using novel object recognition (NOR), a non-aversive memory test that relies on the mouse's natural exploratory behaviour. Before the NOR tests, open field studies showed that FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice have no defects in habituation, sedation, risk assessment and anxiety-like behaviour in novel environments, as previously reported (Tamayev et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2010b</xref>). The first NOR study showed that during training, FDD<sub>KI</sub> and WT mice spent the same amount of time exploring two identical objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4A</xref>). The following day, one of the two old objects was replaced with a new one to test the mouse's memory. WT mice preferentially explored the novel object; conversely FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice spent the same amount of time exploring the two objects as if they were both novel to them, showing that they had no memory of the objects from the previous day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4B</xref>). Two weeks later, we tested the effect of Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV. The mice were injected in the lateral ventricle with 1 Âµl of a 100 ÂµM solution of Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV in PBS 1 h before the training/testing trials. Treated FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice spent significantly more time exploring the novel object just as Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4B</xref>). Following 1 day of rest, a new NOR test performed without treatments showed that FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice had relapsed into amnesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4B</xref>), demonstrating that the therapeutic effect of Î²-secretase inhibition is reversible and short-lived. Four days later, we analysed the behavioural outcome of Î³-secretase inhibition. Mice were injected 1 h before the training/testing with 1 Âµl of a 300 nM solution of compound-E in PBS, The GSI neither improved memory of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice nor altered performance of WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4B</xref>). Two days later, we assessed the therapeutic potential of MoBA by injecting in the lateral ventricle 1 Âµl of a 100 ÂµM solution of MoBA in PBS 1 h before the training/testing sections. MoBA significantly improved memory in FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice. Like for Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV, the therapeutic effect of MoBA was transitory. In fact, when this cohort of mice was retested after 48 h of rest and without treatments, we found that FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice had reverted to a memory-loss phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4B</xref>). To exclude that compound-E was ineffective due to low-dosage, mice were rested for 1 day and retested injecting 1 Âµl of a 3 ÂµM solution of compound-E in PBS 1 h before the training/testing tasks. Even this 10-fold higher GSI dose did not correct the memory deficit of Danish mice, and GSI-treated WT mice showed a trend, though not statistically significant, towards memory impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4B</xref>). Thus, consistent with the LTP data, Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV and MoBA rescued, albeit temporarily, the memory deficit of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice, while the GSI did not.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Our findings demonstrate that the synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in FDD are mediated through production of sAPPÎ² and/or Î²-CTF during LTP and memory acquisition. Interestingly, it has been suggested that an APP fragment derived from sAPPÎ² contributes to AD pathogenesis acting via DR6 (Nikolaev et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2009</xref>). The failure of GSI to rescue the deficits of FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice suggests that metabolites derived from Î³-cleavage of APP, such as AÎ², P3 and AID, are not involved in these pathogenic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4C</xref>). Alternatively, the GSI may have a beneficial effect on LTP/memory deficits, possibly due to a reduction in Î³-secretase-derived APP fragments, that is counterbalanced and masked by increased levels of toxic Î²-CTF caused by inhibition of Î³-cleavage of APP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3C</xref>). Regardless, the data imply that inhibition of Î³-processing of APP, even using Î³-secretase modulators that inhibit APP cleavage sparing Î³-processing of other substrates, may be therapeutically ineffective in correcting memory deficits and, perchance, harmful on account of the increase in Î²-CTF.</p>
      <p>Considering that MoBA and Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV were injected only 1 h before the training/testing for the behavioural tests or perfused for 60 min prior to LTP measurements, it's hard to imagine that they could have manifestly affected the total hippocampal levels of proteolytic products of APP. A logical interpretation of these results is that MoBA and Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV exert a therapeutic effect by reducing Î²-cleavage of APP, perhaps in the synaptic cleft, during synaptic events leading to LTP and memory acquisition. The temporarily therapeutic efficacy of Î²-secretase-inhibitor IV and MoBA in this longitudinal study supports this hypothesis, and suggest that, after the drugs are cleared and APP processing by Î²-secretase is restored at pathological levels, memory acquisition is impaired and the mice relapse into amnesia.</p>
      <p>FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice are genetically congruous to the human disease, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying synaptic and memory impairments in FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice faithfully reproduce the pathogenesis of FDD. The inference that AÎ² may not cause synaptic and memory dysfunction in FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice is at odds with the belief that AÎ² is the primary mediator of AD-related dementias. Perhaps, FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice model early pathogenic events leading to memory loss in human dementia that precede amyloid lesions and tauopathy, while AÎ² might play a role in later disease-stages. Although our data provide no evidence supporting a role for amyloid peptides in synaptic plasticity and memory deficits, amyloid plaques and/or âtoxic amyloid conformersâ may set off other clinical symptoms of FDD/AD patients. It is also possible that the pathophysiology of FDD and AD are distinct and that AÎ² is the primary cause of AD but not FDD. However, several analogies exist between FDD and FAD. FDD and most FAD cases are caused by loss of function mutations of genes that regulate APP processing [<italic>BRI2</italic>/<italic>ITM2b</italic> (Tamayev et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2010a</xref>; Tamayev et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2010b</xref>) and <italic>PSEN1</italic>/<italic>PSEN2</italic> (De Strooper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2007</xref>; Saura et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2004</xref>; Shen &amp; Kelleher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2007</xref>; Zhang et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2009</xref>)]. It is worth noting that loss of function induced by <italic>PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic> FAD mutations may cause, perhaps transiently during synaptic transmission and memory acquisition, an increase in the levels of APP-CTFs including Î²-CTF. In addition, FDD and FAD have common pathological and clinical presentation. Indeed, FDD presents all the hallmarks of AD. These genetic and clinical similarities between FDD and FAD strongly argue that they share common pathogenic mechanisms. It is important to mention that loss of BRI2 function results in increased processing of APP by both Î²- and Î±-secretases in FDD (Matsuda et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2011b</xref>; Tamayev et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2011</xref>). Although the data presented here do not address the role of the latter, it will be interesting to study whether the Î±-secretase-derived APP metabolites Î±-CTF and sAPPÎ± are toxic, or whether Î±-processing of APP has a beneficial effect owing to the prevention of an even larger production of Î²-CTF/sAPPÎ².</p>
      <p>Overall, this study backs therapeutic approaches aiming to reduce sAPPÎ²/Î²-CTF levels, and suggest that targeting AÎ² production and/or clearance is ineffective or, perhaps, detrimental. Since Î²-secretase has important biological functions (Hu et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2006</xref>; Hu et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2010</xref>; Kim et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2007</xref>; Willem et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2006</xref>) the use of a Î²-secretase inhibitor may produce adverse toxic effects, which would be avoided using compounds with a MoBA-like activity. Based on the mechanism of action, MoBA would also ameliorate symptoms and disease-stages mediated by AÎ².</p>

Inadequate models are a major handicap for understanding disease mechanisms and for developing disease-modifying agents. The animal models used to study Alzheimer's disease are designed on the assumption that amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques cause dementia (Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis). These models consist of transgenic mice over-expressing mutant forms of genes causing human dementia because over-expression is required to develop amyloid lesions in mice. These mice however do not reflect the genotypes of human diseases and it is dubious whether they recapitulate the physiopathology of dementia. Indeed, over-expression of human disease genes could produce artefactual harmful effects, leading to erroneous information concerning the pathogenesis and therapy of dementia.</p>

              <title>RESULTS</title>
              <p>To avoid many potential artefacts of the over expression models, we have produced a mouse model of human dementia genetically congruous to the human case. These mice develop memory and synaptic plasticity deficits that are dependent on AÎ² precursor protein (APP). APP is cleaved by Î²-secretase, which produces two APP-metabolites called sAPPÎ² and Î²-CTF; Î²-CTF is than processed by Î³-secretases to produce AÎ². We show here that synaptic plasticity and memory deficits are mediated through production of sAPPÎ² and/or Î²-CTF, but not AÎ², during LTP and memory acquisition. The inference that AÎ² may not cause synaptic and memory dysfunction is at odds with the belief that AÎ² is the primary mediator of AD-related dementias. Moreover we develop a biologic compound (modulator of Î²-cleavage of APP, MoBA) that blocks Î²-cleavage of APP but not Î²-secretase. Since Î²-secretase has important biological functions the use of a Î²-secretase inhibitor may produce adverse toxic effects, which would be avoided using compounds with a MoBA-like activity.</p>

              <title>IMPACT</title>
              <p>Our study provides new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying memory loss in neurodegenerative processes and suggest that memory deficits are primarily caused by APP metabolites distinct from AÎ². These findings have important clinical implications as they offer an alternative explanation to why anti-AÎ² therapies in humans have so far failed, and advise against targeting Î³-secretase cleavage of APP and/or AÎ² in AD therapy. In addition, this work describes a lead compound with a novel mechanisms-of-action (MoBA), which could be a candidate for the therapeutic treatment of dementia.</p>

        <title>Open field and novel object recognition</title>
        <p>The mice were acclimated to the testing room for 30 min after being moved. Each mouse was placed into a 40 cm Ã 40cm open field chamber with opaque walls, 2 ft high. Each mouse was allowed to habituate to the normal open field box for 10 min, and repeated again 24 h later, in which the video tracking system (HVS 2020; HVS Image) quantified various locomotor parameters: total distance travelled, number of entries into, distance travelled in, and time spent in the centre of the locomotor arena. As previously reported (Tamayev et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2010b</xref>), open field studies showed that FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice have no defects in habituation, sedation, risk assessment and anxiety-like behaviour in novel environments.</p>
        <p>Novel object recognition began 24 h after the second open field session, and consisted of two sessions, 24 h apart. In the first session, the mice were placed into the open field chamber with two identical, non-toxic objects, 12 cm from the back and sidewalls of the open field box, and 16 cm apart from each other. A 10 min session, in which the time exploring each object was recorded; an area 2 cm<sup>2</sup> surrounding the object is defined such that nose entries within 2 cm of the object were recorded as time exploring the object. The animal was then returned to its home cage, and 24 h later, placed into the open field box again. This time, there were two new objects, one identical to the previous objects, and one novel object. The mice were given another 10 min to explore, and the amount of time exploring each object was recorded. Mice that spent &lt;7 s exploring the objects were omitted from the analysis (Bevins &amp; Besheer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2006</xref>). Results were recorded as an object discrimination ratio (ODR), which is calculated by dividing the time the mice spent exploring a novel object, divided by the total amount of time exploring the two objects.</p>
