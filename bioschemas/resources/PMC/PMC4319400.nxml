      <abstract>
        <p>As a result of cell-specific functions of voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, such as Kv7.1, mutations in this channel produce profound cardiac and auditory defects. At the same time, the massive diversity of K<sup>+</sup> channels allows for compensatory substitution of mutant channels by other functional channels of their type to minimize defective phenotypes. Kv7.1 represents a clear example of such functional dichotomy. While several point mutations in the channel result in a cardio-auditory syndrome called Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), about 100-fold mutations result in long QT syndrome (LQTS) denoted as RomanoâWard syndrome (RWS), which has an intact auditory phenotype. To determine whether the cellular mechanisms for the diverse phenotypic outcome of Kv7.1 mutations, are dependent on the tissue-specific function of the channel and/or specialized functions of the channel, we made series of point mutations in hKv7.1 ascribed to JLNS and RWS. For JLNS mutations, all except W248F yielded non-functional channels when expressed alone. Although W248F at the end of the S4 domain yielded a functional current, it underwent marked inactivation at positive voltages, rendering the channel non-functional. We demonstrate that by definition, none of the JLNS mutants operated in a dominant negative (DN) fashion. Instead, the JLNS mutants have impaired membrane trafficking, trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Cis-Golgi. The RWS mutants exhibited varied functional phenotypes. However, they can be summed up as exhibiting DN effects. Phenotypic differences between JLNS and RWS may stem from tissue-specific functional requirements of cardiac vs. inner ear non-sensory cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channels perform diverse functions in cells, ranging from regulation of the membrane potential of excitable cells, controlling cell volume, cell division, migration and apoptotic cell death (DeCoursey et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Bortner et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Wei et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), as well as K<sup>+</sup> outflow in specialized compartments in the body, e.g., the kidney and inner ear (Giebisch, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Nin et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Hence, after the human genome was delineated, it was reassuring to identify K<sup>+</sup> channel genes as the most varied ion channel in the body (Gutman et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Wulff et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The cell-specific functions of K<sup>+</sup> channels are such that mutations in these channels often result in a plethora of pathological conditions. This is because in K<sup>+</sup> channelopathy, other K<sup>+</sup> channels can hardly compensate for their loss or gain of functions. Additionally, because K<sup>+</sup> channels operate in multi-component systems, it is extremely difficult to identify their subunit-specific functions. Thus, in order to define their subtype-specific functions, studies in heterologous expression systems are used routinely (Lai and Jan, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Xu et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Maffie and Rudy, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kim et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Moreover, the ensuing properties of either the sequestered wild-type (WT) or mutant (MT) K<sup>+</sup> channel would be incomplete, unless they are interpreted in the context of their cell-specific functions and other potential ion channel subunits they interact with, often promiscuously (Xu et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel Kv7.1, previously called KvLQT1, is expressed in several tissues, including the heart, kidney and cells in the inner ear lateral wall. The Kv7.1 gene comprises of 404 kb at 11p15.5 (Wang et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) and codes for a 75-kDa protein, containing 676 amino acids (Yang et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The significance of Kv7.1 functions in the heart and inner ear underscore several mutations which result in a cardio-auditory syndrome called Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) (Jervell and Lange-Nielsen, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1957</xref>), as well as over 200 mutations that are reported to cause long QT syndrome (LQTS) without the hearing phenotype, as seen in RomanoâWard syndrome (RWS) (Morita et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hedley et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Moreover, the cellular mechanisms responsible for the seemingly similar mutations in LQTS that spare inner ear diseased phenotype remain distressingly unknown.</p>
      <p>JLNS and RWS can be found worldwide, affecting families of diverse backgrounds ranging from Asian, European and American origins. To determine the biophysical and cellular mechanisms of JLNS and RWS, and to provide mechanistic insight on the functional outputs of JLNS vs. RWS mutations, we generated several mutant forms of the human Kv7.1 (hKv7.1, <italic>KCNQ1</italic>) clone, using site-directed mutagenesis to define their sub-cellular localization and examined their electrophysiological properties. A caveat to consider at the onset of this study is that although Kv7.1 invariably operates together with auxiliary subunits e.g., KCNE, and several other interacting proteins, we focused mainly on the biophysical aspects of the pore-forming subunit of the channel.</p>
      <p>We identified JLNS and RWS mutations in <italic>KCNQ1</italic> at the S4-S5-linker, the pore loop (P-loop) and the C-terminus of hKv7.1 which have been found to control channel gating, permeation and modulation, respectively (Lipkind et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Schmitt et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Choveau et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Labro et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We report that all P-loop and C-terminal mutations (seven mutations) ascribed to JLNS yielded non-functional channels when expressed alone. Moreover, the W248F at the end of the S4 domain yielded a functional current, but at positive step potentials, the current underwent marked, inactivation, rendering the channel essentially non-functional. Not only did the seven JLNS mutant channels produce non-functional channels, they also affected channel trafficking and cell-surface expression. Previous studies have indicated that some mutants such as Y461X Kimoto et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), R594Q, A178T, and A525T Harmer et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and 1149insT Wang et al. (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) reduce cell-surface expression due to trafficking defects.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, the RWS mutants showed functional phenotypes consisting of channels with no measurable current when expressed alone, but stunted-to-no-measurable current upon addition of the WT subunit. The RWS mutants, however, produced DN effect. Previous studies reported that mutations in <italic>KCNQ1</italic> such as R555H Aromolaran et al. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), R539W Chouabe et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), and K557E Spatjens et al. (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), cause dominant-negative effects that reduce the current density significantly. Our findings provide integrated cellular and molecular mechanisms of hKv7.1 functions and the ensuing diseased phenotype in JLNS and RWS may stem from the tissue-specific function of the channel.</p>

        <p>Wild-type (WT) hKv7.1 clone (Genebank: AF000571) was kindly given to the laboratory by Dr. N. Chiamvimonvat (Sharma et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The CDS were subcloned into a pIRES2-EGFP plasmid vector (Clonetech, Mountain View, CA). Each of the JLNS and RWS mutations were generated from WT gene using QuickChangeII mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and verified by automated sequencing. pIRES2-EGFP-hKv7.1-WT and mutants (MT) were used in electrophysiology/patch-clamp study using EGFP as the reporter gene. To study the subcellular localization of WT and MT subunits, two different epitopes, modified HA- and c-Myc-tags, were inserted into pCMV-hKv7.1-WT and MT constructs. Here, the EGFP genes were eliminated. Modified HA- and c-Myc epitopes were flanked with ClC-5 chloride channel D1-D2 loop to increase accessibility and inserted in the end of the S1-S2 loop of hKv7.1 as previously described in Kv7.2/7.3 and Kv7.4 channels (Schwake et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Kim et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).

        <p>Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line was used in this study. CHO cells were maintained in F-12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1x antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. CHO cells were seeded onto 12 mm coverslips in F-12 + 10% FBS without antibiotics and cultured 12â24 h before transfection. hKv7.1-WT or hKv7.1-MT DNA were transfected into cells alone or in combinations, using 200 ng/well, employing Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) procedure according to the manufacture's instruction. For experiments in which the WT and MT channels were expressed jointly, we estimated the ratio of expression based on the amount transfected relative to the total DNA (limitations of this strategy is addressed in the Discussion).</p>

        <title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
        <p>We performed these experiments using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA). Fire-polished electrodes (3â4 MÎ©) were pulled from borosilicate glass. We recorded K<sup>+</sup> currents using the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration and recordings were performed from single, uncoupled cells at room temperature (20â22Â°C). The composition of electrode solution was (in mM): KCl 140, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, HEPES 10, EGTA 10, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1, K<sub>2</sub>ATP 4, pH 7.2 with KOH. The bath solution contained (in mM): NaCl 145, KCl 4, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, HEPES 10, D-Glucose 5, pH 7.4 with NaOH. Unless otherwise indicated, reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).</p>
        <p>Outward hKv7.1 channel current traces were generated with depolarizing voltage steps from a holding voltage of â80 mV and stepped to varying step potentials (Î V = 5â10 mV). Currents were measured after capacitance compensation and series resistance compensation (6â8 MÎ©) (nominally 70â90%), and filtered at 2 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter, and sampled at 5 kHz. Liquid-junction potentials were less than 2 mV (1.7 Â± 0.2 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 28). Whole-cell K<sup>+</sup> current amplitude, at varying test potentials, was measured at the peak and steady-state levels using peak and steady-state detection routine. To determine the current density, the current was divided by the cell capacitance (pF) and current density was plotted against voltage. Analyses of data were performed using custom-written software and Microcal Origin (Northampton, MA) programs. Pooled data are presented as means Â±SD. Multiple comparisons vs. control data were performed using <italic>t</italic>-test or Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (Dunn's method). Whole-cell K<sup>+</sup> tail currents were normalized and plotted against the step potential. Using the Boltzmann function I/I<sub>max</sub> = 1 + [exp (V<sub>1/2</sub>-V)/k<sub>m</sub>] where V<sub>1/2</sub>is the half-activation voltage, k<sub>m</sub> = RT/zF is the slope factor, I is the magnitude of the current, and I<sub>max</sub> denotes the maximum current magnitude, we plotted and fitted the steady-state activation curves of the currents.</p>
        <p>The Î±-subunit of the K<sup>+</sup> channel consists of independent monomers that assemble to form a conducting pore. The stoichiometric combination of the WT and MT monomers is expected to be a random process. Thus, the probability of forming a functional channel with only WT monomers (P<sub>WT only</sub>) can be described by a polynomial distribution with the proportion of WT monomers (p<sub>WT</sub>) available to the n<sup>th</sup> power (P<sub>WT only</sub> = p<sup>n</sup><sub>WT</sub>), where n is the number of monomers present in a functional channel (MacKinnon, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Kim et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>

To label the plasma membrane using HA- and c-Myc- tags, cells were blocked in 3% BSA and 5% normal donkey serum in 1X PBS without Triton X-100. Cells were incubated in primary antibodies at 4Â°C overnight, and washed with PBS three times before incubation in secondary antibodies at room temperature for 90 min, followed by 5 min DAPI staining with PBS washing. Slides were mounted with ProLong Gold mounting medium (Invitrogen) and images were taken using a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM510).</p>

        <p>Mutations of hKv7.1 that result in JLNS and RWS have been identified in families from America, Europe and Asia, transcending global ethnicities. Shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> is schematic representation of the topology of the hKv7.1 channel and the locations of recognized mutations, at the transmembrane segment 4 (S4), S4âS5 linker, the pore loop (S5âS6), S6 and the C-terminal that produce JLNS and RWS phenotypes. JLNS and RWS associated mutations have been color coded in blue and red, respectively. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> outlines the global diversity of the ethnic background of patients with the type of disease, the domain of the protein and the associated exon for each mutation. To understand the mechanisms of the disease, we first determined the properties of the wild-type (WT) hKv7.1 channel by expressing it in CHO cells. Unlike EGFP-alone-transfected cells which did not yield measurable current (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), WT hKv7.1 transfected cells held at a holding potential of â80 mV and stepped to voltages ranging from â100 to 60 mV produced outward K<sup>+</sup> currents with mean maximum current density of ~70 pA/pF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Analyses of the current density-voltage relationship and the steady state activation derived from the tail currents at â40 mV are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,D</xref>. The WT hKv7.1 channel currents have an activation voltage of ~â50 mV, half-voltage (V<sub>1/2</sub>) activation of â16.2 Â± 0.9 mV, and slope factor (k) of 11.4 Â± 0.8 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 11), using a single Boltzmann function to describe the activation curves. We examined the current phenotype of eight recognized mutations in hKv7.1 ascribed to JLNS using CHO cell expression strategy (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2EâG</xref>). Seven (T311I, T322M, A336fs+16X, R518X, Q530X, E543fs+107X, and G589D) out of eight mutant channels yielded no visible K<sup>+</sup> currents when expressed singly, even 48 h after transfection using voltage-clamp protocols, which is routinely employed to evoke currents in WT-hKv7.1 transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Moreover, W248F mutant channel alone yielded reduced but robust outward K<sup>+</sup> current compared to the WT and the other seven mutant channels, respectively. Additionally, W248F current profile showed inactivation at step voltages positive to 0 mV as depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> and in the summary data of the current density-voltage relationship (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).</p>

        <p>To understand the cellular mechanism for JLNS, we co-expressed the MT and WT subunits. We were able to examine whether co-expression of the WT-hKv7.1 with the MT subunits was impactful. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows characteristic effects of the WT-hKv7.1:MT co-expression at different ratios. Since functional K<sup>+</sup> channels form tetrameric complexes, we used different WT:MT ratios at 4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3, 0:4. Current traces derived from WT:T322M at 3:1, 2:2 and 1:3 are shown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), and the corresponding current-density voltage relationship is plotted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>. The summary data of the current density from the WT channel is included for comparison. We generated the steady-state activation curves from tail currents at â40 mV from the currents resulting from combinatorial expression of the WT and T322M. The data points were fitted with a single-state Boltzmann function (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Co-expression of the MT T322M with WT-hKv7.1 channels did not alter the gating properties (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). For example, the V<sub>1/2</sub> (in mV) and the slope factor k (in mV) for currents at these ratios (WT:T322M: 3:1, 2:2 and 1:3) were: WT:MT 3:1= â16.0 Â± 0.8, 11.7 Â± 0.8; WT:MT 2:2 = â14.8 Â± 1.8, 10.8 Â± 1.1; WT:MT 1:3 = â15.3 Â± 0.6, 11.5 Â± 0.8 (<italic>n =</italic> 11; <italic>p</italic> = 0.4, 0.4, 0.5). We plotted the time constant of activation (Ï<sub>act</sub>) with respect to voltage for currents, resulting from combined expression of the individual eight JLNS mutants and WT subunits at the ratio of 2:2. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> shows that with the exception of W248F mutant, the Ï<sub>act</sub> of the WT currents were similar. The inset illustrates normalized current traces of WT current and WT-T322M-hybrid (2:2) current. The time constants (Ï) of activation for all JLNS mutations in <italic>KCNQ1</italic> (MT, T311I, T322M, A336fs+16X, R518X, Q530X, E543fs+107X, and G589D) expressed together with the WT constructs at a ratio of 2:2 were comparable, ranging from ~65 to 170-ms except for W248F, which ranged from 27 to 52-ms, depending on the step voltage. Data were assembled from n = 11 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). These findings may reflect the possibility that the reduced current measured in CHO cell transfected with the WT and MT subunits was solely derived from assembly of homomeric WT channel currents. Previous studies showed that some <italic>KCNQ1</italic> JLNS mutations affecting the C-terminus of Kv7.1 channel, such as G589D, produced no current when expressed alone, but yielded measurable current when co-expressed with the WT subunit (Wang et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Aromolaran et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>

        <p>Because combined expression of the WT and MT subunits yielded currents of sizable magnitude, by definition, these seven MTs cannot be classified as DN mutants. Nonetheless, assuming the predicted tetrameric structure of K<sup>+</sup> channels (MacKinnon, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>), we calculated the expected current magnitude when the WT channel is co-expressed with mutant subunits at different ratios. The data was compared to the expected results, when the mutant is operating as DN (mutations of the signature GYG<sub>314â316</sub> to AAA<sub>314â316</sub> in K<sup>+</sup> channel pore) (MacKinnon, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Xue et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The expected results are shown with a dotted line in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Consistent with our initial assertion, the experimental data points (in symbols) for the JLNS mutation suggested that none of the MT channels operated in a DN manner.</p>

The dotted lines denote the expected current reduction if the channels form monomers (black), dimers (red), trimers (green), tetramers (blue), and pentamers (magenta). We generated a dominant negative version of hKv7.1 in which the pore amino acids GYG (WT) were mutated to AAA (MT). The experimental data (in blue, star symbol) are in accord with the predicted relationship of tetramers, demonstrating that the WT<sub>GYG</sub> and MT<sub>AAA</sub> subunits co-assemble equally well with each other to form tetrameric functional channels.

Reduction of WT hKv7.1 current was enhanced with decreasing WT:MT ratio. Whereas co-expression of WT hKv7.1 and the pore mutant channel AAA (dominant negative mutant) at different ratios yielded current magnitudes which confirmed the tetrameric structure of functional K<sup>+</sup> channels, the experimental data from JLNS mutants deviated from the predicted relationship of tetrameric K<sup>+</sup> channel.</p>

        <title>Functional properties of romanoâward syndrome mutations in hKv7.1</title>
        <p>We evaluated eight mutants that have been reported to be associated with RWS. These mutations were identified by their location at; the S4 and S4âS5 linker (D242N, R243C, L250H), the pore loop (G306V, D317N) and the C-terminal (L374fs+43X, N586D, L619M) of the hKv7.1 channel, similar to the identified sites for JLNS mutations. Each mutant was generated and expressed singly, as well as co-jointly, with the WT subunit in tetrameric ratios as described for JLNS mutations. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> shows an example of RWS mutant, D242N that has a reduced current compared to the WT channel. The current traces and the respective ratios are indicated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). As the ratio of the WT:MT subunit increased, the magnitude of the whole-cell K<sup>+</sup> current was enhanced. However, the magnitude of the current remained stunted compared to the WT channel currents. The RWS mutants, D242N, N586D, and L619M, exhibited similar features. The current-density voltage relationship of the three RWS mutant currents is summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, which demonstrates N586D had slightly elevated current compared to D242N and L619M. Comparing the WT and MT currents, the steady-state voltage-dependent activation fitted with a Boltzmann function were moved rightward as follows: V<sub>1/2</sub> (in mV) and k (in mV) for WT-hKv7.1 alone and in combinations of WT-hKv7.1:D242N, WT-hKv7.1:N586D, and WT-hKv7.1:L619M (all in 2:2 ratios) were; â16.3 Â± 0.8, 11.4 Â± 0.9; â1.0 Â± 1.5, 13.1 Â± 1.1; â12.8 Â± 1.2, 11.7 Â± 0.6; â13.2 Â± 0.9, 11.8 Â± 0.9 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 10), respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). An additional finding in the three mutants is that the Ï s of activation were substantially slower than the WT current (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). In contrast to our observation, Aromolaran et al. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) reported that L619M did not produce any current when expressed alone in the CHO cells, but a significant amount of current was observed when this mutant was co-expressed with WT and KCNE1.</p>

        <p>Some KCNQ1 RWS mutants (R243P, L250H and G306V) were non-functional when transfected alone, but showed stunted currents when co-transfected with WT. The family of current traces in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> is an example of the phenotypic outcome of expression of R243P alone and at different ratios with the WT channel. The current density-voltage relationships of the three mutants suggest that although the mutant alone may be non-functional, the presence of the WT channel may render or facilitate mutant subunit functional (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). The steady-state voltage-dependent activation of current generated from conditions when the WT:MT ratio is (2:2) were variable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).

Our results is in agreement with study conducted by Chouabe et al.

The analysis described in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> regarding the predicted current magnitude after co-expression of MT-hKv7.1 and the WT subunits pre-supposes that the synthesis and membrane translocation of the MT and WT subunits occur independently.

        <p>The data from JLNS mutant subunits did not provide evidence for the mutants acting as DN-mutants. Instead, it suggested that the ensuing currents from co-expression of the WT:MT (2:2) subunits exhibited voltage-dependent and kinetic properties that mirrored the WT homomeric currents. Thus, we assessed the plasma membrane and cellular localization of the WT and MT subunits (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Here, we show typical example of JLNS mutant, T311I that did not yield functional currents, when expressed singly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The MT subunit was synthesized but was not localized in the plasma membrane, suggesting that the JLNS mutant channels had an impaired trafficking mechanism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). Sub-cellular identification of JLNS mutant, T311I, suggested that they were trapped in the ER and cis-Golgi (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref> demonstrate localization of the other six JLNS mutants, T322M, A336fs+16X, R518X, Q530X, E543fs+107X, and G589D. These JLNS mutants, when expressed singly, showed minimum-to-absent plasma membrane localization (S1), indicating defective membrane trafficking. Similar to the data described for T311I, the other six JLNS mutants were localized mainly in the ER and cis-Golgi (S2). In keeping with the functional data, and as demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, the WT and W248F channels were synthesized, trafficked, and localized in the plasma membrane. As it turns out, the RWS mutants had weak membrane expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>).</p>

We selected mutations which were identified in JLNS vs. RWS patients, but in most cases their cellular mechanisms were unknown. In order to provide mechanistic insight on the functional outputs of JLNS vs. RWS mutations, we chose RWS mutations adjacent or spatially close to JLNS mutation sites at the S4-S5-linker, the pore loop (P-loop) and the C-terminus because previous studies have identified these sites as being responsible for the voltage-dependent activation, permeation and modulation/tetramerization of K<sup>+</sup> channels, respectively. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether the cellular mechanisms for the diverse phenotypic outcome of <italic>KCNQ1</italic> mutations are dependent on the tissue-specific function of the channel and/or specialized functions of the channel.</p>
      <p>We report that: (1) with the exception of W248F, which is located at the end of the S4 domain, all JLNS mutants, pore loop (T311I and T322M) and C-terminal (A336fs+16X, R518X, Q530X, E543fs+107X, and G589D) yielded no current when expressed as homotetramers; (2) by contrast, homomeric W248F produced a reduced current magnitude but portrayed rapid inactivation at positive voltages, invalidating the channel as an effective outward K<sup>+</sup> current; (3) using immunofluorescence strategies to label the channels and subcellular organelles, we observed that with the exception of W248F, JNLS mutants do not reach the plasma membrane but remain in the ER and cis-Golgi; (4) W248F is translocated into the membrane unimpeded; (5) moreover, the remaining JLNS mutant subunits, when co-expressed with WT subunit remain trapped in organelles in the cytoplasm. Meanwhile, the WT subunits were detected in the plasma membrane. Thus, when co-expressed WT: MT, the measured current is likely to originate from homomeric WT-subunit assembly, in keeping with the findings illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. (6) RWS mutations have varied phenotypic outcomes, consisting of those with reduced currents and altered voltage-dependent activation with and without a co-transfected WT subunit. RWS mutants impeded membrane trafficking, as well.</p>
      <p>The JLNS mutation at the end of S4, W248F, did not show impaired trafficking and yielded reduced outward current with profound inward rectification at positive voltages. The S4 segment, the voltage sensor of K<sup>+</sup> channels (Jiang et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Gagnon and Bezanilla, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), undergoes asymmetric charge movement, which is represented as fast-on and slow-off gating currents (Perozo et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Bezanilla et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Stefani et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). Amino acid residues in the S4âS5 linker have been shown to stabilize the channel in the open state (Batulan et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), raising the possibility that W248F may imbed structural changes that will ultimately destabilize the open state of the channel, leading to the apparent inactivation of the channel. The pore and C-terminal mutants associated with JLNS to a rough approximation appear similar, showing clear impairment in channel trafficking. The precedence for K<sup>+</sup> channel pore mutations and diminished channel trafficking is set in Kv7.4 mutation G285C, which results in an autosomal dominant form of progressive hearing loss (DFNA2). Previous studies have demonstrated that co-expression of the wild-type and the mutant subunits at different ratios produced current magnitudes which were not in keeping with the G285C serving as a DN mutant (Kubisch et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Xu et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Mencia et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Indeed, replacement of glycine with cysteine at the pore region of hKv7.4 alters channel trafficking and plasma membrane expression (Kim et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The C-terminal A-domain or coiled-coil domain (CCD) has been shown to drive tetrameric assembly, stability and selectivity of multimerization (Jenke et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Howard et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The subunit assembly domain resides at the C-terminal segment 589â620. The JLNS mutants R518X and Q530X are expected to have a truncated C-terminus missing the A-domain. G589D occurs at the onset of the assembly domain and it is predicted to disrupt channel multimerization. Finally, E543fs+107X have distinct amino acid sequence by frame shift that is not in keeping with the CCD. Thus, our findings that these mutations revealed robust mutant subunit trapping in the ER and Golgi, dovetail well with the conclusion that the mutant subunit trafficking defect is a major factor in the disease phenotype. The reduced current recorded after joint expression of the WT and mutant subunits likely originates from independent homomeric assembly of the WT subunits.</p>
      <p>All RWS mutations examined yielded stunted currents when expressed jointly with the WT channel. Qualitatively, D242N, R243P, L250H, G306V, L374fs+43, 352X, N586D and L619M had weak expression levels compared to the WT channel. Consistent with the S4 segment and S4âS5 linker serving as the voltage sensor, charged to neutral amino acids substitution in D242N, R243P and vice versa in L250H, distal to the S4 segment have voltage-dependent properties that were significantly weaker than the WT channel. The current seen in pore mutants G306V and D317N is conceivable since they do not alter the selectivity filter (GYG) but are expected to produce slight changes in the pore structure. In contrast to the C-terminal mutants of the JLNS, which have either a truncated A-domain or an altered overall apparent structure of the assembly domain, the RWS mutants had conserved mutations in the A-domain (L619M) or point mutations (N586D) that occur proximal to the assembly domain. The findings suggest that the RWS mutants form multimers and are translocated into the membrane.</p>
      <p>To ensure normal cardiac functions, the regular rhythmic profile of a variety of specialized chamber-specific cardiac cells has to be coordinated by time-dependent changes in ionic conductances (Kurokawa et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Besides their role as determinants of the resting potential, currents derived from Kv7.1 channels and their associated Î²-subunit, KCNE1 (Chouabe et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), regulate the duration of the plateau phase of cardiac action potentials (Noble and Tsien, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; Sanguinetti, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Because of time-dependent requirements of Kv7.1/KCNE1-mediated currents, mutations in the Î±- or Î²-subunits and the ensuing altered current magnitude delay repolarization and cause different forms of LQTS (LQT1-LQT5) (Sanguinetti, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the inner ear, there is a unidirectional flux of K<sup>+</sup> from Spiral Ligament to the Marginal Cells (MC). The K<sup>+</sup> flux is maintained by Kv7.1 channels, coating the apical membrane of MC and the continuous K<sup>+</sup> flux across the MC apical membrane results in the exceptionally high [K<sup>+</sup>] in the endolymph (~150 mM).</p>
      <p>K<sup>+</sup> cycling in the cochlear duct maintains the high throughput rate of K<sup>+</sup> across the lateral wall, which confers the Endococlear Potential (EP). Thus, the essential requirement for the generation and maintenance of the EP is the continuous flow of K<sup>+</sup> which is not time-dependent, in contrast with cardiac where the timing of activation and deactivation of I<sub>KS</sub> is essential for cardiac function.</p>
      <p>Our results demonstrate that JLNS mutations result in non-functional channels with impaired membrane trafficking, so the phenotypic consequences are observed in both inner ear and heart. In contrast, RWS mutations usually lead to functional channels but with significantly reduced current, therefore the phenotypic consequence of mutation is primarily observed in heart where timing of currents is most critical. Moreover, the K<sup>+</sup> channel tetramerization was reported to be stochastic (Kubisch et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), therefore all the different combinations of WT and MT subunits are seen in RWS patients, which apparently is sufficient to maintain EP in the inner ear.</p>

        <title>Limitations of the study</title>
        <p>The primary focus of this study was on the effects of specific mutations of the pore-forming Î±-subunit on the biophysical properties of hKv7.1. Relying on only the outcomes of the features of Î±-subunit, it can be inferred that the tissue-specific functions of the channel in the inner ear lateral wall and the heart may trump on nuisances of biophysical alterations in channel function in a specific class of disease. Moreover, almost invariably, the physiological and pathologic properties of Kv7 channels can be dictated by the Î²-subunit (e.g., KCNE subunits) and other auxiliary binding partners, limiting the scope of the present study. For example, previous reports have indicated that in the presence of KCNE1, W248F induced a rightward shift in the voltage-dependent activation of hKv7.1 currents (Franqueza et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). In contrast as shown in this study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), without KCNE1, the voltage-dependent activation moved leftward. Previous study showed that Kv7.1 voltage sensors move independently, and the channel can conduct ions even before all the voltage sensors move. Some mutation cause the voltage sensors move in more depolarize voltage and as a result channel open in more negative voltage as seen in W248F mutant (Osteen et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since diverse and multiple Î²-subunits can associated with the pore-forming subunit, compounded by the fact that different Î±-subunits can form functional heteromultimers in native cells, interpretation of results from heterologous expression systems can be made with these caveats in mind. Yet, studies in expression systems provide a powerful and robust way to understand the biophysical properties of a channel in a reduced structure. Analyses performed for data in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, explicitly assume that MT and WT subunits have equal probability of assembly into a channel. However, if a mutant subunit impairs channel trafficking, such that the probability of WT subunit homomeric channel is conditional on the MT subunit then the analyses will fail to predict the expected outcome. Thus, while the present report provides a glimpse of the possible mechanisms for JLNS and RWS, further studies may be required to understand the details fully.</p>
