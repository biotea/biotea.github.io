      <abstract>
        <p>Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I) is an inheritable autosomal, recessive disorder caused by mutations in the FuKutin-Related Protein (FKRP) gene (<italic>FKRP</italic>) located on chromosome 19 (19q13.3). Mutations in <italic>FKRP</italic> are also associated with Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDC1C), Walker-Warburg Syndrome (WWS) and Muscle Eye Brain disease (MEB). These four disorders share in common an incomplete/aberrant O-glycosylation of the membrane/extracellular matrix (ECM) protein Î±-dystroglycan. However, further knowledge on the FKRP structure and biological function is lacking, and its intracellular location is controversial. Based on immunogold electron microscopy of human skeletal muscle sections we demonstrate that FKRP co-localises with the middle-to-trans-Golgi marker MG160, between the myofibrils in human <italic>rectus femoris</italic> muscle fibres. Chemical cross-linking experiments followed by pairwise yeast 2-hybrid experiments, and co-immune precipitation, demonstrate that FKRP can exist as homodimers as well as in large multimeric protein complexes when expressed in cell culture. The FKRP homodimer is kept together by a disulfide bridge provided by the most N-terminal cysteine, Cys6. FKRP contains N-glycan of high mannose and/or hybrid type; however, FKRP N-glycosylation is not required for FKRP homodimer or multimer formation. We propose a model for FKRP which is consistent with that of a Golgi resident type II transmembrane protein.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Defects of Î±-dystroglycan (Î±-DG) O-glycosylation are associated with several forms of inheritable muscular dystrophies (Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2I; LGMD2I), of which some are congenital (Congenital Muscular Dystrophy type 1C; MDC1C), and some are associated with brain (Fukyama Congenital Muscular Dystrophy; FCMD, Walker-Warburg Syndrome; WWS) and eye abnormalities (Muscle Eye Brain disease; MEB) <xref rid="pone.0022968-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Î±-DG is a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and contains multiple sites for O-linked glycosylation <xref rid="pone.0022968-Kanagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Barresi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Proper O-glycosylation of Î±-DG is crucial for its interaction with the extracellular laminin-Î±2 and agrin in muscle, and neurexin in brain <xref rid="pone.0022968-Henry1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Ervasti1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Ervasti2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Î±-DG hypoglycosylation precludes these interactions and the disruption of the link between these extracellular components and the actin cytoskeleton, is thought to be part of the molecular pathogenesis of the muscular dystrophy phenotype in LGMD2I and the additional brain involvement seen in WWS and MEB <xref rid="pone.0022968-Michele1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These disorders are collectively known as dystroglycanopathies, and they can be caused by mutations in any one of six different genes encoding known or putative glycosyltransferases or phosphotransferases. These genes are <italic>POMGnT1</italic>, encoding protein <italic>O</italic>-linked mannose <italic>Ã</italic>-1,2-<italic>N</italic> acetylglucosaminyl-transferase 1 <xref rid="pone.0022968-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Manya1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <italic>POMT1</italic> and <italic>POMT2</italic> encoding a complex that confers protein O-mannosyltransferase activity <xref rid="pone.0022968-BeltrnValerodeBernab1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Manya2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-vanReeuwijk1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <italic>LARGE</italic>

      <p>Mutations in <italic>FKRP</italic> were originally reported to cause MDC1C, a severe form of congenital muscular dystrophy <xref rid="pone.0022968-Brockington1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, however, later it has become clear that mutations in the <italic>FKRP</italic> gene might cause a wider range of phenotypes such as those of LGMD2I <xref rid="pone.0022968-Brockington2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, MEB <xref rid="pone.0022968-BeltranValerodeBernab1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and WWS <xref rid="pone.0022968-Louhichi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>FKRP has been postulated to be involved in the O-glycosylation of Î±-DG. This was based on the shift in Î±-DG molecular weight and change in band intensity seen on Western blots of muscle extracts from patients with MDC1C, using glycan dependent anti Î±-DG antibodies <xref rid="pone.0022968-Brockington1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Correspondingly, immune histochemistry showed depletion of glycosylated Î±-DG in muscle sections from LGMD2I patients when glycan specific Î±-DG antibodies were used <xref rid="pone.0022968-Brockington2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, but not when GT20DAG antibodies directed towards the core protein were used <xref rid="pone.0022968-JimenezMallebrera1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. FKRP and its homologue Fukutin contain DXD motifs shared by some glycosyltransferases <xref rid="pone.0022968-MartinRendon1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However importantly, this family of proteins also share sequence similarity with phosphoryl ligand transferases <xref rid="pone.0022968-Aravind1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Harnett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Attempts to solve the intracellular localisation of FKRP have produced contradicting results. Previous studies based on immune-cytochemistry/-histochemistry on various types of cultured cells or tissue sections, from human and rodent muscle, have indicated localisation of FKRP to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <xref rid="pone.0022968-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Torelli1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, the Golgi apparatus <xref rid="pone.0022968-Esapa1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Esapa2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Dolatshad1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-KeramarisVrantsis1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and the muscle cell sarcolemma <xref rid="pone.0022968-Beedle1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this work, by employing high resolution immunogold electron microscopy, we demonstrate that FKRP co-localises with the middle-to-trans Golgi marker MG160, between the myofibrils, in human <italic>rectus femoris</italic> muscle fibres. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FKRP can interact with itself in living cells and that FKRP can exist as a homodimer and in multimeric protein complexes. FKRP homodimer formation depends on an N-terminal interaction interface at which the dimers are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge provided by Cys6, preceding a putative N-terminal trans-membrane sequence motif. FKRP contains two putative N-glycosylation sites. Both are occupied with high mannose/hybrid type of oligosaccharides. However, N-glycosylation is not required for FKRP homodimer or multimer formation.</p>

        <title>FKRP co-localises with the Golgi marker MG160, between the myofibrils of human skeletal muscle fibres</title>
        <p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> localisation of endogenous FKRP in muscle cells, separate double immunogold labelling experiments were performed on human <italic>rectus femoris</italic> longitudinal sections, using antibodies against FKRP and protein markers specifying either the sarcolemma (anti Ã-dystroglycan), Golgi (anti MG160) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (anti PDI). Overall, the 5 nm gold particles, specific to FKRP, clustered (2â15 grains) at discrete locations in the myofibrillar core, mainly between the myofibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g001">Fig. 1 A, B</xref>). Five-nm particles were associated with vesicle- or cisternae-like structures and often they were found in close proximity with mitochondria. Their locations were distinctly different from those of Ã-dystroglycan specific 10 nm gold particles which were found to be scattered continuously along the muscle cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Similar to signals specific to FKRP, PDI specific signals were detected mainly between myofibrils but they were also frequently associated with terminal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) cisternae, neighbouring T-tubule like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g001">Fig. 1 D</xref>). However, FKRP and PDI specific signals were usually not associated, but rather they appeared as spatially separated clusters of 5 nm and 10 nm particles, respectively. In contrast, FKRP specific 5 nm particles co-localised and, in fact, overlapped with clusters of 10 nm particles specific to the Golgi marker MG160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). The MG160 marker was previously found to be located in the middle to trans-cisternae of the Golgi complex in <italic>soleus</italic> muscle cells of adult rats <xref rid="pone.0022968-Ralston1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. No co-localisation of 5 nm and 10 nm particles was observed when omitting one of the primary antibodies, in a series of control experiments as explained in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Hence, we conclude that the Golgi middle-to-<italic>trans</italic> cisterna is the location of FKRP in human adult <italic>rectus femoris</italic> muscle cells.</p>

        <title>FKRP is part of multimeric complexes that are sensitive to reduction by DTT</title>
        <p>Western blot analysis of lysates from FKRP expressing cells, performed under reducing conditions, revealed a prominent FKRP specific band migrating as the size of a monomer (â¼58 kDa), as well as an additional band (â¼116 kDa) of lower intensity, approximately twice the size as that expected for the FKRP monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Discrete bands of higher molecular weight were also observed. Under non-reducing conditions an additional smeared higher molecular weight band ranging from â¼120 to â¼220 kDa as well as a distinct band of &gt;â¼450 kDa were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, lane 1). The involvement of FKRP in these high molecular weight structures was further investigated by adding the cross-linker Ethylene glycol-bis(SuccinimidylSuccinate) (EGS) immediately after cell lysis. EGS is a homobifunctional, DTT insensitive, protein cross-linker with a spacer arm of 16.1 Ã that can covalently link interacting proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, upon cross-linking the FKRP monomer disappeared and only higher molecular weight bands could be detected. Distinct protein bands appeared at â¼116 kDa and â¼170â180 kDa and a smear of bands ranging in molecular weights from 180 kDa to several hundred kDa were observed.</p>

        <title>The two FKRP N-glycosylation sites are occupied with high mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides</title>
        <p>Based on its primary amino acid sequence, human FKRP has a predicted molecular weight of 54.6 kDa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/protcalc.html">http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/protcalc.html</ext-link>). However, initial Western blot analysis demonstrated a molecular weight of â¼58 kDa both under non-reducing and reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). This suggested that FKRP contains a post-translational modification of approximately 3.5 kDa. Human FKRP (as well as FKRP from any other species known) contains two putative N-glycosylation sites; <underline>Asn</underline>ValSer (<underline>N</underline>VS) and <underline>Asn</underline>LeuSer (<underline>N</underline>LS) at amino acid positions 172 and 209 (hFKRP), respectively. In order to assess the composition of the FKRP modification, protein lysates obtained from BHK-21 cells transfected with human FKRP expressing plasmid, were treated separately with the N-glycan specific glycosidases, PNGase F and Endo H. Both PNGase F and Endo H treatment created a shift in the molecular weight of FKRP, corresponding to â¼3.5 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), equivalent to the expected molecular weight of two N-linked glycans. A similar experiment using lysates from transfected COS-7 cells gave identical results (not shown). This demonstrates that upon ectopic FKRP expression in BHK-21 and COS-7 cells, both N-glycosylation sites are occupied with N-linked glycans. Furthermore, since these glycans are sensitive to Endo H digestion they must be composed of high mannose and/or hybrid type oligosaccharides.</p>

        <p>To examine if FKRP self interaction is dependent on N-glycosylation the two FKRP N-glycosylation sites were altered by replacing asparagines (N, Asn) at amino acid positions 172 and 209 with glutamines (Q, Gln).

The lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis both under non-reducing as well as under reducing conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, removal of both N-glycosylation sites created shifts in the FKRP molecular weight corresponding to what was seen in de-glycosylation experiments, using PNGase F and Endo H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Hence, these results confirm that recombinant FKRP is indeed occupied by two N-glycans. Furthermore, the corresponding molecular weight reduction of â¼7 kDa for the â¼116 kDa band is consistent with the above conclusion that FKRP is forming a homodimer. Removal of the FKRP N-glycosylation sites did not affect the capacity of FKRP to form dimers and multimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

        <title>FKRP-FKRP dimer formation depends on an N-terminal interaction interface and a Cys6-Cys6 disulfide linkage</title>
        <p>In order to identify the FKRP-FKRP interaction interface we constructed C-terminal truncation mutants of FKRP: FKRP-373, FKRP-282 and FKRP-157 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) of which the numbers denote the positions of the last amino acids in the truncated FKRP polypeptides. pcDNA3.1-FKRP truncation clones were expressed in COS-7 cells and the resulting lysates were prepared in the presence of 5 mM NEM and subsequently subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, FKRP truncation clones were expressed at levels comparable to that of full length FKRP, except FKRP-157 which repeatedly showed somewhat reduced expression levels. All FKRP truncation mutants, even FKRP-157, retained the property of forming dimers. However, in contrast to FKRP-157, full length FKRP, FKRP-282 and FKRP-373 also produced additional bands seen as smears under non-reducing conditions and distinct high MW bands under reducing conditions. These bands represent multimeric, FKRP containing, protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the interaction interface responsible for homodimer formation, is located in the N-terminal one third of FKRP and, furthermore, that FKRP multimer formation depends on additional protein segments that extend beyond residue 157 and into the C-terminal two third of the FKRP polypeptide.</p>

In the following experiments COS-7 cells were transfected with various pcDNA3.1 constructs and cleared lysates were prepared 48 hrs post transfection in the presence of 5 mM NEM. In all these experiments FKRP was detected with primary antibody FKRP207. B) Cleared lysates from FKRP C-terminal deletion mutants were either left untreated or subjected to reduction (400 mM DTT, at RT for 30 min), followed by (4â12%) SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.

Differences in migration between monomeric forms as well as between dimeric forms (5C) likely represent different FKRP conformations resolved by SDS-PAGE. Such conformational differences might be induced by CysâSer mutations as some of the mutant Cys residues must be expected to be involved in intra-molecular disulfide bridges.

        <p>The FKRP polypeptide contains eight cysteines. These are located at amino acid residues 6, 168, 191, 289, 296, 317, 318 and 375. To examine the role of these cysteines in the formation of FKRP dimers and multimers, cysteine (Cys, C) to serine (Ser, S) substitutions were introduced to FKRP by <italic>in vitro</italic> mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 5 mM NEM and subjected to Western blot analysis under both protein non-reducing and reducing conditions. Cys to Ser substitutions did not affect FKRP expression levels in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, under both non-reducing and reducing conditions, the mutant FKRP-Cys6Ser behaved distinctly different from the <italic>wild type</italic> FKRP and the other FKRP CysâSer mutants. Under non-reducing conditions FKRP-Cys6Ser expressed only the â¼58 kDa monomer as well as a strong band of very high molecular weight (&gt;500 kDa). In contrast, the <italic>wild type</italic> FKRP and the other FKRPCys-Ser mutants expressed both monomers (albeit FKRP-Cys289Ser only weakly) and dimers of â¼116 kDa, as well as smeared bands ranging in molecular weights from â¼180 kDa to several hundred kDas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, left panel). Furthermore, as the only mutant, FKRP-Cys6Ser expressed exclusively FKRP monomers under reducing conditions. For <italic>wild type</italic> FKRP, as well as for other FKRP CysâSer mutants, the relative amount of monomer increased at the expense of higher order multimers. However, in contrast to FKRP-Cys6Ser, distinct bands corresponding to â¼116 kDa and â¼180 kDa were clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, right panel).</p>
        <p>In summary; as the only mutant, FKRP-Cys6Ser failed to express the FKRP homodimer band of â¼116 kDa under non-reducing, as well as under reducing conditions. Hence, we conclude that the FKRP homodimer is kept together by an intermolecular disulfide bridge provided by Cys6 (Cys6-Cys6). The role of Cys6 in dimer formation was confirmed by the observation that FKRP-157-Cys6Ser, but not FKRP-157, failed to form dimers, even under non-reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
        <p>The involvement of other cysteines in FKRP dimer formation was not evident; however, their participation in high molecular weight structures is very likely since higher order multimers, above 180 kDa, were clearly sensitive to reduction by DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Their composition and the role of FKRP in these larger protein complexes remain to be investigated.</p>

General problems in protein localisation studies are mislocalisation, because of protein over-production in transfected cells, and/or lack of sensitivity or sufficient microscopic resolution when studying complex cell types such as those of skeletal muscle. This prompted us to assess endogenous muscle FKRP localisation at maximum resolution using immunoelectron microscopy on ultrathin sections of human <italic>rectus femoris</italic> muscle. A mixture of two polyclonal anti-FKRP antibodies, corresponding both to the N-terminal region and the C-terminal region of the FKRP polypeptide, showed co-localisation and overlap with the Golgi marker MG160, between myofibrils, in human skeletal muscle fibres. Perinuclear localisation, or co-localisation with ER-lumen marker, PDI, or sarcolemma marker, Î²-dystroglycan, was excluded. Hence, in accordance with the location of MG160 <xref rid="pone.0022968-Ralston1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> these results provide ultra structural evidence for FKRP localisation in the middle-to-trans-cisternae of the Golgi complex.</p>
        <p>Some of the previous attempts to identify the intracellular localisation of FKRP have been based on immune cytochemistry on transfected cell lines of various origins.

        <p>Previous attempts to localise endogenous FKRP in muscle have also generated conflicting results.

Nevertheless, the discrepant results on FKRP intracellular localisation are very intriguing.

        <title>FKRP as a homodimer</title>
        <p>Several lines of evidence based on non-reducing Western blot analysis, protein cross-linking, pairwise yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immune precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g003">3</xref>) demonstrated FKRP-FKRP self-interaction. Interestingly in this respect, whereas FKRP-HA could be co-precipitated with FKRP-Myc from cellular lysates originating from co-transfection experiments, FKRP-HA could not be co-precipitated with FKRP-Myc from a mixture of cellular lysates originating from separate solo transfections with FKRP-HA and FKRP-Myc carrying expression plasmids. This shows that when FKRP-FKRP assembly is once completed in the cellular compartment further FKRP assembly is disallowed; indicating that FKRP-FKRP assembly is a self limiting process that is likely terminated by stoichiometric and steric constrictions such as the complete occupation of interaction interfaces and cysteine residues for possible disulfide bridge formation. Since the FKRP homodimer was clearly sensitive to reduction by DTT, we explored the role of its eight cysteines in dimer formation by substituting them with serine. Replacement of Cys6, but none of the seven other cysteines, disrupted FKRP dimerisation. We conclude, therefore, that FKRP dimers are covalently connected at Cys6, by disulfide linkage.</p>
        <p>Important in this respect is that FKRP-FKRP association can take place regardless of the presence of Cys6, but rather through non-covalent interaction as shown in yeast cells. The FKRP constructs used in yeast two-hybrid experiments were devoid of residues 1â31, yet they demonstrated association allowing growth on selective medium. Together with the fact that the severely truncated FKRP-157 construct maintained the property to dimerise, these results strongly indicate that an interaction interface, necessary and sufficient for FKRP homodimer formation, is extending beyond residue 31 and into the N-terminal one third of FKRP polypeptide.</p>
        <p>By necessity, since the covalent disulfide bridge is provided by Cys6 alone, the interaction interfaces, as well as the homodimer as a whole, must display two-fold symmetry. Thus, a model can be envisioned in which FKRP homodimerisation is initiated and driven by hydrophobic interactions of which the resulting dimer is subsequently stabilised by a Cys6-Cys6 disulfide bridge.</p>
        <p>Recently Lu <italic>et al</italic> (2010) <xref rid="pone.0022968-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> demonstrated N-glycosylation of recombinant FKRP expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Here we show that both FKRP N-glycosylation sites are occupied and that these glycans are composed of high mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides. Furthermore, FKRP N-glycosylation is not required for homodimer or multimer formation. However, it remains unknown whether the N-glycans are required, <italic>in vivo</italic>, for FKRP folding, stability, transport and function.</p>

        <title>FKRP in multimeric complexes</title>
        <p>Western blot analysis under protein non-reducing conditions, as well as upon chemical protein cross-linking, showed that FKRP also exists in higher order multimeric complexes. Further dissection of the FKRP-FKRP interaction revealed that whereas the most severely truncated mutant, FKRP-157, devoid of amino acid residues 158â495, displayed no visible multimers, but monomers and dimers only, the two less severely, C-terminally truncated FKRP mutants, FKRP-373 and FKRP-282, maintained the property to express not only monomers and dimers, but clearly also large multimeric complexes. This indicates that whereas the primary FKRP-FKRP dimer interaction interface is located in the N-terminal one-third (1â157), the FKRP involvement in multimer formation must be dependent on amino acid residues belonging to the C-terminal two third - extending from residue 158 and throughout the FKRP polypeptide. Since also large protein complexes (&gt;â¼180 kDa) appear to be sensitive to reduction by DTT it is highly likely that other FKRP Cys residues are involved in multimer formation. However, the complex multimer band patterns from the experiments presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">5</xref>) does not allow such Cys residues to be identified at this juncture.</p>
        <p>Notably however, at reducing conditions we have repeatedly detected a weak, but distinct, FKRP specific band migrating as â¼170â180 kDa, which disappeared along with the FKRP dimer band of the FKRP-Cys6 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">5C</xref>). This suggests that the formation of the â¼170â180 kDa complex depends on a preceding covalent FKRP dimer formation. A strong band of similar molecular weight appeared upon cross-linking with EGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The approximate molecular weight is as expected for a putative FKRP homotrimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g004">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g005">5C</xref>). A disulfide-linked FKRP trimer would require the involvement of more than one Cys residue. Therefore, the possible association of an FKRP homodimer with yet a third FKRP polypeptide would have to involve a non-covalent interaction. The composition of multimers, ranging in molecular weight from that of a putative FKRP trimer (â¼175 kDa) to several hundred kDas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>), likely consist of both homo- and hetero-oligomeric proteins complexes. Their compositions and role in FKRP function remain to be explored.</p>

        <title>FKRP localisation and structure is consistent with Golgi resident type II transmembrane proteins</title>
        <p>The Golgi apparatus is indeed a location that would be expected for an enzyme involved in <italic>de novo</italic> O-glycan synthesis and/or modification. Based on hydrophobicity plots and secondary structure analysis, FKRP was predicted to be a type II transmembrane protein <xref rid="pone.0022968-Esapa1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Most of the knowledge on type II transmembrane proteins has been obtained from studies of N-glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. In general Golgi resident type II transmembrane proteins contain a short, cytoplasmically exposed, amino-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane domain, a stem region and a large, globular, catalytic domain facing the luminal side <xref rid="pone.0022968-Gleeson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Breton1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, they are known to form homodimers and heterodimers, as well as homo- and hetero-oligomeric protein complexes with other Golgi resident proteins which function in the same biosynthetic pathway <xref rid="pone.0022968-ElBattari1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Hassinen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-deGraffenried1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Accordingly, a model can be envisioned in which the N-terminal transmembrane domains of an FKRP homodimer extend through the Golgi membrane, forming a stabilising Cys6-Cys6 disulfide bond at the cytoplasmic face. A proposed model for the FKRP dimer is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022968-g006">Figure 6</xref>.</p>

            <title>Proposed model of the Golgi resident FKRP dimer; a putative glycosyltransferase.</title>
            <p>According to the type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase model, the architecture comprises a globular catalytic domain, a stem region, a single pass transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic N-terminal tail <xref rid="pone.0022968-Gleeson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-Breton1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022968-deGraffenried1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Based on the present work we suggest that FKRP forms homodimers via an interaction interface that extends through the stem region. The interaction is stabilised by a Cys6-Cys6 disulfide bridge in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail resulting in a covalently connected FKRP dimer with two-fold symmetry. The catalytic domain is likely to interact with other proteins forming large multimeric structures (not depicted). -S-S-; disulfide bridge, Y; N-glycan of high mannose and/or hybrid type.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, although its biological significance is yet to be explored, Lu <italic>et al</italic> (2010) <xref rid="pone.0022968-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> demonstrated that recombinant FKRP can be secreted from CHO cells but, in contrast to the putative dimer which was retained in the cell pellet, it was secreted into the supernatant only as a monomer. This monomeric form was presumably devoid of the putative 27 amino acid signal peptide <xref rid="pone.0022968-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. For such a phenomenon to occur FKRP must be proteolytically cleaved, N-terminally, close to the membrane at the luminal face, releasing FKRP from its N-terminal signal peptide. Thus, their observations do not conflict with our model, but rather they support our finding that Cys6 is the only contributor to a covalent, symmetric, FKRP homodimeric interaction.</p>
        <p>In summary, the FKRP localisation and intermolecular interaction determined in this work is consistent with that of a Golgi resident type II transmembrane protein. In the Golgi cisternae FKRP and putative interacting partners will be positioned to modify, or assist the modification of dystroglycan as it passes, <italic>en route</italic>, to the plasma membrane. However, more experiments are required to identify the FKRP substrate (if any) and, moreover, whether FKRP has the capacity to invoke the modification of other proteins besides dystroglycan.</p>
