        <p>When the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is challenged, the unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains ER homeostasis by regulating protein synthesis and enhancing expression of resident ER proteins that facilitate protein maturation and degradation. Here, we report that enforced expression of XBP1(S), the active form of the XBP1 transcription factor generated by UPR-mediated splicing of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA, is sufficient to induce synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the primary phospholipid of the ER membrane. Cells overexpressing XBP1(S) exhibit elevated levels of membrane phospholipids, increased surface area and volume of rough ER, and enhanced activity of the cytidine diphosphocholine pathway of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. These data suggest that XBP1(S) links the mammalian UPR to phospholipid biosynthesis and ER biogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ER is a dynamic protein-folding compartment that can be expanded according to the demands placed upon the exocytic pathway. This is exemplified by the highly developed ER network present in specialized secretory cells such as insulin-producing Î² cells of the pancreas and antibody-secreting plasma cells. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate the synthesis of protein and lipid components necessary for ER biogenesis remain poorly understood.</p>
      <p>Homeostasis of the ER is regulated in large part by the unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex signaling system emanating from the ER membrane that regulates translation and transcription in response to increased demands on the protein folding capacity of the ER (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Rutkowski and Kaufman, 2004</xref>). One branch of the UPR is directed by the ER membrane-bound activating transcription factor 6Î± and 6Î² (ATF6Î±/Î²). Regulated intramembrane proteolysis releases the soluble cytosolic domains of ATF6Î±/Î² to function as basic leucine zipper transcription factors that up-regulate expression of various ER resident chaperones and folding enzymes (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Haze et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>A second branch of the UPR that induces transcription involves X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). The ER transmembrane kinase/endoribonucleases IRE1Î± (expressed ubiquitously; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Tirasophon et al., 1998</xref>) and Î² (expressed in gut epithelium; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1998</xref>) initiate a novel UPR-mediated mRNA splicing mechanism that modifies <italic>XBP1</italic> transcripts to encode a potent basic leucine zipper transcription factor, XBP1(S). In contrast, unspliced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA encodes a basic leucine zipper protein, XBP1(U), that lacks transactivation activity and is more labile than XBP1(S) (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>). Genes identified as targets of XBP1(S) encode proteins that function in the ER (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, like ATF6Î±/Î², the IRE1-XBP1 pathway appears to enhance the ability of the ER to properly handle an increased load of client proteins.</p>
      <p>The differentiation of B-lymphocytes into antibody-secreting cells requires <italic>XBP1</italic> and its modulation by UPR-mediated splicing (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Iwakoshi et al., 2003</xref>), and pancreatic tissue exhibits robust splicing of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Iwawaki et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), the predominant phospholipid in mammalian ER membranes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lykidis and Jackowski, 2001</xref>), elevates in B-cells differentiating in response to lipopolysaccharide (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Rush et al., 1991</xref>). PtdCho biosynthesis also increases in macrophages subjected to free cholesterol loading (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Shiratori et al., 1994</xref>), another example of physiologic UPR activation (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, UPR activation correlates with the presence of an elaborate ER in specialized secretory cells and with induction of phospholipid biosynthesis, but a molecular mechanism linking the UPR to ER biogenesis has not been elucidated.</p>
      <p>Given the roles of the UPR in maintenance of ER homeostasis, we hypothesized that the UPR might regulate overall ER abundance. Here, we report that enforced expression of a single transcription factor, XBP1(S), is sufficient to induce PtdCho biosynthesis, elevate the level of membrane phospholipids, and trigger expansion of the ER in fibroblasts. These data suggest that XBP1(S) regulates ER biogenesis, revealing another means by which cells use the UPR to cope with increased demands on the exocytic pathway.</p>

        <title>Effect of XBP1(S) on phospholipid biosynthesis and ER expansion</title>
        <p>To determine whether mammalian UPR transcriptional activators regulate phospholipid biosynthesis, we transduced NIH-3T3 fibroblasts with retroviral vectors encoding either XBP1(U), XBP1(S), or a constitutively active form of ATF6Î± (ATF6Î±(373); Yoshida et al., 2000). Flow cytometric assessment of GFP, expressed via the bicistronic mRNA encoded by the retroviral vectors, revealed â¥95% transduction efficiency for all retroviral constructs tested in NIH-3T3 cells (see online supplemental material, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200406136/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200406136/DC1</ext-link>). As expected, ATF6Î±(373) induced expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) and the disulfide-isomerase-like protein ERp72, two ER resident chaperones. In addition, ATF6Î±(373) up-regulated ERdj3 (also known as HEDJ), an ER chaperone cofactor that has been identified as an XBP1 target (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The XBP1(U) retroviral vector yielded the â¼30-kD pXBP1(U) and no detectable pXBP1(S), whereas the XBP1(S) virus exclusively yielded the â¼54-kD pXBP1(S). Cells transduced with XBP1(S), but not XBP1(U), exhibited increased levels of ERdj3 and BiP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). These data demonstrate that ATF6Î±(373), XBP1(U), and XBP1(S) all functioned as predicted upon enforced expression in NIH-3T3 cells.</p>

<bold>Phospholipid synthesis in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts retrovirally transduced with UPR transcriptional activators.</bold> NIH-3T3 cells were transduced with the indicated pBMN-I-GFP retroviral vectors. (A) At 48 h after transduction, cells were harvested and equivalent amounts of cell lysate protein were resolved by standard SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Chemiluminescent immunoblotting was performed. A nonspecific band just below the position of pXBP1(S) was detected by the anti-XBP1 antibody. Calnexin served as a loading control. (B) Cells were metabolically labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]choline for 2 h, a labeling interval in which [<sup>3</sup>H]choline is incorporated exclusively into PtdCho. The amount of radiolabel present in cellular lipid extracts was normalized as cpm/10<sup>5</sup> cells and was plotted as the mean Â± SD (<italic>n</italic> = 3; asterisk denotes P = 0.002 for comparison of XBP1(S) to empty vector).

        </fig>
        <p>In contrast to ATF6Î±(373) and XBP1(U), enforced expression of XBP1(S) resulted in a large (approximately fourfold) increase in PtdCho synthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Furthermore, the total amount of both PtdCho and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), also a major lipid in intracellular membranes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lykidis and Jackowski, 2001</xref>), was increased approximately twofold in XBP1(S)-transduced cells. However, the mass of cholesterol, most prevalent in the plasma membrane, was unchanged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). Therefore, XBP1(S) has the capacity to mediate substantial increases in phospholipids that constitute the membranes of intracellular organelles like the ER. It is important to note that the yeast UPR has also been implicated in lipid metabolism (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
        <p>Electron microscopy revealed that XBP1(S)-transduced cells contained an increased number of intracellular membraneâbound structures that were frequently studded with ribosomes, indicating their identity as RER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). Indeed, the surface area and volume of RER were significantly increased in XBP1(S)-transduced cells, 2.5- and 3.4-fold, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that KDEL-containing proteins were distributed throughout the cytoplasm of XBP1(S)-transduced cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C), consistent with an overall increase in the amount of ER. In addition, XBP1(S) induced a 44% increase in cell size (empty vector cells, 103.9 Â± 1.8 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>; XBP1(S) cells, 149.8 Â± 2.5 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>). Cells overexpressing XBP1(S) exhibited a slower rate of proliferation 24 h after transduction, but their viability was not affected through 48 h. Importantly, while this manuscript was under review, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Shaffer et al. (2004)</xref> reported that XBP1(S) can mediate increased cell size and expansion of intracellular organelles including the ER, thereby corroborating our findings.</p>

        <p>Synthesis of XBP1(S) can also be elicited by ER stress-inducing agents such as the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. In a series of experiments, we observed a trend toward a small increase (â¼20%) in PtdCho biosynthesis within 3 to 4 h of tunicamycin treatment, but this was not sustained in a statistically significant fashion for longer intervals (unpublished data). Perhaps gross inhibition of protein folding in the ER and/or complete UPR activation in cells subjected to pharmacologic agents that poison the ER is not compatible with increased phospholipid biosynthesis.</p>

        <title>Effect of XBP1(S) on the cytidine diphosphocholine pathway of PtdCho biosynthesis</title>
        <p>The predominant pathway for PtdCho biosynthesis in mammalian cells is the cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) or Kennedy pathway (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lykidis and Jackowski, 2001</xref>). First, choline kinase (CK) phosphorylates choline in the presence of ATP to yield phosphocholine. Second, choline cytidylyltransferase (CCT) converts phosphocholine to CDP-choline in the presence of CTP, and this is considered to be the rate-limiting step in the CDP-choline pathway (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lykidis and Jackowski, 2001</xref>). Third, cholinephosphotransferase 1 (CPT1) transfers the phosphocholine moiety of CDP-choline to DAG, producing PtdCho. This final step can also be catalyzed by choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase (CEPT1), a bifunctional enzyme that can synthesize both choline- and ethanolamine-containing phospholipids. Here, we refer to the activities of CPT1 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Henneberry et al., 2000</xref>) and CEPT1 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Henneberry and McMaster, 1999</xref>) collectively as CPT activity. In XBP1(S)-transduced cells, CK activity was unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A), CCT activity increased â¼30% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B), and CPT activity elevated approximately fivefold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). Remarkably similar to these data, increased PtdCho biosynthesis in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated splenic B cells was previously shown to correlate with unchanged CK activity, a small increase in CCT activity, and an approximately sixfold increase in CPT activity (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Rush et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, it follows that XBP1(S) might mediate the increased synthesis of phospholipids necessary for ER biogenesis as B cells transition into high-rate antibody secretion.</p>

        <p>There are three isoforms of CCT: Î±, Î²2, and Î²3. CCTÎ± is ubiquitously expressed, whereas the Î² isoforms exhibit tissue-specific expression that is â¼10-fold lower compared with CCTÎ± (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Jackowski et al., 2004</xref>). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed no change in transcript levels for any of the CCT isoforms in XBP1(S)-transduced cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). Likewise, Northern blotting revealed no change in the steady-state levels of <italic>CPT1</italic> and <italic>CEPT1</italic> transcripts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). These data suggest that enforced expression of XBP1(S) leads to post-transcriptional and/or post-translational regulation of the CCTÎ± and CPT1/CEPT1 enzymes, thereby augmenting their activities and increasing synthesis of PtdCho (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

        <p>CCTÎ± is an amphitropic enzyme as it transitions from a soluble form, largely sequestered in the nucleus, into a more active form associated with ER membranes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cornell and Northwood, 2000</xref>). Conversion of CCTÎ± into the membrane-associated form correlates with dephosphorylation of serine residues near its carboxy terminus, and this influences its affinity for membranes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lykidis and Jackowski, 2001</xref>). Thus, there are a number of steps at which an XBP1(S)-regulated gene product might modulate CCTÎ± activity. Both CPT1 and CEPT1 contain an estimated seven membrane-spanning helices and are predicted to reside in the ER membrane (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Henneberry and McMaster, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Henneberry et al., 2000</xref>), but very little is known concerning control of their respective activities. Perhaps XBP1(S) regulates expression of an allosteric modulator or a cofactor that enhances the stability of CPT1 and/or CEPT1.</p>

        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Our data regarding XBP1(S) provide the first example of a transcription factor being sufficient to induce phospholipid biosynthesis and ER expansion in mammalian cells. Whether the expanded ER in XBP1(S)-transduced cells is properly organized and fully functional is under investigation. We propose that in a physiologic UPR, the IRE1-XBP1 pathway regulates synthesis of phospholipids according to cellular needs for ER membrane components (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis via a thermosensitive mutation in the CCT enzyme has been correlated with UPR activation (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">van der Sanden et al., 2003</xref>), providing further evidence that the UPR might provide a means to rapidly respond to an increased need for phospholipids. Coordinating induction of phospholipid biosynthesis with up-regulated expression of ER resident proteins would allow the mammalian UPR to both build and equip the ER.</p>

        <title>Analysis of PtdCho synthesis</title>
        <p>Cells were cultured for 2 h at 37Â°C in DME containing 2 Î¼Ci/ml methyl[<sup>3</sup>H]choline chloride (81 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). In tunicamycin experiments, labeling was performed during the final 2 h of treatment. After labeling, cells were washed with cold PBS and scraped in methanol/water (2:0.8, vol/vol). Lipids were extracted as described previously (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bligh and Dyer, 1959</xref>). Radiolabel incorporated into chloroform-soluble metabolites was determined by scintillation spectroscopy. The organic phase was subjected to TLC in chloroform/methanol/water (65:35:4, vol/vol/vol) to verify that detectable radioactivity was present exclusively in PtdCho.</p>

        <title>Phospholipid mass determinations</title>
        <p>Frozen cell pellets (2 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cells) were thawed on ice and resuspended in 1 ml of water. The total volume was measured and a 100-Î¼l aliquot was removed for protein determination. The remainder of the lysate was extracted as described previously (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bligh and Dyer, 1959</xref>). Lipids were detected by flame ionization using an Iatroscan instrument (Iatron Laboratories) with PEAK SIMPLE software (SRI Instruments). Peaks were identified by comigration with authentic standards. PtdCho, PtdEtn, and cholesterol mass were calculated using standard curves for each prepared with either the polar lipid (no. 1127) or the neutral lipid (no. 1129) mixture (Matreya, Inc.).

        <title>Stereological measurements of RER and cell size determinations</title>
        <p>Four independent stereological sets containing electron micrographs of empty vectorâ and XBP1(S)-transduced cells at magnifications of 8,000 and 20,000 were analyzed. RER volume was measured by determining the volume fraction (V<sub>v</sub>) with a grid containing test points in the linear array (1-cm spacing). V<sub>v</sub> is equal to the number of test points falling on RER divided by the number of test points falling on the containing space. RER surface area was calculated by determining the surface density (S<sub>v</sub>). S<sub>v</sub> is equal to two times the number of line intersections with RER membrane, divided by the total length of line on the containing space (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Weibel and Bolender, 1973</xref>). Average cell size was determined from light microscopy analysis of thick sections using the Scion image program.
