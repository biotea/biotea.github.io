      <abstract>
        <p>Cilia formation and function require a special set of trafficking machinery termed intraflagellar transport (IFT), consisting mainly of protein complexes IFT-A, IFT-B, BBSome, and microtubule-dependent molecular motors. <underline>T</underline>etra<underline>t</underline>ri<underline>c</underline>opeptide repeat-containing (TTC) proteins are widely involved in protein complex formation. Nine of them are known to serve as components of the IFT or BBSome complexes. How many TTC proteins are cilia-related and how they function, however, remain unclear. Here we show that twenty TTC genes were upregulated by at least 2-fold during the differentiation of cultured mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs) into multiciliated cells. Our systematic screen in zebrafish identified four novel TTC genes, <italic>ttc4</italic>, <italic>-9c</italic>, <italic>-36</italic>, and <italic>-39c</italic>, that are critical for cilia formation and motility. Accordingly, their zebrafish morphants displayed typical ciliopathy-related phenotypes, including curved body, abnormal otolith, hydrocephalus, and defective left-right patterning. The morphants of <italic>ttc4</italic> and <italic>ttc25</italic>, a known cilia-related gene, additionally showed pronephric cyst formation. Immunoprecipitation indicated associations of TTC4, -9c, -25, -36, and -39c with components or entire complexes of IFT-A, IFT-B, or BBSome, implying their participations in IFT or IFT-related activities. Our results provide a global view for the relationship between TTC proteins and cilia.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cilia are evolutionarily conserved, microtubule-based, hair-like organelles present in most animal cells. They play important roles in cell movement, environment sensing, and signal transduction [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Defects in cilia assembly and function result in severe disorders called ciliopathies, including infertility, retinal degeneration, hydrocephalus, polycystic kidney, and <italic>situs inversus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ciliogenesis and ciliary functions for the understanding and the treatment of ciliopathies.</p>
      <p>The assembly, maintenance and functions of cilia depend on the intraflagellar transport (IFT), the bidirectional trafficking of vesicles and proteins along the ciliary axoneme [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous works have revealed that the IFT is mediated by motor protein complexes, cytoplasmic dynein and kinesins, via IFT particles that serve as cargo acceptors [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. IFT particles can be further classified into two subcomplexes termed IFT-A (containing IFT144, -140, -139, -122, -121, and -43) and-B (containing IFT172, -88, -81, -80, -74, -70, -57, -54, -52, -46, -27, -25, -22, and -20) [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Their assembly at the cilia base and turnaround at the cilia tip requires another protein complex, BBSome [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. BBSome is composed of seven proteins (BBS1, -2, -4, -5, -7, -8, and -9) [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Mutations in these components cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), an autosomal recessive disorder with polydactyly, kidney cysts, nephropathy, and obesity [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>The <underline>t</underline>etratrico<underline>p</underline>eptide <underline>r</underline>epeat (TPR) domain is a structural domain that mediates protein-protein interactions important for multiprotein complex formation. It usually consists of 3â16 TPRs, each of which is a motif of 34 amino acids [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Crystallographic analysis on phosphatase 5 shows that the TPR motif forms a pair of antiparallel Î±-helices and multiple TPRs are arranged in a parallel manner to form a right-handed superhelix [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The TPR-containing (TTC) proteins widely exist from bacteria to humans and are involved in many important biological processes, such as intracellular transport, vesicle fusion, protein folding, cell cycle, and transcriptional regulation [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, TPR domains are found in all the IFT-A subunits except IFT122 and IFT43, in IFT172, IFT88, and IFT70 of the IFT-B complex, and in BBS4 and BBS8 of BBSome [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. TTC26 has recently been shown as a component of IFT-B complex [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], whereas <italic>Xenopus</italic> TTC25 is found to be important for ciliogenesis and the signal transduction of sonic hedgehog pathway, a cilium-dependent signaling pathway in vertebrate [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Whether there are novel TTC proteins involved in cilia formation and function, however, is not clear.</p>
      <p>In this study, we used cDNA microarray to screen for TTC proteins up-regulated during multiciliogenesis of cultured mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs) [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and characterized their roles in cilia formation and functions during the embryonic development of zebrafish. In addition to known cilia-related TTC proteins, we identified four novel TTC proteins critical for cilia formation and functions. Furthermore, our results suggest that all these TTC proteins are involved in IFT.</p>

        <title>Multiple TTC genes are upregulated during MTEC differentiation</title>
        <p>Following the establishment of an air-liquid interface (ALI), MTECs cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> simultaneously generate hundreds of centrioles, which serve as the basal bodies of cilia, followed by the formation of dense motile cilia (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Accordingly, genes important for centriole biogenesis and cilia formation are upregulated. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that during MTEC differentiation the centriole amplification peaks at ALI day 3 (d3) and multiciliation reaches plateau at around ALI d5 [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our study provides a global view for the relationship between TTC genes and cilia functions. Proteomic analysis, cDNA microarray, and high throughput <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization have previously been used to identify cilia-related proteins or genes from isolated cilia, MTECs, or <italic>Xenopus</italic> or zebrafish embryos [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. FoxJ1, the master transcription factor of motile cilia [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], is shown to drive the expression of several TTC genes, including <italic>IFT88</italic>, <italic>IFT140</italic>, <italic>IFT172</italic>, and <italic>TTC26</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], whereas TTC25 is found critical for multicilia formation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic skin cells [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We performed cDNA microarray using DAPT-treated MTECs and found that, in addition to ten known cilia-related TTC genes, ten novel TTC genes also exhibited correlated expression patterns during multiciliogenesis (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Consistently, all the ten novel TTC genes, except <italic>TTC5 and TTC39c</italic>, have been found to be upregulated by at least two-fold in the previous cDNA microarray using FoxJ1-positive MTECs [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We characterized these ten novel genes using zebrafish embryos and found that <italic>ttc4</italic>, <italic>-9c</italic>, <italic>-36</italic>, and <italic>-39c</italic> are critical for motile cilia functions. The remaining six, <italic>ttc5</italic>, <italic>-12</italic>, -<italic>16</italic>, <italic>-18</italic>, <italic>-29</italic>, and <italic>-39a</italic>, were precluded from our further studies because their zebrafish morphants did not show striking body curvatures (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Nevertheless, since we did not check the knockdown efficiency of the MOs, whether these genes are indeed unrelated to cilia still needs further clarification.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that, TTC4, -9c, -36, -39c, and -25 are critical for normal body shape, otolith formation, pronephric cilia function, and left-right asymmetry during zebrafish embryonic development (Figs <xref rid="pone.0124378.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124378.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0124378.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). They are also required for proper fluid flow of the brain ventricles (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Kidney cysts are mainly attributed to overproliferation [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In zebrafish, defects in motile cilia can cause pronephric cysts but detailed mechanisms are still poorly understood [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Although the <italic>ttc</italic> morphants frequently exhibited enlarged pronephric ducts (S2-S6 Videa vs. <xref rid="pone.0124378.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Video</xref>), only some morphants of <italic>ttc4</italic> and <italic>ttc25</italic> contained visible pronephric cysts (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Nonetheless, there might exist tiny cysts that were not visible in our examinations. Detailed studies in the future are still required to clarify whether or not <italic>ttc9c</italic>, <italic>ttc36</italic>, and <italic>ttc39c</italic> are involved in pronephric cyst formation.</p>
      <p>Although all these TTC proteins are important for KV cilia formation (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4Aâ4C</xref>), they have different impact on the motility of pronephric cilia (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E and 4F</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0124378.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124378.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124378.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124378.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0124378.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Videos</xref>). Compared to the control morphants, pronephric cilia motilities were strikingly repressed in the morphants of <italic>ttc9c</italic>, <italic>ttc36</italic>, and <italic>ttc39c</italic>. The average CBF was reduced by more than 81% (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). By contrast, in the morphants of <italic>ttc25</italic> and <italic>ttc4</italic>, the reduction in average CBF was less than 40% (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). This suggests that <italic>ttc9c</italic>, <italic>ttc36</italic>, and <italic>ttc39c</italic> may have a role in the assembly or activity of axonemal dynein arms.</p>
      <p>It is both surprising and interesting to find that all the cilia-related TTC proteins are implicated in IFT. Nine TTC proteins, including TTC26, have previously been shown as components of IFT-A or-B complex or BBSome [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). TTC25 is important for ciliogenesis and hedgehog signaling in <italic>Xenopus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We further showed that mammalian TTC25 is strongly associated with both IFT-A andâB complexes but not BBSome (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Therefore, TTC25 might function in bridging IFT-A and IFT-B during IFT. TTC36 appeared to associate more strongly with IFT-A complex than with IFT-B complex, whereas TTC39c, -4, and -9c associated with certain subcomplex or subunits of IFT-A or BBSome (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Since TTC26/DYF13 is involved in the transport of motility-related proteins into cilia/flagella through association with IFT-B [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the association of TTC36 with IFT-A might also function in transport of certain cilia components. TTC36 (also named HBP21) and TTC4 have been proposed as co-chaperons implicated in tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and might help protein folding as well. The punctate staining patterns of these TTC proteins (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>) are also consistent with their potential roles in IFT. Nevertheless, how these novel cilia-related TTC proteins function at the molecular level still needs future investigations.</p>
