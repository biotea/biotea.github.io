          <title>Background</title>
          <p>P.R4810K of <italic>RNF213</italic> (mysterin: rs112735431), which is an AAA<sup>+</sup> ATPase, is the susceptibility polymorphism for moyamoya disease (MMD) in East Asians. However, the role of RNF213 R4810K in the etiology of MMD is unknown.</p>

          <title>Methods and Results</title>
          <p>To clarify the role of RNF213 in known angiogenic pathways, RNF213 expression was analyzed in endothelial cells (ECs) treated with several angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, including interferons (IFNs). RNF213 was upregulated by IFN-Î² through signal transducer and activator of transcription x in the promoter and mediated antiangiogenic activity of IFN-Î². RNF213 wild-type (WT) overexpression could not lower angiogenesis without IFN-Î², but RNF213 R4810K overexpression could. To correlate biochemical function as ATPase and the role of RNF213 oligomer formation with antiangiogenic activity, we investigated the effects of mutations in the AAA<sup>+</sup> module. A mutation of the Walker B motif (WEQ), which stabilizes oligomerization, inhibited angiogenesis, but AAA<sup>+</sup> module deletion, which cannot initiate oligomerization, did not. Intriguingly, R4810K, similar to WEQ, decreased ATPase activity, suggesting its antiangiogenic activity through stabilizing oligomers. To confirm the antiangiogenic effect of RNF213 upregulation inÂ vivo, vascular EC- or smooth muscle cell-specific Rnf213 R4757K (R4810K ortholog) or WT transgenic (Tg) mice were exposed to hypoxia. Cerebral angiogenesis by hypoxia was suppressed in EC-specific Rnf213 R4757K Tg mice, whereas it was not suppressed in other mice.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>This study suggests the importance of inflammatory signals as environmental factors and R4810K carriers for susceptibility to cerebral hypoxia. A specific inhibitor of ATP binding to the first AAA<sup>+</sup> could be a promising therapeutic candidate for MMD.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular disease, which is characterized by progressive occlusive or stenotic lesions at the terminal portion of internal carotid arteries.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> MMD is currently recognized as one of the major causes of stroke in children worldwide.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Annual prevalence and incidence of MMD in Japan were reported to be 10.5 and 0.94 per 100Â 000, respectively.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
    <p>Recently, <italic>RNF213</italic> (mysterin) was identified as the susceptibility gene for MMD,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and the polymorphism, p.R4810K (rs112735431: G&gt;A; referred to in the article as RNF213 R4810K) is a founder variant that is commonly found in East Asian (Japanese, Korean, and Chinese) patients.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In Japan and Korea, the majority (â80%) of MMD patients have at least 1 allele of RNF213 R4810K.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A much larger proportion of carriers with RNF213 R4810K develop MMD than that of wild-type (WT) subjects, even though the majority of carriers with RNF213 R4810K remain unaffected with MMD.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Unknown factors are considered to overlay the genetic predisposition in the RNF213 R4810K carrier to develop MMD. Several case reports have suggested that MMD occurs after inflammation,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> suggesting that inflammatory signals may trigger MMD as an environmental factor.</p>
    <p><italic>RNF213</italic> encodes a 591-kDa (5207 amino acids) protein that exhibits ATPase and ubiquitin ligase activities.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This protein was proven to be a novel AAA<sup>+</sup> ATPase, which dynamically changes its oligomeric states.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> RNF213 has 2 AAA<sup>+</sup> ATPase modules. The first module is essential for assembling RNF213 oligomers, whereas the second module is essential to disassemble RNF213 oligomers. Both modules have Walker A and Walker B motifs and are essential for expressing ATPase activity. In the first AAA<sup>+</sup>, the Walker A motif, which binds ATP, is crucial for hexamer formation, whereas the Walker B motif, which hydrolyzes and dissociates ATP, stabilizes hexamers.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The RNF213 R4810K variant is assembled normally as the WT,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> suggesting that this mutation does not affect ATP binding to the Walker A motif in the first AAA<sup>+</sup>.</p>
    <p>We recently evaluated the angiogenic activity of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived vascular endothelial cells (iPSECs) from MMD patients and an unaffected carrier with RNF213 R4810K.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We found that angiogenic activity was lower in patients and carriers than in subjects with the WT genotype. Furthermore, the phenotype of low angiogenic activity was recaptured by overexpression of RNF213 R4810K in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas silencing RNF213 did not alter angiogenic activity.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These observations are consistent with 2 recent independent findings in mouse models that ablation of Rnf213 did not induce any apparent abnormality of the vascular system.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
    <p>In the present study, we aimed to obtain biochemical and functional characterization of RNF213 R4810K in angiogenesis inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo. This aim was approached by 3 objectives. The first objective of this study was to examine whether RNF213 is a mediator in known angiogenic pathways. Therefore, we investigated angiogenic cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î², platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, and interleukin (IL)-1Î²,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> as well as other antiangiogenic cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-Î±, IFN-Î², and IFN-Î³. The second objective was to investigate the effects of mutagenesis of the functional ATPase motifs in the first AAA<sup>+</sup> module on angiogenic activity. RNF213 is known to be in dynamic conformational equilibrium between oligomeric and monomeric conformations.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Those conformational changes of RNF213 are assumed to be related to its function. Finally, the third objective was to determine whether lower angiogenesis caused by upregulation of RNF213 R4810K in endothelial cells (ECs) can be restored in mouse models. This experiment was conducted using transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress Rnf213 R4757K (the human R4810K allelic ortholog) specifically in ECs or smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Mice were exposed to hypoxia and angiogenesis was evaluated. Our results will hopefully provide further insight into RNF213 in angiogenesis.</p>

        <title>Cell Culture and Reagents</title>
        <p>HeLa cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% FBS (Japan Bioserum, Hiroshima, Japan). HUVECs (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) were maintained in endothelial growth medium-2 (Lonza). iPSECs were established and maintained in primate ES medium (ReproCELL, Kanagawa, Japan), supplemented with 500 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 4Â ng/mL of recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (WAKO, Osaka, Japan), as previously reported.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> For use and establishment of iPS cells, the institutional ethics committees of Kyoto University reviewed and approved the present study protocols. All participants gave written informed consent; for those considered too young to consent, informed consent was given by the parent or guardian.</p>
        <p>Recombinant human IL-1Î², TGF-Î², VEGF, PDGF-BB, IFN-Î², and IFN-Î³ were obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). IFN-Î± was obtained from BioVision (Milpitas, CA). ReagentsÂ were dissolved in 0.1% BSA (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA) at 0Â ng/mL.</p>
        <p>For evaluation of cellular proliferation, HUVECs were seeded at 7.5Ã10<sup>4</sup>Â cells/well in 6-well plates. At 24Â hours after seeding, the culture medium including the test reagent was exchanged. The numbers of viable cells were assessed and counted using trypan blue (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) exclusion.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of Angiogenic Activity by Tube Formation and Migration Assays</title>
        <p>Tube formation was assessed as described previously.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> HUVECs (30Â 000Â cells/well; 0 or 1Â ng/mL of IFN-Î²) were seeded onto 96-well plates coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After incubation for 20Â hours at 37Â°C, digital images of the tubes that formed were captured. For quantification, the area of the tube, total length of the tube, and number of tube branches were calculated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).</p>
        <p>Migration assays were performed as described previously.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> HUVECs were grown to overconfluence in 24-well plates and then incubated overnight for serum starvation (0 or 1Â ng/mL of IFN-Î²). After creation of a wound with a p200 pipette tip, the medium was replaced with endothelial growth medium-2 (0 or 1Â ng/mL of IFN-Î²). The wound was allowed to narrow for healing (re-endothelialization) for 8Â hours. Digital images were obtained before and after the incubation period, and the area of re-endothelialization was calculated using ImageJ software.</p>

        <title>Plasmid Construction for RNF213 WT, RNF213 R4810K, RNF213 WEQ, and RNF213 Deletion of AAA<sup>+</sup> and Transfection</title>
        <p>To obtain RNF213 cDNA, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using 3 sets of primers (Primer N1 to N2, M1 to M2, and C1 to C2), as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Table S1</xref>. We used RevTra Ace reverse transcriptase and KOD FX DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The 3 amplified fragments were digested with restriction enzymes (NcoI and SalI, SalI and HindIII, and HindIII and NotI, respectively). Fragments were cloned between NcoI and NotI sites of pENTR4 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) to construct full-length cDNA of RNF213. The R4810K mutation and Walker B mutation (E2488Q:WEQ) were introduced by PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis using mutated primers using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). These mutated primers (Primers 1 to 4) were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Table S1</xref>. The deleted mutation (delta AAA) was introduced by the SalI site at the 8310-nucleotide position from the start codon (primer delatSalI: AAT GTC GAC GTG ATC ACA GAA GTC CTC TGC and primer M2) by PCR using KOD FX DNA polymerase and combined with RNF213 cDNA. These entry clones were used for the LR reaction (Thermo Scientific) using a destination vector with an amino-terminal 3xFLAG tagged or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sequence under a tetracycline-regulated cytomegalovirus promoter. The design of the tagged-RNF213 WT and mutant vectors that were used in the present study are shown in Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>. The generated constructs were confirmed by sequencing.

The construct was generated using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). An entry vector harboring mouse Rnf213 WT was produced based on the pENTR4 vector. Five fragments of the Rnf213 coding sequence were amplified by RT-PCR from C57BL/6 mouse liver RNA using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) using primers, which are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Table S2</xref>. Fragments 1 and 2 were connected using the XhoI site at 3259 to 3264Â bp. Fragments 2 and 3 were connected using the EcoRI site at 6080 to 6085Â bp. Fragments 3 and 4 were connected using the SacII site at 8975 to 8980Â bp. Fragments 4 and 5 were connected using the MluI site at 12Â 651 to 12Â 656Â bp. The full-length Rnf213 coding sequence was integrated into the pENTR4 vector using NcoI and NotI sites. An allelic ortholog of human p.R4810K (p.R4757K) was introduced into <italic>Rnf213</italic> WT using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen).

        <p>We first screened several angiogenic and antiangiogenic cytokines to determine whether treatment with different doses of these cytokines induced RNF213 in cultured cells. IFN-Î² and IFN-Î³ were found to induce RNF213. We then statistically compared RNF213 levels in IFN-Î²- or IFN-Î³-treated cells with untreated cells. The mechanism of RNF213 induction with IFN-Î² was examined in cells transfected with RNF213 WT or mutated promoter luciferase plasmid. To test the effect of a STATx mutation, luciferase activity in cells transfected with STATx mutation promoter was compared with cells transfected with RNF213 WT promoter. Effects of treatment of IFN-Î² on angiogenesis were statistically evaluated by tube formation and migration assay using HUVECs and iPSECs. In experiments of target protein depletion (p-STAT1, STAT1, or RNF213) using corresponding siRNAs, we compared target protein levels in cells treated with target siRNA with cells treated with control siRNA. We also tested the effect of STAT1 and RNF213 siRNA on angiogenesis.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the inÂ vitro effect of various RNF213 mutations on angiogenesis, the angiogenic function of HUVECs transfected with RNF213 mutants were compared with HUVECs transfected with a control vector. In addition, ATPase activities of RNF213 mutants were compared to RNF213 WT.</p>

After 24Â hours of treatment, none of the factors, except for IFN-Î³, changed RNF213 protein levels in HeLa cells (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>).

We then investigated the effects of treatment with the same factors on HUVECs at the 24-hour time point. Whereas TGF-Î², IL-1Î², VEGF, and PDGF-BB did not change RNF213 protein levels (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4A</xref>), IFN-Î² and IFN-Î³, but not IFN-Î±, increased protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>).

        <title>Role of RNF213 in Antiangiogenic Activity of IFN-Î²</title>
        <p>First, we evaluated effects of treatment with IFN-Î² on HUVEC proliferation, and found that IFN-Î² did not increase proliferation (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>). Angiogenic activity was then evaluated by tube formation and migration assays. We confirmed that IFN-Î² lowered tube formation and inhibited migration (Figures<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">9</xref>) without affecting proliferation rates (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>). Because IFN-Î² induced RNF213, we hypothesized that antiangiogenic activity of IFN-Î² is mediated by RNF213. To test this hypothesis, we first depleted STAT1 by siRNA. Antiangiogenic activity of IFN-Î², except for branching, was normalized by depletion of STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1 by siRNA transfection (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10B</xref>). Notably, siRNA also downregulated RNF213 (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10A</xref>). This downregulation was likely mediated by activation of the promoter. We then depleted RNF213 protein levels by siRNA transfection. Depletion of RNF213 restored tube formation and migration (Figures<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). These rescue experiments by siRNA transfection demonstrated that RNF213 was involved in antiangiogenic activity of IFN-Î² in ECs.</p>

        <p>Our inÂ vitro data strongly suggest that RNF213 R4810K lowers angiogenic activity in ECs when it is induced by environmental stimuli, such as IFNs. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ablation or upregulation of RNF213 R4810K inÂ vivo using various genetically modified mice. These mouse strains involved ablation of Rnf213 (KO)<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and Tg mice, which overexpresses Rnf213 (R4757K or WT) in ECs (EC: EC-Mut-Tg and EC-WT-Tg) or SMCs (SMC: SMC-Mu-Tg) (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). Tissue-specific upregulation of RNF213 was confirmed in Tg mice in ECs and SMCs (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>). To induce cerebral angiogenesis, mice at 3Â weeks of age were exposed to hypoxia (8% O<sub>2</sub> for 2Â weeks). At the end of exposure, MRA was conducted inÂ 3 mice for each strain. Exposure to hypoxia failed toÂ induce angiogenesis in EC-Mut-Tg mice, whereas upregulation of Rnf213 WT in ECs, upregulation of Rnf213 R4757K in SMCs, and null Rnf213 or WT significantly induced angiogenesis (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>). However, we could not find any stenotic lesions, moyamoya vessels, or lesions indicative of cerebral infarction in any mice with different genotypes (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">9</xref>).</p>

      <p>RNF213 is highly associated with MMD<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and is a causative gene for MMD.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Although low angiogenesis has been reported with RNF213,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> functional deviations caused by R4810K have not been investigated. Given that upregulation of R4810K may be important in development of MMD, the environmental stimuli that induce RNF213 remain unknown. Additionally, there are no animal models enabling to recapture the low-angiogenesis phenotype.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we systemically investigated the effects of RNF213 R4810K on angiogenesis to address these issues discussed above. We found that upregulation could be produced by inflammatory signals of IFNs in HUVECs and ECs established from iPS cells from unaffected subjects and MMD patients. Upregulation of RNF213 by IFNs was consistently accompanied by lower angiogenesis, and silencing RNF213 partially ameliorated inhibition of angiogenesis by IFN-Î². We also showed that upregulation of RNF213 was mediated by STATx in the promoter of the <italic>RNF213</italic> gene. These data collectively indicate that upregulation of RNF213 WT is causally associated with lower angiogenic activity after IFN-Î² exposure. Therefore, RNF213 is likely to be a mediator downstream of the IFN-Î²-signaling pathway in ECs that are primed by IFN-Î² inÂ vivo. However, upregulation of RNF213 WT was not sufficient to elicit antiangiogenic signals independently, whereas upregulation of RNF213 R4810K was sufficient. This inÂ vitro finding was further confirmed by the Tg animal model in hypoxia. RNF213 R4757K (R4810K ortholog) inhibited angiogenesis in mice that overexpressed RNF213 in ECs. However, none of the mice with upregulation of the WT in ECs, upregulation of R4757K in SMCs, or null Rnf213 inhibited angiogenesis. Taken together, these data indicate that RNF213 R4810K can inhibit angiogenesis under conditions of exposure to IFNs or hypoxia, whereas RNF213 WT can only inhibit angiogenesis in the IFN-signaling pathway. It should be addressed that the current study clearly demonstrated the primary role of ECs in angiogenesis. This finding demonstrated a sharp contrast, with an anticipation that SMCs plays a critical role in the development of vascular remodeling. Collectively, we successfully demonstrated substantial roles of RNF213 R4810K in the low-angiogenesis phenotype in response to environmental stimuli. However, the issue of whether known functional impairment (ie, inhibition of cellular proliferation<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> or mitotic abnormalities<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) associated with RNF213 R4810K is involved in reduced angiogenesis after hypoxia in EC-specific RNF213 R4757K Tg mice needs to be examined in the future.</p>
      <p>The current results suggest that carriers of RNF213 R4810K may be susceptible to cerebral hypoxia because of insufficient angiogenesis if inflammation and hypoxia simultaneously occur. These IFNs are induced by viral and bacterial infections and are upregulated in autoimmune patients, who are often complicated by encephalitis.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Our study may imply that IFNs initially play a major role and are causally associated with insufficient angiogenesis in infectious or autoimmune diseases with MMD, as observed in accumulated clinical cases of MMD.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p>
      <p>In the present study, we found that a mutation in the AAA<sup>+</sup> module toward stabilization of oligomers is responsible for a low-angiogenesis phenotype. We showed that the Walker B motif in the first AAA<sup>+</sup> module of RNF213 had an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis. In contrast, deletion of the first AAA<sup>+</sup> module did not have any discernible effects on angiogenesis. Intriguingly, both mutations resulted in loss of ATPase activity, but the WEQ mutation resulted in stabilization of oligomers, whereas deletion of AAA<sup>+</sup> did not result in oligomerization. If this is the case, RNF213 R4810K, which decreased angiogenic activity and resulted in loss of ATPase activity in our study, may stabilize oligomers once they are formed and thus impair angiogenesis, suggesting a dominant negative mechanism. Furthermore, absence of a discernible effect of upregulation of deletion of the first AAA<sup>+</sup> RNF213 on angiogenesis is in agreement with an observation in RNF213 null mice in which angiogenesis was not inhibited in the brain after exposure to hypoxia. Collectively, the current data provide a premature, but novel, insight into the mechanism of RNF213 R4810K mutation. AAA<sup>+</sup> is a class of proteins, most of which transduce phosphorus covalent bond energy of ATP into mechanical energy through conformational changes. This process is mediated by the chemical reactions of ATP binding and hydrolysis. We consider that R4810K may be trapped in the RNF213 oligomer state, thereby inhibiting conformational changes, similar to RNF213 WEQ. Rigorous 3D structure analysis is required with a focus on conformational interaction between R4810K and AAA modules.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the present data suggest that RNF213 R4810K carriers have lower angiogenic capacities, indicating that these carriers might be more susceptible to insults of cerebral hypoxia. The present study shows that IFNs are environmental factors. Importantly, lower angiogenic activity is causally linked with AAA<sup>+</sup> function of RNF213. Nevertheless, the pathological process bridging lowered angiogenesis and abnormal SMC proliferation (ie, moyamoya vessel formation or stenosis of arteries in the ring of Willis) remains unknown. This issue needs to be addressed in future studies. Studies determining the roles of RNF213 in remodeling and maintenance of the vascular system could provide comprehensive mechanisms of not only MMD, but also stenotic lesions in cerebral arteries.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Finally, a specific inhibitor of ATP binding to the Walker A motif in the first AAA<sup>+</sup> is a promising therapeutic candidate. Such a therapeutic tool could improve hypoxic tolerance of the central nervous system in R4810K carriers.</p>
