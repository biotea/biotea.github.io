      <abstract>
        <p>Loss of function of the enzyme Î²-hexosaminidase A (HexA) causes the lysosomal storage disorder TayâSachs disease (TSD). It has been proposed that mutations in the Î± chain of HexA can impair folding, enzyme assembly, and/or trafficking, yet there is surprisingly little known about the mechanisms of these potential routes of pathogenesis. We therefore investigated the biosynthesis and trafficking of TSD-associated HexA Î± mutants, seeking to identify relevant cellular quality control mechanisms. The Î± mutants E482K and G269S are defective in enzymatic activity, unprocessed by lysosomal proteases, and exhibit altered folding pathways compared with wild-type Î±. E482K is more severely misfolded than G269S, as observed by its aggregation and inability to associate with the HexA Î² chain. Importantly, both mutants are retrotranslocated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol and are degraded by the proteasome, indicating that they are cleared via ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Leveraging these discoveries, we observed that manipulating the cellular folding environment or ERAD pathways can alter the kinetics of mutant Î± degradation. Additionally, growth of patient fibroblasts at a permissive temperature or with chemical chaperones increases cellular Hex activity by improving mutant Î± folding. Therefore modulation of the ER quality control systems may be a potential therapeutic route for improving some forms of TSD.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a devastating class of more than 50 pathologies, with a combined frequency in the human population of â¼1:5000 births (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Poorthuis <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Vellodi, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Platt <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Their unifying feature is a defect in the function of the endosomeâlysosome system, which in many cases leads to the toxic accumulation of metabolites and cell death. A subset of LSDs, GM2 gangliosidoses, are a series of associated disorders resulting from insufficiency of active Î²-hexosaminidase A (HexA), the enzyme that processes GM2 ganglioside to GM3 ganglioside in the lysosome (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Mahuran, 1999</xref>). The loss or inactivation of HexA causes the toxic buildup of GM2, leading to cell death and disease (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Svennerholm, 1962</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The HexA enzyme is produced from the <italic>HEXA</italic> and <italic>HEXB</italic> genes, which encode the Î± and Î² subunits, respectively. These are 60% identical at the amino acid level and are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are glycosylated (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sonderfeld-Fresko and Proia, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Weitz and Proia, 1992</xref>), form intramolecular disulfide linkages (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Maier <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and dimerize. Because of the structural similarities between the chains, multiple isozymes can be formed via differential association: HexA (Î±Î²), HexS (Î±Î±), and HexB (Î²Î²) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Stirling, 1968</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Hou <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Although HexB is the most stable of these complexes, HexA is the only species capable of processing GM2 ganglioside (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lemieux <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Therefore it is hypothesized that the production of Î² is kept low to promote heterodimerization over Î² homodimerization (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Mahuran, 1991</xref>). In the Golgi apparatus, specific glycans are modified with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), allowing for the trafficking of Hex enzymes to lysosomes (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sonderfeld-Fresko and Proia, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Weitz and Proia, 1992</xref>). However, this recognition and transport is not entirely efficient, resulting in constitutive secretion both in vitro and in vivo (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hasilik and Neufeld, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Once in the lysosome, the Î± and Î² chains are proteolytically processed to their mature forms (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Little <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Mahuran <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hubbes <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sagherian <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). These cleavage events appear to be dispensable for activityâextracellular HexA is full length yet enzymatically active. In the lysosome, presentation of the GM2 ganglioside substrate from the bilayer to the active site of HexA additionally requires the adaptor protein GM2-Activator (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Loss of function in either subunit of HexA or its adaptor protein can lead to GM2 gangliosidosis. TayâSachs disease (TSD) is clinically defined by mutations in the <italic>HEXA</italic> gene, Sandhoff disease by mutations in the HEXB gene, and AB variant gangliosidosis by inactivating mutations in GM2-Activator (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Schepers <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Mahuran, 1999</xref>). Of these related disorders, TSD is the best characterized, with well over 100 known mutations identified in the <italic>HEXA</italic> gene (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Triggs-Raine <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; see also an online database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hexdb.mcgill.ca">www.hexdb.mcgill.ca</ext-link>). Depending on the mutations inherited, there may be no signs of disease, a late-onset and chronic form of the disease, or severe juvenile-onset disease causing death by the age of 4. Based on phenotypic information, along with activity assays of patients and healthy people, the currently accepted model posits a âcritical thresholdâ of â¼10% activity, below which TSD presents in some manner (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Conzelmann and Sandhoff, 1983</xref>). From a therapeutic point of view, this may allow for the rescue of certain disease-causing mutants, as attempted by recent clinical trials (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Clarke <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Osher <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Even with the identification of many disease-associated alleles, there are few options for TSD treatment and no cures. The lack of information about mutant HexA synthesis and trafficking during disease pathology, as opposed to its normal biosynthetic route, is likely a contributing factor to the poor availability of therapeutic avenues. Therefore we chose to study two important variants of <italic>HEXA</italic>, one that produces G269S Î± and one that produces E482K Î±.</p><p>G269S is the most commonly identified allele in patients with adult-onset TSD, making it a clear target for future treatments (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Navon and Proia, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Mahuran, 1993</xref>). On the other hand, the E482K mutant is a relatively rare variant, but a severe one that exhibits little residual activity and causes infantile forms of TSD (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Proia and Neufeld, 1982</xref>). Unlike very rare mutations that affect the active site of Î±, these mutations have been predicted to interfere with folding pathways (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Proia and Neufeld, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nakano <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Mahuran, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tropak <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ohno <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In vitro, G269S appears to lose activity at physiological temperatures (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Mahuran, 1993</xref>). Structurally, the sterically larger serine side chain in position 269 may displace local backbone conformation, disallowing proper folding and trafficking of the enzyme (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lemieux <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Computer modeling of the E482K mutation predicted that it has a much more drastic effect on protein conformation than G269S (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ohno <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), correlating with a previous report that E482K can form insoluble aggregates (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Proia and Neufeld, 1982</xref>). Additionally, phosphorylated E482K has not been observed, perhaps signifying that it cannot leave the ER (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Proia and Neufeld, 1982</xref>). The crystal structure of HexA confirms that E482 is a buried residue important for a salt bridge with an arginine residue (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lemieux <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The change in charge of this residue likely explains the massive conformational changes predicted to occur (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lemieux <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ohno <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In patients, it is clear that many Î± mutants such as G269S and E482K are properly synthesized but never reach the lysosome. Though it has been speculated that these mutants (and others) are degraded early in the secretory pathway, there has been little direct evidence to support these hypotheses (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mu <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In fact, mechanisms of protein turnover from the ER were uncovered well after much of the initial characterization of TSD mutations. We now have a deeper understanding of ER-associated degradation (ERAD), the processes by which terminally misfolded proteins in the ER are sensed, escorted to membrane complexes, dislocated to the cytosol, and degraded by the proteasome. Here we asked whether ERAD is indeed involved in the retention and disposal of mutant Î± in TSD and whether we could interfere with ER homeostasis to promote cellular activity in cell models of the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>E482K and G269S Î± mutants remain unprocessed and have impaired activities</title><p>For characterization of folding and trafficking of HexA, the human <italic>HEXA</italic> and <italic>HEXB</italic> genes were cloned into expression plasmids, with an N-terminal FLAG tag appended to the <italic>HEXA</italic> gene immediately after the ER-targeting signal sequence, and a C-terminal HA tag fused to <italic>HEXB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). It has been previously shown that small tags do not interfere with Hex activity, indicating that the FLAG and HA peptides would not significantly impact the proteins (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Yamada <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to recapitulate the disease-associated mutants of Î±, G269S and E482K.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Characterization of cloned <italic>HEXA</italic> and <italic>HEXB</italic> gene products.

(E) FLAG-HEXA or HEXB-HA was expressed for 24 h and analyzed by Western analysis in both reducing and nonreducing gels; anti-Î± and anti-Î² were used for detection, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="3813fig1"/></fig><p>We first studied the steady-state distribution of Î± in HEK293T cells. Immunoblotting whole-cell lysates with an anti-Î± antibody revealed that only wild-type (WT) Î± was proteolytically cleaved to the predicted mature species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hasilik and Neufeld, 1980</xref>). This processing was dependent on forward trafficking in the secretory pathway, since it was inhibited by brefeldin A treatment. Mature forms were not observed upon expression of either G269S or E482K, indicating that these variants either do not reach the lysosome or cannot be cleaved by the proper proteases. Additionally, the cloning strategy used for FLAG-HEXA allowed for the specific identification of ER species, using the anti-FLAG M1 antibody that only recognizes free N-terminal FLAG sequences (i.e., after cleavage of the signal sequence). This epitope is clearly lost upon proteolytic processing of WT Î± in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Expression of the HEXB-HA construct also yielded both immature and mature Î² species, and the appearance of the latter was sensitive to brefeldin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The heterogeneity in the molecular weights is due to glycosylation, as described previously (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sonderfeld-Fresko and Proia, 1989</xref>; unpublished data). Finally, the immature and mature species of both Î± and Î² collapsed into single species when lysates were resolved on nonreducing gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that disulfide bonds covalently link the mature species, even after proteolysis (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Schuette <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Therefore both FLAG-HEXA and HEXB-HA are expressed properly and undergo the expected biosynthesis in our cell system.</p><p>To measure the activity of each Î± construct, we monitored the fluorescence from the breakdown of 4-methylumbelliferone <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate (MUGS). Because of structural differences in the active sites of Î± and Î², coupled with the sulfate group and negative charge of this substrate, MUGS is specifically cleaved by the Î± subunit in HexA (Î±Î²) and HexS (Î±Î±) but not by HexB (Î²Î²) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mark <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lemieux <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Extracts of the HEK293T cell line tested here have basal activity toward MUGS, because they express endogenous Hex dimers, yet ectopic expression of WT Î± greatly enhanced this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). While expression of WT Î± increased intracellular activity approximately sevenfold, neither E482K nor G269S were detectably active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, as expected, the E482K and G269S mutations inhibit the formation of active HexA and HexS.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Activity and secretion of Î± mutants. (A, B) The indicated FLAG-HEXA constructs were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells for 48 h, lysed in a pH 4.2 lysis buffer, and subjected to the MUGS activity assay at 37Â°C, as described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>.

Increase in activity was normalized to the activity present in conditioned medium from untransfected cells. Values are plotted as averages of three experiments with SDs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="3813fig2"/></fig><p>Because the targeting of lysosomal enzymes via M6P receptors is imperfect, we asked whether each Î± subunit was secreted. Indeed, WT Î± was observed in the supernatant of cells after transient expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming previous reports (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hasilik and Neufeld, 1980</xref>). Surprisingly, G269S was also found in the conditioned medium, though to a much lesser extent than WT (â¼20%). No E482K was detected, indicating that it was completely retained intracellularly. The presence of G269S in the conditioned medium without detection of the mature species in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) implies that either G269S targeting to the lysosome is ineffective (e.g., poor recognition by GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, the first step in M6P tag generation; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tiede <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) or that some fraction of G269S reaches the lysosome but cannot be properly cleaved. Correlating with the secretion data, activity was enhanced in the medium of cells expressing G269S by approximately fourfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This level of activity is lower than would be predicted by the band intensities in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, indicating that, even though G269S has extracellular activity, its specific activity may be lower than the WT enzyme at physiological temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical and cell biological differences among Î± mutants</title><p>Because the lysosomal processing, secretion, and activity of E482K and G269S Î± were impaired, we pursued the hypothesis that they are misfolded.

On immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates, the WT Î± yielded one major band and two minor, slower mobility species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, black arrows). WT Î± is known to contain three disulfide bonds, one of which retains the propeptide to the main chain (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hubbes <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mark <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lemieux <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>); it is therefore possible that these species represent folding intermediates with distinct electrophoretic mobilities. Alternatively, these bands may represent phosphorylated species in the Golgi. Neither E482K nor G269S displayed such minor forms under nonreducing conditions. Instead, E482K was significantly more enriched at the top of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, white arrowhead), correlating with its relative insolubility in NP-40 and probable aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The G269S protein ran as a major monomer species and a band corresponding to the size of a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, black arrowhead). While the precise nature of these unique redox species remains to be identified, the data suggest that the oxidative folding of E482K and G269S differs from that of WT Î±.</p><p>Third, limited trypsin proteolysis of Î± chains in cell lysates revealed that, while WT and G269S Î± were equally sensitive to trypsin, E482K was significantly more resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, C and D</xref>). We conclude that the E482K mutation causes a change in protein conformation (e.g., aggregation), resulting in lowered trypsin accessibility.</p><p>Fourth, we probed the ability of Î± to bind to Î², which reports on the fold of the Î± dimerization surface (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Maier <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mark <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Coimmunoprecipitations (co-IP) confirmed that while WT and G269S were able to associate with endogenous Î², E482K was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Considering that the E482K mutation is not proximal to the dimerization domain (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ohno <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), these results strongly suggest that the mutation causes large-scale alterations to the protein, which may underlie its lack of lysosomal targeting, secretion, and activity.</p><p>On the basis of these four experimental approaches, we conclude that the E482K mutation causes global misfolding of Î± and that the G269S mutation has a subtler effect that appears to alter at least its oxidative folding pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Î± Mutants are bona fide ERAD substrates</title><p>The cellular location of the Î±âÎ² dimerization has been historically unclear, but we found that WT Î± associated with Î², even in cells pretreated with brefeldin A, which disrupts traffic to the Golgi complex, or bafilomycin A1, which disrupts acidic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus Î±âÎ² dimerization occurs early in the biosynthesis of HexA, and we speculate that dimerization is likely a prerequisite for HexA to leave the ER, as has been observed with many other multisubunit proteins. Assembly in the ER is also consistent with the secretion of WT and G269S, but not E482K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), since only WT and G269S are competent to bind Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Because the ER plays an important role in quality control of secretory pathway proteins, and because E482K and G269S are not properly trafficked, we sought to identify ER-resident components that may be important for the regulation of HexA and took a targeted co-IP approach to determine which common ER factors interact with Î± and its mutants (Supplemental Figure 1). The Hsp70 master chaperone BiP and two of its cofactors, GRP170 and PDIA6, associated with all three forms of Î±. Notably, WT Î± associated less well with BiP and its cofactors, implying that either WT Î± resides in the ER for less time than E482K and G269S or that the mutant Î± subunits require more rounds of chaperone assistance. The association of Î± with the BiP machinery was selective, since two of the most abundant lumenal chaperones, GRP94 and PDI, were not found in the complex.</p><p>In addition to BiP, two components of the ERAD machinery associated with Î±âOS-9 and SEL1L (Supplemental Figure 1). OS-9 is an ER-resident lectin that functions in the recognition of terminally misfolded proteins and their subsequent escort (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Christianson <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hosokawa <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) to membrane-bound retrotranslocons, sites at which ERAD substrates are dislocated to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. Indeed, Î± mutants also associated with SEL1L, a key scaffold of these retrotranslocon complexes (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Mueller <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Similar to its association with BiP, WT Î± associated less well than E482K and G269S with both OS-9 and SEL1L. This was most clear in the case of SEL1L, where WT Î± bound poorly, if at all, to the retrotranslocon scaffold, whereas E482K and G269S bound SEL1L as clearly as the well-studied ERAD substrate NHK (Supplemental Figure 1B). That these interactions were detected at all suggested that some conformers of Î± were recognized by the ERAD machinery.</p><p>The evidence for a degradation pathway for mutant Î± was significant: 1) Î± mutants showed little/no secretion, lysosomal processing, or activity; 2) E482K, and to a lesser extent G269S, showed evidence for altered conformation; and 3) mutant forms of Î± were found in complex with the ERAD factors OS-9 and SEL1L. We hypothesized that mutant Î± chains were triaged via ERAD and therefore used pulse-chase analysis to monitor the ER forms of WT, E482K, and G269S Î±. In addition to measuring their basal, constitutive turnover (half-lives of ER species: 2.9 h for WT, 2.5 h for E482K, 4.1 h for G269S), we also quantified turnover in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and in cells expressing a dominant-negative version of Hrd1 (Hrd1<sub>C294A</sub>), an E3 ubiquitin ligase and key component of the mammalian retrotranslocon (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bernasconi <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Both treatment with MG-132 and expression of Hrd1<sub>C294A</sub> stabilized all Î± proteins over the indicated chase times. This included even the WT protein, although the stabilization was most significant for the E482K mutant, the most severely misfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, A, C, and E</xref>; quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, B, D, and F</xref>). However, the turnover measured in these experiments is a combination of protein degradation and exit from the ER, and because MG-132 can induce ER stress and cause off-target cellular responses, we also examined whether inhibition of proteasomes affected Î± secretion coordinately. Indeed, the persistence of intracellular WT Î± was explained by inhibition of its secretion, indicating that the stress of proteasomal inhibition impacts the forward trafficking of WT Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, A and B</xref>). E482K, on the other hand, was not secreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with our observations at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore the pulse-chase results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, C and D</xref>) represent the true sensitivity of intracellular E482K to proteasomal degradation. Finally, although a small fraction of G269S is secreted, MG-132 stabilization of G269S is not due to an alteration in the secreted pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, D and E</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate ER pools of E482K and G269S are stabilized by proteasomal inhibition, implicating ERAD as their mechanism of degradation. The sensitivity of WT Î± to MG-132 stems from a defect in secretion, not intracellular turnover.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4:</label><caption><p>WT and mutant Î± are sensitive to impairment of ERAD.

If true, this would be the most compelling argument for ER quality control, since dislocation is one of the most proximal activities of ERAD. To ask whether the Hex proteins were exposed to the cytosol for degradation, we adapted an elegant assay developed by Burrone and colleagues (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Petris <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Vecchi <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In this retrotranslocation assay, an ER protein of interest is first designed with a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) tag. The construct is then coexpressed with a cytosolic enzyme BirA, which has the ability to conjugate biotin to the BAP tag. Because this can occur only when both proteins are present in the same compartment, an ER-resident/secretory protein must be first retrotranslocated to the cytosol to be biotinylated (scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6:</label><caption><p>Î± mutants, but not WT Î±, are retrotranslocated to the cytosol.

Upon treatment of cells with biotin, BirA can attach a biotin molecule to the BAP tag, but only when the protein of interest is retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytosol. This modification is detected using streptavidin to retard gel mobility of biotinylated molecules. Glycans on substrates present in the cytosol can be removed by PNGase, an activity that is inhibited by Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Misaghi <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).

For the last 4 h of treatment, cells were also treated with DMSO, Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, MG-132, or MG-132 + Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, as indicated (Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK at 30 Î¼M; MG-132 at 20 Î¼M).

For detection of biotinylated molecules, streptavidin was incubated with lysate samples before SDSâPAGE; this allowed for the identification of streptavidin-shifted bands by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). The well-folded WT Î±1AT is very efficiently secreted (unpublished data) yet shows some biotinylation, indicating that the assay does have a small background of mistargeted substrate or biotinylation during cell death. However, upon MG-132 treatment, size-shifted bands of the ERAD substrate NHK, but not WT Î±1AT, were detected below the main species, and these bands were entirely sensitive to streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). They represent cytosolic, deglycosylated forms of NHK, since treatment with the cytosolic PNGase inhibitor, Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, inhibits their formation.</p><p>For testing whether Î± mutants were also retrotranslocated, BAP-tagged forms of WT and mutant HEXA constructs were created and coexpressed with BirA in HEK293T cells. Deglycosylated forms of both E482K and G269S were clearly formed upon MG-132 treatment and were sensitive to the presence of Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, these species were not observed upon WT Î± expression. Taken together, these results indicate that both the E482K and G269S Î± mutants give rise to cytosolic, glycosylated species (i.e., ER-derived), providing significant evidence for ERAD.</p><p>One potential pitfall of these studies is that overexpression of FLAG-tagged Î± may affect the stoichiometry of the Î±Î² complex formation, leading to enhanced degradation of the excess subunit. Theoretically, this is not a significant concern, since Î±Î± homodimers can form readily and do not absolutely require Î² for trafficking. Additionally, we showed that E482K Î± does not associate with Î², removing the concern of stoichiometric disparity for this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, we asked whether coexpression of G269S Î± with Î² might improve lysosomal processing, a readout for proper HexA trafficking. No processed G269S was detected, even with increased coexpression of Î² (Supplemental Figure 2A). Nor did Î² expression significantly dampen G269S retrotranslocation or sensitivity to MG-132 (Supplemental Figure 2B). Therefore we conclude that while G269S can associate with Î², enhanced levels of Î² do not rescue its misfolding and degradation.</p></sec><sec><title>Manipulations of cellular quality control prevent Î±-chain disposal and increase Hex activity</title><p>We next asked whether we could manipulate ER quality control to interfere with the recognition and degradation of Î± mutants. Ideally, the modulation of ER chaperones or degradation factors would either enhance folding or inhibit turnover of mutant Î±. If so, valuable insights would be gained into targets that could potentially rescue HexA activity in patients.</p><p>Glycosylated ERAD substrates are known to undergo trimming of their N-linked glycans by slow-acting mannosidases in the ER lumen, thought to be a âtimerâ mechanism by which terminally malfolded proteins are initially recognized (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).

Kifunensine was clearly active, as observed by the loss of mannose-trimmed molecules of the ERAD substrate NHK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). By pulse-chase analysis, incubation with kifunensine impaired the degradation of both E482K and G269S Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Therefore blocking ERAD before retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation also delays mutant Î± clearance.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7:</label><caption><p>Pharmacological inhibition of ERAD stabilizes Î± mutants but does not restore enzymatic activity.

Coordinately, although kifunensine increased Hex activity secreted from untransfected cells, it provided no further significant increase in activity for any of the HEXA constructs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7, C and D</xref>). On the other hand, treatment of E482K-expressing cells with kifunensine did increase the E482K/Î² interaction, likely due to its longer ER residency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>) but potentially because of a better-folded dimerization domain.</p><p>Because our data suggested that E482K Î± is nearly completely degraded via ERAD, we asked whether overexpression of a relevant molecular chaperone might prevent this outcome.

Because in vitro data suggested that the G269S mutation interferes with protein stability at physiological temperatures (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Mahuran, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tropak <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), we compared G269S fibroblasts grown at 32 and 37Â°C. Fibroblasts grown at the lower temperature produced more active G269S, as observed by the specific activity of MUGS cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>, roughly increasing G269S from â¼7 to â¼10% of WT activity). Thus we confirmed the temperature sensitivity of G269S and also appear to have improved its folding in cell culture.</p><p>Another method to enhance productive folding of cellular proteins is with chemical chaperones, small molecules that can help stabilize the folding of metastable proteins (reviewed in <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rajan <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Thus far, the only chemical chaperones tested on TSD cells/models have been specific inhibitors of HexA (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tropak <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Maegawa <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), which can act to stabilize intermediates but have their own disadvantages. Instead of inhibitors, we examined enhancement of folding by culturing G269S patient fibroblasts with general chemical chaperones, measuring the resulting intracellular Hex activity after 72 h. While trehalose and proline treatment did not alter enzymatic activity significantly, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) treatment and, even more so, glutamic acid increased endogenous Hex activity in the patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>). The fact that up-regulation of G269S does not itself increase cellular activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) supports the conclusion that these chemical chaperones do not simply alter expression levels of Î± but may instead promote the folding and activity of G269S.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Many common mutations in the <italic>HEXA</italic> gene are thought to impair folding of the Î± chain of HexA and thereby decrease the activity of the enzyme to pathological levels. However, many past studies did not distinguish between folding defects per se and defects in the cellular handling of HexA, a distinction with important implications for potential therapies. In the work described here, we analyzed two <italic>HEXA</italic> mutations yielding the infantile-onset E482K and the adult-onset G269S Î±-chain mutants and showed that they are defective in folding in the cell and are subjected to disposal by the ERAD quality control system.</p><p>Our biochemical and cell biological evidence suggests that the E482K Î± chain is severely misfolded, forming inactive, trypsin-resistant aggregates in cells, thus confirming a previous report that observed detergent-dependent solubilization (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Proia and Neufeld, 1982</xref>). E482K is unable to associate with the Î² subunit and is not observed to be secreted from cells. The G269S mutant, on the other hand, is more similar in conformation to the WT Î± chain, although it differs in at least its oxidative folding, resulting in a loss of activity. G269S is competent to heterodimerize with Î² and â¼10â20% is secreted. These findings suggest that clinical severity is proportional to the degree of misfolding, as would be predicted.</p><p>We and others have speculated that misfolded TSD-associated mutants would be turned over by ERAD, since this is a dominant pathway in the quality control of proteins in the secretory pathway. However, because much work on the biosynthesis, assembly, and trafficking of HexA was conducted before the characterization of ERAD, there is little direct evidence in the literature to support this hypothesis. Slight gains in activity of G269S fibroblasts had been observed upon treatment with the p97 inhibitor eeyarestatin I, though this treatment broadly affected the expression of ER chaperones and the activation of the unfolded protein response, making the interpretation difficult (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mu <italic>etÂ al.</italic> (2008</xref>) showed that MG-132 had a moderately beneficial effect on the Hex activity of G269S patient fibroblasts, but this was measured only after several days of treatment during which cells can and do adapt to the chronic stress.</p><p>Armed with better tools and a more developed understanding of the ERAD pathways, we examined whether E482K and G269S were bona fide ERAD substrates. Indeed, E482K Î± is nearly completely stabilized by proteasome inhibition or expression of the dominant negative C294A mutant of the ERAD E3 ligase Hrd1. Because E482K is not secreted or proteolytically cleaved, this confirms that it is nearly completely triaged through ERAD. On the other hand, a small fraction of G269S Î± does get secreted; however, â¼20% of synthesized G269S is cleared via ERAD.</p><p>We further demonstrated ERAD as the mode of Î± degradation by monitoring ER-to-cytosol retrotranslocation, a more proximal readout than proteasomal degradation. Relying on cytosolic BirA-mediated biotinylation, we found that glycosylated (i.e., ER-derived) forms of both E482K and G269S gained access to the cytosol and furthermore were deglycosylated by cytosolic PNGase. This active process was inhibited by the presence of Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, an inhibitor of PNGase, providing strong evidence of retrotranslocation.</p><p>Because ERAD is the pathway for destruction of disease-associated Î± mutants, could interference in the recognition of these mutants be a useful strategy in preventing or delaying disease onset? Similar reasoning showed promise in other LSD models, such as Gaucher disease (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Sawkar <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Segatori, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In this work, we provide several proofs of principle that manipulation of folding and quality control may also be useful in TSD. Notably, we show that 1) coexpression of CRT delays E482K Î± from being identified and escorted to ERAD and that this depends on the activity of CRT; 2) an inhibitor of mannosidase I, kifunensine, delays clearance of both E482K and G269S by impairing early glycan trimming; and 3) patient fibroblasts expressing endogenous levels of G269S can show improved specific activity upon treatments with chemical chaperones or by growth at a permissive temperature. Though the effects of each treatment are modest, optimization and combination of the treatments, as was done for Gaucher disease (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Sawkar <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), may well prove synergistic.</p><p>As diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>, we interpret the experimental data to show that Î± is cotranslationally N-glycosylated as it enters the ER, utilizing the calreticulin/calnexin cycle for rounds of attempted folding. Association with Î² also occurs in the ER and relies on an appropriately folded dimerization interface. Well-folded dimers (either Î±Î² or Î±Î±) are competent to exit the ER and traffic to the Golgi for M6P modification and lysosomal sorting or secretion. On the other hand, mutations in Î± can impact oxidative-folding pathways and overall conformation. These malfolded molecules are recognized by ERAD sensors such as OS-9, a recognition that is likely enhanced by mannose trimming of N-linked glycans. Retrotranslocation of the Î± mutants occurs via the Hrd1/SEL1L machinery, and cytosolic PNGase removes the cytosol-exposed glycans before proteasomal degradation.</p><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>FIGURE 10:</label><caption><p>Model for cell pathology in TayâSachs disease. Our data support a model whereby Î± is translocated into the ER, cotranslationally glycosylated, and folded in the calreticulin/calnexin cycle. If properly folded, Î± and Î² dimerize in the ER lumen and are exported to the Golgi, where they receive M6P signals to reach lysosomes. If ER folding of Î± is stalled, for example, in the disease-related mutations G269S and E482K, glycan trimming (perhaps in combination with OS-9 association) can initiate disposal. Molecules of Î± are brought to the retrotranslocon, where they use at least SEL1L and Hrd1 to access the cytosol. During this process, glycans are removed by cytosolic PNGase. The 26S proteasome is the site of protein destruction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="3813fig10"/></fig><p>Because none of the antibodies we tested was able to recognize immature Î± in patient fibroblasts, we could not assess ERAD of endogenous Î±. While it is possible that the imbalance between Î± and Î² in our overexpression system may impact the propensity to drive Î± to ERAD, we show 1) E482K cannot associate with Î² and therefore is not subject to stoichiometric concerns; and 2) G269S targeting, processing, and retrotranslocation are insensitive to coexpression of Î². Additionally, since it is thought that the production of Î² chains is rate limiting to enforce Î±Î² dimers over Î²Î² production, having an excess of Î± subunits may actually be the biological norm. Ultimately, definitive answers will require examining the turnover of endogenous protein in TSD patient cells and healthy controls. New antibodies or the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system will enable these studies.</p><p>Clearly, each of the more than 100 <italic>HEXA</italic> mutations will alter the folding of the Î± chain in a unique manner. For example, compared with G269S, E482K has a much more dramatic effect on the conformation and trafficking of Î±. Because E482K is very likely to be globally misfolded, and even aggregation prone, it is unlikely that patients with such a mutation will be helped by buttressing folding pathways or impairing ERAD. Data from the G269S patient fibroblasts, however, suggest that improvement to folding may assist in reaching the â¼10% activity threshold to prevent disease. Interestingly, our pulse-chase data indicate that â¼40% of G269S molecules are unaccounted for, even in the presence of MG-132. Further confirmation will be required, but we speculate that a fraction of G269S in fact reaches the lysosome but is degraded there because it is less stable than WT Î±. Therefore ERAD is not the only source of cellular clearance and likely depends on the type of mutation and conformational outcomes.</p><p>Thus far, TSD therapies have not yet provided patients with useful treatment options. Substrate reduction therapyâthe attenuation of GM2 ganglioside productionâwas unable to prevent neurodegeneration in patients with TSD (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bembi <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and may even impact cells undesirably by broadly affecting cell metabolism (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ledeen and Wu, 2010</xref>). Gene therapies to restore WT enzymes to patients with LSDs is predicted to essentially cure these diseases, but clearly the types of vectors, timing, and kinetics of enzyme production will require extensive optimization (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kyrkanides <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Finally, the use of small molecular inhibitors of HexA has been previously shown to stabilize folding intermediates and increase proper cellular trafficking of Î± mutants. However, because of the duality of their functions (stabilization of folding vs. inhibition of activity), dosing will be critical to avoid unwanted side effects (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Clarke <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The data presented in this paper support the idea that manipulating ERAD pathways and improving protein folding may be useful additions to the tools needed to treat some types of TSD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals and antibodies</title><p>The following reagents were used: kifunensine and 4-methylumÂ­belliferyl-6-sulfo-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-Î²-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminide (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA); bafilomycin A1, MG-132, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), biotin, streptavidin, brefeldin A, proline, glutamic acid, TMAO, and trehalose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO); Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK (Abcam, Cambridge, England).
