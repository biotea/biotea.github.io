      <abstract>
        <p id="P3">Few monogenic causes for severe manifestations of common allergic diseases have been identified. Via next generation sequencing on a cohort of patients with severe atopic dermatitis, some with comorbid infections, we found 8 individuals from 4 families with novel heterozygous mutations in CARD11, a scaffolding protein involved in lymphocyte receptor signaling. Disease improved over time in most patients. Transfection of mutant expression constructs into T cell lines demonstrated both loss of function and dominant interfering activity upon antigen receptor-induced NF-ÎºB and mTORC1 activation. Patient T-cells had similar defects, as well as diminished IFN-Î³ cytokine production. The mTORC1 and IFN-Î³ production defects could be partially rescued by supplementing with glutamine, which requires CARD11 for import into T cells. Our findings indicate a single hypomorphic gene mutation in CARD11 can cause potentially correctable cellular defects that lead to atopic dermatitis.</p>

      <p id="P4">Monogenic causes for immune disorders have provided critical insights into the role of specific immune pathways in the pathogenesis of common diseases, including atopy and allergic diseases. In the case of some allergic disorders involving atopic dermatitis and elevated IgE coupled with infection, it may be difficult to separate impairment of host defense from the role of the defined genetic lesion in contributing to allergic disease. Patients with severe atopic disease and elevated serum IgE levels have now been linked to mutations in immune-mediated host defense pathways, including DOCK8, STAT3 or PGM3 <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In some patients with severe atopic dermatitis, elevated IgE and eosinophilia, there is little reason to suspect an immune deficiency, as infections beyond the skin are less common, and they lack comorbidities seen with the genetically defined disorders. Single gene mutations in common allergic disease without overt syndromic features have been less common<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, but are being increasingly described. One example is found in a single gain of function (GOF) mutation in <italic>IL4RA</italic> identified initially in a few severely atopic patients<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, which is a common risk allele in allergic disease<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Another example is in loss of function (LOF) <italic>IFNGR1</italic> mutations leading to atopic dermatitis with eczema herpeticum, without additional immune phenotypes<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Other LOF mutations in cytokine signaling components such as STAT3 and STAT5b <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> can also contribute to atopic phenotypes, but with substantial multisystem comorbidity, seen also in putative antigen receptor signaling gene mutations such as <italic>WASP</italic>, <italic>DOCK8</italic><sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and <italic>MALT1</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Diminished antigen-driven TCR signaling can predispose to Th2 phenotypes in a variety of in vivo and in vitro settings<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and mouse models have shown that hypomorphic mutations in <italic>ZAP70</italic><sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and <italic>CARD11</italic><sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> can also lead to severe atopy.</p>

        <title>Heterozygous <italic>CARD11</italic> mutations found in 4 families with severe atopic dermatitis</title>
        <p id="P7">Next generation sequencing was performed on a series of patients with recalcitrant, severe atopic disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1AâC</xref>). In four of these patients, novel, heterozygous <italic>CARD11</italic> mutations were detected. These included 3 distinct missense mutations (p.Glu57Asp (E57D), p.Leu194Pro (L194)) p.Arg975Trp (R975W)) and one in-frame, 14aa insertion (p.Met183_Lys196; herein referred to as dup183_196) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The PolyPhen values are 1 for all three missense mutations and the CADD scores are 21.2, 19.5, and 17.8, respectively. They are predicted to be deleterious. A parent and/or other relatives in 2 out of the 4 patients had a history of atopic dermatitis that waned in severity over time; these relatives were confirmed as carriers of the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Patient B-II.2, the mother of patient B-I, was unaffected but reported eczema when younger. Patients A-I and C-I had histories of pneumonia early in life, and C-II.1 had transient hypogammaglobulinemia of childhood. Patients A-I C-I, D-I, D-II.1 and D-II.2 had multiple episodes of respiratory distress in early childhood, which were treated as pneumonia. Patients A-I and C-I also were diagnosed with asthma. Oral steroids were required to resolve all asthmatic episodes for patient A-I, whose CT imaging showed normal lungs, raising the likelihood that his respiratory symptoms may not have been of infectious etiology. The infectious history of family D (dup183_196) includes abscesses, bacteremia and pulmonary infections. Affected members of family D had some other unique features which may or may not have been related to their primary genetic diagnosis, including a prominent forehead and broad nasal base from birth. Unlike STAT3LOF patients, there was no characteristic facial asymmetry or coarseness, and the birth onset differs as well (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Patient C-I has history of stroke and ulcerative colitis. C-II.1, his father, who also carries the E57D variant, has history of lymphoma. Cancer and stroke were not otherwise reported. Two of the seven patients had B cell lymphopenia with no decrease in other lymphocyte lineages; 3/7 patients had decreased IgM with no decrease in IgG and normal to elevated IgA in most recent testing. Elevated IgE (5/7) and eosinophilia (6/7) were prominent, and those without had more significant atopic phenotypes when younger without documentation of these laboratory values at that time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <title><italic>CARD11</italic> mutations are hypomorphic and interfere with NF-ÎºB and mTORC1 activation</title>
        <p id="P8">The four heterozygous mutations detected in the patients are in markedly different domains of the CARD11 protein (accession code Q9BXL7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). L194P and dup183_196 are found in the coiled coil (CC) domain. E57D is in the N-terminal CARD domain, while R975W is in the C-terminal GUK domain. None are found in public polymorphism databases (e.g. ExAC). Interestingly, Goodnow and colleagues noted elevated IgE levels and severe eczema in the <italic>unmodulated</italic> (UNM) mouse strain harboring an ENU mutagenesis-induced, homozygous Card11 mutation in the CC domain (p.Leu298Gln), raising the possibility that the patientsâ <italic>CARD11</italic> mutations might lead to hypomorphic activity. However, UNM +/â mice had no atopic phenotype, and the heterozygous parental carriers of patients with CARD11-associated SCID were reported as clinically asymptomatic<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and did not have a history of atopy (A. Kuzolik &amp; P. Stepensky, personal communication), suggesting that haploinsufficiency was not a likely explanation for the patientsâ presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P9">Two principal signaling pathways in which CARD11 participates are NF-ÎºB <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and, as identified more recently, mTORC1 <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We first assessed the effect of the four CARD11 mutations on NF-ÎºB activation by transfecting WT and mutant CARD11 expression constructs into a CARD11-deficient Jurkat T cell line (JPM50.6) expressing a NF-ÎºB-driven GFP reporter. As shown previously, the GOF mutant E134G, described in a family with BENTA disease, induced constitutive GFP expression in the absence of antigen receptor (AgR) ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. When compared to WT, all four <italic>CARD11</italic> mutants induced little NF-ÎºB activation upon CD3/CD28 stimulation compared to WT, confirming loss of function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2AâB</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Furthermore, co-transfection of each mutant construct disrupted the ability of WT CARD11 to activate NF-ÎºB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2CâE</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting dominant interference; the R975W mutant was least disruptive. Importantly, disruption of WT CARD11-induced NF-ÎºB activation was not observed in co-transfections with empty vector (EV), E134G, or Q945X, a homozygous, functionally ânullâ nonsense mutant described in an autosomal recessive SCID patient born to healthy, heterozygous parents <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig 1CâH</xref>). Similar results were obtained upon transfection of normal Jurkat T cells expressing endogenous WT CARD11, as measured by an NF-ÎºB-dependent luciferase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2GâH</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1I</xref>). All mutants were comparably expressed in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F,H,L</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P10">Next, we examined mTORC1 activity via measurement of the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, and found that all 4 hypomorphic CARD11 mutants resulted in significantly decreased mTORC1 activity at baseline (unstimulated) and upon CD3/CD28 stimulation in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2IâJ</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1J</xref>). Similar attenuation of phospho-S6 signaling was noted for each mutant relative to both ectopic WT CARD11 and empty vector (EV) transfected cells, suggesting interference with endogenous WT CARD11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1JâK</xref>). Q945X expression had little effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1L</xref>). Taken together, these findings show that each CARD11 mutant was hypomorphic and reduced WT CARD11 activity in a heterozygous context, as illustrated by decreased downstream activation of both NF-ÎºB and mTORC1.</p>
        <p id="P11">Defective NF-ÎºB activation likely results from impaired CBM complex assembly, as we noted significantly less association of CARD11 LOF mutants with BCL10 and MALT1 in JPM50.6 co-immunoprecipitations (IPs) following PMA/ionomycin stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In fact, we recovered less CARD11 in BCL10 co-IPs from WT Jurkat cells transfected with CARD11 E57D, suggesting assembly of the endogenous CBM complex was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with dominant interference, MALT1 protease activity was also diminished in Jurkat T cells in the presence of CARD11 LOF mutants, as measured by cleavage of the MALT1 substrate CYLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3CâD</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>

        <title>Primary T-cells from <italic>CARD11</italic>mut patients display decreased activation responses, Th1/Th17 cytokine production and proliferation</title>
        <p id="P12">We next investigated CARD11-dependent signaling in primary patient T cells. PMA stimulation of patient lymphocytes revealed marked impairment of NF-ÎºB activation, based on reduced p65 phosphorylation and IÎºB degradation in T cells from families A, B and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similarly, mTORC1 activity (indicated by p-S6) was also attenuated in stimulated patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), while S473 AKT phosphorylation (a readout of mTORC2) was normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Reduced p38 activity was also noted in some patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), whereas robust ERK activity was comparable in all patients and controls, consistent with normal ERK activity noted in the UNM mice<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Patient B-I, who harbors the R975W mutation which had the least NF-ÎºB inhibitory activity, and who had the fewest comorbidities beyond atopy within this cohort, had recently been treated with corticosteroids and methotrexate when blood was drawn, potentially complicating the assessment of T cell phenotype and function. Of note, milder NF-ÎºB and mTORC1 signaling defects could also be detected in CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells from certain patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). Overall B-cell development was generally unaffected in these patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3BâC</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P13">We also observed poor upregulation of key cell surface markers such as CD69, CD25 and CD98 after overnight anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, particularly for Patient A-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Both PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <bold><italic>left panel</italic></bold>) and sorted naÃ¯ve T-cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>) from patient A-I showed decreased short-term proliferation upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation. PBMC from patient B-II.2 also showed mildly decreased blastogenesis upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4<italic>B</italic></xref>, <bold><italic>middle panel</italic></bold>), and patients D-I, D-II.1 and D-II.2 showed a moderate defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4<italic>B</italic></xref>, <bold><italic>right panel</italic></bold>). These data indicated that the activation and proliferation of <italic>CARD11</italic>mut patient T cells were variably impaired, consistent with defective activation of NF-ÎºB and mTORC1.</p>
        <p id="P14">Further flow cytometric phenotyping of patient PBMC showed variability in CD45RA<sup>â</sup> memory T cells and circulating CXCR5<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>hi</sup> T follicular helper (cTFH) cells in families AâC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Direct ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>) and 5 day culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4C</xref>) of patient T cells showed impaired Th1, normal Th17 and elevated Th2 cytokine production within the CD45RO<sup>+</sup> compartment, mirroring the phenotype of both UNM mice and, with the exception of the IL-17 production, both mTORC1 and ASCT2 KO mice <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.

        <title><italic>CARD11</italic> mutations result in poor upregulation of glutamine transporter ASCT2; mTORC1 activation cellular proliferation, and interferon gamma production improves with glutamine supplementation</title>
        <p id="P15">CARD11 was recently shown to be critical for mTORC1 activation<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, at least in part by facilitating TCR-induced upregulation and/or activation of ASCT2, an essential glutamine transporter required for extracellular glutamine import during cellular activation<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Similar to CARD11-deficient murine T cells, we observed reduced ASCT2 upregulation following TCR activation of <italic>CARD11</italic>mut patient T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data</xref>). Mice lacking ASCT2 also display mTORC1 activation defects, impaired Th1 differentiation and a Th2-skewed phenotype<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. However, the addition of exogenous glutamine could rescue mTORC1 signaling and reverse Th1 defects<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Supplementing culture medium with exogenous glutamine boosted mTORC1 activation (phospho-S6) in Patient A-I T cells, particularly in CD45RA<sup>+</sup> naÃ¯ve T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6AâB</xref>), without affecting NF-ÎºB or ERK phosphorylation (data not shown). We then cultured naÃ¯ve patient A-I T-cells in the presence of supplemented glutamine (3mM) under a variety of stimulation conditions. We found that the combined addition of cytokines capable of activating NF-ÎºB (IL-1Î² and TNF) and STAT3 (IL-6) partially rescued defects in proliferation and CD98 induction, but only with exogenous glutamine supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6CâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). While these conditions are not ideal for measuring biases for cell intrinsic Th differentiation, we did find that divided cells were more likely to produce IFNÎ³ upon glutamine supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P16">Here we show that different heterozygous hypomorphic mutations in <italic>CARD11</italic> can lead to severe atopic disease in humans, associated with weaker, Th2-skewed T cell responses. These patients mostly lack the non-immunologic features seen in <italic>PGM3, STAT3</italic> and <italic>DOCK8</italic> deficiencies, but share features of severe atopic dermatitis often with elevated serum IgE levels and peripheral blood eosinophilia. A similar atopic disease phenotype in UNM mice homozygous for a hypomorphic mutation provides strong evidence for the association of hypomorphic <italic>CARD11</italic> activity and atopy<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, in contrast to the UNM mouse, our results demonstrate that the four unique <italic>CARD11</italic> LOF mutations found in our patient cohort can dominantly interfere with WT CARD11 signaling, providing an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. In addition to identifying a new cause of an inherited syndrome associated with atopic dermatitis, peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated IgE, these findings raise the possibility that DN <italic>CARD11</italic> mutations could potentially be a common cause of severe allergy in the absence of syndromic features. Heterozygous <italic>CARD11</italic> mutations should therefore be considered in genetic testing of families with an autosomal dominant inheritance of a history of significant atopic dermatitisâcurrent or remote-- elevated IgE and eosinophilia, independent of other comorbidities.</p>
      <p id="P17">The scaffold function of CARD11 in lymphocytes is normally tightly regulated, ensuring CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex formation and downstream signaling is only triggered after antigen receptor-dependent phosphorylation of the inhibitory linker domain <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>â<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Two of the patient mutations were located in the CC domain, a demonstrated hotspot for both GOF and LOF mutations that likely perturb intramolecular regulation via the linker, thereby enhancing or debilitating self-oligomerization of CARD11 required for signalosome assembly, respectively<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Likewise, the E57D mutation found in the CARD domain likely directly disrupts interaction with BCL10, a key initiating event in CBM signaling. The importance of CARD and CC domain protein interactions for nucleating the larger CBM signalosome likely explains the substantial reduction in CBM complex formation and NF-ÎºB activation observed in transfected cells. On the other hand, the unusual MAGUK domain mutation R975W may interfere with higher order, intermolecular âclusteringâ of activated CARD11 molecules via SH3-GUK interactions<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, explaining a weaker dominant negative effect on NF-ÎºB stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Indeed, a lesser NF-ÎºB defect associated with this specific GUK-domain mutation may help explain the milder infectious disease history and cellular phenotypes observed in Family B. In contrast, the LOF/DN activity we observed in relation to mTORC1 signaling was comparable for all four CARD11 mutants in transfection studies, suggesting more discrete roles for the NF-ÎºB and mTORC1 pathways in preventing infection and atopy, respectively.</p>
      <p id="P18">It remains unclear which CARD11 domains might be required for direct interaction and/or transcriptional regulation of ASCT2, the glutamine transporter connecting AgR engagement with mTORC1 activation <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Attenuated p38 signaling in some CARD11mut patients was also surprising, as CARD11 has not been specifically implicated in driving this MAPK pathway. Given that the MAGUK protein DLGH1 governs the TCR-driven âalternative p38 pathwayâ<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, perhaps these CARD11 mutants interfere with related MAGUK family scaffold proteins in as yet undefined ways.</p>
      <p id="P19">Problems with T cell proliferation and balanced Th differentiation in the patients likely result from defects in multiple TCR-driven signaling pathways that rely on CARD11. Disruption of TCR signal strength, which can occur an a variety of settings and TCR signaling pathways, has been associated with Th2 bias<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and this phenomenon likely contributes to the pathogenesis of these patients . Numerous studies have shown that disruption of either NF-ÎºB or mTORC1 signaling blocks proper T cell expansion, likely by compromising both the IL-2 signaling loop and metabolic reprogramming required for T cell proliferation. For these reasons, it was difficult to definitively characterize the effect of these <italic>CARD11</italic> LOF mutations on Th differentiation, since typical unbiased in vitro conditions did not support T cell proliferation. However, recent work indicates that mTOR activity profoundly affects Th differentiation<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. The attenuation of CARD11-dependent mTORC1 activation ostensibly contributes to impaired Th1 differentiation in our patients, allowing an mTORC2-dependent Th2 response to dominate. NF-ÎºB signal blockade in mouse T cells was also shown to preferentially disrupt the Th1 response and permit Th2-driven allergic inflammation in vivo<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Whether reduced (but not absent) IFN-Î³ production explains the atopic and skin infection phenotype entirelyâas hinted to by patients with hypomorphic <italic>IFNGR</italic> mutationsâis not clear. An intrinsic Th2 bias alone that could drive the atopic phenotype and predispose to skin infection<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P20">Recent work suggests CARD11-dependent NF-ÎºB stimulation is particularly important for Th17 differentiation of murine T cells in vitro under specific polarizing conditions<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. In vivo, CARD11-deficient mice fail to mount a Th2 response capable of driving allergic inflammation<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, whereas UNM mice show decreased frequency of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and a gradual accumulation of Th2 cells, resulting in allergic disease<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. In contrast, we found the patients possess normal numbers of Th17 cells and Tregs, although the patients Tregs appear âTh2-likeâ based on aberrant expression of GATA3, a recognized hallmark of atopic disease susceptibility<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Further study is required to confirm a causal role of this observation. These disparate findings underscore the importance of identifying and characterizing âCARD11-opathiesâ in humans versus mice. Indeed, BENTA patients harboring GOF <italic>CARD11</italic> mutations show no signs of allergic disease, even though adoptively transferred T cells expressing constitutively active CARD11 can drive allergic disease in mice<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P21">Abnormal CARD11 signaling likely has intrinsic consequences for B cell fate as well. In contrast to the selective expansion of naÃ¯ve B cells seen in BENTA, we noted reduced numbers of CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells in some <italic>CARD11</italic> LOF patients. However, both GOF and LOF <italic>CARD11</italic> mutations can reduce circulating memory B cells and can affect immunoglobulin production in humans, suggesting CARD11 is a critical gatekeeper for tuning proper BCR signals required for normal B cell maturation and differentiation<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Of interest here, although IgE signaling normally forces murine B cells to terminally differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts prone to apoptosis, loss of key BCR signaling molecules facilitates the survival and subsequent development of IgE<sup>+</sup> memory and long-lived plasma cells<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Our findings imply that attenuated CARD11 signaling may mirror this phenomenon in humans, permitting an atypical accumulation of longer-lived IgE-secreting plasma cells that promote allergic disease, particularly in childhood.</p>
      <p id="P22">Additional work is required to identify the key pathogenic events related to the atopic phenotype and infection. Nevertheless, it may be that disease severity generally lessens over time, consistent with the phenotype in aged UNM mice (C. Goodnow, personal communication). Importantly, our findings suggest that exogenous glutamine could partially correct specific defects in <italic>CARD11</italic>mut T cell responses, including proliferation and IFN-Î³ secretion. Glutamine supplementation has been explored as a treatment for reducing allergic disease in low birth weight infants, with a promising decrease in atopic dermatitis reported<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.

        <p id="P34">The wild-type Jurkat T cell line (clone E6.1) was obtained from ATCC (TIB-152). CARD11-deficient Jurkat cells (JPM50.6) were originally provided by Dr. Xin Lin (MD Anderson Cancer Center); for authentication, absence of CARD11 expression was periodically monitored by immunoblotting. Neither cell line tested positive for mycoplasma contamination. Cell lines were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 (Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mM glutamine, and 100U/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies). JPM50.6 cells (4â5 Ã10<sup>6</sup>/cuvette) were electroporated with 5 Âµg plasmid DNA in 0.4 mL RPMI plus 10% FBS (no antibiotics) using a BTX Electroporator (BTX Harvard Apparatus: 260 V, 950 ÂµF). For luciferase assays, Jurkat cells were simultaneously transfected with 5 Âµg NF-ÎºB-dependent firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-ÎºB-Luc), and 0.25 Âµg of Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-TK) for transfection normalization. A portion of these cells were stimulated 24 hrs post-transfection with 1 Âµg/ml anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 (BD Biosciences). NF-ÎºB activity was measured 24 hrs later via detection of ÎºB-GFP reporter expression in JPM50.6 cells using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD), or by dual luciferase assay in Jurkat T cells (Promega) using a Tecan Infinite M200 Mulimode Microplate Reader. Relative NF-ÎºB activation in Jurkat transfectants was calculated by normalizing the relative ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase signals. Phospho-S6 was measured 24 hrs post stimulation via intracellular flow cytometry as previously described (26), using an AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-phospho-S6 Ab (2F9, Cell Signaling Technology) and an Accuri C6 cytometer.</p>
