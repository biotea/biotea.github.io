        <p>Î±-Tropomyosin (Tm) carrying hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
mutation
D175N or E180G was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.
We have assembled dimers of two polypeptide chains in vitro that carry
one (Î±Î±*) or two (Î±*Î±*) copies of the mutation.
We found that the presence of the mutation has little effect on dimer
assembly, thereby predicting that individuals heterozygous for the
Tm mutations are likely to express both Î±Î±* and Î±*Î±*
Tm. Depending on the expression level, the heterodimer may be the
predominant form in individuals carrying the mutation. Thus, it is
important to define differences in the properties of Tm molecules
carrying one or two copies of the mutation. We examined the Tm homo-
and heterodimer properties: actin affinity, thermal stability, calcium
regulation of myosin subfragment 1 binding, and calcium regulation
of myofibril force. We report that the properties of the heterodimer
may be similar to those of the wild-type homodimer (actin affinity,
thermal stability, D175N Î±Î±*), similar to those of the
mutant homodimer (calcium sensitivity, D175N Î±Î±*), intermediate
between the two (actin affinity, E180G Î±Î±*), or different
from both (thermal stability, E180G Î±Î±*). Thus, the properties
of the homodimer are not a completely reliable guide to the properties
of the heterodimer.</p>

    <p id="sec1">Tropomyosin is an Î±-helical,
coiled-coil protein that, with troponin, is involved in the calcium-dependent
regulation of actomyosin activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Each
Tm dimer lies along the surface of an actin filament and associates
in a head-to-tail manner into a linear polymer in which the C-terminal
section of a Tm dimer associates with the N-terminus of the next Tm
dimer. The overlap between adjacent Tms is relatively short, 11 amino
acids,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> compared to the overall length
of the molecule (284 amino acids per monomer). In the off or B-state,
each Tm covers the myosin binding site on seven actin monomers. Calcium
binding to troponin releases TnI from its binding site on actin, and
the Tm relaxes back to its preferred position on the actin surface
(C-state) where most of the myosin binding site is now exposed. Strong
binding of myosin to actin induces the Tm to move even farther from
the B-state to the M-state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The movement of Tm over
seven actins and the associated communication with the adjacent Tms
can result in significant cooperativity in the binding of calcium
to a single Tn or the binding of a single myosin to actin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The human cardiac muscle tissue contains
Î±- and Î²Tm
isoforms expressed as a mixture of Î±Î± homodimers and Î±Î²
heterodimers. To date, 11 missense mutations in Î±Tm have been
associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> HCM is a pathophysiologic condition associated with an
impaired myocardial function resulting from enlargement or hypertrophy
of myocytes and consequent remodeling of the heart. This can in some
cases lead to sudden cardiac death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> HCM
is primarily a genetic disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant
manner with an estimated incidence of one in 500 individuals. A plethora
of disease-causing mutations has been identified in the sarcomeric
proteins of the heart,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> including the protein
in which we are interested, Î±-tropomyosin (Tm).</p>
    <p>Missense
mutations in Tm associated with HCM have so far only been
reported in the Î±Tm isoform. Therefore Î±Î±, Î±Î±*,
and Î±*Î±* as well as Î±Î² and Î±*Î²
Tm dimers (where an asterisk represents a point mutation) are expected
in affected individuals with a heterozygous background. Two of these
mutations, D175N and E180G, have been intensively studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> to characterize the biochemical and biophysical properties of the
protein and subsequently to understand the consequences of these mutations
for cardiac function. All of these in vitro studies of Tm carrying
cardiomyopathy mutations to date were conducted exclusively with homodimers
because of the lack of a reliable method for the assembly and purification
of Tm heterodimers. The reported results are not always consistent
with those found from in vivo models of the disease (human slow muscle
fibres,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> transgenic mouse models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> and adenovirus-mediated infected cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup>). In these in vivo models, Tm heterodimers may be the predominant
forms of Tm.</p>
    <p>The aim of this study is then the identification
of the biophysical,
biochemical, and functional consequences of Tm HCM mutations in homo-
or heterodimeric form, based on the recently described method for
the formation in vitro and the subsequent isolation of Tm Î±Î²
heterodimers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup></p>
    <p>We report here the
optimization of this method for the assembly
and purification of human cardiac Î±Tm heterodimers carrying
HCM mutation D175N or E180G in one of the two Î± chains. We go
on to investigate the in vitro biochemical and biophysical properties
of these mutants at the molecular level. Our results demonstrate that
both D175N- and E180G-Tm readily form Î±Î±* heterodimers
and these assemble on actin with small changes in the apparent affinity
for actin. We also measure the thermal stability of the heterodimers
compared to that of the wild type (WT) and the homodimers carrying
the mutation in both chains. In vitro, the calcium activation of actin
filaments assembled with mutant Tms showed small changes to a lower
calcium level required for activation (0.08â0.14 pCa unit).
The largest change in calcium sensitivity was seen with E180G homodimers,
and this result was confirmed using rabbit skeletal myofibrils in
which the TmTn complex was extracted and replaced with human cardiac
TmTn with or without the mutation in Tm.</p>
    <p>All of the mutations
produced relatively small effects, but noticeably,
the effect of the heterodimer was not always intermediate between
those of the WT and mutant homodimers. The study of homodimers is
not therefore necessarily a good predictor of the properties of the
heterodimer.</p>

labeled at Cys374 with pyrene iodoacetamide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> and stabilized by overnight incubation at 10 Î¼M with a 1:1
ratio of phalloidin.</p>
        <p>The rat Î± isoforms of Tm (WT-Tm,
D175N-Tm, and E180G-Tm) were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and had the Ala-Ser N-terminal extension shown to mimic the N-terminal
acetylation of the native Î±Tm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> WT-Tm and

the human sequence at a single site, R220 in human versus K220 in
rat (UniProt entries P09493 and P04692 for human and rat forms, respectively).
The formation and isolation of defined Tm heterodimers required the
production of WT-Tm with a His<sub>6</sub> affinity tag followed by
the Factor Xa protease recognition site and Ala-Ser N-terminal extension.
His-Tm was cloned as described in ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>) with the following N-terminal sequence.<graphic xlink:href="bi-2012-01323n_0011" id="GRAPHIC-d585e271-autogenerated" position="float"/></p>

        <p>The formation of defined Î±Î±* Tm heterodimers was performed
as previously described by Kalyva et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Î±Î±* Tm heterodimers were assembled by mixing WT His-Tm
with a nontagged homodimer of the Tm carrying a point HCM mutation
(Î±*Î±* Tm) in a ratio 1:4. The high ratio of untagged to
tagged Tm resulted in a low level of doubly tagged dimers simplifying
the purification. The sample was heated to 58 Â°C in the presence
of DTT to generate a mixture of Tm monomers and then cooled to 37
Â°C for 1 h, and the monomers were allowed to reanneal into dimers.
Tm carrying zero, one, or two His tags was separated using a TALON
Superflow metal affinity resin column (Clontech) connected to an FPLC
system (ÃKTA). Samples were collected and analyzed on a 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel (see Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For further details, see <xref rid="sec3" ref-type="other">Results</xref>.</p>

device (Jasco PTC 423S/15) and a temperature increasing at a rate
of 1 Â°C/min. The final concentration of all Tm samples was 7
Î¼M. The reversibility of the unfoldingârefolding process
was assessed by reheating the Tm sample directly after it had been
cooled from the previous temperature scan. The temperature scans were
repeated three times without and three to four times with 1 mM DTT
added.</p>
        <p>The CD data from thermal unfolding experiments were analyzed
using MicroCal Origin version 8.6. The isotherms were smoothed (SavitzkyâGolay

of the thin filament proteins was assayed
by mixing 0.25 Î¼M S1 in the absence of calcium with a 10-fold
excess of actin (2.5 Î¼M) and 1 Î¼M WT-Tm and increasing
concentrations of hcTn. The observed reaction was a single-exponential
reaction, and the observed rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>) decreased as the hcTn concentration increased until saturation,
typically at 2.5 Î¼M hcTn with a <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> of 2.0 s<sup>â1</sup>. The hcTn required for saturation was
used in all subsequent measurements with the same batch of hcTn. Repeating
the reaction with a saturating level of Tn in the presence of calcium
typically increased <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> 3.5-fold to 7.0

        <title>Formation and Purification of Tm Heterodimers</title>
        <p>The method
of preparing heterodimers is essentially that of Kalyva et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> as outlined in <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials and
Methods</xref>. Briefly, His-Tm (Î±Î±) was mixed with the
Tm carrying a point HCM mutation (Î±*Î±*) in a ratio of
1:4. The mixture was heated at 58 Â°C for 10 min in the presence
of 20 mM DTT and then cooled to 37 Â°C for 45 min to allow dimer
formation. DTT was removed via gel filtration (Econo-Pac 10DG). The
Tm dimers were catalytically cross-linked at Cys190 by incubation
in 10 mM K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>, 2 Î¼M CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 M NaCl, 10 mM MOPS (pH 7) buffer at 35 Â°C overnight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> The cross-link was formed to trap Tm dimers
for purification. The sample was then dialyzed in 300 mM KCl, 20 mM
KP<sub>i</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7) column buffer.</p>
        <p>The mixture of dimers was purified by affinity chromatography using
a 25 mL TALON Superflow metal affinity resin column. The mixture of
Tm dimers applied to the column was washed with 100 mL of wash buffer.
The flow-through contained only nontagged Tm. The His-tagged dimers
were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 250 mM imidazole. The
high concentration of imidazole prevents the monitoring of Tm dimer
elution by the absorbance at 280 nm. The protein content of eluted
fractions was therefore monitored by running a 10% SDSâPAGE
gel under nonreducing conditions as shown in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Lanes 2 and 3 show
His-WT and D175N-Tm homodimers as controls, respectively. Heterodimers
with only one His tag were eluted first (lanes 4â12), followed
by a mixture of singly and doubly tagged Tm dimers at higher imidazole
concentrations, and both migrated with apparent molecular masses close
to 85 kDa. Lanes 4â14 show also a minor fraction of heterodimers
that were not cross-linked (two bands of tagged and nontagged Tm monomers
with similar intensity at â¼30 and 25 kDa, respectively). The
elution profile of the WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer is shown in Figure

together,
and the purity was checked via 4â12% SDSâPAGE (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The heterodimers were concentrated by precipitation
at pH 4.6 and collected by centrifugation at 4200 rpm for 12 min.
Pelleted protein was dissolved in FXa protease reaction buffer [20
mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 6.5)], and
the concentration was measured. The His tag was proteolytically cleaved
from heterodimers with FXa protease digestion. Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the isolation and purity of the WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer
before and after His tag digestion. Lanes 2 and 3 show His-Tm and
D175N-Tm homodimer controls under nonreducing conditions, respectively.
The His-Tm dimer does not form a cross-link as readily as nontagged
Tm and is shown as a mixture of monomers and dimers that migrated
with apparent molecular masses of 39 and 85 kDa, respectively. Lane
4 shows the expected 1:1 ratio of tagged and nontagged Tm arising
from the heterodimer under reducing conditions [Î²-mercaptoethanol
(BME) was used to reduce disulfide bonds]. The same sample under nonreducing
conditions (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, lane 5) shows a single
dimer band as evidence of the pure His-tagged WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer
with an apparent molecular mass of 83 kDa. The final WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer
after His tag digestion (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, lane 6)
showed a single band under reducing conditions as WT and D175N-Tm
run together under these conditions. The purity of heterodimers was
measured by gel densitometry (described in <xref rid="sec2.4" ref-type="other">Cosedimentation
and Densitometry</xref>). Two bands of the purified His-tagged WT-D175N-Tm
heterodimer under reducing conditions (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, lane 4) showed a 4% difference in density, which indicates a 96%
purity of heterodimers. Additionally, the intensities of the WT and
D175N-Tm bands from cosedimentation assays (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A) were compared, and a 5% difference in the density between
two Tm bands was measured (95% heterodimers). The ratio of Î±
and Î±* monomers was checked routinely for both tagged and nontagged
heterodimers. The isolation and purity of the WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer

profile for
the third heating cycle of the cross-linked WT homodimer superimposed
on the profile of the D175N homodimer and the WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer.
All these almost identical profiles show a major unfolding event at
â¼57 Â°C and a minor one at â¼37 Â°C. The first
derivative of the curves resolves a third, smaller domain with a midpoint
at â¼49 Â°C (see the <xref rid="notes-3" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>).</p>
        <p>After addition of DTT (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B)
to reduce
the Cys190 cross-link, the WT profile showed a reduction in the size
of the event at 37 Â°C. The 57 Â°C event occurred at a lower
temperature of â¼53 Â°C, and the intermediate event was
unchanged at 49 Â°C. The D175N homodimer was more stable than
WT by â¼1 Â°C, and the heterodimer was similar to the WT
below 40 Â°C but closer to the D175N homodimer above 45 Â°C.
The details of what is happening to the unfolding domains are shown
more clearly in the first differential of the data (see the <xref rid="notes-3" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>).</p>
        <p>The unfolding
profiles for the third heating cycle of cross-linked
homo- and heterodimers of E180G-Tm are shown in Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C. There is a significant loss of thermal stability at â¼30
Â°C that is proportional to the number of Tm mutations. The profile
of the double E180G-Tm mutant exhibits its first thermal transition
at â¼30 Â°C, that of the WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer at 35 Â°C,
and that of the WT at 40 Â°C. Above 45 Â°C all three Tm constructs
are identical. Reduction of the cross-link at Cys190 shows several
changes. Compared to WT, both dimers are less stable over the range
of 30â50 Â°C. The homodimer has a new transition at â¼42 Â°C,
and both hetero- and homodimers are apparently more stable without
the cross-link at 30 Â°C. Again the interpretation in terms of
three folding domains is clear when looking at the differentiated
data in the <xref rid="notes-3" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>.</p>
        <p>It is important to mention that both WT-D175N and WT-E180G-Tm heterodimers
under reducing conditions will reanneal into a mixture of Î±Î±,
Î±Î±*, and Î±*Î±* (the asterisk indicates a mutation)
in a ratio of approximately 1:2:1. For the WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer,
this has little consequence as all dimers have similar unfolding characteristics.
For the WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer, this complicates the interpretation.
By subtracting 25% of the expected transitions for WT and E180G homodimers
(the expected proportion after reannealing), we can estimate the unfolding
transitions for the heterodimer. The error on such a process is large,
but it can indicate the underlying properties and is shown as a thick
gray line in Figure S3F of the <xref rid="notes-3" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>. This does not alter the positions of the three transitions but
does alter their relative proportions where the area of all three
transitions is reduced by 55%.</p>

with a small
fraction, probably G-actin, remaining in the supernatant. Note that
the 10% gel used here under reducing conditions resolves the WT- and
D175N-Tm monomers. The similarity of the density of the two bands
is consistent with a pure heterodimer.</p>
        <p>Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B shows the sigmoid binding curves
of WT- and D175N-Tm constructs with F-actin as expected for Tm polymerizing
on the actin surface. Fitting the data to the Hill equation gives
an estimate of the affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>50%</sub>). The
apparent affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>50%</sub>) of the WT-D175N-Tm
heterodimer for actin (0.23 Î¼M) was tighter in comparison to
that of the D175N-Tm homodimer (0.52 Î¼M; <italic>p</italic> â¤

from that of the WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer, indicating that the introduction
of the D175N mutation in only one Tm chain does not have any effect
on binding to actin.</p>
        <p>The binding curves of WT and E180G-Tm constructs
with F-actin are
shown in Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C. The affinity of the E180G-Tm
homodimer was significantly weaker (0.42 Î¼M; <italic>p</italic> â¤ 0.05) that that of the WT (0.20 Î¼M), with the heterodimer
at an intermediate value (0.27 Î¼M; <italic>p</italic> â¤

        <p>The following stopped-flow experiments were used to evaluate the
calcium-dependent occupancy of the blocked state of the thin filament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> The thin filament was reconstituted with pyr-actin,
human cardiac Tn, and Î±Tm carrying an HCM mutation (D175N or
E180G) in one or both chains of the Tm dimer. S1 (0.25 Î¼M) was
rapidly mixed with a 10-fold excess of the pyr-actinÂ·TmÂ·Tn
complex. Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the set of observed pyrene actin fluorescence transients with

(pCa 4.6). Each transient is fit to a single exponential, and for

the equilibrium constant between actinÂ·TmÂ·Tn complexes in

to thin filaments because of the limited yields of Î±Î±*
Tm heterodimers. In this assay, 2.5 Î¼M S1 was rapidly mixed
with preincubated 0.25 Î¼M pyr-actin, 0.1 Î¼M cTn, and 0.1

transients at different calcium concentrations (pCa from 4.6 to 9.8)
with thin filaments containing WT-D175N-Tm. Measurements for each

        <title>Functional Assay in Myofibrils Replaced for the Endogenous TmÂ·Tn
Complex</title>
        <p>The following mechanical measurements in myofibrils
were taken to test the functional impact of human cardiac Î±Tm
carrying an HCM mutation in one (heterodimer) or both chains (homodimer)
when present in the sarcomere. For this reason, we extracted endogenous
Tm and Tn and replaced them in rabbit skeletal muscle myofibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> with hcTn and Î±Tm (WT, WT-E180G-Tm, and E180G-Tm). Only the
E180G mutation has been used in these experiments, based on in vitro
findings showing the largest effect in increasing the sensitivity
of calcium activation of actin filaments.</p>
        <p>As shown in Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref>, the presence of the E180G mutation in both heterodimeric
and homodimeric forms did not significantly affect maximally activated
force development (<italic>P</italic><sub>oÂ 4.5</sub>) or the
kinetics of its development (<italic>k</italic><sub>ACT</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>TR</sub>). Resting sarcomere lengths were in the optimal
overlap range of rabbit psoas muscle, and differences in the two sets
of experiments reported in Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref> were caused
by different myofibril batches. Interestingly, a clear effect was
present with the E180G-Tm homodimer when tension development at submaximal
calcium levels (pCa 5.8â5.9) was compared to the full activation
in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration-jump experiments. As shown in Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref>, myofibrils
replaced with the E180G-Tm heterodimer did not significantly differ
from control WT-Tm, while the presence of the E180G-Tm homodimer significantly
enhanced (see Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref>) tension development
(i.e., thin filament activation) at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.
The differential effect of Î±Tm homodimers versus heterodimers
on submaximal calcium-activated force seems clear even though for
Î±Tm heterodimers the comparison was made at only one submaximal
pCa that was eliciting a relatively small amount of tension (Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref>). On the other hand, calcium-independent tension
[pCa 9 (see Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>)], which signals the presence
of some myosin heads that can cycle in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, was not significantly affected by the E180G mutation in the heterodimeric
or homodimeric form.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results of our study show a method for
the in vitro formation
of defined, cardiac Î±Tm heterodimers, using bacterially expressed
Î±Tm homodimers, and is optimized for Î±Tm heterodimers
with HCM mutations D175N and E180G. The Tm HCM mutants do not show
any preference for homodimer over heterodimer formation as using a
combination of 50% Î±*Tm with 50% His-Î±Tm produced a mixture
of dimers close to that predicted for random association with a ratio
of 1:2:1 (Î±Î±:Î±Î±*:Î±*Î±*). The ratio
of formed dimers shows that the introduction of the His tag into the
Tm molecule does not affect dimerization. This suggests that in the
heterozygous cell, if both WT and mutant proteins are expressed in
similar amounts then the heterodimer will form a large fraction of
the assembled dimer. Studies of the expression of Tm mutations in
cultured cardiac myocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> or in human
skeletal muscle biopsies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> show expression
levels of 40â50% of the mutant Tm. Thus, assembly of a significant
proportion of heterodimers is likely, but to date, this has not been
investigated in cell cultures, biopsies, or transgenic animals. It
ought to be possible to detect heterodimers in tissue samples if the
Tm can be cross-linked before isolation and analysis. However, note
that the difference between the WT and mutant may be too small to
detect by SDSâPAGE or mass spectrometry. Whether such Tm dimers
assemble into the thin filament or alter the calcium activation of
contraction will depend on how the heterodimers interact with the
other thin filament components.</p>
      <p>Because the mutations do not
affect dimer formation, we considered
what other role the side chains of D175N and E180G in the homo- or
heterodimer might play in the overall function. These surface charge
residues are in a position to alter the stability of the TmâTm
contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> or alter the interaction with
actin (in position B, C, or M on the actin surface)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> or with troponin and hence alter calcium sensitivity.</p>
      <p>Actin binding assays with D175N- and E180G-Tm homodimers showed
a weaker affinity of approximately 2.5-fold in comparison to that
of the WT (<italic>K</italic><sub>50%</sub> = 0.21 Î¼M), which
agrees with previous measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> The
WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer had an actin affinity (0.23 Î¼M) that
was not distinguishable from that of the WT, while the value of the
WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer (0.27 Î¼M) was intermediate between those
of the E180G homodimer and WT. However, the physiological significance
in a muscle fiber is likely negligible because of much higher concentrations
of actin and Tm. These values show that all Tm dimers bind actin with
a tight apparent affinity, and under physiological conditions, all
will bind to actin. If all of the protein were present in the same
cell, there would be a very marginal preference for the WT over the
mutant proteins.</p>
      <p>The thermal unfolding measurements of the reduced
WT and D175N-Tm
homodimer show two major thermal transitions at 47.5 Â°C (N-terminal
region) and 53.1 Â°C (C-terminal region) and a third at 41.2 Â°C.
These observations agree with previously measured data for WT-Î±Tm
at high salt concentrations (0.5â1 M).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> A high salt concentration was used to prevent end-to-end polymerization
of Tm that can confuse the melting isotherm. Similar studies of Tm
thermal unfolding at a low salt concentration (100 mM KCl) and an
â¼3-fold higher protein concentration using differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> reported the thermal
transition of C-terminal region Tm at 50 Â°C and the N-terminal
region Tm at 42.7 Â°C. These differences are probably caused by
differences in the ionic strengths of the buffers. When the Tm is
cross-linked at Cys190, the most thermally stable domains are stabilized
with some loss of stability of the least stable domain.</p>
      <p>The
thermal unfolding of the D175N-Tm homodimer, both reduced and
cross-linked, was indistinguishable from that of the WT as previously
reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> and unsurprisingly, the D175N
heterodimer was therefore also very similar to the WT.</p>
      <p>The E180G-Tm
homodimer shows a decreased thermal stability compared
to that of the WT in agreement with the work of Kremneva et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> For the cross-linked homodimer, the least stable
domain unfolds at â¼26 Â°C, well below physiological temperature,
while the other two domains are similar to those of WT. When reduced,
the most stable domain is similar to the WT while the domain with
midrange stability is less stable by 5 Â°C at (42 Â°C). In
contrast, the least stable domain is only a little less stable than
the WT at 39 Â°C. This temperature is close to body temperature,
which led Kremneva et al. to speculate that this domain unfolding
could contribute to the pathology of this mutation particularly under
conditions where the body temperature is elevated, i.e., during fever
or intense exercise. For the heterodimer, the least stable domain
is intermediate between the homodimer and WT when cross-linked and
similar to the WT for the more stable domains.</p>
      <p>It is important
to note that both mutations are close to the disulfide
cross-link at Cys190 and the cross-link could perturb the structure
around the mutation. This is difficult to rule out for the E180G-Tm
homodimer, but the observation that the D175N mutant has a stability
identical to that of the WT suggests little interaction between the
cross-link and the residue at position 175.</p>
      <p>In the absence of
the cross-link, the interpretation is more difficult
because the protein will exist as a mixture of homodimers and heterodimers.
Even so, the mixture appears to be less stable than the pure E180G
homodimer at physiological temperatures with a midpoint transition
close to 36 Â°C. The presence of the WT and E180G homodimers would
tend to make this domain appear to be more stable, suggesting that
the heterodimer may be significantly less stable than either WT or
E180G homodimers and could be partially folded even at normal body
temperature. Note, however, that Tm is stabilized by binding to actin
and once bound would be resistant to unfolding. We conducted some
preliminary sedimentation studies of the E180G-Tm heterodimer binding
to actin at 37 Â°C and did not observe a significant loss of affinity.</p>
      <p>Tropomyosin thermal stability may be directly related to the stiffness
or flexibility of the Tm, and flexibility is widely recognized as
an important parameter defining Tm function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> Any mutation-induced
change in Tm flexibility could have a significant effect on the interaction
with actin, the movement of Tm between sites on actin, and the accessibility
of myosin to its binding sites on actin. The D175N mutation has shown
no change in stability and is therefore not predicted to alter flexibility.
Recently, it has been shown that the E180G mutation increases the
local flexibility of the Tm molecule (in the homodimer) even when
bound to actin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> and the same could be
true for the heterodimer. If the Tm thermal instability plays a role
in the pathology of HCM, it may occur through the metabolic load imposed
by the loss and clearing of misfolded Tm that is not bound to actin.</p>
      <p>Many HCM mutations, at least in thin filament proteins, are associated
with an increase in calcium sensitivity; i.e., less calcium is required
to activate the thin filament, and conversely, if the same amount
of calcium is released because of a stimulus, more calcium has to
be removed from the cell before relaxation occurs. Previous work has
shown that D175N and E180G homodimers do show changes in calcium sensitivity
when in a fully assembled actin filament in in vitro motility assays
(IVM) or reconstituted fiber experiments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> with E180G showing a greater shift than D175N. Our
measurements of the apparent calcium affinity for calcium switching
of the actinÂ·TmÂ·Tn filament for homodimers (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>) confirm this and show ÎpCa values of 0.08
for D175N and 0.14 for E180G. These are similar to the values we reported
using the same method (0.09 and 0.13, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> or estimated using IVM by Bing et al. (0.082 and 0.115,
respectively). Larger values, with lower precision, were reported
with IVM by Wang et al. (pCa<sub>50%</sub> values of 0.2 for D175N
and 0.64 for E180G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup>) and by Bai et al
using reconstituted cardiac preparations (pCa<sub>50%</sub> values
of 0.03 for D175N and 0.64 for E180G).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Interestingly, important differences exist upon comparison
of homodimers
with heterodimers: in the case of the heterodimers, the WT-E180G-Tm
heterodimer had only a small ÎpCa (0.03) compared to that of
the WT, much smaller than that of the homodimer (0.14), while the
D175N heterodimer had a larger ÎpCa (0.11) that was not significantly
different from that of the homodimer (0.09). Thus, our data are compatible
with both homo- and heterodimers showing the positive shift in calcium
sensitivity expected for these HCM mutations and with the fact that
the value of the E180G heterodimer surprisingly is very small and
not significant.</p>
      <p>The pCa shifts are small, and we tested if
the same change in sensitivity
could be seen in the sarcomere via replacement of the TmÂ·Tn complex
in rabbit psoas myofibrils with human cardiac TmÂ·Tn with either
WT-Tm or the E180G homo- or heterodimer. The results (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref>) do show an
increased calcium sensitivity for the homodimer compared to that of
the WT but not for the heterodimer. This is compatible with the solution
data using pure actinÂ·TmÂ·Tn filaments.</p>
      <p>This work is
significant for two reasons. First, we establish that
heterodimers with only one mutation in the Î±Tm can be formed
easily in vitro and therefore can be expected to form in vivo. Second,
we establish that the properties of the heterodimers are not simply
means of the properties of the two homodimers. Some properties are
intermediate like the affinity of E180G-Tm for actin, but others like
the thermal stability of E180G-Tm and the calcium sensitivity of D175N-Tm
heterodimers are more similar to that of the mutant homodimer than
to that of the WT homodimer. Tm Î±Î² heterodimers showed
intermediate thermal stability, and the affinity for actin was weaker
than that of homodimers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> This observation
is important also upon comparison of in vitro results, obtained exclusively
with homodimers of Tm carrying cardiomyopathy mutations, which results
in transgenic (TG) animals or human biopsies and clinical data. In
these last cases, the ratios of WT and mutant homodimers or heterodimers
are probably highly variable, and this would produce significant differences
in the extent of the modification of calcium sensitivity. Our results
provide insight into the molecular mechanism of phenotype modification
in the presence of cardiomyopathy mutations of Tm.</p>
      <p>It should
be noted that the approach taken here to examine the
behavior of distinct heterodimers of Tm is distinct from the approach
taken by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> who have assembled a mixture
of homodimers (in various ratios) onto actin. If heterodimers are
formed in the cell, then the actin filaments may contain a combination
of both types of homodimer and the heterodimer on a single filament.
This is more complex than the situation described here and is more
difficult to assess. Different types of tags, probably fluorescent
tags, would be required to assess the Tm composition of individual
actin filaments.</p>
