      <abstract>
        <p>Human complement receptor type 2 (CR2) is the B lymphocyte receptor for C3d and the Epstein-Barr virus. This protein is also a member of a family of C3b/C4b binding proteins that regulate complement activation, comprise tandemly repeated 60-75 amino acid sequences, and whose genes map to band q32 on chromosome 1. Overlapping cDNA clones encoding the entire human CR2 protein have been isolated from a human tonsillar cDNA library. The derived amino acid sequence of 1,032 residues encodes a peptide of 112,716 mol wt. A signal peptide was identified, followed by 15 copies of the short consensus repeat (SCR) structure common to the C3/C4 binding protein family. The entire extracellular portion of the protein comprised SCRs, thus, the ligand binding sites both for C3d and the EBV protein gp350/220 are positioned within this structure. Immediately following the final SCR was a transmembrane sequence of 24 amino acids and a cytoplasmic region of 34 amino acids. One of five cDNA clones isolated contained an additional SCR, providing evidence for alternative mRNA splicing or gene products of different human alleles. The CR2 cDNAs were used to isolate CR2-specific genomic phage. The entire CR2 coding sequences were found within 20 kb of human DNA. Analysis of the CR2 cDNA sequence indicated that CR2 contained internally homologous regions and suggested that CR2 arose by duplication of a primordial gene sequence encoding four SCRs. Comparison of the CR2 peptide sequence with those of other members of the gene family has identified many regions highly homologous with human CR1, fewer with C4bp and decay accelerating factor, and very few with factor H, and suggested that CR2 and CR1 arose by duplication of the same ancestral gene sequence. The homology between CR2 and CR1 extended to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, suggesting that these sequences were derived from a common membrane-bound precursor.</p>
