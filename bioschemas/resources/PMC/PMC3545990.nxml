      <abstract>
        <p>Textilinin-1 is a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor from Australian brown snake venom. Its ability to potently and specifically inhibit human plasmin (K<sub>i</sub>â=â0.44 nM) makes it a potential therapeutic drug as a systemic anti-bleeding agent. The crystal structures of the human microplasmin-textilinin-1 and the trypsin-textilinin-1 complexes have been determined to 2.78 Ã and 1.64 Ã resolution respectively, and show that textilinin-1 binds to trypsin in a canonical mode but to microplasmin in an atypical mode with the catalytic histidine of microplasmin rotated out of the active site. The space vacated by the histidine side-chain in this complex is partially occupied by a water molecule. In the structure of microplasminogen the Ï<sub>1</sub> dihedral angle of the side-chain of the catalytic histidine is rotated by 67Â° from its âactiveâ position in the catalytic triad, as exemplified by its location when microplasmin is bound to streptokinase. However, when textilinin-1 binds to microplasmin the Ï<sub>1</sub> dihedral angle of this amino acid residue changes by â157Â° (<italic>i.e.</italic> in the opposite rotation direction compared to microplasminogen). The unusual mode of interaction between textilinin-1 and plasmin explains textilinin-1â²s selectivity for human plasmin over plasma kallikrein. This difference can be exploited in future drug design efforts.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Aprotinin (TrasylolÂ®) is a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor that has been in broad use for â¼40 years as a therapeutic agent to decrease blood loss in patients undergoing surgical procedures. However, an extensive study conducted by Fergusson and colleagues involving over 2000 high risk cardiac surgery patients showed that its use is associated with a significantly increased risk of stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, encephalopathy, and vascular, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events compared with the lysine analogue anti-bleeding agents, tranexamic acid and Îµ-amino caproic acid <xref rid="pone.0054104-Fergusson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The study also showed that patients receiving aprotinin as compared to the other treatments were less likely, by â¼3%, to suffer a massive bleeding episode. As a result of the higher risks of side-effects associated with aprotinin its use as an anti-bleeding agent has now been suspended in many countries <xref rid="pone.0054104-Mangano1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Beattie1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Overall, the Fergusson study highlights the need for the discovery of improved anti-bleeding agents that are both safe and highly effective.</p>
      <p>Snake venoms are a good source for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents <xref rid="pone.0054104-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Fry1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Kunitz-type inhibitors (similar in structure to aprotinin) are one class of small protein commonly found in such venoms <xref rid="pone.0054104-Birrell1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These molecules can have exquisite binding specificities and possess high potency for their targets making them excellent therapeutic candidates. Textilinin-1, isolated from the venom of the Australian brown snake, <italic>Pseudonaja textilis</italic>, is an experimental drug (Q8008, Venomics Pty Ltd) and is suggested as a novel anti-bleeding agent to replace aprotinin. Possible modes of action for aprotinin include inhibition of plasmin (EC 3.4.21.7) thereby reducing fibrinolysis and/or inhibition of plasma kallikrein (EC 3.4.21.34) limiting activation of inflammatory pathways. Some of aprotininâs detrimental side-effects <xref rid="pone.0054104-Fergusson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Mangano1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Shaw1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Schneeweiss1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> may be due to (i) its overall lack of protease specificity, and (ii) its virtually irreversible inhibition of plasmin, leading to prolonged inhibition of fibrinolysis. Textilinin-1 is a good inhibitor of plasmin but with a more narrow binding specificity compared to aprotinin <xref rid="pone.0054104-Flight1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Flight2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. No measurable inhibition could be detected for textilinin-1 against tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, activated protein C and elastase while aprotinin inhibits these enzymes with K<sub>i</sub> values in the micromolar range <xref rid="pone.0054104-Flight1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Flight2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that the K<sub>i</sub> ratios in favour of aprotinin over textilinin-1 are 295, 9.9Ã10<sup>3</sup> and 1.3Ã10<sup>4</sup> for plasma kallikrein, tissue kallikrein and trypsin, respectively <xref rid="pone.0054104-Flight1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Flight2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These data suggest that its application as an anti-bleeding agent may not be accompanied by the observed side-effects associated with aprotinin.</p>
      <p>An understanding of the structural basis for the inhibition of serine proteases by textilinin-1 is important in developing it or related inhibitors into pharmaceuticals. To date, no structural data have been obtained for a Kunitz/BPTI-type inhibitor in complex with either plasmin or plasma kallikrein. These structures are needed to understand the molecular interactions that are responsible for potency and specificity. Crystallization of complete plasmin with its kringle domains or plasma kallikrein with its apple domains have historically been problematic due to the modular nature and inherent flexibility of these molecules, though recently the first crystal structure of complete plasmin has now become available <xref rid="pone.0054104-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, in both cases it has been possible to determine structures of the catalytic domains alone <xref rid="pone.0054104-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, crystallization of aprotinin in complex with these protease domains has, to date, proven intractable.</p>
      <p>A key structural feature of aprotinin and related Kunitz/BPTI inhibitors is a loop located between the first Î±-helix and Î²-sheet of the polypeptide. This region is known as the canonical loop and binds in a complementary manner to the active site of a serine protease but is not cleaved by the enzyme. There are six amino acids in aprotinin that are crucial in binding to serine proteases: P13, C14, K15, A16, R17 and I18. A nomenclature to describe the location of these amino acids has been established identifying these residues generally as P<sub>3</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>â², P<sub>2</sub>â², P<sub>3</sub>â², respectively <xref rid="pone.0054104-Schechter1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The opposing sites on the protease are signified by the letter S accompanied by the appropriate superscript and subscript. Proteolytic cleavage ordinarily occurs at the peptide bond between the P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>1</sub>â² residues. However, this does not happen when a Kunitz/BPTI inhibitor forms a complex with a serine protease. Instead BPTI becomes tightly bound to the enzyme, acting as an inhibitor. The critical amino acids in the active site of the protease are the catalytic triad of a histidine, aspartic acid and a serine (S741 in plasmin and S195 in trypsin) whose side-chain hydroxyl is the nucleophile in the reaction.</p>
      <p>Herein, we describe a kinetic study of the inhibition of human plasmin and plasma kallikrein by textilinin-1 and aprotinin, and report the crystal structure of the complex between urokinase-activated microplasmin (protease domain of human plasmin) and textilinin-1. In addition we have determined the crystal structure of the complex between textilinin-1 and bovine trypsin. This structure allows for a discussion of the comparison of the mode of binding of textilinin-1 to two different serine proteases.</p>

        <p>Here, we have shown that while textilinin-1 and aprotinin are both potent inhibitors, aprotinin binds about 44, 98 and 698 times more tightly than textilinin-1 to plasmin (K<sub>i</sub>â=â0.01 <italic>vs</italic> 0.44 nM), kallikrein (K<sub>i</sub>â=â19 <italic>vs</italic> 1870 nM) and trypsin (K<sub>i</sub>â=â6Ã10<sup>â5</sup>

However, the <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> and t<sub>1/2 (off)</sub> values show that on removal of unbound inhibitor from the system, the activity of textilinin-1 treated plasmin would recover 32 times faster than the activity of aprotinin-treated plasmin. In contrast to aprotinin, textilinin-1 binds relatively weakly to plasma kallikrein with a K<sub>i</sub> of 1.9 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054104-t001">

</xref>), a slower association (t<sub>1/2 (on)</sub>â=â55 s) and much faster dissociation (t<sub>1/2 (off)</sub>â=â0.49 min). The inhibition parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054104-t001">

        <title>Crystal Structure of the Microplasmin-textilinin-1 Complex</title>
        <p>The crystal structure of the complex between textilinin-1 and human microplasmin has been determined to 2.78 Ã resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054104-t002">
<bold>Table 2</bold>
</xref>). Two complexes are present in the asymmetric unit. The overall folds of the protease domain and textilinin-1 are similar to those observed in structures of the separate molecules <xref rid="pone.0054104-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Millers1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> with the root-mean-squared deviation (rmsd) values upon superimposition of all CÎ± atoms is â¤0.9 Ã. For textilinin-1 in the microplasmin complex, rmsd values for all CÎ± atoms are in the range 0.40 Ã to 0.74 Ã when these structures are compared with the three molecules in the asymmetric unit for the free inhibitor (PDB code 3BYB). In general, the major differences in structure occur at the N- and C- termini for the three polypeptides. However, for molecule âCâ in the free inhibitor structure the canonical loop adopts a different conformation compared to all of the other textilinin-1 structures. A discussion of this difference in structure is described later in the text. For microplasmin in the textilinin-1 complex, rmsd values for all CÎ± atoms are in the range 0.55 Ã to 0.90 Ã when these structures are superimposed on microplasmin in the streptokinase (PDB code 1L4D) and staphylokinase (PDB code 1BUI) complexes. The major differences in structure occur in the loop regions 688â695 and 583â585 and at the N-termini of the polypeptides. None of these regions are directly involved in the interaction between microplasmin and textilinin-1. However, the 688â695 is involved in interactions stabilizing both the streptokinase and staphylokinase complexes, thereby altering its conformation compared to how it exists in the textilinin-1 complex.</p>

        <p>When aprotinin and trypsin make a complex, a short antiparallel Î²-sheet is formed at the interface between the two partners <xref rid="pone.0054104-Rhlmann1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The same occurs in the microplasmin-textilinin-1 complex with the residues involved being G762-W761-S760 of microplasmin and the P3-P1 residues, P15-C16-R17, of textilinin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g004">
<bold>Figures 4a and 4b</bold>
</xref>). The hydrogen bonds that stabilize this Î²-sheet are between P15O of textilinin-1 and G762N of microplasmin and R17N of textilinin-1 and S760O of microplasmin. P15 makes a kink in the structure of textilinin-1, which positions its amide nitrogen too far from the microplasmin surface to form a hydrogen bond. However, this proline is stabilized by hydrophobic contacts to W761 of microplasmin. A hydrogen bond is also formed between C16O of textilinin-1 and the side-chain amide nitrogen of Q738.</p>
        <p>The S1' site of microplasmin is partly open and is defined by the side-chain of F587 and the C588-C604 bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g004">
<bold>Figure 4</bold>
</xref>). The side-chain of V18 (P1') fits into this site but it has different conformations in the two complexes of the asymmetric unit. This difference in conformation may be the reason for the difference in docking angles observed in the two complexes, though we cannot rule out that the difference in docking angle is not also due to crystal packing effects (see below). The presence of the alternative conformations does however demonstrate that there is flexibility at the interface between microplasmin and textilinin-1. Furthermore, there is not complete complementarity at this site signifying that there could be opportunities to modify the structure to improve affinity and or selectivity. The S2' subsite is partially exposed to solvent with the side-chain of R19 of textilinin-1 in an extended conformation poised over but not firmly packed against any side-chains of microplasmin. Nonetheless, the guanidino group of R19 is loosely held in place by electrostatic attraction to three backbone oxygen atoms and to the side-chains of E623 and E687 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g004">
<bold>Figure 4</bold>
</xref>), which are all within 5 Ã but outside hydrogen bonding distance (<italic>i.e.</italic> &gt;3.2 Ã). The backbone of R19 is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between its amide nitrogen and F587O of plasmin. The S3' subsite consists mainly of the side-chain of F587 and the hydrophobic part of the side-chain of K607 with one-edge of the side-chain of F20 from textilinin-1 slotting neatly into this pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g004">
<bold>Figure 4</bold>
</xref>).</p>
        <p>The secondary binding loop of textilinin-1 makes relatively few contacts with microplasmin but it does shield a small portion of the surface of microplasmin from the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g004">
<bold>Figures 4a and 4c</bold>
</xref>). The most important polar attraction is an interaction between G39O of textilinin-1 and E606OE1 of microplasmin. This suggests that the carboxylate of E606 is protonated, and/or that a water molecule(s) not visible in the electron density at 2.78 Ã resolution bridges the two groups. Elevated pKaâs (as high as 8) for glutamate side-chains are rare but can occur when they are buried inside proteins <xref rid="pone.0054104-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>19</bold>]</xref>, which is the case in this structure when the complex is formed. The backbone dihedral angles of G39 in both free <xref rid="pone.0054104-Millers1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and complexed textilinin-1 are in a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot for the other standard amino acids indicating that glycine may be the only residue capable of optimally making this bond. The side-chain of I36 of textilinin-1 is exposed to the solvent but does form hydrophobic attractions with E687, Q738 and to a lesser extent H603 of microplasmin. If the inhibitor has evolved to specifically target plasmin it is curious that a polar or charged side-chain is not in this location to optimize binding, but such a side-chain may pull R19 (P2') towards the textilinin-1 surface rather than making interactions with microplasmin, thereby weakening the overall affinity for plasmin.</p>
        <p>The only difference in amino acid sequence in the secondary loops of textilinin-1 and aprotinin is at position 36, which is an isoleucine in textilinin-1 and a valine in aprotinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g005">
<bold>Figure 5</bold>
</xref>). The contact between the CD1 atom (the only difference in structure between valine and isoleucine) and plasmin is minimal with a closest approach of 3.2 Ã to E687 in one complex in the asymmetric unit and 4.4 Ã in the other complex in the asymmetric unit. It is therefore unlikely that this difference would even partially account for the fact that aprotinin binds 44-fold more tightly than textilinin-1 to plasmin.</p>
        <p>In the active form of serine proteases, the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad (S741, H603 and D646 in human plasmin) forms a compact unit with the histidine side-chain centrally located and hydrogen bonded to both the serine and aspartate. However, in both complexes of the asymmetric unit in the microplasmin-textilinin-1 crystal structure the side-chain of H603 is positioned in an alternate conformation when compared to the active conformation of the catalytic triad in serine proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g007">
<bold>Figure 7</bold>
</xref>). The space that is normally occupied by the histidine side-chain is filled by a water molecule, which forms hydrogen bonds to S741OG, D646OD1 and S760O. Based on X-ray crystallography, it is not possible to unambiguously assign the position of the ND1 and NE2 atoms of the imidazolium ring of H603 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g007">
<bold>Figure 7</bold>
</xref>). However, if the ND1 atom is oriented toward E606OD1 a hydrogen bond would be present. In either conformation, the H603 side-chain interacts through van der Waals contact with the C16-C40 bridge of textilinin-1. The side-chain of H603 has an orientation not observed in any of the other microplasmin structures previously reported. When bound to streptokinase this side-chain is in the serine protease âactiveâ conformation <xref rid="pone.0054104-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g007">
<bold>Figure 7</bold>
</xref>. However, in the microplasminogen structure this side-chain is partially rotated in a position intermediate between the active conformation and the conformation when textilinin-1 is bound <xref rid="pone.0054104-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g007">
<bold>Figure 7</bold>
</xref>. The movement of this side-chain is largely attributed to a rotation of the Ï<sub>1</sub> dihedral angle which differs by 67Â° in the microplasmin-streptokinase complex and the microplasminogen structure and by -157Â° (<italic>i.e.</italic> in the opposite rotation direction compared to microplasminogen) in the microplasmin-streptokinase complex and the microplasmin-textilinin-1 complex. Modelling studies show that if the histidine side-chain is placed in its catalytically active position in the triad a steric clash would occur with the side-chain of the P1â² residue, V18, from textilinin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g007">
<bold>Figure 7</bold>
</xref>). As a result of the atypical location of the histidine side-chain there is a lack of complementarity at this site and this may partly explain why textilinin-1 binds more weakly to plasmin than does aprotinin.</p>

        <title>Crystal Packing in the Microplasmin-textilinin-1 Complex</title>
        <p>In order to assess the effect of crystal packing on the overall structure of the complex a detailed analysis of the non-covalent interactions between non crystallographic and symmetry related partners is required. The buried surface area between complex A and complex B in the asymmetric unit of the mcroplasmin-textilinin-1 complex is 221 Ã<sup>2</sup>. In this interface the side-chain of the P2' residue (R19) of textilinin-1 from complex B, which is situated in the partly open S2' subsite of microplasmin, extends out to form an ionic contact with the side-chain of D28 of textilinin-1 from complex A (3.03 Ã). However, the conformation and location of the side-chain of R19 of textilinin-1 is similar in both complexes. Thus, it is unlikely that this interaction would perturb the positioning of textilinin-1 relative to microplasmin in this complex.</p>
        <p>There are also some crystal contacts between textilinin-1 molecules and symmetry neighbours. For molecule A, there are three van der Waals contacts (3.4â3.6 Ã) between the side-chains of E51 and E52 and side-chains of symmetry neighbours S51 and F47, respectively. Again it would seem these relatively few interactions would not significantly influence the docking angle of textilinin-1, especially given that the side-chain dihedral angles could easily move to prevent unfavourable interactions. For molecule B, seven side-chains form contacts with symmetry neighbours: L9 forms a van der Waals contact with P609; the side-chain of P10 forms a van der Waals contact with N769; the side-chain of D28 forms ionic bonds with the side-chains of R767 and K770 and van der Waals contacts with Pro768 and; the side-chains of E51, D52, E54, S55 and S56 form hydrogen bonds with the side-chain of S612. Again all of these are side-chain contacts but they are numerous leading us to conclude that we cannot completely rule out that crystal packing could affect the docking angle. Nonetheless, as suggested earlier, the structures of the two complexes show that the interaction between microplasmin and textilinin-1 is flexible and there is freedom of movement around the P1â site if outside forces such as those due to crystal packing are present.</p>

        <p>The S1' subsite in trypsin is lined by the side-chains of F41, the catalytic H57, and the C42-C58 bridge. The side-chain of the P1' residue of textilinin-1, V18, fits in this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g009">
<bold>Figures 9a and 9b</bold>
</xref>). Unlike the microplasmin-textilinin-1 complex, the catalytic triad of trypsin is maintained in its catalytically active conformation with the histidine centrally located. The S2' site is a half open channel bordered by the side-chains of two tyrosine residues, Y39 and Y151. The side-chain of the P2' residue, R19, fills this site but is also exposed to solvent forming a hydrogen bond to a water molecule which bridges to H40O of trypsin. The P3' residue, F20, has one side of its aromatic ring resting against the side-chain of K60, while the remainder of the side-chain is exposed to solvent.</p>
        <p>Superposition of the trypsin-aprotinin and trypsin-textilinin-1 complexes shows that the docking angle of the two inhibitors into trypsin differs by â¼25Â° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g009">
<bold>Figure 9d</bold>
</xref>). This appears to be due to the fact that if textilinin-1 was to bind in the same orientation as aprotinin steric clashes would occur between H60 of trypsin and the P1' (V18) and the P3' (F20) and K63. Thus, the P3-P1 residues of both aprotinin and textilinin-1 slot into their sites into trypsin in an almost identical way, but the P1'-P3' residues of textilnin-1 adapt as best they can to fit into their respective sites. This is achieved in two ways: modification of backbone dihedral angles and change of docking angle of the inhibitor. Overall, the surface area that is buried in the trypsin-textilinin-1 complex is 77 Ã<sup>2</sup> less than in the trypsin-aprotinin complex. The overall impression is that the textilinin-1 molecule does not fit neatly into the subsites on the P1' side of the active site due to steric clashes. Nonetheless, binding is maintained due to the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate. These observations are in good agreement with the determined K<sub>i</sub> values for textilinin-1 (0.42 nM) and aprotinin (6.0Ã10<sup>â5</sup> nM) binding to trypsin <xref rid="pone.0054104-Flight1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>There is a &gt;4000 fold difference in K<sub>i</sub> for textilinin-1 inhibiting plasma kallikrein compared to plasmin. The on rate is 100-fold slower and the off rate 100-fold faster than observed when textilinin-1 binds to plasmin. In plasma kallikrein the space behind the catalytic histidine is occupied by the side-chain of a tyrosine residue from the 99-loop <xref rid="pone.0054104-Sotiropoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Lawrence1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> effectively locking the histidine side-chain in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054104-g006">

</xref>). Thus, in plasmin there is space in the S1â² site for valine, but only after the histidine has moved. However, in plasma kallikrein it does not appear to be possible for this movement to occur and it is therefore unlikely that textilinin-1 can get close enough to the active site serine (and catalytic triad) to form a tightly bound and stable tetrahedral intermediate, thereby providing an explanation for the &gt;4000 fold difference in K<sub>i</sub> value.</p>

      <p>The K<sub>i</sub> value for textilinin-1 binding to plasmin is 44-times higher than aprotinin. Based on the crystal structure of the microplasmin-textilinin-1 complex, a likely explanation is that, at the P1â² site, the alanine side-chain of aprotinin can fit neatly in the S1â² site of the enzyme and that the histidine side-chain is in position for catalysis. If this is the case then the interface between the enzyme and inhibitor should be sealed via hydrophobic interactions. On the other hand, the movement of the histidine side-chain in the complex with textilinin-1 reduces the surface complementarity at this site. Furthermore, the introduction of a water molecule in the location of the histidine side-chain creates a polar interface, which would not be a favoured interaction with the non-polar side-chain of the P1â² valine of textilinin-1.</p>
      <p>An important property in terms of its therapeutic potential is that textilinin-1 has a much faster off-rate for plasmin as compared to aprotinin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054104-t001">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>). There is as yet no crystal structure for aprotinin in complex with plasmin, but the P1' residue in aprotinin is alanine, which is smaller by two methyl groups than V18 in textilinin-1. Therefore, it is likely that when aprotinin binds to plasmin the catalytic triad remains intact. In the case of textilinin-1 bound plasmin, dissociation of the complex could be facilitated by the movement of the histidine back into its position in the catalytic triad, rapidly releasing the inhibitor from plasmin. A feature of textilinin-1 is that the canonical loop in the free molecule can adopt an inverted structure that is stabilized by interactions between V18, T12 and I35 <xref rid="pone.0054104-Millers1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This flexibility may be a property of textilinin-1 that can facilitate its rapid release from the enzyme. Overall the explanation of tighter specificity and faster off rate that textilinin-1 exhibits compared to aprotinin appears to lie in the identity of the P1' residue, which is the larger valine in textilinin-1 (<italic>cf</italic> alanine in aprotinin). Another factor that may contribute to an enhanced binding specificity textilinin-1 has is the presence of the bulky phenylalanine side-chain at the P3' site (<italic>cf</italic> isoleucine in aprotinin). This may preclude textilinin-1 from optimally binding to serine proteases that have a protuberance at this site, as is observed in the trypsin structure.</p>
      <p>Adverse effects due to the immunogenicity of textilinin-1 and other Kunitz-type inhibitors from snake venoms are considered a problem with the use of such molecules as therapeutic agents. In the case of aprotinin, effects can range from mild skin rashes to, in rare cases, anaphylaxis <xref rid="pone.0054104-Scheule1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, the most severe allergic reactions (&lt;0.75% of cases) are generally restricted to those occurring upon re-exposure to aprotinin <xref rid="pone.0054104-Dietrich1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. One approach to overcoming this problem is to synthesize mutant inhibitors with the aim of removing potential immunogenic epitope(s) (as has been suggested for aprotinin <xref rid="pone.0054104-Siekmann1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>) but maintaining the critical residues that are responsible for selective binding to the target. Another approach to drug design may be to graft the primary binding loop of textilinin-1 onto a smaller molecule which would be non-immunogenic.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>The more rapidly reversible inhibition of plasmin by textilinin-1 in comparison with aprotinin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054104-t001">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>) would be expected to result in a faster recovery of plasmin activity after cessation of treatment, leading to a decreased tendency to develop post-operative thrombosis. Compromising fibrinolysis for longer than necessary to stem blood loss would be expected to result in adverse thrombotic effects. It is well established that active fibrinolysis is necessary to prevent such adverse effects <xref rid="pone.0054104-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054104-Gaffney1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Other side-effects of aprotinin may be due to its ability to inhibit a range of serine proteases involved in blood clotting and other physiological processes. The more reversible binding and better specificity of textilinin-1 compared to aprotinin suggest that this molecule may have improved pharmaceutical properties over aprotinin.</p>
        <p>The sequence of textilinin-1 is novel. An extensive BLAST search of all Kunitz-type protease inhibitor sequences failed to find a match with the RVRF motif in the P1-P3' sites found in textilinin-1 (except for textilinin-2, also found in the Australian brown snake). The observation that the histidine side-chain is out of its position in the catalytic triad in the microplasmin complex and the flexible nature of the canonical loop in textilinin-1 could not have easily been predicted by molecular modelling. The atypical positioning of the histidine side-chain is not an unprecedented observation as it has been previously seen in the crystal structure of complement protease factor D <xref rid="pone.0054104-Jing1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In this enzyme the movement of this side-chain (from inactive to active state) can only be induced by C3b-bound factor B and it is suggested that this movement is the reason for its high specificity for factor B as a substrate. That plasmin can also adopt this unusual configuration of the catalytic triad in the presence of an experimental drug (textilinin-1) suggests that rational approaches could be employed to design or synthesize compounds that have greater selectivity and potency and possess highly favourable pharmacokinetic properties.</p>

A crystal was directly transferred to a cryostream (100 K) without addition of cryoprotectant. Crystallization of the trypsin-textilinin-1 complex was also by the hanging drop method but the experiment was undertaken at 4Â°C and using a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL. Crystals took up to one month to appear in the drops. The well solution consisted of 0.1 M HEPES-Na pH 7.5 and 1.4 M tri-sodium citrate dihydrate. The drop comprised 1 Âµl of well solution and 1 Âµl of complex. Crystals were transferred from their growth drop to a new drop containing 70% (v/v) well solution and 30% (v/v) glycerol and soaked for 5 min in this solution before being transferred to the cryostream (100 K).</p>

        <title>Data Collection and Structure Determination</title>
        <p>Data sets for both complexes were collected using a Molecular Structure Incorporated FR-E X-ray generator operated at 45 kV and 45 mA and an R-Axis IV++ imaging plate detector. For the microplasmin-textilinin-1 complex, 200 oscillation images with an oscillation range of 0.5Â° were collected. The exposure time for each image was 180 s. For the trypsin-textilinin-1 complex, 150 oscillation images with an oscillation range of 0.5Â° were collected. The exposure time for each image was 360 s. Data for the microplasmin-textilinin-1 complex were integrated, scaled and merged using Crystalclear 1.3.6 <xref rid="pone.0054104-Pflugrath1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Data for the trypsin-textilinin-1 complex were integrated, scaled and merged using HKL2000 <xref rid="pone.0054104-Otwinowski1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The structures of both complexes were solved by molecular replacement using EPMR <xref rid="pone.0054104-Kissinger1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The coordinates of microplasmin from the complex with streptokinase (pdb code 1BML) and bovine trypsin (pdbcode 3PTN) were used as starting models for the respective complexes. The initial electron density maps revealed textilinin-1 bound in the active site of each the proteases. Textilinin-1 was subsequently docked into this space. Refinement of both complexes was carried out initially using REFMAC5 <xref rid="pone.0054104-Murshudov1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> followed by Phenix <xref rid="pone.0054104-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, and model building and structural analysis were performed with Coot <xref rid="pone.0054104-Emsley1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> with MOLPROBITY <xref rid="pone.0054104-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, respectively. Accessible surface areas were calculated using the method of Lee and Richards <xref rid="pone.0054104-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. To determine the docking angles of textilinin-1 to microplasmin the microplasmin structures were superimposed on each other and the coordinates of the textilinin-1 rotated until they superimposed.</p>
