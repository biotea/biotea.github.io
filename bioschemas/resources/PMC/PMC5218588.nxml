        <p id="P1">XRCC1 is a molecular scaffold protein that assembles multi-protein complexes involved in DNA single-strand break repair<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.

  <body>
    <p id="P2">A forty-seven year old woman of East Indian descent and non-consanguineous parents was diagnosed at age forty-one with cerebellar atrophy, gait and limb ataxia, ocular motor apraxia, and peripheral neuropathy (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Prenatal and early developmental history was completely normal and difficulties with balance and gait were first noticed at twenty-eight years, but this was not fully investigated until age forty. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebellar examination revealed progressive cerebellar atrophy (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and multiple ataxic abnormalities including dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, and dysarthria, and nerve conduction studies revealed chronic length-dependent sensory-motor predominantly axonal peripheral neuropathy (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>). After ruling out more than ten known spinocerebellar at axias by genetic and metabolic screening (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>) exome sequencing of the proband identified compound heterozygous mutations in <italic>XRCC1</italic> (NM_006297). The mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing as c.1293G&gt;C (p.K431N) and c.1393C&gt;T (p.Q465*) and were present <italic>in trans</italic>, with the unaffected sibling of the proband heterozygous for c.1293G&gt;C (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). c.1393C&gt;T has not previously been described in the population, whereas c.1293G&gt;C was previously detected in heterozygous state in four individuals of South Asian descent (ExAC Consortium, Cambridge, MA). After ruling out other rare gene variants on the basis of their presence in the unaffected sibling, presence in homozygous state in unaffected in-house controls and/or ExAC, and lack of functional and/or disease relevance no other candidate causative mutations remained.</p>
    <p id="P3">The c.1393C&gt;T mutation is located within exon 12 and creates a premature stop codon at amino acid 465, most likely triggering nonsense mediated mRNA decay. The c.1293G&gt;C mutation is located at the end of exon 11 and is also part of the donor splice site for intron 11, most likely affecting splicing and inducing premature stop codons/nonsense-mediated decay and/or encoding XRCC1 with the missense mutation, K431N. Consistent with this, reduced total levels of XRCC1 mRNA were observed in patient cells, as well as aberrant splicing of XRCC1 transcripts if nonsense-mediated decay was inhibited with cycloheximide (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">To establish the pathogenic impact of the biallelic <italic>XRCC1</italic> mutations we examined patient fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) for levels of XRCC1 protein by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The level of XRCC1 in the patient primary fibroblasts was greatly reduced when compared to wild type primary human fibroblasts (1BR) by indirect immunofluorescence and was not measurably higher than in human RPE-1 cells in which <italic>XRCC1</italic> was deleted by CRISPR-Cas9 (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, Western blotting suggested that patient fibroblasts and LCLs both retained a small amount (â¼5%) of residual XRCC1 (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Indeed, this was confirmed using XRCC1 siRNA, which reduced the anti-XRCC1 signal on Western blots of patient fibroblasts even further (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Levels of DNA ligase IIIÎ± (Lig3Î±) were also greatly reduced (by &gt;80%) in patient cells, consistent with the established impact of XRCC1 on the cellular stability of this partner protein (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <italic>top</italic>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Since germ-line deletion of <italic>Xrcc1</italic> in mouse is embryonic lethal<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> we suggest that the small amount of XRCC1 remaining in the patient was important for embryonic viability. Consistent with this idea, embryonic viability in mice is supported by a little as â¼10% of normal Xrcc1 levels<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P5">To determine whether the residual XRCC1 in patient cells can engage in single-strand break repair (SSBR) we quantified the extent to which it bound oxidized chromatin. XRCC1 was primarily detected in nucleoli in undamaged wild-type RPE-1 cells and normal primary 1BR fibroblasts, following the extraction of soluble proteins with detergent, but was rapidly recruited into global nuclear chromatin following treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c, d</xref>); a physiological source of oxidative single-strand breaks (SSBs)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In contrast, little or no XRCC1 recruitment into chromatin was detected in <italic>XRCC1</italic>-patient fibroblasts by high-resolution or high-content imaging (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c, d</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Similar results were observed following treatment with camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase poison that induces SSBs triggered by abortive topoisomerase I activity (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">Importantly, the defect in XRCC1 recruitment in patient fibroblasts was accompanied by a delay in the kinetics of DNA single-strand break repair (SSBR) following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This phenotype was recapitulated in <italic>XRCC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RPE-1 cells and is consistent with the established molecular role of XRCC1<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In contrast, we failed to detect a major difference in double-strand break repair in <italic>XRCC1-</italic>patient fibroblasts, as measured by Î³H2AX immunostaining following ionising radiation (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). In agreement with the defect in SSBR, <italic>XRCC1</italic>-patient LCLs exhibited a four-fold increase in sister chromatid exchange; a hyper-recombination phenotype resulting from elevated homologous recombination triggered by unrepaired SSBs in S/G2 phase of the cell cycle (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P7">XRCC1 is a scaffold protein that assembles SSBR multi-protein complexes and, importantly, components of these complexes are mutated in the cerebellar ataxias <italic>spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1</italic> (SCAN1; mutated in TDP1)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, <italic>ataxia oculomotor apraxia-1</italic> (AOA1; mutated in Aprataxin)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and <italic>ataxia oculomotor apraxia-4</italic> (AOA4; mutated in PNKP)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Indeed, it is striking that the pathology of the XRCC1 patient combines features of each of these diseases, consistent with the role played by XRCC1 in coordinating their activity. The discovery that XRCC1 is itself mutated in cerebellar ataxia is thus significant because it demonstrates the importance of these complexes in preventing neurodegeneration in humans.</p>
    <p id="P8">To investigate the mechanism(s) by which unrepaired SSBs trigger neuropathology we considered the possibility that persistent unrepaired SSBs might result in prolonged activity of the SSB sensor protein, PARP1. This hypothesis was prompted by the observation that excessive synthesis of poly (ADP-ribose) and/or excessive depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup> by PARP1 is neurotoxic and associated with ischemia reperfusion injury<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Consistent with this idea, whilst ADP-ribose was rapidly detected in both wild type and patient fibroblasts following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment it persisted at a higher level in the latter cells during subsequent incubation in drug-free medium (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). This was also evident in <italic>XRCC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> human RPE-1 cells, confirming that this phenotype was induced by loss of XRCC1. Elevated ADP-ribose levels were also detected in XRCC1 patient fibroblasts and <italic>XRCC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RPE-1 cells following treatment with camptothecin (CPT) (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Indeed, the difference in ADP-ribose levels between wild type and XRCC1-mutant cells was even greater following CPT than following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. The type of SSB induced by CPT has been linked previously with SSBR-defective neurodegenerative disease and is a possible source of pathogenic SSBs in SSBR-defective individuals<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Consistent with this idea, CPT-induced ADP-ribose levels were also elevated in fibroblasts from a patient with ataxia oculomotor apraxia-4 (AOA4); the cerebellar ataxia resulting from mutation of the XRCC1 protein partner, PNKP (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). Importantly, the elevated ADP-ribose observed in CPT-treated <italic>XRCC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RPE-1 cells, <italic>XRCC1</italic>- patient cells, and PNKP-patient cells was entirely dependent on PARP1 activity (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs 6</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Moreover, this phenotype was rescued by the introduction of wild-type recombinant XRCC1 into XRCC1 patient fibroblasts by electroporation (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">Next, to examine directly whether hyperactive PARP1 triggers cerebellar ataxia in the absence of efficient SSBR we employed a mouse model in which <italic>Xrcc1</italic> was conditionally deleted in brain (<italic>Xrcc1<sup>Nes-Cre</sup></italic>)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. <italic>Xrcc1<sup>Nes-Cre</sup></italic> mice exhibit pronounced cerebellar histopathology including increased apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons, greatly reduced numbers of cerebellar interneurons and decreased electrophysiological spike activity in Purkinje cells (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Ref. 4</xref> &amp; <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). Moreover, consistent with the pathology of the <italic>XRCC1</italic>-mutant patient and other SSBR-defective patients, <italic>Xrcc1<sup>Nes-Cre</sup></italic> mice exhibit cerebellar ataxia<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Strikingly, we detected elevated levels of ADP-ribose in the cerebellum of <italic>Xrcc1<sup>Nes-Cre</sup></italic> mice suggesting that the loss of Xrcc1 can trigger Parp1 hyperactivation in brain even at endogenous levels of SSBs (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Indeed, the deletion of <italic>Parp1</italic> ablated both the elevated level of ADP-ribose and the characteristic loss of cerebellar interneurons in <italic>Xrcc1<sup>Nes-Cre</sup></italic> mice, thereby increasing neuronal density in the molecular layer â¼4-fold to wild type levels (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, b</xref>). This did not reflect an impact of Parp1 deletion on the rate of SSBR because the latter was similarly slow in <italic>XRCC1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>XRCC1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>PARP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RPE-1 cells (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>). Rather, these data demonstrate that in the absence of Xrcc1-dependent SSB repair Parp1 is hyperactivated, resulting in the loss and/or dysfunction of cerebellar neurones. Finally, to examine whether <italic>Parp1</italic> deletion also rescued the cerebellar ataxia observed in <italic>Xrcc1<sup>Nes-Cre</sup></italic> mice we compared <italic>Xrcc1<sup>Nes-Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Xrcc1<sup>Nes-Cre</sup></italic>/<italic>Parp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice for their performance on an accelerating rotarod. Indeed, remarkably, whereas <italic>Xrcc1<sup>Nes-Cre</sup></italic> mice were profoundly ataxic and unable to remain on the rotarod for more than a few seconds the additional deletion of <italic>Parp1</italic> improved the rotarod performance of <italic>Xrcc1<sup>Nes-Cre</sup></italic> mice &gt;30-fold, increasing their mean retention time to â¼30 sec (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">Collectively, these data identify elevated ADP-ribose levels as a biomarker of PARP1 hyperactivity and as a cause of cerebellar ataxia induced by unrepaired SSBs (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). This scenario might also extend to other more common neurodegenerative diseases because elevated levels of oxidative stress and DNA strand breakage are also implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, patients with mutations in the XRCC1 partner protein PNKP exhibit not only ataxia but also microcephaly and seizures, and we have more recently identified a second patient with rare putative pathogenic mutations (&lt;0.01% allele frequency and not present in ExAC in homozygous state) in XRCC1 that exhibits this same combination of phenotypes<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, <italic>Xrcc1</italic><sup>Nes-Cre</sup> mice also present with seizures, raising the prospect that PARP1 hyperactivation may induce not only ataxia, but also more severe pathologies.</p>
    <p id="P11">Finally, these data identify PARP1 as a possible drug-target for the treatment of cerebellar ataxias associated with unrepaired SSBs. Inhibition of PARP1 with currently available chemical inhibitors may not be useful in this context, however, because these inhibitors âtrapâ PARP1 on DNA<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and do not mimic PARP1 genetic deletion (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>). However, the development of selective inhibitors of PARP1 that prevent DNA binding by this enzyme may have significant therapeutic potential.</p>

        <p id="P36">To evaluate motor coordination/cerebellar ataxia, an accelerating Panlab Rotarod (Harvard Apparatus Ltd., UK) was used. The apparatus was composed of a rod with a diameter of 30 mm divided into five opaque methacrylate arnite barriers, separating the rod into five 50 mm sections. Mice were trained for three successive attempts on the day prior to assessment. For assessment, mice were positioned on the rod facing away from the experimenter whilst the rod was stationary. Once activated, the rod accelerated at 0 to 40 rpm at an acceleration rate of 5 min. Mice were rested for 15 min between each of the three trials and then positioned back on the rod for the next assessment. The time spent on the rod was recorded for each mouse and the mean time was calculated from the three independent trials.</p>

        <title>Purkinje cell recordings</title>
        <p id="P37">Vermis parasagittal slices (200 Î¼m) were taken from P13-P17 mice using a vibroslicer (VT1200S, Leica Microsystems, Germany) in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.3). Slices were maintained in ACSF at 34-35Â°C for 45 min and then at 23-25Â°C for electrophysiology. Voltage-clamp recordings of Purkinje cells were performed in cell-attached mode using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices) with pipettes (5-7 MÎ©) containing 150 mM NaCl. Signals were filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 50 kHz and analysis of spike activity performed offline using Clampfit (Molecular Devices).</p>
