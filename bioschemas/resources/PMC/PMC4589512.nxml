        <p id="P1">Specialized junctional sites that connect the plasma membrane (PM) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) play critical roles in controlling lipid metabolism and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mediated by dynamic STIM1-ORAI1 coupling represents a classical molecular event occurring at ER-PM junctions, but the protein composition and how previously-unrecognized protein regulators facilitate this process remain ill-defined. Using a combination of spatially-restricted biotin-labelling <italic>in situ</italic> coupled with mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and a secondary screen based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, we mapped the proteome of intact ER-PM junctions in living cells without disrupting their architectural integrity. Our approaches lead to the discovery of an ER-resident multi-transmembrane protein that we call STIMATE (<italic>STIM</italic>-<italic>a</italic>c<italic>t</italic>ivating <italic>e</italic>nhancer, encoded by <italic>TMEM110</italic>) as a positive regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in vertebrates. STIMATE physically interacts with STIM1 to promote STIM1 conformational switch. Genetic depletion of STIMATE substantially reduces STIM1 puncta formation at ER-PM junctions and suppresses the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-NFAT signaling. Our findings enable further genetic studies to elucidate the function of STIMATE in normal physiology and disease, and set the stage to uncover more uncharted functions of hitherto underexplored ER-PM junctions.</p>

    <p id="P2">ER-PM junctions are defined as spatially extended or small circular compartments in which the PM and ER membranes are stably separated at a distance of approximately 10â20 nm without direct membrane fusion<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The broad significance of this structure has only recently begun to be appreciated, with emerging roles in lipid metabolism and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Although ER-PM junctions were first observed over half a century ago<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, systematic dissection of this specialized subcompartment at the molecular level remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate methods and convenient tools, which motivated us to explore a non-biased yet effective approach to obtain an integrated picture of ER-PM junctions. By taking advantage of an <italic>in situ</italic> protein labeling technique<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, we set out to map the proteome of ER-PM junctions that are dedicated to store operated calcium entry (SOCE), a fundamental physiological process that is mediated by two protein families, STIM and ORAI<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The ER-resident Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor protein, STIM1, when fused to an engineered ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APEX2), enables proximity biotin labeling with least perturbation to the architecture of ER-PM junctions, thereby opening new avenues for capturing protein complexes situated at or in close proximity of STIM1 in living cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). At the heart of this <italic>in situ</italic> protein labelling technique is APEX2-catalyzed conversion of biotin-phenol in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to phenoxyl radicals, which could attack electron-rich amino acids and covalently attach biotin tags to targeted proteins<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Biotinylated proteins can be subsequently enriched by streptavidin beads and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Notably, these radicals have very short lifetimes (&lt;1 ms) with an estimated labelling radius of &lt;20 nm<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, thus matching the distance that separates ER and PM at junctional sites. One additional benefit of this approach is that it enables dynamic sampling of this specialized cellular compartment during the translocation of STIM1 from ER toward PM, thereby allowing us to compare protein complexes surrounding STIM1 before and after store depletion.</p>
    <p id="P3">Following ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion elicited by thapsigargin (TG), a blocker of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA), total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope imaging showed that EGFP-tagged STIM1-APEX2 formed puncta and colocalised tightly with biotinylated proteins, the latter of which were labelled by fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This process was dependent on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> since biotinylation was not observed whilst omitting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the reaction medium. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>- and APEX2-dependent biotinylation of protein complexes surrounding STIM1 was further confirmed by silver staining after affinity enrichment and independently by western blotting probed by streptavidin-HRP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Because ORAI1 (MW: 33 kDa) is a known binding partner of STIM1, we first analysed a gel slice corresponding to 25â37 kDa on the SDS-PAGE with mass spectrometry in our initial experiment and confirmed the presence of ORAI1 using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In the same gel band, we repeatedly detected the gene product of <italic>TMEM110</italic> (RefSeq ID: NM_198563), hereafter designated as STIMATE (for <italic>STIM</italic>-<italic>a</italic>c<italic>t</italic>ivating <italic>e</italic>nhancer, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In our subsequent LC-MS/MS analyses on all the eluted products, we further identified a total of 73 potential STIM1 interactors, with 17 detected in both store-full and store-depleted HEK293 cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). The majority of them fell into the categories of ER- or PM-resident proteins, cytoskeletal components, and proteins functioning in intracellular membrane trafficking or posttranslational modifications. Notably, 18% of them also appeared as strong hits identified in an independent genome-wide screen for regulators of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, a transcriptional factor that is downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediated by STIM-ORAI signaling. The prowess of this approach was further attested by the identification of EB1, SERCA2, ORAI1, voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, extended synaptotagmin 1 and septins as candidate proteins that are in close proximity to STIM1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). These proteins are known to either directly interact with STIM1 or reside in the ER-PM junctions<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">Given the major interest in identifying protein regulators at ER-PM junctions that are directly involved in STIM1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, we created a customized prey library of 38 genes representing the majority of gene products (<italic>e.g.</italic>, STIMATE) identified under both store-full (resting) and store depleted conditions, as well as candidate genes that have an annotated function in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling or harbor predicted transmembrane domains (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). A secondary screen based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFc, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1aâc</xref>) was performed to examine their potentials as STIM1 interactors either before or after TG-induced store depletion. Our assay is based on the reconstitution of an intact yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) from two complementary non-fluorescent fragments when they are brought together through STIM1 and STIM1-binding partners. Again, STIMATE stood out as one of the strongest hits in the screen (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1bâsc</xref>). Collectively, STIMATE, a positive regulator of NFAT activation identified in a previous genome-wide RNAi screening<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, emerged early and prominently in both screens, which prompted us to further examine its role in modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux at ER-PM junctions, and in parallel, to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying its interplay with STIM1.</p>
    <p id="P5">To examine the effect of STIMATE on SOCE and its downstream effectors, we monitored the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and NFAT-dependent activities by treating HEK293 cells with siRNA oligonucleotides designed to specifically target STIMATE. The knockdown efficiency (~60â80%) of two synthesized siSTIMATE oligos was confirmed by qPCR (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1eâf</xref>, TG-triggered SOCE, as well as NFAT-dependent luciferase activity, was significantly suppressed in HEK293 cells transfected with either of the two siSTIMATE oligos. The inhibitory effect could be rescued in siSTIMATE-treated cells by overexpression of an siRNA-resistant variant of STIMATE (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">To further demonstrate the role of STIMATE in modulating SOCE, we generated STIMATE knockout (STIMATE-KO) HEK293 stable cell lines by disrupting exon 4 of human <italic>STIMATE</italic> with the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing tool<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Gene disruption was validated using both the Surveyor nuclease assay and Sangerâs sequencing of exon 4 (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2câd</xref>). In two stable STIMATE-KO clones harboring early stop codons, the cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in response to ionomycin-induced store depletion (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>) was profoundly reduced, whilst the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store remained largely unaltered (first peak, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). Together, these results suggest that STIMATE is a previously-unrecognized positive modulator of SOCE.</p>
    <p id="P7"><italic>STIMATE</italic> is broadly expressed in mouse and human tissues (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). STIMATE protein is predicted to contain multiple putative transmembrane (TM) segments with a polybasic C tail (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), but its subcellular localization and membrane topology remain unknown. When overexpressed in HEK293, HeLa or COS-7 cells, STIMATE localised to ER and overlapped tightly with the ER marker Sec61Î²<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> or DsRed-ER (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, STIMATE exhibited a predominant PM-like localisation with a small pool trapped intracellularly when the last 74 amino acids was truncated (STIMATE<sub>1â220</sub>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Through a serial truncation study combined with site-directed mutagenesis, we further mapped a region (residues <sup>241</sup>KXRXRR<sup>246</sup>) that seems to be critical for keeping STIMATE localised within the ER. Substitution of these positively charged residues with glutamines (K or R&gt;Q mutant) caused a large fraction of the ER-resident STIMATE<sub>1â250</sub>-mCherry to exhibit a PM-like distribution (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Next, we performed a chemical cross-linking experiment to examine the oligomeric state of STIMATE. As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, addition of membrane-permeable cross-linker DSS resulted in the appearance of protein bands corresponding to multimers of STIMATE on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that STIMATE could be assembled as oligomers in ER membrane. This result echoes the presence of a GXXXG transmembrane association motif<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> in one of its predicted TM segments (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). The tendency of STIMATE to multimerize was further attested by the efficient restoration of YFP fluorescence when STIMATE was C-terminally tagged with two complementary non-fluorescent YFP fragments in the BiFc assay (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1bâc</xref>). The membrane topology of STIMATE was further determined by using a fluorescence protease protection assay (FPP)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, with EGFP-STIM1 and STIM1-YFP as controls. We found that both termini of STIMATE face toward the cytosolic side of ER (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1eâh</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">We next examined whether STIMATE is located in the vicinity of the two major players of SOCE, STIM1 and ORAI1. When expressed together with ORAI1 or STIM1 in HEK293 cells, STIMATE colocalised tightly with STIM1 to ER but not with ORAI1 at resting conditions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), a finding that is further corroborated by results from an independent FRET assay (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Discernible FRET signals were only detected in HEK293 cells cotransfected with CFP-STIMATE and STIM1-YFP but not in cells coexpressing CFP-STIMATE and ORAI1-YFP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). When expressed alone or coexpressed with an ER marker in HEK293, HeLa or COS-7 cells, STIMATE did not seem to globally translocate to ER-PM junctions as STIM1 did after store depletion (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). However, when STIMATE was coexpressed with STIM1 in the same cell, we observed the colocalisation of STIMATE with STIM1 at ER-PM junctions in a fraction of cells after store depletion. This phenomenon was less obvious under the confocal microscope but more pronounced when cells were examined by TIRF microscopy, which reports exclusively on fluorescence within 200 nm above the coverslip (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). The coexpression of ORAI1 did not seem to increase the degree or tendency of STIMATE to colocalise with STIM1 (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4câd</xref>). Thus, a portion of STIMATE might translocate to ER-PM junctions in a STIM1-dependent manner in store-depleted cells. Together, our data imply that STIMATE colocalises with STIM1 within the ER and might also reside in close proximity to STIM1 at ER-PM junctions in response to store depletion in mammalian cells.</p>
    <p id="P9">After expression of mCherry-STIMATE in HEK293 cells cotransfected with STIM1, we frequently observed the spontaneous formation of STIM1 puncta even when the ER store was not depleted (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4bâc</xref>). This scenario was most prominently visualized in cells stably expressing both ORAI1-CFP and STIM1-YFP (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3aâc</xref>). STIM1 puncta could be readily detected in cells transfected with mCherry-STIMATE before store depletion. In contrast, the other cells in the same field without STIMATE overexpression showed an even distribution of STIM1 at the footprint of HEK293 cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Upon store depletion, STIMATE-expressing cells formed significantly larger STIM1 puncta (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Consistent with the pre-formation of STIM1 puncta before store depletion, overexpression of mCherry-STIMATE also elicited constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in these stably expressing cells when we switched the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 0 to 1 mM (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux could be reversed by withdrawing Ca<sup>2+</sup> or by adding 2-APB, a pharmacological tool that is widely used to block SOCE at high concentrations (~50â100 Î¼M).</p>
    <p id="P10">These findings led us to propose that STIMATE could modulate STIM1 puncta formation at ER-PM junctions. Indeed, genetic disruption of <italic>STIMATE</italic> in HEK293 (STIMATE-KO) cells induced a substantial reduction in the amounts of STIM1 puncta at ER-PM junctions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). Compared to TG-stimulated normal HEK293 cells, the fluorescence intensity of EGFP-STIM1 at the TIRF layer of STIMATE-KO cells dropped by almost 70%. STIMATE knockout appreciably delayed the formation of STIM1 puncta, and resulted in a significant reduction in the puncta size at ER-PM junctions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). An appreciable (~10â15%), but less pronounced, reduction in puncta formation was also observed in STIMATE knockout cells expressing the STIM1 gain-of-function mutants D76A and L258G (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5aâd</xref>). Subsequent scrutiny under high-resolution electron microscopy (EM) further revealed that fewer STIM1 proteins migrated into cortical ER (cER, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>), a specialized ER network that lies immediately beneath the PM (&lt;20~30 nm). In aggregate, these results indicate that STIMATE is required to promote efficient STIM1 clustering at ER-PM junctions, which might be achieved through modulating cER accumulation or modulating STIM1 activation as described below.</p>
    <p id="P11">To examine the effect of STIMATE depletion on cER, we compared the cER accumulation in native and STIMATE-KO HEK293 cells. We used the genetically-encoded fluorescent cER marker, MAPPER (<italic>m</italic>embrane-<italic>a</italic>ttached <italic>p</italic>eri<italic>p</italic>heral <italic>ER</italic>), as readout because it has been recently shown to selectively label cER and colocalise tightly with activated STIM1 puncta at ER-PM junctions<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We noted that depletion of STIMATE caused approximately 8â10% decrease in the intensity or density of cER in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5fâh</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the constitutive localization of MAPPER at ER-PM junctions might cause bias in our analysis on cER, we created an optogenetic tool, LiMETER (<italic>l</italic>ight-<italic>i</italic>nducible <italic>me</italic>mbrane-<italic>t</italic>ethered peripheral <italic>ER,</italic>
<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 2</xref>), to reversibly label cER. The ER luminal domain of LiMETER is composed of a signal peptide and the single TM domain derived from STIM1, with GFP placed in between as reporter. The cytoplasmic region of LiMETER contains a flexible linker and a genetically-encoded lightswitch LOV2 domain (Light Oxygen Voltage-sensing domain, residues 404â546) derived from <italic>Avena sativa</italic> phototrophin 1 (refs. <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), followed by a C-terminal PM-targeting polybasic tail isolated from the small G protein Rit<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). In the dark, the JÎ± helix docks to the LOV2 domain and cages the polybasic tail to prevent its interaction with negatively-charged PM-resident phosphoinositides. Upon blue light stimulation, photoexcitation generates a covalent adduct between a cysteine residue (C450) and the flavin cofactor in LOV2, and subsequently promotes the undocking and unwinding of the JÎ± helix<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, thereby exposing the Rit polybasic C-tail to enable translocation of the protein toward PM to form puncta-like structures<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. As a result, LiMETER underwent photo-inducible accumulation at ER-PM junctions to specifically label cER (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 2</xref>). Notably, this process can be reversibly repeated with multiple light-dark cycles without significant loss in the magnitude of response (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). This unique tool enables us to quantitatively examine the effect of STIMATE depletion on the dynamics of cER accumulation at defined spatiotemporal resolution. When compared to native HEK293 cells, we observed 10â12% decrease in the rate and extent of LiMETER accumulation at ER-PM junctions in STIMATE-KO HEK293 cells after blue light illumination (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4câd</xref>). Thus, by using either MAPPER or LiMETER as cER marker, we found that genetic depletion of STIMATE noticeably affects cER accumulation in HEK293 cells. Nonetheless, the ~10% decrease in the efficiency of cER accumulation could not fully explain the more pronounced effect (~70%) on STIM1 puncta formation in STIMATE-depleted cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3dâe</xref>). This prompted us to further explore alternative mechanisms by focusing on the initial activation steps of STIM1.</p>
    <p id="P12">Results from both the BiFc (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1aâc</xref>) and FRET (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>) assays suggest a possible interaction between STIMATE and STIM1 in HEK293 cells. We further confirmed this by using coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). To investigate how STIMATE modulates STIM1 actions, we applied a combination of CoIP (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) and FRET (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>) methods to map the domain(s) within STIM1 that mediate its interaction with STIMATE. We narrowed down the minimal STIMATE-interacting domain to the juxtamembrane coiled coil region of STIM1 (STIM1-CC1, residues 233â343). In both assays, the minimal ORAI-activating domain of STIM1 (CAD/SOAR)<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> showed negligible or no discernible interaction with STIMATE. Since the longest cytosolic fragment of STIMATE protein is its C-terminal region (STIMATE-CT, residues 214â294, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), we further expressed STIMATE-CT in bacteria and purified the recombinant protein to examine whether it would directly interact with STIM1 cytosolic domains. GST-tagged STIMATE-CT immobilized on GS4B resin was able to pull down both the entire STIM1 cytoplasmic domain (233â685) and STIM1-CC1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). The dissociation constant of the interaction between STIMATE-CT and STIM1-CC1 was further determined to be 8.9 Â± 0.7 Î¼M (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). Overall, these studies clearly demonstrated a direct physical contact between STIMATE and STIM1 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
    <p id="P13">After store depletion, STIM1 is activated through a conformational switch mechanism by undocking CAD/ SOAR from CC1, thus projecting CAD/ SOAR toward the PM to engage and gate ORAI1 channels<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. The observation of a direct interaction between STIMATE-CT and STIM1-CC1 raised the possibility that STIMATE might promote STIM1 conformational switch through disrupting the intramolecular trapping mediated by CC1-SOAR association<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. To test this, we developed a two-component FRET assay by fusing CFP or YFP to STIM1<sub>1â310</sub> and SOAR, respectively. This assay enabled us to monitor CC1-SOAR interaction in real time, and more importantly, to examine the effect of STIMATE on the STIM1 conformational switch in living cells<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Under resting conditions, YFP-SOAR was tightly docked toward the ER-resident STIM1<sub>1â310</sub> and showed a high resting FRET signal (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Upon ionomycin stimulation, YFP-SOAR undocked from CC1 and thus caused a profound decrease of the FRET signal. The coexpression of STIMATE in this assay significantly reduced the resting FRET signal (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>), implying that STIMATE could at least partially release STIM1 autoinhibition possibly by weakening CC1-SOAR association at rest. STIMATE-CT exhibited a similar effect but was much less potent, likely because this process requires anchoring of the STIMATE C-tail in the vicinity of the ER membrane or it involves coordinated actions of the C-tail with other regions of STIMATE. The consequence of STIMATE-mediated action on STIM1 was further reflected in enhanced FRET signals between CFP-STIM1 and YFP-STIM1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>) or STIM1-YFP and ORAI1-CFP at rest (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>), and culminated in constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Clearly, our data provide compelling evidence to support a model in which STIMATE interacts with the juxtamembrane CC1 region of STIM1 to perturb the CC1-SOAR association that is the basis for STIM1 autoinhibition<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, thereby shifting the equilibrium toward activated states to promote the conformational switch and subsequent translocation of STIM1 toward ER-PM junctions.</p>
    <p id="P14">In summary, we have applied a non-disruptive biotin labeling approach to capture protein complexes in close proximity to STIM1 at ER-PM junctions in living cells. Our findings not only afford an initial view on the protein composition of intact ER-PM junctions under physiological conditions, but also provide a framework for future dissection of their roles in cellular signaling, human health and disease. In particular, our study has established an irreplaceable role of the previously-unrecognized ER-resident protein STIMATE in modulating STIM1-depedent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at ER-PM junctions. Major questions that warrant further investigation include i) how STIMATE choreographs with other components at ER-PM junctions to coordinate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and other cellular events; and ii) how STIMATE itself contributes to the formation and maintenance of ER-PM junctions.</p>

        <p id="P26">Intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] were measured with Fura-2 AM as previously described<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. In brief, HEK293 WT or STIM1-YFP/ORAI1-CFP stable cells were seeded and cultured on cover slips at least one day before imaging. To load Fura-2 AM, HEK293 cells were first kept in the imaging solution with 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 Î¼M Fura-2 AM for 30 min. Next, cells were kept in Fura-2 AM free imaging solution with 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for another 30 min. For cells transfected with STIMATE that has constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, 300 Î¼M Ca<sup>2+</sup> or nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup> free solution were used to keep cells healthy. Emission fluorescence at 509 nm generated by 340-nm excitation light (F<sub>340</sub>) and 380-nm light (F<sub>380</sub>) was collected every two seconds, and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are shown as F<sub>340</sub>/F<sub>380</sub> ratio. After careful calibration, the Fura-2 intensities were further converted to Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations as we routinely did in previous studies<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.

        <p id="P27">The same system used in Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements plus an Optosplit II Image Splitter (Cairn Research Limited) was used for FRET measurements. CFP (428.9Â±5.5<sub>Ex</sub>/ 465Â±32<sub>Em</sub>), YFP (502.6Â±11.2<sub>Ex</sub>/ 549Â±21<sub>Em</sub>), FRET<sub>raw</sub> (428.9Â±5.5<sub>Ex</sub>/ 549Â±21<sub>Em</sub>) filters were used to capture raw images (F<sub>CFP</sub>, F<sub>YFP</sub> and F<sub>raw</sub>, respectively) every 10 seconds at room temperature. To generate apparent FRET efficiency, E<sub>app</sub>, the following calculations on raw images were performed: First, three channel corrected FRET was calculated using the following formula:

Second, to reduce variations caused by differences in expression levels, FRET<sub>c</sub> values were further normalized against donor fluorescence (F<sub>CFP</sub>) to generate N-FRET (normalized FRET) signal. Third, E<sub>app</sub>, was calculated using the following equation:

A fluorescence probe, YFP-STIM1-D76G-CFP was expressed in HEK293 cells to examine the relative expression level of CFP tagged protein to YFP tagged ones. YFP and CFP of this probe is separated by ER membrane with a distance more than 10 nm, thus used as a negative control in our experiments<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. To minimize fluctuations in E<sub>app</sub> caused by variations of relative expression levels of donor protein to acceptor protein, only cells with F<sub>CFP</sub>/F<sub>YFP</sub> ratio falling between 0.7~1.4 were used for data analysis. All fluorescence images were collected and processed with MetaFluor software (Molecular Devices), and the resulting data were further analyzed with Matlab R2012b software and plotted with Prism5 software. Representative traces of at least three independent experiments are shown as mean Â± s.e.m.</p>

        <p id="P28">HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM as described above in 24-well plates. After reaching 40â50% confluence, siRNA oligos were transfected using DharmaFECT (GE Dharmacon) for 48h before further transfection of NFAT-luciferase reporter gene pGL4.30[luc2P/NFAT-RE/Hygro] (Promega). The Renilla luciferase gene (pRL-TK) was cotransfected as a control for counting transfected cells and normalizing the luminescence signals. HEK293 cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 1 Î¼M) and thapsigargin (1 Î¼M) for 8 hours. Three duplicates were used for each treatment. Cells were then harvested and lysed by following the manufacturerâs protocol. Luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on a Biotek Synergy2 luminescence microplate reader. The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity was plotted for HEK293 cells. All the data were normalized against the control group. For the rescue group, after 48 h treatment with siRNA, HEK293 cells were further transfected with the siSTIMATE-resistant variant of mCherry-STIMATE, along with the NFAT-luciferase reporter genes and pRL-TK.</p>

All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 100 units ml<sup>â1</sup> penicillin, 100 Î¼g ml<sup>â1</sup> streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, unless otherwise noted. Confocal imaging was performed as previously described<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. TIRF images were acquired on a NIKON Eclipse Ti-E microscope customized with Nikon A1R+ confocal laser sources with a 60X, NA 1.49 oil-immersion TIRF objective (Nikon). A 488-nm laser was used to excite GFP, and a 561-nm laser to excite mCherry. For two-color imaging, 100-nm fluorescent beads (TetraSpecK Microspheres, Life Technologies) were deposited onto a coverslip and imaged as markers for later alignment.</p>
        <p id="P31">To monitor LiMETER accumulation at ER-PM junctions, 50 ng LiMETER was transfected into normal or STIMATE-KO HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies). Confocal images were acquired by using the Nikon A1R+ confocal laser sources. Images representative of the dark state of LiMETER (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> with relatively low resolution) were acquired within 1 sec using fast scanning mode to minimize photoactivation of LiMETER by the 488-nm light source. TIRF time-lapse imaging of LiMETER was performed 24â36 h posttransfection. The 488-nm laser source used to acquire the GFP signal of LiMETER was applied to activate the photoswitch LOV2. The images were acquired every 5 seconds for 5 minutes as one cycle. The cells were then kept in the dark for 5â10 minutes, followed by subsequent cycles of photostimulation.</p>

The size of GFP-STIM1 puncta shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> were quantified using Image J. Regions of interest (ROIs) within the images were determined using a manually selected pixel intensity threshold and the total pixel number per ROI was determined as a measure of puncta size. Using the same image analysis strategy, HRP-STIM1 relative distribution in ER was determined by measuring the total length of HRP-positive STIM1 segments and the length of multiple HRP-positive STIM1 segments migrated into cortical ER (separated within 20 nm from the PM). Pearson correlation coefficient between EGFP-STIM1 and mCherry-STIMATE was calculated using the built-in colocalization analysis module of the NIS-Elements AR software. To determine the intensity, size and number of MAPPER or LiMETER accumulation at cER and STIM1 puncta at ER-PM junctions, the TIRF images were background subtracted and converted to binary images to identify dim puncta and define the edges based on optimized thresholds using the NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon).</p>

        <p id="P35">SPR-based Biacore experiments were performed at 25 Â°C on a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Immobilized STIM1-CC1 sensor surface was prepared by ligand thiol coupling through the single cysteine residue at the N-terminus of CGG-CC1 (ref. <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The sensor chip CM3 and reagents for thiol coupling were purchased from GE Healthcare. The immobilization was performed at 5 Î¼l min<sup>â1</sup> flow rate with PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl). Flow cell was activated by 0.4 M 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 0.1 M N-hyroxysuccinimide followed by washing with 80 mM of 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine hydrochloride (GE Healthcare) in 0.1 M sodium borate (pH 8.5) to introduce reactive disulfide groups on the surface. 30 Î¼l of STIM1-CC1 (10 Î¼g ml<sup>â1</sup> in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5) was injected to the activated surface and then blocked with 20 Î¼l of Cysteine-NaCl. Approximately 550 RU (response unit) of STIM1-CC1 was immobilized. A reference flow cell was prepared with the same activation and blocking steps but without any protein coupled.

        <p><bold>a,</bold> Schematic depiction of proteomic mapping of potential STIM1 interactors at ER-PM junctions through APEX2-mediated biotin-labelling <italic>in situ</italic>. APEX2 fused to STIM1 enables biotin labelling on proteins located &lt;20 nm from STIM1. This reaction requires externally added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Biotinylated proteins were further affinity-enriched with streptavidin beads, with the eluted products analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS).</p>
        <p><bold>b,</bold> Fluorescence imaging of biotinylated proteins (stained with streptavidin conjugated with Dylight594) in HEK293 cells expressing GFP-STIM1-APEX2 as illustrated in panel <bold>a</bold>. Store depletion was induced by 1 Î¼M thapsigargin (TG) in nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup> and serum free medium. Scale bar, 5 Î¼m.</p>
        <p><bold>c,</bold> Silver staining and immunoblotting of biotinylated protein complexes surrounding STIM1 puncta at ER-PM junctions. Shown on the SDS-PAGE were samples before (lanes 1â3) and after (lanes 4â6) streptavidin bead enrichment, as well as the eluted samples immunoblotted by streptavidin conjugated by horseradish peroxidase (streptavidin-HRP, lanes 7â9).</p>
        <p><bold>d,</bold> Scatter plot of identified potential STIM1 binding partners. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFc, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a-c</xref>) was used as a secondary assay to confirm strong hits that emerged from the proteomic study. The N-terminal fragment of YFP (YFP<sub>N</sub>, residues 1â155) is fused to the STIM1 C-terminus as the bait to interact with prey in a customized library containing candidate genes fused with the C-terminal half of YFP (YFP<sub>C</sub>, residues 156â238). Each candidate was plotted according to its MS spectral counts (Y axis) and the degree of YFP fluorescence restoration (X axis, as shown in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

        <title>Effect of STIMATE depletion on cER accumulation reported by LiMETER</title>
        <p><bold>a,</bold> Design of LiMETER as an optogenetic tool to photo-manipulate ER-PM junctions and reversibly label cER. The ER luminal region of LiMETER includes a signal peptide (SP) and the single transmembrane domain (TM) derived from human STIM1, with GFP inserted in between as reporter. The cytoplasmic region is composed of a (GA)<sub>6</sub> linker, the lightswitch LOV2 domain and a PM-targeting polybasic tail (PB) derived from the small GTPase Rit.</p>
        <p><bold>b,</bold> In the dark, the LOV2 JÎ± helix keeps the polybasic C-tail caged to prevent its targeting toward PM. LiMETER appears as a typical ER-resident protein like STIM1 at its resting state. Upon blue light stimulation (450â490 nm), the unwinding of the JÎ± helix exposes the PB domain to associate with phosphoinositides enriched in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby promoting the formation of LiMETER puncta at cER (much as STIM1 forms puncta at ER-PM junctions). The confocal images on the right are representative confocal sections at the footprint or the middle layers of a typical LiMETER-expressing HEK293 cell before (upper) and after photoactivation (lower). A 488-nm laser was used as the light source to activate LiMETER while acquiring the GFP signals. Scale bar, 10 Î¼m.</p>
        <p><bold>c-d,</bold> Representative TIRF images (<bold>c</bold>) and time course (<bold>d</bold>) of LiMETER accumulation at cER in response to light stimulation (488 nm with an estimated power density of 50 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) in normal (<italic>upper</italic>) or STIMATE-KO HEK293 cells (<italic>lower</italic>). For points falling within the time window of 125â175 s or 600â650 s, the difference of signal between control and STIMATE-KO was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). Nonetheless, no significant difference was observed in the rate of LiMETER translocation toward cER (P = 0.07, paired Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test). The LiMETER intensity was quantified using ImageJ software. Error bars denote s.e.m. for n=10 (control) or n=12 cells (STIMATE-KO) pooled across three independent experiment that emitted comparable total fluorescence signals under epifluorescence microscopy. Scale bar, 10 Î¼m.</p>
