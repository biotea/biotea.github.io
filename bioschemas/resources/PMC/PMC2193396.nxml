      <abstract>
        <p>Neutrophils are markedly less sensitive to glucocorticoids than T cells, making it difficult to control inflammation in neutrophil-mediated diseases. Development of new antiinflammatory strategies for such diseases would be aided by an understanding of mechanisms underlying differential steroid responsiveness. Two protein isoforms of the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) exist, GRÎ± and GRÎ², which arise from alternative splicing of the GR pre-mRNA primary transcripts. GRÎ² does not bind glucocorticoids and is an inhibitor of GRÎ± activity. Relative amounts of these two GRs can therefore determine the level of glucocorticoid sensitivity. In this study, human neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were studied to determine the relative amounts of each GR isoform.</p>
        <p>The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) using immunofluorescence analysis for GRÎ± was 475 Â± 62 and 985 Â± 107 for PBMCs and neutrophils, respectively. For GRÎ², the MFI was 350 Â± 60 and 1,389 Â± 143 for PBMCs and neutrophils, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). After interleukin (IL)-8 stimulation of neutrophils, there was a statistically significant increase in intensity of GRÎ² staining to 2,497 Â± 140 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). No change in GRÎ± expression was observed. This inversion of the GRÎ±/GRÎ² ratio in human neutrophils compared with PBMCs was confirmed by quantitative Western analysis. Increased GRÎ² mRNA expression in neutrophils at baseline, and after IL-8 exposure, was observed using RNA dot blot analysis. Increased levels of GRÎ±/GRÎ² heterodimers were found in neutrophils as compared with PBMCs using coimmunoprecipitation/Western analysis. Transfection of mouse neutrophils, which do not contain GRÎ², resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of cell death when treated with dexamethasone.</p>
        <p>We conclude that high constitutive expression of GRÎ² by human neutrophils may provide a mechanism by which these cells escape glucocorticoid-induced cell death. Moreover, upregulation of this GR by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 further enhances their survival in the presence of glucocorticoids during inflammation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including severe asthma <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>, psoriasis <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>, and a variety of collagen-vascular diseases <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref>. These cells are known to be less sensitive to glucocorticoids than other white blood cell types <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>. Moreover, glucocorticoid treatment actually inhibits their cell death in vitro <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>. This is in contrast to T cells, where workers have shown that steroids induce apoptosis <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref>. Thus, use of glucocorticoid therapy in the treatment of neutrophil-associated inflammation is of major clinical concern in terms of disease resolution.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms by which human T cell and neutrophil apoptotic responses to glucocorticoids differ are unknown. Glucocorticoid action is mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is found in the cytosol of most human cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>. As the result of alternative splicing of the GR pre-mRNA, there are two homologous mRNAs and protein isoforms, termed GRÎ± and GRÎ². Both mRNAs contain the same first eight exons of the GR gene <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref>. The remainder is derived by alternative splicing of the last exon of the GR gene, resulting in either inclusion or exclusion of exon 9Î±. The two protein isoforms have the same first 727 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal amino acids. GRÎ² differs from GRÎ± only in its COOH terminus with replacement of the last 50 amino acids of GRÎ± with a unique 15 amino acid sequence lacking a steroid binding domain. These differences render GRÎ² unable to bind glucocorticoids, reduces its binding affinity for DNA recognition sites, abolishes its ability to transactivate glucocorticoid-sensitive genes, and makes it function as a dominant inhibitor of GRÎ±, possibly through formation of antagonistic GRÎ±/GRÎ² heterodimers <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R18">18</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we confirm that T cells and neutrophils respond differentially to dexamethasone (DEX), the model steroid used. We have also found that IL-8 synergizes with DEX to decrease neutrophil cell death in vitro, and that both of these responses are associated with increases in the ratio of GRÎ² to GRÎ±. These observations suggest an alternate mode of action of GRs in neutrophils than that observed in PBMCs. On the one hand, glucocorticoids are ineffective at resolving neutrophil-associated inflammation. On the other hand, as glucocorticoids reduce the spontaneous cell death of these cells, neutrophils must be glucocorticoid-sensitive but simply do not react in the same manner as T cells. Therefore, in this study, two different approaches were chosen in an attempt to determine whether shifts in GRÎ² to GRÎ± levels could account for these different responses to steroids. First, by quantitating the relative levels of GRÎ± and GRÎ² in human neutrophils, in terms of protein and mRNA levels. Then second, because mouse neutrophils have no GRÎ², assessing whether introduction of the GRÎ² gene into mouse neutrophils changes the effects of glucocorticoids on neutrophil cell death.</p>

        <title>Preparation of Human Neutrophils.</title>
        <p>Human neutrophils were isolated from normal healthy individuals using a Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) density gradient <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>. In brief, 4.4 ml of 3.8% (wt/vol) sodium citrate (Fisher Scientific) was added to 40 ml of heparinized venous blood. The blood was then centrifuged at 400 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min. The plasma layer was then removed, 5 ml of 6% (wt/vol) dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then added to the pelleted whole blood, and the total volume was brought up to 50 ml with saline and mixed gently. The cell suspension was then left for 30 min at room temperature to allow the red blood cells to settle. The upper white blood cell layer was removed, centrifuged at 400 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, the supernatant discarded, and the pellet resuspended in 2 ml of autologous plasma. The cell suspension was then underlaid first with a 42% (wt/vol), then a 51% (wt/vol) Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 350 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The resulting neutrophil rich layer was carefully removed. Neutrophils were then resuspended in PBS, centrifuged at 350 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatant discarded.

        <title>Preparation of Murine Neutrophils.</title>
        <p>For preparation of murine neutrophils, individual BALB/c female mice were given a 1 ml intraperitoneal injection of 4% (wt/vol) Brewer's thioglycollate (DIFCO). After 4 h, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation and the peritoneal cavity washed with cold 1Ã PBS, 5 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich). The PBS/EDTA cell suspension was harvested with a syringe, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 3 ml 1Ã HBSS. The resulting cell suspension was then layered over a 55/65/81% Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 min. Neutrophils were harvested at the 65/81% interface. Harvested neutrophils were then washed in 1Ã HBSS, resuspended in RPMI, 10% FCS, and counted.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence Staining of Neutrophils and PBMCs for GRÎ± and GRÎ².</title>
        <p>Cytospins of both cell types were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with permeabilizing solution (PBS containing 0.5% [wt/vol] BSA, 0.1% [vol/vol] Tween 20, and 0.1% [wt/vol] saponin [Sigma-Aldrich]). The permeabilizing solution was then tipped off and the cytospins were blocked with a commercial blocking solution (Superblock; Scytek) for 15 min at room temperature. After the incubation period, the blocking solution was aspirated off and discarded. Cytospins were then incubated with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to human GRÎ± (Affinity BioReagents, Inc.) or anti-GRÎ² (preparation and specificity as described in references <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref>) and diluted in permeabilizing solution. Purified nonimmune rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) served as the control. The cytospins were then incubated overnight at 4Â°C. After the incubation period, the cytospins were washed in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 15 min at room temperature with gentle agitation, then incubated with a goat antiârabbit F(abâ²)<sub>2</sub> FITC conjugate (Dako) for 30 min at room temperature and washed in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 15 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.

        <title>Quantitative Western Analysis.</title>
        <p>Quantitative Western analysis was performed using specific anti-GRÎ± and GRÎ² polyclonal antibodies produced in our laboratory as described previously <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>. The GRÎ±-directed antibody has been extensively employed in detailed analyses of GRÎ± proteolytic cleavage <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref>. PBMCs and neutrophils were lysed at 4Â°C, and 100 Î¼g protein was applied to a 8% precast polyacrylamide-SDS gels (Novex) and electrophoresed in parallel with prestained markers (SeeBlueâ¢; Novex) to estimate molecular weight; increasing concentrations of peptide-BSA conjugate standard (5â25 ng corresponding to 70â360 fmol) were also used for quantitation. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h. Immunoblotting was performed at 4Â°C overnight using purified GRÎ±- and GRÎ²-specific polyclonal antibodies at 10 Î¼g/ml. The specificity of these antibodies were described in references <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref>. After washing, the blots were incubated at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated antiârabbit immunoglobulin antibody (Dako) at 1:4,000 dilution. Blots were washed and exposed to chemiluminescence solution for 1 min. (ECL kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by exposure to X-OMAT AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Band densities of the standards and the samples developed on the film were scanned and saved on computer disks for densitometry using the NIH image system 1.61 program.</p>

        <title>Demonstration of GRÎ±/GRÎ² Heterodimers by Western Blot Analysis.</title>
        <p>3 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs or neutrophils were lysed in a buffer containing the following protease inhibitors: 0.5 M EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 10 Î¼g/ml of leupeptin, aprotonin, antipain, and pepstatin (Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lysates were left on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed and then incubated overnight at 4Â°C with sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) covalently linked to a polyclonal antibody that recognized GRÎ±. The beads were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 s. The pelleted beads were then resuspended in loading buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl [Sigma-Aldrich], 4% [wt/vol] SDS, and 10% [vol/vol] Î²-mercaptoethanol [Boehringer]).</p>
        <p>The beads were then boiled for 5 min and loaded onto a 10% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide mini-gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories) under reducing conditions. The gel was run at 80 V in a running buffer containing the following: 0.3% (wt/vol) Tris-HCl, 1.4% (wt/vol) glycine, and 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS (Boehringer), until the loading dye reached the end of the gel. After the electrophoresis, the protein was transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 50 mA for 1 h using a semidry transfer system (BioRad Laboratories). The transfer buffer contained the following: 48 mM Tris-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 39 mM glycine, and 20% methanol (Sigma-Aldrich). The nitrocellulose paper was then blocked overnight at 4Â°C with 5% BSA (wt/vol; Sigma-Aldrich) in 1Ã dilution buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; Sigma-Aldrich). After the incubation period, the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with an antibody specific to GRÎ². The antibody was diluted in PBS containing 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% (wt/vol) BSA (Sigma-Aldrich). After the incubation period, the membrane was washed in PBS, 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20 for 1 h, then incubated for 1 h with an antiârabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Dako) diluted in 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1Ã dilution buffer. The membrane was then washed in 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) 1Ã dilution buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and specific bands were visualized using a commercial chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).</p>

        <title>RNA Dot Blot Analysis.</title>
        <p>Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from 10<sup>7</sup> cells (PBMCs or neutrophils) as follows: the cells were cracked in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 mM EDTA) containing 0.5% NP-40 and 10 mM vanadyl ribonucleoside complex. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 <italic>g</italic>. RNA was subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and EtOH precipitation. The RNA was applied to nitrocellulose sheets using vacuum transfer (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and cross-linked at 80Â°C under vacuum for 2 h. GR RNA was detected by hybridization to 50 base, biotinylated probes. Total GR (GRÎ± plus GRÎ²) was detected with a probe to exon 9-Î²: 5â²-TTTTAGTCTAATTACACACTCTACACGAAAGACCAAAATTGGTGTATTG-3â². GRÎ± RNA was detected with an oligonucleotide that specifically recognized exon 9-Î±: 5â²-TACCAGAATAGGTTTTTACAAACCTTCGTTATCAATTCCTCTAAAAGTTG-3â².</p>
        <p>It was not possible to probe for GRÎ² mRNA specifically in these studies due to poor specificity of the oligonucleotide probe directed to the exon 8/9Î² junction, which is the only part of the GRÎ² mRNA which is not also included in the GRÎ± mRNA. Specificity of the probes was verified by hybridization to GRÎ± and Î² cDNAs prepared from the expression plasmids Rous sarcoma human (pRSh) GRÎ± and pRSh GRÎ². Cross-hybridization of the biotinylated GRÎ± probe to cDNA derived from pRSh GRÎ² was not noted. After hybridization, the blots were incubated in buffer with streptavidin-linked alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and specific bands were visualized using a chromogenic system comprising 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Boehringer).</p>
        <p>Transfection of murine neutrophils with a GRÎ² containing plasmid neutrophils were transfected with pRSh GRÎ² that contains the full-length coding region of GRÎ² under the control of the constitutively active Rous sarcoma virus promoter <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R18">18</xref>. As a control, a commercially available plasmid vector was used, plasmid green fluorescent protein (pGFP)-C1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). Reversible permeabilization of cells using the pore-forming agent, streptolysin O, was used to enhance uptake of the plasmid <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R22">22</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref>. Streptolysin O (Lee Laboratories) was preactivated with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT; Bio-Rad Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature, then added to a transfection medium (TM) consisting of RPMI 1640, 40 Î¼M <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and 20 mM Hepes (GIBCO BRL) at a concentration of 20 U/ml with 10 Î¼g of plasmid (pRSh GRÎ² or pGFP-C; CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). Freshly isolated murine neutrophils (described above) were then resuspended (4 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells total) in 200 Î¼l of this streptolysin O/TM/plasmid medium and incubated for 5 min at 37Â°C. The cells were then resuspended at 10<sup>6</sup>/ml in of RPMI 1640, 40 Î¼M <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 20 mM Hepes, and 10% (vol/vol) FCS (GIBCO BRL). Confirmation of GRÎ² expression of pRSh GRÎ² transfected cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IMF) staining. The method used is described in full earlier; however, the secondary antibody used for this staining was an antiârabbit Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Transfection efficiency was determined by capturing images of 10 fields per sample, and counting the number of GFP-positive cells. Identification of negative cells was accomplished by nuclear counterstaining with 300 nM 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich). Transfection efficiency was calculated as the average percentage of GFP-positive cells per field.</p>

        <p>Cells were cultured overnight in 48-well flat-bottomed plates with or without 10<sup>â6</sup> M DEX (Sigma-Aldrich). After this incubation period, cells were washed and resuspended in 600 Î¼l of 1Ã PBS. Each individual sample (<italic>n</italic> = 7) was divided in two 300-Î¼l aliquots one of which received no treatment as a control the other was stained with propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 0.3 Î¼g/ml. PI positivity was determined by flow cytometry (FACScanâ¢; Becton Dickinson) and expressed as percentage of positive cells. Cells were also analyzed via terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) to confirm that PI staining corresponded well with TUNEL staining.</p>

        <title>GR Protein and mRNA Levels in Human Neutrophils.</title>
        <p>Freshly isolated PBMCs and neutrophils expressed both GR isoforms. By immunofluorescence, the GRs were localized to the cytoplasm of both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), although in some cases a subpopulation of neutrophils did exhibit strong baseline nuclear staining (data not shown). In neutrophils, GRÎ² immunoreactive protein was expressed at a higher level than GRÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. B</xref>, respectively). Of interest, when neutrophils were incubated with IL-8, a marked upregulation of GRÎ² immunoreactivity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> C). Conversely in PBMCs, GRÎ± protein was expressed at a higher level than GRÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. E</xref>, respectively).</p>
        <p>Using image analysis, we were able to quantify the relative intensity of GRÎ² and GRÎ± staining by MFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and confirm our observation of the high expression of GRÎ² in neutrophils. For PBMCs and neutrophils, the GRÎ± MFIs were 475 Â± 62 and 985 Â± 107, respectively. In contrast, GRÎ² MFIs were 350 Â± 60 vs. 1,389 Â± 143 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in PBMCs versus neutrophils, respectively. After IL-8 stimulation of neutrophils for 24 h, there was a significant further increase in the intensity of GRÎ² staining to 2,497 Â± 140 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 compared with medium control). However, no change in GRÎ± expression was observed.</p>
        <p>To quantify the absolute amounts of GRÎ± and GRÎ² contained in the cells, we performed quantitative Western analysis of cell extracts. Immunoreactive GRÎ± and GRÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), expressed as fmol/Î¼g protein, showed higher concentrations of GRÎ± than GRÎ² in PBMCs (GRÎ±: 12.0 Â± 2.1; GRÎ²: 0.78 Â± 0.2; mean Â± SEM). In contrast, GRÎ² was expressed at higher concentrations than GRÎ± in neutrophils (GRÎ±: 1.6 Â± 1.0; GRÎ²: 4.2 Â± 0.9; mean Â± SEM). Thus, in keeping with the IMF data, GRÎ² was expressed at higher level in neutrophils than PBMCs. The relative GRÎ²/GRÎ± ratio (calculated as mean GRÎ²/GRÎ± ratio of individual samples) was 73-fold higher in neutrophils (4.4 Â± 1.6; mean Â± SEM) than PBMCs (0.06 Â± 0.007; mean Â± SEM). When the two populations of cells were compared, a significant difference was found analyzing the GRÎ± expression (neutrophils versus PBMCs; <italic>P</italic> = 0.003; <italic>t</italic> test), as well as the GRÎ² expression (neutrophils versus PBMCs; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test), and the GRÎ²/GRÎ± ratio (neutrophils versus PBMCs; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test).</p>

        <title>RNA Dot Blot Analysis.</title>
        <p>Dot blot analysis of mRNA levels revealed that GRÎ± mRNA in PBMCs was expressed at a higher level than GRÎ² mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, lane 1). However, in neutrophils, GRÎ² mRNA was expressed at a greater level than GRÎ± mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, lane 2). After overnight stimulation of neutrophils with IL-8, there was an increase in total GR and GRÎ² mRNA levels. However, IL-8 reduced GRÎ± mRNA to undetectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, lane 3). Thus, the IL-8âinduced increase in total GR in neutrophils can be attributed to increased GRÎ².</p>

        <title>Presence of GRÎ±/GRÎ² Heterodimers in Neutrophils.</title>
        <p>High levels of GRÎ² may contribute to the formation of GRÎ±/GRÎ² heterodimers in neutrophils which could antagonize the function of GRÎ±/GRÎ± homodimers <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>. Therefore, we sought to determine the presence of heterodimers in neutrophils. An anti-GRÎ± antibody was used to immunoprecipitate both GRÎ± and complexes containing GRÎ±. The immunoprecipitate was electrophoresed on an agarose gel and then immunoblotted with an antibody specific for GRÎ² to detect GRÎ±/GRÎ² heterodimers.</p>
        <p>Neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, lanes 5â8) were found to contain markedly higher levels of GRÎ±/GRÎ² heterodimers than found in PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, lane 1â4). Beads alone did not precipitate any GRÎ± or GRÎ² (data not shown). These data demonstrate that GRÎ±/GRÎ² heterodimers are present in freshly isolated neutrophils at higher levels than found in PBMCs.</p>

        <title>Effect of Dexamethasone and IL-8 on Neutrophil Cell Death.</title>
        <p>Given the observation of heterodimer formation between GRÎ± and GRÎ² in human neutrophils, which could result in antagonism of GR activity, we examined neutrophils for their apoptotic responses to DEX in the presence and absence of IL-8. This analysis was performed using PI to stain dead cells in the population, which correlated well with TUNEL analysis, indicating that the cells had died via apoptosis. No significant reduction in the percentage of PI-positive cells was observed by incubation with IL-8 alone compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). However, incubation with DEX caused a significant decrease in PI-positive cells compared with the control (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). This rescue from cell death was further increased by incubation with IL-8 and DEX together (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Transfection of Murine Neutrophils with pRSh GRÎ² Expression Vector Alters Their Response to DEX.</title>
        <p>The association between elevated GRÎ² and reduced apoptosis in response to DEX raised the question of whether GRÎ² directly enables neutrophils to reduce their rate of apoptosis in response to DEX. As it is known that mice do not express GRÎ², they make an ideal model in which to temporarily cause expression of GRÎ² to answer this question <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref>.</p>
        <p>Transient expression of human GRÎ² in primary murine neutrophils required development of a method to efficiently introduce plasmid DNA into the cells. To accomplish this, we relied on transient permeabilization of the cells with streptolysin O, which has been employed in a similar manner by others <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R22">22</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref>. Permeabilization of the neutrophils in the presence of plasmid DNA encoding GFP under control of the CMV immediate early promoter resulted in efficient uptake and expression of the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Plasmid transfection efficiency was 63 Â± 10% (mean Â± SEM) as assessed by measuring the percentage of cells expressing GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> B). Cells that had been treated with streptolysin O in the presence of a control plasmid, which did not encode GFP, showed no fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> D).</p>
        <p>In contrast to the antiapoptotic effect of DEX on human neutrophils, treatment of mouse neutrophils with DEX increased their rate of cell death as measured by PI uptake (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>; control pGFP). Unstained cells from each test sample served as a negative control to allow appropriate gating. To examine whether this effect could be due to the lack of GRÎ² expression in these cells, freshly isolated neutrophils from BALB/c mice were transfected with pRSh GRÎ². In these experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 7), successful transfection was confirmed by demonstrating murine neutrophils to stain positive with anti-GRÎ² antibody after pRSh GRÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> F), but not control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> E), plasmid transfection. This difference between the two plasmid treatments was found to be highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) as determined by a paired Student's <italic>t</italic> test.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, treatment of the transfected neutrophils with DEX caused the cells treated with control plasmid pGFP to increase their rate of cell death by 9.4 Â± 3.2%, similar to untreated murine neutrophils. However, cells transfected with pRSh GRÎ² decreased their rate of cell death in response to DEX by 13.7 Â± 3.5%.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The mechanism by which neutrophils respond differently than T cells to glucocorticoids has not been resolved, although it is generally agreed that the GR must be intimately involved. Kato et al. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R25">25</xref> demonstrated that treatment of neutrophils with DEX significantly inhibited both spontaneous and TNF-Î±âinduced cell death. Moreover, this effect was completely reversed by a GR antagonist, RU 38486, and by cycloheximide. Similarly, Liles et al. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref> demonstrated that glucocorticoid treatment of neutrophils could inhibit cell death by up to 90%. GRÎ² attenuates GRE-mediated pathways <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref> and may therefore provide a natural mechanism for reducing glucocorticoid-induced cell death. The results of our studies confirm that DEX causes a reduction in the rate of spontaneous cell death by neutrophils. In addition, we have made a novel observation that preincubation of neutrophils with IL-8 dramatically enhances the protective effect of DEX.</p>
      <p>These studies also illustrate that the ratio of GRÎ² to GRÎ± is 73-fold greater in neutrophils than in PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This reflects differences observed in relative abundance of the mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). If an activity of GRÎ² is to attenuate GR binding and activation of GRE in response to DEX, we would expect to find GRÎ±/GRÎ² heterodimers in neutrophils after incubation with DEX, which were indeed much more abundant in neutrophils than in PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Heterodimers have only 15â20% of the transactivating activity of GRÎ± homodimers <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>. The rate of cell death in T lymphocytes is thought to be mediated through GRÎ± homodimers acting on GREs of glucocorticoid-sensitive genes <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R26">26</xref>. If the same mechanism is active in neutrophils, then the net effect of promoter activation via GRÎ± homodimers binding to GRE should be to promote cell death. However, DEX acts contrary to expectations in human neutrophils by promoting cell survival. In our studies, the prosurvival activity of DEX is associated with elevated GRÎ² in freshly isolated neutrophils, perhaps through formation of GRÎ±/GRÎ² heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). When the GRÎ² to GRÎ± ratio is increased after incubation with IL-8, the prosurvival effect of DEX is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although the prosurvival effect of DEX on human neutrophils is associated with elevated levels of GRÎ², additional evidence is required to assert that GRÎ² is functionally responsible for this effect. To properly confirm that GRÎ² is responsible for the prosurvival effects of DEX on neutrophils, it is useful to examine the effect of DEX on neutrophils which completely lack GRÎ². As it is known that mouse cells do not express the GRÎ² isoform of the GR <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref>, the mouse makes an ideal model for studying the role of GRÎ² in neutrophils in response to glucocorticoids. It is known that endogenous steroids such as cortisol can differ in both magnitude and mechanism of action; however, in this study DEX was chosen as the model steroid. Our data indicate that in contrast to human neutrophils, mouse neutrophils increase their rate of cell death in response to DEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). This indicates that in the absence of GRÎ², mouse neutrophils respond to DEX in the same manner as human PBMCs. However, there may be other important differences between human and murine neutrophils, and therefore proof of a functional role for GRÎ² in neutrophils requires that inducing GRÎ² expression in mouse neutrophils causes the effect of DEX to switch from promotion of cell death to promotion of cell survival.</p>
      <p>To induce GRÎ² expression in murine neutrophils, we had to develop a method to efficiently transfect this cell type, which has not previously been reported. After extensive screening of lipid-based transfection reagents and conditions for electroporation, we succeeded in transfecting primary murine neutrophils using streptolysin O to transiently permeabilize the cells in the presence of an pGFP expression vector driven by the CMV immediate early promoter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> B, this technique resulted in â¼63% of the cells expressing GFP, 18 h after transfection.</p>
      <p>Inducing GRÎ² expression in mouse neutrophils via transfection of pRSh GRÎ² was also successful, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> F. In fact, the observed transfection efficiency may have been somewhat higher due to the greater fluorescence quantum yield of the Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody used to detect GRÎ² relative to GFP. Induction of human GRÎ² expression in murine neutrophils did indeed alter the effect of DEX on them from promoting cell death, as in human PBMCs, to promoting cell survival, as in human neutrophils. Therefore, induction of GRÎ² expression in mouse neutrophils resulted in a steroid insensitivity pattern similar to that of human neutrophils.</p>
      <p>Whether GRÎ² has a functional role in steroid resistance has been a matter of major controversy. Bamberger et al. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref> and Oakley et al. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R18">18</xref> have both found that transfecting increasing amounts of GRÎ² expression vectors into various cell types inhibits the transactivating ability of GrÎ±. The main argument against this isoform having a functional role is its lack of a steroid binding domain. De Lange et al. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R27">27</xref> showed that even in the presence of 10-fold excess of GRÎ², GRÎ± was still able to activate transcription from the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter at the same rate. Similarly, Hecht et al. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R28">28</xref> were unable to demonstrate an inhibitory role for GRÎ² when transfected into COS7 cells. These discrepant results may be explained by the use of different vector systems, differences in cell or tissue specificity, or insufficient GRÎ² expression due to the transient transfection method used. Work presented in our study further delineates the mode of GRÎ² action and demonstrates a physiological role for this receptor in neutrophils.</p>
      <p>The data presented in this study demonstrate for the first time a role for GR in neutrophils. This observation implies an interaction between this receptor and DEX despite the absence of a glucocorticoid binding domain. One possible explanation of this would be through GRÎ² complexing with GRÎ±/DEX and exerting a cellular effect via formation of a heterodimer which is distinct from that of the homodimer rather than simply attenuating transcription from GREs. Moreover, as GRÎ² was found to be the predominant GR isoform in neutrophils, it follows that heterodimer, rather than homodimer, formation would be favored in these cells. Oakley et al. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref> demonstrated that use of a truncated form of GRÎ² (hGR728T) which lacked the unique 15 amino acids at the COOH terminus does not repress the transcriptional activity of GRÎ±. This final portion of the GRÎ² is also important in the heterodimerization with GRÎ±. The authors hypothesized that heterodimer formation may reduce the transcriptional activity of GRÎ± by denying access to GREs. An alternative explanation may be that different glucocorticoid-induced signaling pathways (one inducing apoptosis that can be inhibited by GRÎ², and one reducing apoptosis that can not be inhibited by GRÎ²) may be used in cells expressing high levels of GRÎ². The first pathway may be GRE dependent and the latter dependent on interaction of GR with other transcription factors like activating protein 1 (AP-1) or nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB, as the latter mechanism can not be inhibited by GRÎ² <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R29">29</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the elevated GRÎ² to GRÎ± ratio in freshly isolated neutrophils provides a novel mechanism by which neutrophils escape glucocorticoid-induced cell death in vivo. Moreover, the inflammatory environment in itself may increase neutrophil insensitivity by increasing the ratio of GRÎ² to GRÎ±, promoting further heterodimer formation. These data suggest that strategies aimed at reducing expression of GRÎ² in neutrophils may provide a starting point for the development of novel antiinflammatory treatments for neutrophil-associated disease.</p>

        <p>Immunofluorescence staining of PBMCs and neutrophils was performed using antibodies specific for either GRÎ± or GRÎ². A and B show GRÎ± and GRÎ² expression in resting neutrophils, respectively. After IL-8 stimulation, GRÎ² expression was increased as shown in C. In comparison, PBMCs were also stained for GRÎ± and GRÎ², which are shown in D and E, respectively. However, these GRs are expressed at a lower level than in neutrophils. F is a negative control consisting of affinity-purified rabbit IgG for the neutrophil staining (Ã60 objective).</p>

PBMCs showed weak bands indicating low levels of heterodimers (lanes 1â4). In contrast, neutrophils demonstrated strong GRÎ² staining, indicating a high level of GRÎ±/GRÎ² heterodimers (lanes 5â8).</p>

        <p>Transfection of mouse neutrophils with either pGFP or pRSh GRÎ² induces human GRÎ² protein expression. A (bright field) and B (fluorescence) show mouse neutrophils transfected with pGFP. Positive cells (green fluorescence) are observed in B. Negative cells (blue fluorescence) was visualized by counterstaining with DAPI (see Materials and Methods). Transfection efficiency was 63% in the experiment shown. Transfection efficiency was measured in two additional experiments, and found to vary from 63 to 70%. C (bright field) and D (fluorescence) show mouse neutrophils transfected with pCLeco as a control. Negative cells are observed in D (Ã40 objective). E are pRSh GRÎ² mouse neutrophils stained with a negative control antibody (rabbit IgG). Weak background staining is observed. F shows pRSh GRÎ² transfected neutrophils with many GRÎ² positively stained cells (Ã60 objective).</p>

        <p>Effect of pRSh GRÎ² vs. pGFP transfection on DEX-induced cell death by mouse neutrophils as measured by PI uptake. This shows the change in neutrophil PI positivity after DEX treatment in neutrophils transfected with either pRSh GRÎ² or control pGFP. Neutrophils transfected with pRSh GRÎ² showed a decrease in PI positivity as opposed to the control pGFP-treated neutrophils where an increase in PI positivity was observed.</p>
