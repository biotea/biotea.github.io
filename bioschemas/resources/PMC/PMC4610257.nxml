      <abstract>
        <p id="P4">The AAA-ATPase VCP (also known as p97 or CDC48) uses ATP hydrolysis to âsegregateâ ubiquitinated proteins from their binding partners. VCP acts via UBX-domain containing adaptors that provide target specificity, but targets and functions of UBXD proteins remain poorly understood. Through systematic proteomic analysis of UBXD proteins in human cells, we reveal a network of over 195 interacting proteins, implicating VCP in diverse cellular pathways. We have explored one such complex between an unstudied adaptor UBXN10 and the intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) complex, which regulates anterograde transport into cilia. UBXN10 localizes to cilia in a VCP-dependent manner and both VCP and UBXN10 are required for ciliogenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of VCP destabilized the IFT-B complex and increased trafficking rates. Depletion of UBXN10 in zebrafish embryos causes defects in left-right asymmetry, which depends on functional cilia. This study provides a resource for exploring the landscape of UBXD proteins in biology and identifies an unexpected requirement for VCP-UBXN10 in ciliogenesis.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P5">The VCP AAA-ATPase, an evolutionarily conserved ATP-driven âsegregaseâ, is a central regulator of protein quality control and ubiquitin-mediated signaling<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. VCP functions in diverse processes such as ER associated degradation, macro and selective autophagy and DNA damage responses (DDR)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. ATP hydrolysis by VCP remodels protein complexes, unfolds ubiquitylated substrates for degradation, and extracts proteins embedded in membranes or chromatin. The prevailing model suggests that specific adaptor proteins target VCP to cellular structures and substrates where VCP activity is required<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P6">The largest family of adaptors contains the ubiquitin X domain (UBXD), which adopts a ubiquitin fold and associates with the N-terminus of VCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. A subset of UBXD proteins also contain ubiquitin associated domains (UBA), to recognize polyubiquitin chains on substrates<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Other cofactors utilize shorter motifs to associate with VCP<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Some studies have suggested the involvement of distinct adaptors in specific processes, however UFD1L-NPLOC4 association with VCP is required in some cases for adaptor binding<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P7">Our understanding of how VCP is targeted to substrates is limited and only a subset of adaptors have been studied in detail. Even adaptors such as UBXN7 whose role in Cullin RING Ligase (CRL) function has been reported, the full repertoire of targets and biological pathways remain unknown. VCP is mutated in human neurodegenerative disorders including Inclusion Body Myopathy, Paget's disease of the bone and Frontotemporal Dementia (IBMPFD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. A significant fraction of disease-specific mutations cluster to the N-terminus where adaptors bind, suggesting that alterations in the repertoire of adaptors associated with VCP could contribute to disease<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Thus, a more complete understanding of adaptors and their targets is needed to fully understand VCP function.</p>
    <p id="P8">Here, we employed a previously described interaction proteomics platform<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> to analyze the VCP-UBXD interaction landscape, including several adaptors that are hitherto unstudied. The VCP-adaptor network is linked with a vast array of biological processes and we explore a interaction between the unstudied adaptor UBXN10 and the intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) complex involved in cilia biogenesis.</p>
    <p id="P9">Cilia are microtubule-based structures that are required for proper signaling in virtually every cell of the human body<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Defects in cilia formation or function cause a host of multi-system disorders referred to as ciliopathies. Cilia are assembled and disassembled by distinct IFT complexes that regulate anterograde (IFT-B) and retrograde (IFT-A) trafficking of ciliary components<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> in a BardetâBiedl syndrome (BBSome)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> complex-dependent manner. While hundreds of candidate ciliary proteins have been identified, their functions remain largely uncharacterized<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Through biochemical studies coupled with genetic and pharmacological disruption of VCP-UBXN10 function, we reveal a role for this complex in promoting ciliogenesis in mammalian cells in culture and in zebrafish. The VCP-UBXD network elaborated here provides a resource for further elucidation of the targeting mechanisms and biological functions of VCP.</p>

        <title>Mapping the VCP-UBXD adaptor protein network</title>
        <p id="P10">We used an unbiased comparative proteomic approach to develop a physical map of the VCP-UBXD network in 293T cells stably expressing one of thirteen FLAG-HAUBXD proteins, UFD1L, NPLOC4, or VCP via lentiviral transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Because UBX adaptors have protein interaction domains near their N and C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), we created both N- and C-terminally tagged proteins, with the exception of N-tagged UBXN11 and ASPSCR1, which failed to generate stable cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Immunoblotting with available antibodies demonstrated expression levels of the tagged protein ranging from 0.6-4.5-fold compared with the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). We also created HeLa cells expressing N or C-terminally tagged VCP or its adaptors and determined their sub-cellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), allowing correlation with the known localization of interaction partners. These 30 cell lines were subjected to two independent Î±-FLAG magnetic bead affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) experiments and one Î±-HA agarose AP-MS experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). To filter the &gt;400 proteins identified for each bait for high confidence interacting proteins (HCIPs), we employed the Comp<italic>PASS</italic> platform, which uses a database containing AP-MS derived APSM (assembled peptide spectral match) data for &gt;100 unrelated bait proteins to identify non-specific contaminants. <italic>CompPASS</italic> determines HCIPs based on a normalized weighted D score (NWD-Score) measuring the frequency with which interactors appear in the database, the abundance (APSM-based), and the reproducibility of detection in technical replicates<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. An APSM-based Z-score was also employed for identifying proteins that are often seen in AP-MS experiments but are selectively enriched with particular baits<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. We designated interactors as HCIPs if they passed three criteria: 1) NWD â¥ 0.98, 2) Z â¥ 4, and 3) APSM â¥ 2. Proteins scoring below this threshold may still represent <italic>bona fide</italic> interactors, but could be weakly associated or sub-stoichiometric. In the majority of cases, bait abundance and the overall number of HCIPs was similar between N- and C-terminally tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S3">
        <title>Overview and topology of the VCP-adaptor network</title>
        <p id="P11">We organized HCIPs into tiers based on their reproducible identification in both Î±-FLAG and Î±-HA datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). Overall, we identified 169 HCIPs (54 unique proteins) from both N- and C-terminal baits for either Î±-FLAG or Î±-HA purified-complexes, which we designate as Tier 1 HCIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We identified 149 HCIPs (125 unique proteins) in replicate analyses in either N- or C-terminally tagged baits from the Î±-FLAG dataset, which we refer to as Tier 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Finally, 680 interactions (481 unique proteins) were found only once across all baits (Tier 3); these HCIPs are of lower confidence than Tier 1, 2 HCIPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The majority of Tier 1 and 2 HCIPs had adjusted p values â¤ 0.05 based on a hypergeometric test that evaluated the likelihood of nonrandom association among bait and prey observations across all LC-MS analyses in each dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). As described below, we observed extensive validation for selected HCIPs using reciprocal interaction approaches.</p>
        <p id="P12">Hierarchical clustering revealed that while the majority of HCIPs were unique to individual UBXD proteins, a subset were found in common between baits; for example, UBXN2A and UBXN2B associated with a phosphatase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). A number of HCIPs, were common to many UBXD proteins, including the known VCP-associated deubiquitinating enzyme VCPIP, the BAG6 complex (UBXN1, FAF2), and CUL3 adaptors TNFAIP1, KCTD10, KCTD13 (UBXN1, FAF1, UBXN7). It was evident that some interactions are dependent upon the position of the epitope tag; UBXN1-HA-FLAG associated with the BAG6 complex but HA-FLAG-UBXN1 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P13">Of the 89 interactions reported in BioGRID in high-throughput AP-MS experiments with the adaptors analyzed here, 23 were identified as Tier 1, 2 HCIPs, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Of 69 interactions identified by immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting (IP-IB), 17 were present in Tier 1, 2 and finally for yeast two-hybrid data, 4 of 56 reported interactions were identified in Tier 1, 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). A number of BioGRID interactions were also identified in our dataset but did not pass our stringent filtering criteria (65 interactions in APMS, 38 interactions in IP-IB and 17 interactions in yeast two hybrid) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, 29 of 39 interactions reported in a previous study examining 5 UBA-UBXD adaptors by AP-MS<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> were identified in our study (9 in Tier 1 and 2 and 20 below our filtering criteria, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Moreover, our study identified 83 Tier 1, 106 Tier 2 that are not reported in BioGRID, and thereby represents the largest collection of candidate UBXD-interacting proteins reported to date.</p>

      <sec id="S4">
        <title>Placement of UBXD proteins within cellular modules</title>
        <p id="P14">We identified interactions among UBXD proteins that were not previously reported, thereby extending potential crosstalk between UBXD proteins possibly assembled on the same VCP hexamer. Of the 14 UBXD proteins in BioGRID, 8 have been reported to interact with UFD1L and/or NPLOC4. In addition, UBXN6 has been reported to associate with FAF2 and ASPSCR1, and NSFL1C has been reported to interact with UBXN11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In our dataset, UFD1L and/or NPLOC4 associated with 11 of 14 UBXD proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). UBXN2A and UBXN6 associated with 6 and 5 distinct UBXD proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). ASPSCR1 has been proposed to function in the assembly of the VCP hexamer<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and associated with 6 UBXD proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). While we cannot rule out the possibility that the interactions we observe may represent adaptor exchange post-lysis, it suggests that VCP-adaptor modules may be more complex than currently appreciated.</p>
        <p id="P15">We organized the VCP-adaptor network globally and individually, focusing on Tier 1, 2 HCIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Gene Ontology analysis of Tier 1, 2 HCIPs displays enrichment for numerous biological processes, including ubiquitin signaling, protein trafficking, membrane transport, DDR, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 1d</xref>). HCIPs frequently localize in the same compartment as the bait. For example, nuclear UBXN7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) associated with transcription-coupled nucleotide repair machinery, other DDR proteins, and CRL components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. VCP-UBXN2B mediates homotypic membrane fusion and promotes ER and Golgi biogenesis during interphase<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation of UBXN2B has been proposed to regulate this process<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, however the <italic>in vivo</italic> kinase is presently unknown. We identified two kinases â GSK3Î² and CDC42BPB â in association with UBXN2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P16">Several UBXD-associated proteins associate with membrane components. We found that the membrane-tethered FAF2 (also called UBXD8) that functions in ERAD and lipid droplet homeostasis<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> associated with AMFR, DERLIN2, AUP1, BAG6 and UBAC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>) as expected.

We stably expressed GFP-UBXN10 in hTERT-RPE1, IMCD or LLC-PK1 cells and observed localization within cilia either along the length of the cilium, as discrete puncta within the cilium, or at the ciliary tip as reported for IFT-B subunit IFT88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Live cell imaging in LLC-PK1 cells, demonstrated GFP-UBXN10 trafficking in a bi-directional manner within cilia at rates similar to IFT88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). Furthermore UBXN10-mCHERRY and EYFP-IFT-B co-trafficked in the same complex, as determined by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, strongly suggesting that UBXN10 migrates within the cilium with IFT-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video 2</xref>). We were unable to visualize VCP or UFD1L-NPLOC4 within cilia due to their high abundance in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).

Therefore, we examined the involvement of VCP and UBXN10 in cilia formation and maintenance. Depletion of either VCP or UBXN10 in hTERT-RPE1 cells with multiple siRNAs resulted in a reduction in the number of cilia (ascertained by acetylated tubulin staining) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Similar results were observed in LLC-PK1 and hTERT-RPE1 cells expressing GFP-UBXN10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>). Cell cycle analysis upon depletion of VCP or UBXN10 did not identify any overt delay in G0/G1 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>), indicating that the phenotypes observed are not a result of secondary cell cycle effects previously observed upon VCP depletion. Co-depletion of UFD1L-NPLOC4 by siRNA led to a 15-18% reduction in ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P24">To definitively implicate UBXN10 in ciliogenesis, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt the <italic>UBXN10</italic> gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells and observed a significant decrease in the number of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>).

        <title>The stability and activity of IFT-B is dependent on VCP catalytic activity</title>
        <p id="P26">IFT complexes move with well-defined velocities in a cell-type dependent manner. To test whether VCP function is required for IFT-B trafficking, we combined small molecule VCP inhibitors with time-lapse imaging of EYFP-IFT88 and CSAP-Cherry (a centriolar marker used for ciliary orientation) in IMCD cells. Treatment of cells with VCP inhibitors for 4-6 hours led to a dramatic reduction in the length and number of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). Therefore, ciliated cells were treated acutely with a high concentration of inhibitors to achieve physiologically relevant levels in a rapid time frame (&lt;5 min) and cells immediately imaged to measure IFT velocity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>). Acute inhibition caused a significant increase in anterograde and retrograde velocities of EYFP-IFT88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). These results are consistent with studies in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> suggesting disassembly of cilia increases IFT-B velocities possibly due to the lack of cargo on IFT-B<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. At longer times with lower concentrations of DBeQ, the anterograde and retrograde velocities were moderately elevated but not to the extent seen with acute treatment. However, under these conditions, there was also a discernable loss of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). We asked if VCP inhibition impacted UBXN10 trafficking within cilia. TIRF microscopy in IMCD EYFP-IFT88-UBXN10-mCHERRY cells acutely treated with NMS-873 demonstrated a decrease in the number of cilia with UBXN10 trafficking compared to control cells, suggesting that UBXN10 may be uncoupled from IFT-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). We also examined whether VCP inhibition altered IFT-A and BBSsome trafficking. We acutely treated IMCD GFP-IFT43<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> cells with NMS-873 and observed a ~20% decrease in both anterograde and retrograde velocities of IFT-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8d</xref>). Furthermore, the BBSome subunit BBS5 was depleted from cilia over time in response to VCP inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8e,f</xref>). These studies suggest that VCP inhibition may alter the steady-state rates of protein transport within cilia.</p>
        <p id="P27">Assembly and regulation of IFT complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> is poorly understood. We examined whether VCP inhibition affected the composition of IFT-B complexes. hTERT-RPE1 cells were treated with either DMSO or NMS-873 and lysates were fractionated by gel filtration. Immunoblotting for IFT-B subunits revealed multiple complexes, IFT81 and IFT57 are in two complexes at ~1-2 MDa and 150 KDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>). In contrast, heterodimeric IFT25 and IFT27<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> were abundant at 66 KDa but were also detected in the 1-2 MDa complex. VCP inhibition resulted in a reduction of IFT81, IFT25 and IFT27 in the 1-2 MDa size fractions and an increase in smaller molecular weight fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8g</xref>). Recent studies suggest that IFT25 and 27 exist in two pools, one that associates with the IFT-B complex and a heterodimeric form that regulates access of the BBSome to cilia<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, which is recapitulated by our gel filtration results. CLUAP1 was present in a 1-2 MDa complex and a ~150 kDa complex (also occupied by UBXN10), and VCP inhibition resulted in a reduction in the 1-2 MDa form of CLUAP1 and the 150 kDa form of UBXN10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>). We noted that NMS-873 treatment resulted in a decrease in UBXN10 protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>), therefore we asked if VCP inhibition affected UBXD adaptor levels in cells. Treatment of LLC-PK1 cells with NMS-873 led to a reduction in UBXN10 as well as UBXN7 and FAF2 at 4-6 hours post inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>). However, we observed a rapid loss of ciliary GFP-UBXN10 within 1 hour of inhibitor treatment (when protein levels are unaltered relative to control) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7g</xref>). This suggests that VCP inhibition results in the loss of UBXN10 from cilia and that the decline in the adaptor levels maybe a secondary effect of prolonged inhibition. At present, we cannot determine if this effect is due to defects in entry or exit of UBXN10 from cilia. Taken together, these results suggest that VCP inhibition results in selective loss of a subset of proteins from the IFT-B complex.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P29">This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the VCP-UBXD protein interaction network, identifying over 195 HCIPs, and greatly expands the potential breadth of cellular VCP function by: (1) identifying stable interacting partners for UBXDs with no known function, (2) implicating an adaptor and associated complexes in a known VCP pathway thereby informing further mechanistic studies, and (3) identifying candidate targets for certain well-studied VCP adaptors. Further work is required to elucidate functional roles for modules identified here.</p>
      <p id="P30">While a role for ubiquitin-dependent signaling has long been proposed in cilia-related processes<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, only recently have E3s and candidate substrates been identified<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>â<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Our identification of a role for VCP-UBXN10 in cilia formation and maintenance at the cellular and organismal level was unexpected but suggests a role for VCP's segregase activity in either trafficking of IFT-B itself in cilia or in trafficking of IFT-B cargo. As UBXN10 has no known ubiquitin interaction domains, further studies are necessary to understand the role, if any, of ubiquitin in VCP-UBXN10 function within cilia.</p>
      <p id="P31">We find that UBXN10 recruits VCP to IFT-B via direct interaction with CLUAP1 and that UBXN10 traffics within cilia along with IFT-B in a bi-directional manner. While previous proteomic studies detect VCP in purified cilia<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, we have been unable to directly visualize VCP within cilia. However, since an interaction between VCP and UBXN10 is required for UBXN10 trafficking to the cilia, we favor the possibility that the VCP-UBXN10 complex traffics within cilia. Further studies are required to test whether VCP enters cilia and whether this requires UBXN10. VCP-UBXN10 depletion or pharmacological inhibition of VCP causes the shortening and eventual loss of cilia and our biochemical studies suggest that this maybe due in part to defects in the assembly of IFT25-IFT27 (and perhaps other subunits) within IFT-B. Furthermore, acute treatment of ciliated cells with VCP inhibitors led to increased anterograde and retrograde IFT-B velocities, whereas IFT-A velocities were decreased, indicating a mis-coordination of IFT particle trafficking. We also observe loss of BBS5 in cilia upon VCP inhibition. In <italic>C.elegans</italic> the BBSome is thought to link IFT-A and B complexes within cilia<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, as genetic deletion of BBSome subunits results in loss of coordinated IFT-A and B trafficking.</p>
      <p id="P32">Our results suggest that interfering with VCP activity leads to the acute loss of UBXN10 from primary cilia. Subsequently, we detect the disruption of IFT complexes biochemically. We speculate that loss of specific subunits from IFT-B may disable critical interactions with IFT-A, the BBSome complex, cargo and/or motors, leading to cilia shortening and eventual collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8j</xref>). Whether this regulation of IFT-B occurs within cilia or in the cell body is presently unclear and will be the focus of future studies. Our proteomic study identifies biologically relevant functions for VCP adaptors and provides a rich resource for the further exploration of VCP function in numerous cellular processes.</p>

An identical cut-off was used for the single HA AP/MS for each tagged bait. Baits were removed from all HCIP lists prior to HCIP calculation. To evaluate the statistical significance of each bait-prey interaction, a hypergeometric test was applied comparing the null hypothesis that detection of bait and prey was independent across LC-MS analyses, versus the alternative hypothesis that bait and prey were detected preferentially together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). For purposes of this analysis, AP-MS data were separated according to the location of the affinity tag (N- versus C- terminus) and according to whether HA or FLAG purification was performed. P-values were subsequently corrected to account for multiple hypothesis testing using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. HCIPs designated in this study generally had adjusted p values â¤ 0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The only exceptions were for interactors that associated with VCP itself and for UBXD-UBXD associations. Because the very abundant VCP protein (~1% of the total cellular protein) was ubiquitously detected across FLAG AP-MS analyses, detection-based statistical analyses such as the hypergeometric test described here will be insensitive to associations with its interactors. Some UBXD-UBXD associations similarly fail to meet significance cutoffs in this statistical analysis due to high frequency of detection across these LC-MS analyses. This list of HCIPs from the Î±-FLAG dataset was cross-referenced with the interactors in the Î±-HA dataset and interaction maps were generated via Cytoscape. In situations where known members of an associating complex were identified in the IP but did not pass put cut-offs, these were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>. APSMs for the HCIPs identified in the FLAG datasets were bait normalized and plotted in a heatmap form using Multi-experiment Viewer (MeV).</p>

        <title>Validation Studies</title>
        <p id="P40">A subset of interactors were used to reciprocally validate the interaction with either VCP or the UBXD adaptor. Interactors were cloned into lentiviral vectors containing a N-HA/FLAG tag. Stable cell lines were generated for 7 interactors and analyzed by AP-MS as described above. IFT-B stable cell lines were generated in hTERT-RPE1 cells. Nineteen interactors were cloned into epitope tagged vectors and transiently transfected with its cognate tagged UBXD into 293T cells. 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and clarified lysates were used to immunoprecipitate the tagged HCIP and immunoblotted for the UBXD protein.</p>

Cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2 % Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed again and then blocked in 1 % BSA in PBS for 1 h. The coverslips were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h in a humidified chamber, washed and incubated for a further hour with appropriate Alexa-Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 1 h in the dark. Cells were washed with PBS, nuclei were stained with Hoechst and mounted on slides. All images were collected with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with 100Ã Plan Apo NA 1.4 objective lens. The indicated fluorophores were excited with either a 491 nm, 561 nm or 642 nm laser line via an AOTF controlled solid-state laser launch. Emission spectra were collected with a quad band pass polychroic mirror and Chroma emissions filters ET525/50m (488nm), ET620/60m (561) and ET700/75 (642). Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA-AG cooled CCD camera controlled with MetaMorph 7 software. 10-15 z-series optical sections were collected with a step size of 0.2 microns using a Prior Proscan focus motor. Z-series were deconvolved using AutoQuant blind deconvolution software, and displayed as maximum z-projections. Gamma and brightness were adjusted on displayed images (identically for compared image sets using MetaMorph 7 software). Ciliated cells were counted based on acetylated tubulin staining using Pericentrin as an orientation marker. To determine BBS5 localization to cilia, the intensity of BBS5 within cilia (based on the acetylated tubulin staining) was quantified and normalized to the length of each cilium measured in MetaMorph. For immunoflourescene based quantification studies, fields of cells were chosen based on the Hoechst (nuclei) channel to prevent biased image acquisition. On average 150-350 cells were quantified for each sample in two separate experiments. All experiments were performed at least 2 independent times.</p>

The Nikon FITC and HcRED1 cubes were used to efficiently reflect 488 nm and 575 nm wavelengths correspondingly and pass the emission wavelengths into the CCD camera detection channel. The acquisition settings were kept constant for all samples so that valid comparisons could be made between measurements from different data sets. Acquisition parameters were set within the linear range of the CCD camera detection. The acquired fluorescence image time series were subjected to the kymograph analysis using the ImageJ software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>).

The fluorophores were excited using 491nm and 561nm 50mW solid state lasers coupled together using a laser merge module with acousto-optic tunable filter (Spectral Applied Research, Richmond Hill, ON). TIRF image time series were acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA-D2 CCD camera controlled with MetaMorph 7 software. For particle velocity measurement, one hundred images were continuously (49.44 ms read-out time per frame) collected using an exposure time of 100 ms and 2Ã2 binning.
