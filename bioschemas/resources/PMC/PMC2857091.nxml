      <abstract>
        <p>Small heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones capable of maintaining denatured proteins in a folding-competent state. We have previously shown that missense mutations in the small heat shock protein HSPB1 (HSP27) cause distal hereditary motor neuropathy and axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Here we investigated the biochemical consequences of HSPB1 mutations that are known to cause peripheral neuropathy. In contrast to other chaperonopathies, our results revealed that particular HSPB1 mutations presented higher chaperone activity compared with wild type. Hyperactivation of HSPB1 was accompanied by a change from its wild-type dimeric state to a monomer without dissociation of the 24-meric state. Purification of protein complexes from wild-type and HSPB1 mutants showed that the hyperactive isoforms also presented enhanced binding to client proteins. Furthermore, we show that the wild-type HSPB1 protein undergoes monomerization during heat-shock activation, strongly suggesting that the monomer is the active form of the HSPB1 protein.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inherited peripheral neuropathies comprise a very complex and genetically diverse group of disorders affecting the peripheral nervous system. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN6"><sup>6</sup></xref> disease is the most common type and is clinically characterized by a symmetric weakness and wasting of distal muscles in lower limbs, feet, and hands. Mutations in more than 40 genes have been linked to CMT neuropathy and related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Dominant missense mutations in the small heat shock protein 27 (HSP27 or HSPB1) were linked to CMT type 2F and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are stress-induced chaperones with a ubiquitous expression pattern that are characterized by the presence of a conserved Î±-crystallin domain. Unlike the heat shock proteins with an ATPase domain (<italic>e.g.</italic> HSP70), sHSPs do not have the intrinsic capacity to refold denatured proteins. However, they are able to bind unfolded substrates and keep them in a folding-competent state. These sHSP-unfolded protein complexes act as repositories that are later cleared out by the ATP-dependent heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Like all other members of the sHSP family, HSPB1 exists in a dynamic equilibrium between oligomeric and dimeric states. Although HSPB1 oligomers ranging from 12- to 30-mers have been described, the 24-meric state arranged in dimers is the most common form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The exact role of each of these states in the function of sHSPs is still controversial. Some studies support the idea that the dissociation of the oligomer is required for substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), whereas others have shown that the oligomeric state is the chaperone active form that protects cells from stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Besides its canonical folding properties, HSPB1 is involved in several cellular processes, such as apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and translational elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Therefore, pinpointing the underlying mechanism for the neuron-specific phenotype of CMT causing HSPB1 mutations represents a big challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the influence of the CMT causing HSPB1 mutations identified by us in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) on the basic biochemical properties of this protein using neuronal cell lines stably expressing either wild-type or mutant HSPB1 variants. Surprisingly, three missense mutations presented higher <italic>in vivo</italic> chaperone activity when compared with the wild-type protein. The enhanced activity of these mutations was accompanied by an increased fraction of the protein residing in a monomeric state. Consistently, analysis of the predicted protein structure of HSPB1 suggested a mechanism for the monomeric tendency of hyperactive mutants. Furthermore, we were able to show that heat shock-induced activation of the wild-type HSPB1 is also accompanied by a similar increase in the fraction of the protein residing in the monomeric state, at the expense of the dimer fraction, indicating that the ratio between monomeric and dimeric HSPB1 is a key determinant for the activity of the protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Identification of the Non-pathogenic Variation S156Y</title><p>Using direct DNA sequencing, we identified an HSPB1 variation, c.467C&gt;A, in one CMT2 affected patient (CMT-442.01) from a Croatian family (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.082644/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>). The mutation was found to be non-pathogenic because this variation was not present in the affected sister (CMT-442.02). Mutation analysis was performed by sequencing of amplification products containing exons and intron-exon boundaries of all HSPB1 exons. Sequencing reactions were performed using the Big Dye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems) and run on an ABI3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing data were analyzed using NovoSNP software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Culture Material and Conditions</title><p>All cell culture media and supplements were acquired from Invitrogen. The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was acquired from ATCC, whereas HEK293 Flp-in host cells were purchased from Invitrogen. When not stated differently, SH-SY5Y cells were cultivated at 37 Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293 Flp-in cells were cultivated at 37 Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin.</p></sec><sec><title>SH-SY5Y Stable Cell Lines</title><p>To generate stable SH-SY5Y cell lines, we made constructs encoding different HSPB1 mutations or EGFP using the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen). Using primers containing the attB recombination sites, ORFs from HSPB1 wild-type, R127W, S135F, R136W, T151I, and P182L were amplified from constructs described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The non-pathogenic HSPB1 variation S156Y was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The EGFP cassette was amplified from the vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The PCR products containing the ORFs flanked by the attB recombination sites were then recombined into a pDONR221 vector, and the sequence was validated. The validated pDONRs-HSPB1 constructs were then transferred by recombination to the pLENTI6/V5-Dest (Invitrogen) generating constructs with the ORFs C-terminally fused to a V5 tag. Stable cell lines were produced by lentiviral transduction of the neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y, according to the method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The construct for stable expression of the luciferase gene was generated by amplifying the luciferase gene ORF from the vector pNFconluc (gift from A. Israel (Institut Pasteur, Paris)) and recombining it into the vector pLENTI6/V5-Dest (Invitrogen). Double stable cell lines expressing both luciferase and the HSPB1 forms were generated by lentiviral transduction of the HSPB1-expressing stable cell lines with the luciferase construct. Stable cells lines presented similar expression levels and equal growth rate (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>HEK293 Flp-in Stable Cell Lines</title><p>To generate stable HEK293 Flp-in cell lines, we made constructs carrying a double tag (FLAG-TEV cleavage site-Protein A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) C-terminally fused to HSPB1 isoforms or EGFP. To this end, the double tag cassette from the vector pMET-TYK7-TAP2 (gift from Jan Tavernier (Ghent University)) and the single recombination Gateway cloning cassette were transferred to the Flp-in vector pCDNA5/FRT.

The elution profile of HSPB1 for each stable cell line was determined by Western blotting of the different SEC fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>).

The mutants R127W, S135F, and R136W equally displayed an elution profile with two major peaks, with no major observable differences in the peak corresponding to the larger apparent molecular weight when compared with the wild type. However, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, the fractions of the R127W and S135F mutants eluting at low apparent molecular weight shifted to higher elution volumes when compared with the wild-type protein, indicative of a decrease in the apparent molecular weight of the fraction.

We also know by experience that the HSPB1 dimer is resistant to SDS treatment. For this reason, HSPB1 dimers can be visualized by Western blot by running gels with non-reduced (without DTT) samples. The lack of DTT in the samples generates three extra higher bands in the Western blot (around 60 kDa) corresponding to the three possible HSPB1 dimers. Given the fact that we introduced exogenous HSPB1 as a fusion protein, its molecular mass differs from the endogenous protein by 5 kDa. Hence, the highest molecular weight band corresponds to exogenous homodimer, the lower molecular weight band to the endogenous homodimer, and the intermediate band to the heterodimer of HSPB1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>, the R127W and S135F mutants showed a strong reduction in the two dimeric forms containing the mutant protein (2Ã HSPB1-V5 and HSPB1end + HSPB1-V5) as compared with wild-type HSPB1, whereas for the other mutants no striking differences were seen.

The Ser-135 residue is located in the dimer interface and is predicted to form a pair of hydrogen bonds with the Thr-139 residue from the other subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). The S135F mutation results in the projection of the aromatic R-group from phenylalanine toward the other subunit, possibly avoiding the formation of the hydrogen bonds and destabilizing the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). The Arg-127 residue is localized in the region preceding the dimerization Î²-strand. The R-group from this arginine is predicted to form an important hydrogen bond with the His-103 residue stabilizing part of the Î²6 and part of the Î²7 strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). The R127W mutation does not allow the formation of this hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>), possibly destabilizing a part of the Î²-strand from the interface and explaining the dimerization deficit of this mutant.

To determine whether these two phenomena are related, we tested if the activation of wild-type HSPB1 is also accompanied by monomer formation. Therefore, SH-SY5Y cells expressing wild-type HSPB1 were heat-shocked at 44 Â°C for 30 min and allowed to recover for different periods of time. HSPB1 dimers and monomers for each time point were then visualized by Western blot with reduced and non-reduced samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic> shows that in basal conditions, wild-type HSPB1 is present predominantly in a dimeric form and that heat shock induces a transient increase of the monomeric fraction of wild-type HSPB1. The quantification of the ratio between monomers and dimers shows that the heat-induced monomerization of HSPB1 peaks at 30 min after heat shock, with the protein being predominantly present as monomers at that time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). At 60 min after heat shock, the dimeric state starts to be restored. At 24 h after heat shock, the dimeric state is fully restored (data not shown). This result corroborates the hypothesis that the increased monomerization presented by the R127W, S135F, and R136W mutations is responsible for their hyperactivation. The same experiment was repeated for the R127W and S135F mutations. As expected, both mutants maintained the heat shock-induced monomerization pattern shown by the wild-type protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.082644/DC1">supplemental Fig. S5</ext-link>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Heat activation-induced monomerization of wild-type HSPB1.</bold> Cells expressing wild-type HSPB1 were heat-shocked for 30 min at 44 Â°C and allowed to recover for different time periods. <italic>A</italic>, Western blot (<italic>WB</italic>) showing the decrease in HSPB1 dimers after heat shock.

Literature data show that HSPB1 is phosphorylated by the p38/MAPKAP kinase 2/3 pathway and that its phosphorylation level reaches a plateau around 30 min after heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Western blots using phospho-specific antibodies confirmed this phosphorylation kinetics and showed that the phosphorylated forms of HSPB1 were equally present in both dimeric and monomeric forms, indicating that HSPB1 phosphorylation is not the driving force of monomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). To further rule out the effect of phosphorylation, we repeated this experiment under conditions where HSPB1 is not phosphorylated (<italic>i.e.</italic> by using the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>D</italic>, both basal and heat-induced HSPB1 phosphorylation levels were efficiently abolished by treatment with SB203580. However, inhibition of HSPB1 phosphorylation did not affect the heat-induced monomerization pattern of HSPB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>D</italic>). Taken together, these results show that the monomerization of HSPB1 is not promoted directly by phosphorylation of any of these three serine residues.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In 2004, our group discovered that mutations in the small heat shock protein HSPB1 are linked to CMT type 2F and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Interestingly, aberrant chaperone activity had been associated before with neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Disease-causing mutations in HSPs generally cause loss of their protective chaperone activity and as such lead to protein misfolding and aggregation. Among the sHSPs, lower chaperone activity has been described for the autosomal dominant cataract and desmin-related myopathy causing mutations in Î±A-crystallin and Î±B-crystallin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Similarly, hereditary spastic paraplegia causing mutations in HSP60 causes a reduction in the activity of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). To understand the underlying pathomechanism of disease-causing mutations in HSPB1, we investigated the influence of these mutations on the biochemical properties of this protein. In contrast to other chaperonopathies, three mutations in HSPB1 (R127W, S135F, and R136W) led to a higher, rather than a reduced, chaperone activity of the mutant protein when compared with the wild-type protein. The non-pathogenic variant S156Y and two other point mutations, T151I and P182L, did not affect HSPB1 chaperone activity. Additionally, the enhanced chaperone activity of the R127W, S135F, and R136W mutations was associated with a dimerization deficit and an enhanced binding to their client proteins.</p><p>Small heat shock proteins are present within cells in a dynamic equilibrium between oligomeric and dimeric states. Which state is the active form of these proteins or how they sense unfolded substrates is still not clear. We observed that the increased thermotolerance and <italic>in vivo</italic> chaperone activity of the HSPB1 mutants R127W and S135F was accompanied by a partial loss of dimerization and consequently a shift toward the monomeric state. We could couple these two phenomena by showing that activation of wild-type HSPB1 is also accompanied by an increase in the monomeric fraction of the protein. Supporting this result, it has recently been shown that the Î±B-crystallin mutation R120G, which causes a decrease in chaperone activity, results in increased stability of the protein dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Although the HSPB1 mutations R127W and S135F are present predominantly as monomers, they still form oligomers, showing that dimer dissociation does not necessarily result in oligomer dissociation. Actually, our SEC results revealed that the mutants R127W and S135F present a slightly higher propensity to be in the oligomeric state compared with the wild type. Therefore, we believe that the mutant HSPB1 monomers are also inserted into oligomeric structures. Corroborating with this hypothesis, Benesch <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) recently showed that the chaperone activity of Î±A-crystallin and Î±B-crystallin is regulated by the amount of monomers within the oligomers. Oligomers formed by monomers, instead of just dimers, would be more active due to the exposition of hydrophobic surfaces previously embedded into the dimer interface. The increased exposition of hydrophobic surfaces would then result in higher substrate affinity and consequently increased chaperone function. In line with these data, we observed that mutants R127W, S135F, and R136W show an excessive binding to their client proteins, even under rest conditions. This result suggests that the regulation of these mutants is lost, which might result in unrequired formation of sHSP-substrate complexes, possibly interfering with their normal function. The mutation R136W, which presented a slightly higher chaperone activity, showed a normal SEC distribution and, interestingly, a loss of dimerization exclusively with the endogenous wild-type HSPB1 protein. Because CMT2F is an autosomal dominant disease, in patients, it is expected that the ratio between the mutant and the normal protein will be 1:1. Therefore it is possible that at equimolar conditions with the endogenous wild-type protein, the overall balance of dimers and monomers in the cells expressing the R136W mutations will be disturbed in a way similar to what is happening with the mutations R127W and S135F.</p><p>By using the recently published Î±B-crystallin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), we were able to model the HSPB1 structure and evaluate the consequences of the CMT-causing mutations. Our analysis predicted a dimerization deficit mechanism for the R127W and S135F mutations, whereas no clear explanation was found for the behavior of the R136W mutation. Despite the high similarity between HSPB1 and Î±B-crystallin, the confirmation of the structural mechanisms leading to the hyperactivation of these mutations awaits resolution of the crystal structure of wild-type and mutant HSPB1.</p><p>Whether the increased chaperone activity of S135F, R127W, and R136W is actually disease-causing is unclear at this point. Because other CMT-linked mutations behave neutrally in our chaperone assays, either the increased activity is not relevant for the disease, or it shows that different pathomechanisms for different CMT mutations are operational. The latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that patients carrying the mutations T151I and P182L were described with a predominant motor neuropathy (distal hereditary motor neuropathy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), whereas some patients carrying the mutations R127W, S135F, and R136W presented motor and sensory symptoms (CMT2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The mutation P182L is a clinically more severe mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), and the expression of this mutation is by itself a stress to the cells. Our stable cells look smaller (data not shown), and previous studies have shown that this mutant protein forms large intracellular aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that in contrast to several other chaperonopathies, CMT-causing mutations in HSPB1 lead to increased chaperone activity and enhanced binding to their client proteins. Furthermore, this hyperactivity appears to be caused by an increased monomerization of HSPB1, strongly suggesting that the monomer is the active state of this protein. The link between the increased chaperone activity of HSPB1 mutants and the etiology of CMT remains to be proven. We favor the hypothesis that the increased chaperone activity is not by itself disease-causing but rather an aberrant binding with a neuron-specific partner due to the protein hyperactivity. Therefore, we are currently following up to determine if neuron-specific interaction partners of HSPB1 are targeted specifically by CMT-causing mutations. Because HSPB1 is involved in a series of normal and pathogenic biological processes, a better understanding of the biology of this protein can be of great help toward the development of therapies for a multitude of disorders.</p></sec>
