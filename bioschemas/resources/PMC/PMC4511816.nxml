      <abstract>
        <p>Porokeratosis (PK) is a heterogeneous group of keratinization disorders. No causal genes except <italic>MVK</italic> have been identified, even though the disease was linked to several genomic loci. Here, we performed massively parallel sequencing and exonic CNV screening of 12 isoprenoid genes in 134 index PK patients (61 familial and 73 sporadic) and identified causal mutations in three novel genes (<italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic>, and <italic>FDPS</italic>) in addition to <italic>MVK</italic> in the mevalonate pathway. Allelic expression imbalance (AEI) assays were performed in 13 lesional tissues. At least one mutation in one of the four genes in the mevalonate pathway was found in 60 (98%) familial and 53 (73%) sporadic patients, which suggests that isoprenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of PK. Significantly reduced expression of the wild allele was common in lesional tissues due to gene conversion or some other unknown mechanism. A G-to-A RNA editing was observed in one lesional tissue without AEI. In addition, we observed correlations between the mutations in the four mevalonate pathway genes and clinical manifestations in the PK patients, which might support a new and simplified classification of PK under the guidance of genetic testing.</p>

        <p>Porokeratosis refers to a group of around twenty skin conditions that involve a build-up of a protein called keratin in skin cells. Keratin forms the tough fibres that give strength to hair and nails, and people suffering from porokeratosis develop hardened skin lesions. Porokeratosis is an uncommon condition; most cases are inherited and have been linked to exposure to ultraviolet light and having a weakened immune system.</p>
        <p>Mutations in one gene called <italic>MVK</italic> are known to cause two forms of the disorder, but it is suspected that other genetic causes of porokeratosis will also be identified. The <italic>MVK</italic> gene encodes an enzyme that is involved in making chemicals called isoprenoids. This large and diverse class of chemicals provides the building blocks for making many other important molecules in all living species. Zhang, Li et al. have now analysed genetic material from 134 different porokeratosis patients to search for mutations in other genes involved in the production of isoprenoids. The patients examined include 61 people with a family history of the disorder, and 73 cases in which the condition seems to be a one-off occurrence.</p>
        <p>This search identified mutations in three additional genes (called <italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic> and <italic>FDPS</italic>) that are all linked to porokeratosis. Further analysis of these three genes and <italic>MVK</italic> revealed that about half of the patients with mutations in the <italic>MVK</italic> gene developed large lesions (that were over 5 centimetres in diameter). However, those with mutations in the other three genes did not develop such large lesions. Mutations in some of the newly identified genes were instead linked to porokeratosis affecting specific areas of the body; for example, <italic>PMVK</italic> and <italic>MVD</italic> mutations are linked to porokeratosis localized to the genitals and around the eyes, respectively. This means that, in the future, doctors might be able to simplify the diagnosis of the different varieties of porokeratosis based on information gained via genetic tests.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Porokeratosis (PK, MIM 175800) is a heterogeneous group of keratinization disorders that exhibit an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. PK is also a skin-specific autoinflammatory disease which was often inherited and linked to ultraviolet light exposure and immunosuppression (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Schamroth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abramovits and Oquendo, 2013</xref>). For example, eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis exemplifies the inflammatory manifestation, and complications to inflammatory conditions such as localized cutaneous amyloidosis are seen in PK patients (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Biswas, 2015</xref>). Indeed, PK and psoriasis share some features at both clinical and molecular levels and sometimes coexist in the same patients (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>As a histological hallmark that unifies all variants of PK, cornoid lamella (CL) is a vertical âcolumnâ of parakeratosis. The pattern of CL can be slender, broad, or confluent, which is related to epidermal hyperplasia and dermal inflammation. However, CL is not a unique feature of PK because it can be seen in some inflammatory and inherited cutaneous disorders and also as an incidental finding (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Biswas, 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p>PK is currently classified according to the clinical manifestations, such as number, size, morphology, and distribution of the histological lesions. A better system of classification is expected because some variants of PK are fraught with confusing terminology (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Schamroth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Sertznig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Biswas, 2015</xref>). For example, it is sometimes hard to completely differentiate disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) from disseminated superficial porokeratosis (DSP) by age of onset and sun-exposed areas.</p>
      <p>In addition to the heterogeneity in clinical manifestations, genetic heterogeneity is also observed in PK. At least five linkage loci (i.e., 12q23.2-24.1, 15q25.1-26.1, 18p11.3, 1p31.3-p31.1, 16q24.1-24.3) have been reported for the disseminated forms of PK which include DSAP, DSP, porokeratosis palmaris et plantaris disseminata (PPPD), and immunosuppression-induced porokeratosis (ISIP) (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Schamroth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib9c" ref-type="bibr">Luan et al., 2011</xref>). However, only one causal gene, the mevalonate kinase gene (<italic>MVK</italic>) at 12q24, has been identified in DSAP and porokeratosis of Mibille (PM) (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib9b" ref-type="bibr">Li and Zhang, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2014</xref>). Here we performed genetic analysis in 134 index patients with PK to identify additional causal genes and to establish new parameters for better differential diagnosis of PK. Allelic expression imbalance (AEI) and cDNA mutation were analyzed in 13 pairwise lesional tissues (LTs) and neighboring normal-appearing skin (NNS) to investigate the underlying pathogenicity of PK.</p>

        <p>Since both <italic>MVD</italic> and <italic>MVK</italic> are involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Thurnher et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that mutations in other members of the mevalonate pathway exist in PK and screened for mutations in 12 genes in the mevalonate pathway including <italic>MVD</italic> and <italic>MVK</italic> in 134 PK patients (61 familial and 73 sporadic). The 12 genes are: acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (<italic>ACAT</italic>) <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (<italic>HMGCS</italic>) <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (<italic>HMGCR</italic>), <italic>MVK</italic>, phosphomevalonate kinase (<italic>PMVK</italic>), <italic>MVD</italic>, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase (<italic>IDI</italic>) <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (<italic>FDPS</italic>), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 1 (<italic>GGPS1</italic>) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Kanehisa et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A cycled primer extension and ligation-dependent amplification (CPELA) reaction for enrichment of target genomic fragments and next generation sequencing (NGS) were performed in each sample. The NGS data were analyzed for rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with no record in dbSNP or a minor allele frequency of &lt;1% in Chinese from 1000 genome database. After Sanger sequencing validation, 60 out of 61 SNVs called from NGS data were demonstrated to be true SNVs, which were predicted to impact protein function.

These two oligos are mixed with genomic DNA, heat-denatured, and then annealed to the same strand of the target DNA fragment. The primer extends and stops until it meets the block probe, and the extension product is then ligated with the block probe by a thermal stable ligase. The above procedure can be repeated n times on the PCR machine using a two-step PCR cycling program. The extension and ligation product is then purified by an exonuclase mixture digestion to remove any DNA fragment with no exonuclease-resistance modification at both ends such as remained primers or probes, primer dimers and genomic DNA, and then amplified using universal NGS PCR primer pairs. A CPELA reaction can include hundreds of extension primer-blocking probe sets and simultaneously amplify hundreds of target DNA fragments for subsequent massively parallel sequencing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

        <p>We determined the genomic variations by Sanger sequencing in other family members apart from one with an unknown mutation. In 20 pedigrees with more than two blood samples collected, all patients carried the same mutation with the proband. On the other hand, no mutation was detected in any of the healthy family members. Except for one common <italic>MVD</italic> mutation of c.746T&gt;C, all deleterious candidate SNVs and large deletions were undetected in healthy family members and 270 unrelated ethnically matched controls. In total, we identified 13 mutations in <italic>MVD</italic>, six mutations in <italic>PMVK</italic>, four mutations in <italic>FDPS</italic>, and 28 mutations in <italic>MVK</italic> in 113 of the 134 PK patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Notably, 21 of the 28 MVK mutations are novel (<xref rid="bib9b" ref-type="bibr">Li and Zhang, 2014</xref>). These mutations include 30 missense (58%), two start codon (4%), five nonsense (10%), seven indels (14%), four splicing defects (8%), and three large deletions (6%), and predictably affect functions of the respective enzymes. The two <italic>MVD</italic> mutations (c.746T&gt;C and c.875A&gt;G) were identified in 50 unrelated patients, accounting for 81% of all patients with <italic>MVD</italic> mutations.

The distribution of lesions could be categorized as localized and disseminated forms (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Schamroth et al., 1997</xref>). Several classical variants were found to coexist in the same patient. However, no malignant degeneration was found in the lesions of these patients. Although all affected members in the same family carried the same mutation, each affected member showed different clinical manifestations and severity.</p>

        <title>Genotypeâphenotype correlations in PK patients</title>
        <p>We observed some interesting correlations between gene mutations and clinical phenotypes of PK (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). First, giant plaque-type porokeratosis ptychotropica (PPt) with lesion diameters at least 5 cm appeared to be a unique phenotype associated with <italic>MVK</italic> mutations. This feature was observed in 50% (19/38) of index patients with <italic>MVK</italic> mutations, but not in any patients with <italic>MVD</italic>, <italic>PMVK</italic>, or <italic>FDPS</italic> mutations. In addition, patients with <italic>MVK</italic> mutations generally showed the widest range of phenotypes in terms of both the number and size of lesions. Second, localized genital PK (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006</xref>) and porokeratoma (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Walsh et al., 2007</xref>) appeared to be unique phenotypes associated with <italic>PMVK</italic> mutations. Third, in PK patients with <italic>MVD</italic> mutations, the age of onset spanned from 5 to 70 years, and the diameter of the lesions was generally less than 2 cm. Five females and one male with <italic>MVD</italic> mutations manifested mild solar facial PK (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Sharquie and Al-Baghdady, 2003</xref>), which was not found in any patients with mutations in other genes. Fourth, in patients with <italic>FDPS</italic> mutations, the number of lesions was generally more than 500 and the diameter of the lesions was less than 1 cm.<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06322.012</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Clinical characteristics and genetic causes of 134 index patients with PK</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

        <title>Reduced expression of wild allele and RNA editing in LTs</title>
        <p>The expression of the wild allele in 10 out of 13 LTs was significantly reduced at the 1% significance level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 5â7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In contrast, the expression of the mutant allele was significantly reduced in almost all NNS (except one from F-42) carrying a mutation resulting in nonsense, frameshift, or splicing defect. As for LT from F-31, the mutant to wild allelic ratio in genomic DNA was &gt;3 compared with the ratio of about 1 in the corresponding NNS genomic DNA. However, no deletion or duplication of all <italic>MVK</italic> exons was detected in F-31, which might indicate that gene conversion of the wild to the mutant allele occurred in the LT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Gene conversion might also occur in the thigh LT of F-43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). No copy number change or CpG island methylation was detected at the corresponding mutated genes in all LTs. A mutation of c.1003G&gt;A (p.Gly335Ser) on the wild allele (T) of <italic>MVK</italic>: c.1093T&gt;A was identified in the cDNA of the LT without AEI but not the cDNA of NNS collected from the left forearm of F-38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this present study we were able to identify mutations in four genes (<italic>MVK</italic>, <italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic>, and <italic>FDPS</italic>) underlying PK by massively parallel sequencing and copy number variation analysis in 134 index patients with PK. In the 12 PK families where the affected members span three to six generations, we found mutations only in <italic>MVK</italic> or <italic>MVD</italic> but not in <italic>PMVK</italic> or <italic>FDPS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We also observed the correlation of genotypes and several clinical manifestations in the PK patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which might be helpful to simplify the classification of PK under the guidance of genetic testing.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, two patients were identified to carry two mutations: c.302C&gt;G (p.Pro101Arg) and c.683G&gt;A (p.Arg228Gln) in <italic>MVD</italic> for S-62, and c.746T&gt;C (p.Phe249Ser) in <italic>MVD</italic> and c.235G&gt;A (p.Asp79Asn) in <italic>MVK</italic> for F-28. According to the prediction programs of bioinformatics, the c.235G&gt;A in <italic>MVK</italic> and c.302C&gt;G in <italic>MVD</italic> were less conservative than the other mutation carried in F-28 and S-62, respectively. The two mutations in <italic>MVD</italic> for S-62 were located in the <italic>trans</italic> position, for his daughter carried only one of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). S-62 had late-onset PK at the age of 50 and his 30-year-old daughter had no lesions to date. According to our observation, index patients F-28 and S-62 did not present with more severe phenotypes or earlier age of onset or any other unique clinical features.</p>
      <p>In this study we did not detect pathogenic mutation in 21 patients: five cases with linear PK (LP), six cases with solitary plaque-type PK, and 10 cases with disseminated PK (only one had family history). There were three possible explanations: (1) these patients might have other non-classical or mosaic/somatic mutations that could not be detected by current mutation screening methods; (2) these patients might have mutations in unknown genes; (3) these patients might be acquired ISIP without mutation. Recently, mutations in the <italic>SLC17A9</italic> gene were reported to be another genetic cause for DSAP (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2014</xref>). We sequenced all exons of <italic>SLC17A9</italic> in these 21 patients by Sanger sequencing but found no mutations in <italic>SLC17A9</italic>.</p>
      <p>RNA editing is a process of some discrete changes to specific nucleotide sequences of a RNA molecule which may be critical during normal development and diseases (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Witkin, et al., 2015</xref>). G-to-A RNA editing in PK was first reported in our study. Interestingly, the RNA editing seemed to occur selectively on the one copy of <italic>MVK</italic> and this selective editing pattern seemed to be capable of being transmitted during mitosis. The mechanism underlying this observation should be investigated further.</p>
      <p>Using AEI assays, we observed that the expression of wild allele was significantly reduced to various extents in most LTs (&gt;77%). The variation in the expression reduction level might be due to the LT containing various amounts of normal-appearing keratinocytes and other different types of cells. Somatic loss of function of the wild allele in the epidermal stem cells might play a key role in the formation of lesions, and it might occur spontaneously and be induced by environmental factors such as ultraviolet light.</p>
      <p>There was only one RNA editing identified in the LT, therefore the somatic loss of function of the wild allele in LTs of PK could be mainly caused by suppression of the wild allele through gene conversion in a minor proportion of cases or an unknown DNA methylation-independent epigenetic mechanism in most cases. Allelic imbalance of histone methylation modification unlinked to DNA methylation, whose pattern is able to be transmitted during cell mitosis, could be the DNA methylation-independent epigenetic mechanism (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Further investigation would be necessary to test this hypothesis. We did not find reduced expression or somatic mutation of the wild allele in only two LTs. The reason for this could be that the LT might contain many normal cells affecting the sensitivity of AEI and mutation detection.</p>
      <p>As a starter button of PK, gene conversion of the wild allele to the mutant allele was first identified in this study. This observation is generally consistent with the phenomenon known as ârevertant mosaicismâ, in which the mutant allele is corrected in some stem cells. Revertant mosaicism is mainly identified in blood diseases such as WiskottâAldrich syndrome and Fanconiâs anemia, and skin diseases such as ichthyosis and epidermolysis bullosa (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">May, 2011</xref>). Revertant mosaicism shows the bright side of gene conversion, but our observation revealed the opposite side. Therefore, gene conversion could be a natural ârescue angelâ in some recessive diseases or a âdamaging devilâ in some dominant diseases, which could mostly affect tissues with extensive ability to self-renew for life.</p>
      <p>Our findings support the notion that Mendelian diseases can be caused by multiple genes involved in the same metabolic or signal transduction pathway, or producing proteins on interaction. The four genes <italic>MVK</italic>, <italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic>, and <italic>FDPS</italic> are members of the mevalonate pathway, suggesting that this pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of PK. The mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis provides precursors of isoprenoids, which are ubiquitous in living species and diverse in biological function (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Smit and Mushegian, 2000</xref>) and serve as precursors of cholesterol, heme A, ubiquinones, dolichol, and isoprenylated proteins (e.g., RAS and Lamin B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, it is also the subject of many pharmacological regulating drugs such as statins. It is well known that cholesterol is an important constituent of the cell membrane of most eukaryotic cells, and several inherited disorders have been linked to defects in cholesterol biosynthesis. The isoprenylated proteins play a role in the regulation of cell growth, division, and differentiation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Moir and Spann, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Zwerger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Davidson and Lammerding, 2014</xref>) and are probably associated with the retained nuclei in the stratum corneum (i.e., parakeratosis). We propose that the accumulation of abnormal metabolites or shortage of isoprenoids might predispose patients to idiopathic inflammation of the skin, and that correction of the abnormal isoprenoid biosynthesis might be a novel therapeutic direction for PK. Further functional studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p>

In addition, blood samples were collected from 270 healthy adult individuals undergoing routine medical examination in the hospital. The 134 index patients were diagnosed by at least two experienced dermatologists, based on both clinical features and histological examinations. In view of the family history, these index patients were divided into family (F) and sporadic (S) cases. Among the 61 familial cases, 40 index patients were probands from each family. We examined members of 21 families from different provinces of China, whose generations ranged from 2 to 6.</p>

        <title>CPELA</title>
        <p>A total of 162 fragments covering the promoter region, 5â²UTR, coding sequence and splicing site of 12 genes in the mevalonate pathway (<italic>ACAT1</italic>, <italic>ACAT2</italic>, <italic>HMGCS1</italic>, <italic>HMGCS2</italic>, <italic>HMGCR</italic>, <italic>MVK</italic>, <italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic>, <italic>IDI1</italic>, <italic>IDI2</italic>, <italic>FDPS</italic>, and <italic>GGPS1</italic>) were amplified using the EasyTarget<sup>Â®</sup> amplification kit (Genesky Biotechnologies Inc, Shanghai, China) which was developed according to the CPELA method. The CPELA was a new method developed by Genesky Biotechnologies for fast and simple enrichment of multiple gene regions for massively parallel sequencing. The principle of CPELA is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>.</p>

        <title>Massively parallel sequencing</title>
        <p>The amplification products by CEPLA were mixed and size-separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Products of length 200â400bp were recovered. The final concentration of the library mixture was determined by real-time quantitative PCR and the average concentration for each library was estimated. The libraries tagged with different index sequences from several projects were well mixed in an appropriate concentration for each library corresponding to its aimed sequencing depth. The final library mixture was sequenced on MiSeq sequencer (Illumina) using Miseq reagent kit v2. The sequencing reads were separated for each sample by running CASAVA (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) and target reads were determined by comparing them with fragment reference sequences (hg19) using the Blat program (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Kent, 2002</xref>).</p>

        <title>Bioinformatics</title>
        <p>In order to reduce the reading error from the sequencing reaction step, we first compared the two reads from the same cluster and integrated them into one correction read. The correction reads were then aligned to hg19 using the BurrowsâWheeler Aligner (BWA) (<xref rid="bib9a" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>). SNV calling was performed using both GATK (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>) and Varscan programs (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Koboldt et al., 2012</xref>), and the called SNV data were then combined. The Annovar program was used for SNV annotation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). The functional effect of non-synonymous SNVs was assessed by the PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and MutationTaster (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ng and Henikoff, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Adzhubei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>). Non-synonymous SNVs with SIFT score of &lt;0.05, Polyphen-2 score of &gt;0.85 or MutationTaster score of &gt;0.85 were considered as significant of not being benign. To sort potentially deleterious variants from benign polymorphisms, perl scripts were used to filter the SNVs against those of dbSNP135. Any SNV recorded in dbSNP135 and with a minor allele frequency of â¥1% in Chinese from 1000 genome database was considered as benign polymorphisms and therefore removed for subsequent analysis.</p>

        <title>CNVplex assay and breakpoint analysis</title>
        <p>The copy number of the target regions was measured by a CNVplex assay, a high-throughput multiplex CNV analysis method recently developed by Genesky Biotechnologies. The principle of CNVplex technology is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>. We utilized this technology for quantitative analysis of copy numbers of all 37 exons and upstream promoter regions in the <italic>MVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic>, <italic>PMVK</italic>, and <italic>FDPS</italic> genes for the blood DNA samples with no point mutation identified and the tissue DNA samples. Based on the copy number measurements for all target sequences, the breakpoints were estimated to be located between two neighboring probe target sites showing different copy numbers. Several primer sets flanking the two probe target sites were tested to amplify the target region from case and control DNA samples using a long PCR protocol. Specific PCR products from case samples were sequenced using the ABI BigDye3.1 and the breakpoints were determined by blasting the sequences with human reference genome assembly.</p>

        <title>AEI assay</title>
        <p>Both DNA and RNA were extracted from pairwise LT and NNS. Each RNA sample was reversely transcripted into cDNA twice using polyA and N9 primer mix and Reverse Transcriptase M-MLV (RNase H-) (New England Biolabs, England). For each pairwise tissue set, single nucleotide extension was used to quantitate the ratio of the mutant to the wild allele both in the tissue cDNA and DNA using the ABI PRISM SNaPshot Multiplex Kit (Applied Biosystems), followed by normalization to the ratio value in the corresponding patientâs blood DNA as a reference of 1:1. As for cDNA from F-42 and S-36 patients with splicing defect mutations of <italic>MVK</italic>: c.371+2T&gt;A and <italic>FDPS</italic>: c.684+1G&gt;A respectively, fluorescent PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis was used to quantitate the ratios of mutant to wild transcripts.</p>

        <title>cDNA sequencing and bisulfite sequencing</title>
        <p>Total RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA. Two or three sets of primers were designed to amplify the cDNA of <italic>MVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic>, or <italic>FDPS</italic>, covering all coding sequences for each gene. The sequences of PCR products were determined by Sanger sequencing. Two allele-specific PCRs for c.1093T&gt;A followed by Sanger sequencing were performed in order to determine whether the mutant allele (A) of c.1003G&gt;A was in the cis position with the wild allele (T) of c.1093T&gt;A. DNA from each pairwise LT and NNS were subject to bisulfite conversion using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA). PCR products amplifying the bisulfite converted DNA at CpG islands of <italic>MVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic>, or <italic>FDPS</italic> were sequenced on MiSeq sequencer (Illumina) using Miseq reagent kit v2 or on the ABI 3130xl genetic analyzer using the ABI BigDye3.1.</p>

      <p>Thank you for sending your work entitled âGenomic Variations of the Mevalonate Pathway in Porokeratosisâ for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Stylianos Antonarakis (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Helen Hobbs, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p>
      <p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p>
      <p>This paper explores the genetic basis of porokeratosis, a genetically heterogeneous autosomal dominant disorder of keratinization that includes both inherited and sporadic forms. Mutations in mevalonate kinase (MVK), a key enzyme in sterol synthesis, were shown previously by these authors to cause the disease in a subset of individuals, but the etiology in most affected individuals has remained unknown. Here the authors test the hypothesis that the disease is due to defective isoprenoid generation and function. First, they used linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing to identify a second defective gene in the mevalonate pathway that causes this disorder, mevalonate decarboxylase (<italic>MVD</italic>). They then sequenced 12 genes in the mevalonate and isoprenoid pathways in 134 index cases and provide evidence that mutations inactivating 3 more genes in the pathway (<italic>PMVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic> and <italic>FDPS</italic>) also cause this disease. Collectively, implicated variants in the 4 genes identified explain disease in 98% of familial cases and 73% of apparently sporadic cases. They also provide evidence for correlation between the underlying gene and selected aspects of clinical presentation.</p>
      <p>The three reviewers agree that the paper is clearly written and the major conclusions of the paper are supported by the data presented. Although this represents an important advance in the molecular characterization of this disorder, and further implicates and refines the disrupted pathway, the paper does not provide sufficient mechanistic insights to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and without such data is better suited for a subspecialty journal. How do defects in mevalonate metabolism cause the keratinization defects â toxic intermediary metabolites vs. deficiency of metabolic end-products? Most individuals were heterozygous for a mutation. Since the genes all encode enzymes, is there a mutation in the normal allele, or possibly in another allele in the pathway, in the skin lesions? Providing data to address any one of these questions would suffice.</p>
      <p>Other major concerns:</p>
      <p>1) While the authors describe that complete co-segregation between each putative mutation and disease was observed (and representative pedigrees are shown), these data should be expanded. While it might not be plausible to show pedigrees for all 60 familial cases with a defined mutation, it would be worth noting the size distribution of families for each gene and the number of families that achieved an independent LOD score &gt;2.0 or &gt;3.0, for example.</p>
      <p>2) Curiously, it is stated that the vast majority of cases associated with variation in <italic>PMVK</italic> or <italic>FDPS</italic> were sporadic. If familial segregation was ever seen for these 2 genes, it should be shown. Genetic evidence that at least some of the sporadic mutations are de novo should be provided. It would also be informative to perform a formal burden test for these 2 genes to document enrichment for novel/rare and predicted deleterious variation in association with phenotype.</p>
      <p>3) There is no evidence of pathogenicity for a number of the missense variants listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> aside from the fact that they are present in cases and not controls (or 1 control, in the case of variant 44, <italic>MVD</italic> c.746T&gt;C in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Providing information regarding the presence of these mutations in the public databases would be informative. A formal burden test for each new gene should be performed.</p>
      <p>4) While the authors acknowledge that <italic>MVK</italic> mutations have previously been observed in other disorders, including mevalonic aciduria (MA) and hyper IgD syndrome (HIGDS), the same appears not to be true for the other 3 genes. Curiously, patients with biallelic mutations causing MA or HIGDS do not show porokeratosis, nor do their heterozygous parents. This is particularly puzzling because this group has identified porokeratosis in individuals heterozygous for some of the same mutations. Variation in environmental exposure (e.g. UV light) has been invoked as a potential mechanism, however this seems less tenable given the complete penetrance seen for porokeratosis in the described families. Somatic loss of the other <italic>MVK</italic> allele in skin lesions was previously excluded in a handful of patients, but this should be revisited in this manuscript.</p>

      <p><italic>1) While the authors describe that complete co-segregation between each putative mutation and disease was observed (and representative pedigrees are shown), these data should be expanded. While it might not be plausible to show pedigrees for all 60 familial cases with a defined mutation, it would be worth noting the size distribution of families for each gene and the number of families that achieved an independent LOD score &gt;2.0 or &gt;3.0, for example</italic>.</p>
      <p>Among 61 familial cases, we examined members of 21 families from different provinces of China, whose generations ranged from 2 to 6. There were 5 core families (F-1, F-2, F-3, F-19 and F-24) in which more than 10 family members and blood samples were collected. The maximum two-point LOD score of F-1, F-2, F-3, F-19 and F-24 were 5.56 (D12S79), 8.62 (D12S84), 3.73 (D16S3074), 2.78 (D12S1583), 4.61 (D12S84), respectively. There were 40 probands from different PK families during the past 10 years, which could have been used for confirmation. All of them were adult and came to the out-patient department by themselves. We didnât examine their family members and collected their blood samples. Therefore, it is difficult to calculate a reasonable LOD score in those non-core pedigrees. The sentence âWe confirmed the genomic variations by Sanger sequencing in each family member. Each mutation displayed 100% cosegregation with PK phenotype in the familyâ may be misleading. Therefore, it was replaced with: âWe determined the genomic variations by Sanger sequencing in other family members apart from one with unknown mutation. In 20 pedigrees with more than two blood samples collected, all patients carried the same mutation with the proband, on the contrary, no mutation was detected in all family healthy membersâ.</p>
      <p><italic>2) Curiously, it is stated that the vast majority of cases associated with variation in</italic> PMVK <italic>or</italic> FDPS <italic>were sporadic. If familial segregation was ever seen for these 2 genes, it should be shown. Genetic evidence that at least some of the sporadic mutations are de novo should be provided. It would also be informative to perform a formal burden test for these 2 genes to document enrichment for novel/rare and predicted deleterious variation in association with phenotype</italic>.</p>
      <p>The sentence âIn contrast, mutations in <italic>PMVK</italic> and <italic>FDPS</italic> were mainly found in proband or sporadic casesâ was misleading. Since only 9 index patients were identified to carry <italic>PMVK</italic> mutations, and 3 of them were familial cases, and only 4 index patients were identified to carry <italic>FDPS</italic> mutations, and 2 of them were familial cases. Those index patients with negative family history were classified as the sporadic cases. Actually, the sporadic case might not be truly the only one patient in his family, because PK could be late-onset, undiscovered in non-exposure region. Therefore, we deleted this sentence in our revised manuscript. All 73 sporadic cases were adult and collected during the past 10 years, which could have been used for confirmation. Most of them lived separately with their parents and were out of touch with us for years. We didnât examine those parents and get no informed consent and no peripheral blood from them. We are really sorry for that. The formal burden test is generally used for complex diseases with a large number of samples (Nat Genet. 2012, 29;44:623-630; Hum Mol Genet. 2012,21:R1-9). However, it is not suitable for our study.</p>
      <p><italic>3) There is no evidence of pathogenicity for a number of the missense variants listed in</italic>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref>
<italic>aside from the fact that they are present in cases and not controls (or 1 control, in the case of variant 44,</italic> MVD <italic>c.746T&gt;C in</italic>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>). Providing information regarding the presence of these mutations in the public databases would be informative. A formal burden test for each new gene should be performed</italic>.</p>
      <p>The highest frequency mutation (c.746T&gt;C in <italic>MVD</italic>) was identified in one control. This control was a 22 year-old male, who took routine medical examination in the hospital. He had no PK lesions till now and gave negative familial history of skin diseases. He could be predicted to develop PK in future. In view of its high frequency of occurence in PK, p-value of this mutation showed significant difference (p=0.00). Including this common mutation, there were 11 mutations had been identified in at least 2 index patients, but not in 270 controls. There are 7 mutations in <italic>MVK</italic> have been reported as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, moreover, 5 mutations of them were identified in at least 2 index patients and 2 mutations of them were identified in 2 different sporadic cases. There were 4 mutations identified only in one family, but more than 2 patients in the pedigree were identified to carry this mutation and other healthy family members were not. Thus, at least 17 mutations in <italic>MVK</italic>, <italic>MVD</italic> and <italic>PMVK</italic> could be considered as pathogenic with strong evidence.</p>
      <p>A formal burden test for each new gene may not be suitable for our study for the following two reasons: 1) the genetic and phenotypic information could provide solid support of <italic>MVK, MVD</italic> and <italic>PMVK</italic> being pathogenic genes of PK, especially <italic>MVK</italic> and <italic>MVD</italic>; 2) A formal burden test is generally used for complex traits with a large number of samples (Nat Genet. 2012, 29;44:623-630; Hum Mol Genet. 2012,21:R1-9). However, PK is regarded as monogenic disease with obvious dominant inheritance and a pedigree-based analysis could provide a more powerful way to identify the pathogenic genes, moreover, there were only 9 and 4 index patients with PK carrying different mutations in <italic>PMVK</italic> and <italic>FDPS</italic>, respectively.</p>
      <p><italic>4) While the authors acknowledge that</italic> MVK <italic>mutations have previously been observed in other disorders, including mevalonic aciduria (MA) and hyper IgD syndrome (HIGDS), the same appears not to be true for the other 3 genes. Curiously, patients with biallelic mutations causing MA or HIGDS do not show porokeratosis, nor do their heterozygous parents. This is particularly puzzling because this group has identified porokeratosis in individuals heterozygous for some of the same mutations. Variation in environmental exposure (e.g. UV light) has been invoked as a potential mechanism, however this seems less tenable given the complete penetrance seen for porokeratosis in the described families. Somatic loss of the other</italic> MVK <italic>allele in skin lesions was previously excluded in a handful of patients, but this should be revisited in this manuscript</italic>.</p>
      <p>Mevalonate kinase deficiency syndrome (MKD) are early onset (usually &lt;12 months), and it was reported that most hyper IgD syndrome (HIGDS) showed mild features of vasculitis (Arch Dermatol. 1994; 130: 59-65). Actually, it is a puzzle that why the patients with MA and HIGDS do not show PK. From the database of hereditary auto-inflammatory disorders mutations, c.417dupC and c.604G&gt;A in <italic>MVK</italic> were both reported in HIDS and PK. As for those heterozygous parents, the possible reason was that pediatricians and rheumatologists might neglect to examine their skin, since they were not familiar with porokeratosis.</p>
      <p>Somatic deletion of the wild <italic>MVK</italic> allele in skin lesions was not detected in our samples either, however, we observed the reduced expression of the wild allele in most skin lesions and a G-to-A RNA editing on the wild allele in one skin lesion. Therefore, the somatic loss of function, but not somatic deletion, of the wild allele in skin lesions should be common.</p>
