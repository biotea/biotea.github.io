      <abstract>
        <p>The current consensus model for the circadian clock in mammals is based on a transcription-translation feedback loop. In this model, CRY and PER proteins repress their own transcription by suppressing the transactivator function of the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer directly (physical model) and by facilitating post-translational modifications (chemical model). Most of the data for this model come from genetic and cell biological experiments. Here, we have purified all of the core clock proteins and performed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> biochemical experiments to test the physical model. We find that CLOCK:BMAL1 binds to an E-box sequence in DNA and that CRY binds stably to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box ternary complex independently of PER. Both CRY and PER bind to CLOCK and BMAL1 off DNA but, in contrast to CRY, PER does not bind to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex. Unexpectedly, PER actually interferes with the binding of CRY to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box ternary complex. CRY likely destabilizes the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer on DNA by a post-translational mechanism after binding to the complex. These findings support some aspects of the canonical model, but also suggest that some key features of the model need to be revised.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The circadian clock is the internal timekeeping system that generates a daily rhythm in physiology and behavior of an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In mice and humans this rhythmic behavior is generated by a molecular clock with a periodicity of about 24 h that consists of a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> The core mammalian molecular clock is made up of 4 genes/proteins and their paralogs: <italic>Clock</italic> (<italic>Npas2</italic>), <italic>Bmal1</italic>, <italic>Cry</italic> (<italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic>), and <italic>Per</italic> (<italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic>), and according to the current consensus model, operates as follows: the BMAL1 and CLOCK proteins, which are members of the bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) family of transcription factors, make a heterodimer, which binds to the E-box element in the promoters of <italic>Per</italic> and <italic>Cry</italic> genes and activates their transcription (positive arm). The CRY and PER proteins make heterodimeric complexes, which, after a time lag enter the nucleus and inhibit the CLOCK:BMAL1-activated transcription of their own genes (negative arm). This core circuitry is consolidated by additional interlocking transcriptional circuits as well as post-translational modifications and proteolytic degradation of the core clock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>The TTFL model is largely based on genetic data from mice with mutations in the so-called core clock genes, on protein-protein interaction data, reporter gene assays, and ChIP analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Various studies have led to several models for how CRY and PER repress their own transcription as well as the transcription of output genes controlled by the transactivation function of CLOCK:BMAL1. These, not necessarily mutually exclusive models, include: 1) physical (steric) models and 2) chemical (catalytic) models. In the steric model, binding of CRY, PER, or the PER:CRY complex to CLOCK and BMAL1 interferes with their transcription function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In the catalytic model, the ârepressorâ is actually a protein that recruits enzymes for post-translational modification of the activator complex and eventualy changes its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). There are numerous versions of both the chemical and physical models, and quite likely both mechanisms contribute to the generation of robust circadian rhythmicity at the transcriptional level.</p><p>Here we have used a biochemical approach to investigate the mechanisms by which the two proteins in the negative arm of the mammalian TTFL model, CRY and PER, may interfere with the transactivator function of CLOCK and BMAL1. Specifically, we have addressed the following questions: (<italic>a</italic>) do CRY or PER interfere with the formation of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex as has been suggested for zebrafish CRY1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) or do they inhibit CLOCK:BMAL1 from binding to its target sequence by shifting the equilibrium to the unbound form as has been suggested for <italic>Drosophila</italic> PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>); (<italic>b</italic>) do both CRY and PER interact with CLOCK and BMAL1 on and off DNA; (<italic>c</italic>) during repression of CLOCK-BMAL1, does PER bring CRY to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) or is it the other way around? We find that both CRY and PER bind to CLOCK-BMAL1 off DNA. Unexpectedly, and not predicted by any of the current models, only CRY binds to the CLOCK:BMAL1:DNA ternary complex. Neither the PER:CRY heterodimer nor PER alone can bind to CLOCK:BMAL1:DNA and, in fact, at a sufficiently high concentration PER interferes with the binding of CRY to this complex. These <italic>in vitro</italic> data were supported by ChIP analysis with various mouse clock gene knock-out cell lines, which revealed that binding of CRY to the cognate promoters is dependent on BMAL1 but independent of PER. In light of these findings we propose a revised TTFL model for the mammalian circadian clock.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cells and Antibodies</title><p>The <italic>Cry1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> <italic>Cry2</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mouse skin fibroblasts have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).

To prepare radiolabeled probes, 40 pmol of M34TOP or P2GSA were labeled with [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). DNA was then extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the labeled oligonucleotides were annealed with complementary strands (M34BTM and P2GS). Mini-quick spin oligo columns (Roche Applied Science) were used to remove the free ATP from labeled DNA. In EMSA experiments, the binding buffer consisted of 50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 1 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 6 m<sc>m</sc> dithiothreitol, and 20 Î¼g/ml of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). Radiolabeled DNA at â¼1 n<sc>m</sc> was mixed in 15 Î¼l with clock proteins in the following order depending on the experiments: 1) CLOCK:BMAL1 for 10 min, 2) CLOCK:BMAL1 for 5 min, then CRY, PER, or hCRY1:PER2 protein for 8 min, or 3) CLOCK:BMAL1 for 5 min, then CRY for 8 min, and PER for 8 min. All reactions were incubated at 22 Â°C followed by 10 min at 4 Â°C. In antibody supershift experiments, about 1 Î¼g of antibody was added for an additional 5 min after the original incubation at 22 Â°C.

We used both mouse CRY1 and CRY2 and mouse PER1 and PER2 in our experiments as dictated by availability and practical considerations. In addition, we used human CRY1 for the CRY1:PER2 heterodimer and human CRY1 alone as a reference cryptochrome in experiments with this heterodimer.

These findings led to the original TTFL model that proposed that the PER:CRY heterodimer (or a higher order oligomer) binds to the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex on E-boxes of the cognate promoters and suppresses the transactivation function of the complex. In addition, reporter gene assays have led to the conclusion that CRY is the major repressor of CLOCK:BMAL1 by direct interaction with either CLOCK alone or with both CLOCK and BMAL1 in a multiprotein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). However, a recent study that, in addition to reporter gene assays, employed co-immunoprecipitation assay and behavioral analysis of transgenic mice overexpressing PER2 or CRY1 concluded that PER2 directly binds to CLOCK:BMAL1 and brings CRY1 to the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

Importantly, the retarded band is supershifted both with anti-CLOCK and anti-BMAL1 antibodies (anti-Myc as negative control), indicating that the protein-DNA complex contains both the CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins (<italic>lanes 6</italic> and <italic>8</italic>).</p><p>Next, we investigated the effect of CRY1 on the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box ternary complex. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic> the complex was incubated with increasing concentrations of CRY1 and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Two conclusions emerge from this figure. First, CRY1 does not disrupt the ternary complex under our experimental conditions as evidenced by the intensity of the CLOCK:BMAL1:DNA band in the absence and presence of CRY. Second, in the presence of CRY, in particular at the highest CRY concentration used in this experiment, there is a slight supershift of the protein-DNA complex, suggesting that CRY associates with CLOCK:BMAL1 on DNA. To further examine this association, we attempted to supershift the presumed CRY:CLOCK:BMAL1:DNA complex with antibodies against each of the 3 proteins. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic> the complex is nearly completely supershifted by anti-CLOCK and anti-BMAL1 antibodies and a significant fraction of it was supershifted with anti-CRY antibodies as well. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic> we show that with high concentrations of CRY protein, most of the protein-DNA complex is supershifted, indicating that under appropriate assay conditions nearly all of the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex is bound to CRY1. In addition, CRY2 protein, but not <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY binds to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex in our assay (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M111.254680/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>). The CLOCK:BMAL1:CRY1 complex co-purified from mammalian cells also showed clear binding activity to the E-box as a ternary complex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M111.254680/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></ext-link>). To ascertain the specificity of CRY1 binding to CLOCK:BMAL1 on an E-box we performed additional experiments to test effects of CRY on other E-box-binding proteins including the BMAL1 homodimer and the MAX homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>F</italic> shows that the association of CRY1 with the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex is specific, because the mobility of the BMAL1:E-box or the MAX:E-box complexes are not affected by CRY1 or CRY1 plus anti-CRY1 antibody under conditions where the entire CRY1:CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box is supershifted by the anti-CRY1 antibody. These data unambiguously show that the CRY protein does not dissociate CLOCK:BMAL1 from the E-box by physical interaction; in contrast, it binds to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex with high specificity and without the intermediacy of another protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Footprint of CLOCK:BMAL1</title><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> show that under appropriate reaction conditions nearly all of the BMAL1:CLOCK:E-box complexes are associated with CRY1. Yet, even under conditions of saturating concentration of CRY1 only a minor CRY1-induced supershift is detected in the DNA-protein complex. This could be due either to the relatively small molecular mass of CRY1 (â65 kDa) compared with that of the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer (â180 kDa) or to the shape and electrostatic charge of the proteins involved. It is well known that the degree of mobility shift of DNA-protein complexes is not linear with the size of the binding protein. Indeed, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>F</italic> the BMAL1 homodimer:DNA complex migrates slower than the CLOCK:BMAL1-DNA complex even though the latter complex possesses a molecular mass â25 kDa more than the former. Hence, we considered the possibility that the CRY1:CLOCK:BMAL1 complex on an E-box, which is clearly detectable only by anti-CRY1 antibody induced supershift in gel retardation experiments, may be more readily detectable by DNase I footprinting, which has higher resolution than the gel retardation assay. For DNase I footprinting, we used a 60-bp fragment P2GS encompassing an E-box in the mouse <italic>Per1</italic> promoter, which was shown to be functional in a reporter gene assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). In the gel mobility shift assay using this fragment we obtained results similar to those obtained with the 14-bp E-box fragment used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M111.254680/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>D</italic></ext-link>). Importantly, in the presence of anti-CRY1 antibodies, most of the DNA-protein complex was supershifted in the reaction that included CRY1 in the reaction mixture. Interestingly, when these complexes were probed by DNase I footprinting the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer produced a rather small footprint of 8-bp centered around the E-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>), and this footprint was not affected by CRY1 under conditions known to produce the CRY1:CLOCK:BMAL1 complex on the E-box. Even though this result did not provide further insight on the anatomy of the CLOCK:BMAL1:CRY complex, the footprint is consistent with the known properties of interactions of bHLH family protein with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In the complex of BMAL1 and CLOCK, both of which are bHLH-PAS domain proteins, contact with DNA is made with the bHLH domains, which are located at the extreme N terminus of each member of the heterodimer. The extended structure of this family of proteins explains the small footprint and also explains the lack of effect of CRY1 on the footprint because CRYs bind to the PAS domains and the C-terminal domains distant from the DNA contact region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DNase I footprint of clock proteins on an E-box.</bold> <italic>A</italic>, schematic representation of the <italic>mPer1</italic> promoter illustrating the relative position and the sequence of one strand of the 60-bp duplex encompassing the <italic>mPer1</italic> E-box2. <italic>CDS</italic> indicates coding DNA sequence. <italic>B</italic>, EMSA with the 60-bp duplex and supershift of the protein-DNA (0.4 n<sc>m</sc> CRY and 0.2 n<sc>m</sc> CLOCK:BMAL1 dimer) complexes with the indicated antibodies.

The coordinated inhibitor function of PER and CRY can be classified by the following different steric models: (<italic>a</italic>) PER:CRY complex binds to CLOCK:BMAL1 off DNA and disrupts the heterodimer or interferes with its binding to E-boxes in the cognate promoters.

To differentiate among these models, we investigated the combined effects of PER and CRY on the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex. Because PER2 appears to be more important than PER1 for normal clock function in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), we used PER2 in most of our experiments.</p><p>The various models were tested by gel mobility shift assays. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M111.254680/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>E</italic></ext-link> show that, in contrast to CRY1 and CRY2, PER1 and PER2 do not affect the mobility of the CLOCK:BMAL1: E-box complex.

When Myc-tagged CRY1 and PER2 were added to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box reaction mixture, Myc-CRY1 slightly retarded the DNA-protein band, which, importantly, upon the addition of Myc antibodies was nearly completely supershifted. In contrast, Myc-PER2 at the same concentration as Myc-CRY1 had no effect on the mobility of the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex, and most importantly, the addition of anti-Myc antibodies to the Myc-PER2 plus CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box reaction mixture did not affect the mobility of the protein-DNA band.

With these considerations, we purified the PER2:hCRY1 complex and the hCRY1 as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>) and tested them in gel mobility shift assays. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D</italic>. As expected, CRY1 alone supershifts the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex. Surprisingly, however, the PER2:CRY1 heterodimer does not affect migration of the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box even though CRY1 alone at a concentration equivalent to its concentration in the PER2:CRY1 heterodimer clearly retards the protein-DNA band. The most parsimonious explanation of these data is that PER2 interferes with binding of CRY1 to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex. However, because such a conclusion is contrary to the generally held view that PER either mediates the binding of CRY to CLOCK:BMAL1, or is in a complex with CRY that binds to the CLOCK:BMAL1:DNA complex, we were concerned that the lack of binding by PER2:CRY1 might have been caused by an inactive protein preparation. Therefore, to test if indeed PER2 interfered with binding of CRY to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex we performed gel mobility shift assays to test the effects of PER on a pre-assembled CRY:CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>, show that supershifting of the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex by CRY is abolished when PER2 is added to the complex as evidenced by the migration of the protein-DNA band without (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>E</italic>) and with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>F</italic>) antibodies against the affinity tag on CRY1.

To examine this issue <italic>in vivo</italic>, we conducted ChIP assays with polyclonal anti-PER2 antibodies and wild-type mouse skin fibroblast cells. However, our experiments failed to reveal any measurable binding of PER2 protein to either <italic>Per1</italic> or <italic>Per2</italic> promoters (data not shown). Because ChIP assay results may be dramatically affected by the quality of the antibodies, we carried out ChIP assays using anti-FLAG antibodies in fibroblast cell lines that stably express CRY1-FLAG (control) or PER2-FLAG proteins. The immunoprecipitation assay results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic> show that PER2-FLAG and CRY1-FLAG were precipitated at comparable levels from the two stable lines. CLOCK and BMAL1 bound to both FLAG-tagged proteins, more strongly to PER2-FLAG. Therefore, both FLAG-tagged proteins are active. However, the ChIP assay results with anti-FLAG antibodies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic> show that CRY1-FLAG, but not PER2-FLAG, can bind to <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> promoters. FLAG-tagged PER2 failed to bind these regions when the FLAG tag was at either the C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>) or N terminus (data not shown). These results indicate that at least in skin fibroblast, PER2 does not bind to these E-boxes. The strong interaction of PER2 with CLOCK and BMAL1 probably occurs only when these proteins are off DNA.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>CRY1 represses <italic>Dbp</italic> transcription independently of PER1 and PER2 in mouse fibroblasts.</bold> <italic>A</italic>, expression of clock proteins in mouse fibroblasts stably expressing CRY1-FLAG or PER2-FLAG.

To determine whether this binding affects transcription we used a CLOCK:BMAL1-controlled gene with high amplitude circadian oscillation, <italic>Dbp</italic>, as a readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). First, we confirmed that as in the case of the <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> promoters, CRY1 binds to the E-box in the <italic>Dbp</italic> gene independently of PER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>). Then to determine the effects of CRY binding on <italic>Dbp</italic> transcription in the absence and presence of PER, we down-regulated CRY1 and CRY2 in the wild-type and <italic>Per</italic> mutant background and analyzed the cells for <italic>Dbp</italic> transcription as measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Clearly, the reduction in CRY level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>D</italic>) is accompanied by a proportional increase in the level of <italic>Dbp</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic>), consistent with the consensus clock model whereby the binding of CRY to CLOCK:BMAL1 at the E-boxes of the target genes represses the transcription of these genes. Importantly, both in wild-type and <italic>Per1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> <italic>Per2</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cell lines, the <italic>Dbp</italic> mRNA level goes up similarly upon down-regulation of CRY.

However, despite the extensive genetic and cell biological data that exist in support of the canonical model, a rigorous biochemical test of the model has been lacking. Clearly, biochemical experiments with purified proteins are necessary to test some key points of the canonical model. Here, we attempted to address some key features of the model by conducting experiments with purified proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> and ChIP assays with cell lines mutated in various clock genes. Our findings support some aspects of the conventional model, but also suggest that some features of the canonical model need to be revised. A revised model consistent with our data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> and is elaborated below.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for the roles of CRY and PER in the TTFL of the mammalian circadian clock.</bold> <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, during the day (or subjective day) CLOCK:BMAL1 bind to the <italic>Per</italic> and <italic>Cry</italic> promoters and activate their transcription. In addition, REV-ERB/ROR regulates <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription. The PER and CRY proteins make heterodimers and enter the nucleus. Within the nucleus there is a dynamic equilibrium of the PER:CRY complex and solitary PER and CRY (most likely in complexes with other proteins); <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>, during the night (or subjective night), solitary CRY binds to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box ternary complex and inhibits the transcription of <italic>Per</italic> and <italic>Cry</italic> (as well as other CLOCK:BMAL1 controlled genes) both by physically interfering with the transactivation function of CLOCK:BMAL1, as well as by interfering with the post-translational modification of these proteins, which seems to be important for their transactivation functions. Data from mouse liver ChIP shows that PER2 can bind to the promoter of <italic>Bmal1</italic> and control its transcription independently of CRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). This is a highly simplified model to emphasize that CRY can directly interact with CLOCK:BMAL1 on DNA to repress its transactivator function and that similarly, based on data from other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), PER2 can regulate the transcription of genes in the âstabilizing loopâ of the clock independently of CRY to affect their transcription. <italic>NRE</italic>, nuclear responsive element.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0341171440007"/></fig><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Mechanism of CRY Repression of CLOCK:BMAL1 Transcriptional Activation</title><p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> findings are in agreement with previous reports in showing that bHLH-PAS domain proteins CLOCK and BMAL1 make a heterodimer, which binds to E-boxes in the promoters of cognate genes and functions as a transcriptional activator. Furthermore, our reconsitituted system and ChIP assays clearly demonstrate that CRY interacts strongly with CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complexes. Binding was BMAL1 dependent both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating that CRY is directly recruited to the E-box by a (CLOCK/NPAS2):BMAL1 heterodimer. Also of considerable importance is our finding that this binding of CRY is independent of PER: ChIP assays clearly demonstrated that CRY binds to regulatory E-boxes even in <italic>Per</italic> knock-out cells, and <italic>in vitro</italic>, PER was not only unnecessary for, but actually impaired CRY binding to the BMAL1:CLOCK:E-box DNA complex. Binding of CRY to the transactivator complex in the absence of PER is biologically meaningful, because we found that in <italic>Per1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> <italic>Per2</italic><sup>â/â</sup> knock-out cells, CRY down-regulated BMAL1:CLOCK-activated transcription of the <italic>Dbp</italic> gene. All of these results are in agreement with a reporter gene assay that found the inhibition of transactivation by CRY depends on the interaction of CRY with either CLOCK or both CLOCK and BMAL1 bound to DNA in S2 cells, which express no other mammalian clock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Thus, independently of PER, CRY directly interacts with the BMAL1:CLOCK:E-box complex in a BMAL1-dependent manner to form a stable complex on DNA in which the transactivator function of CLOCK:BMAL1 is inhibited by CRY.</p><p>In addition to blocking transactivation, CRY may mediate an enzymatic function. We found that CLOCK occupied the <italic>Per1</italic> E-box2, and to a lesser extent <italic>Per2</italic> E-box2, at higher frequency in <italic>Cry</italic> null cells than wild-type cells, suggesting that CRY may destabilize the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>). Relevant to this is a report showing that CLOCK:BMAL1 binds rhythmically to the <italic>Dbp</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Because under all experimental conditions tested, CRY did not destabilize the ternary complex <italic>in vitro</italic>, we ascribe the discrepancy between the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data to the effect of CRY on the phosphorylation status of other clock proteins including PER, CLOCK, and BMAL1 <italic>in vivo</italic> as it is known that the phosphorylation status of CLOCK affects its protein stability and DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of the CRY:CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box Complex by PER</title><p>Although it is clear that PER and CRY bind to one another with high affinity, the significance of this interaction for their respective functions has been a matter of considerable debate. Some reports suggest that CRY is required for nuclear transport of PER, and others indicate that, in fact, CRY depends on PER for nuclear entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that PER and CRY are required for the stability of one another, which somewhat complicates the interpretation of the results obtained with CRY or PER mutant mice and cell lines.</p><p>Similarly, even though yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments have revealed that in pairwise tests both CRY and PER directly interact with both CLOCK and BMAL1, these tests do not address the question of whether these interactions occur both off and on DNA. Some studies have concluded that CRY is the <italic>bona fide</italic> repressor that binds to CLOCK:BMAL1 and brings along PER to E-boxes in target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, a recent study that employed co-immunoprecipition and behavioral analysis of CRY1- or PER2- overproducing mice suggested that PER2 bridges CRY and CLOCK:BMAL1 bound to DNA to drive the circadian negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we focused on the question of CRY/PER interactions with CLOCK and BMAL1 both on and off DNA in a defined system. These <italic>in vitro</italic> data were further verified by ChIP experiments in mouse fibroblasts to ascertain that the results we observed with the <italic>in vitro</italic> system were not an artifact of the reaction conditions. Contrary to our expectations, based on numerous reports indicating an essential role for PER in repressing CLOCK:BMAL1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and based on <italic>in vitro</italic> data, including our own, which show strong PER/CLOCK/BMAL1 interaction off DNA, we were unable to detect the formation of a PER:CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex under a variety of experimental conditions. Furthermore, the presence of CRY in the reaction mixture does not promote the recruitment of PER to the CLOCK:BMAL1:DNA complex. In contrast, ChIP assays failed to reveal measurable binding of PER2 protein to either <italic>Per1</italic> or <italic>Per2</italic> promoters in wild-type fibroblasts. This is consistent with our model that CRY binds directly to the BMAL1:CLOCK:E-box complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). However, the lack of PER2 binding to cognate promoters in fibroblasts differs from the findings with ChIP using liver nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Most likely, liver cells express proteins, which are not expressed in fibroblasts and interact with PER2 and recruit it to the target promoters in a tissue-specific manner.</p><p>Most surprisingly, perhaps, was our finding that even though solitary CRY binds to a CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box <italic>in vitro</italic>, the CRY:PER heterodimer does not, suggesting that PER interferes with binding of CRY to the transactivator on DNA. In support of this conclusion, we found that when PER was added to the CRY:CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex, CRY was removed from the complex. This is consistent with a model whereby CRY is in a dynamic equilibrium with CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box, and in the presence of PER at a sufficiently high concentration in the nucleus, all CRY becomes trapped in the form of a PER:CRY heterodimer, which cannot bind to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>). This conclusion may explain the severely disrupted rhythm in PER2 overexpressing fibroblasts or mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), but is counterintuitive to the genetically defined role of PER as a repressor in the core clock circuitry, and calls for re-evaluation of the core molecular clock model or revision of at least some aspects of the model.</p><p>Quite conceivably, PER functions as a repressor of CLOCK:BMAL1 not in the conventional sense by physical interaction with the transactivator complex, but by participating in stabilization and nuclear transport of CRY, which is the actual repressor, as well as by regulating transcription through interactions with some nuclear receptors as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). We note, however, that this model does not incorporate the well known and rather strong interactions of PER with CLOCK and BMAL1. It is conceivable that PER interacts with these proteins off DNA, and in doing so, prevents their association with DNA although this is not consistent with the reporter gene assay results that show that the PER protein alone is a weak inhibitor of CLOCK:BMAL1 activity. It is, however, possible that PER, in addition to aiding CRY repressor function in its capacity as chaperone. It may, to a limited degree, aid in the formation of the CRY:CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex in its capacity as a molecular matchmaker by transient interaction with CLOCK:BMAL1 on DNA. Clearly, additional work is needed to clarify the mechanism by which PER participates in the negative arm of the transcription-translation feedback loop, and, if there is some tissue specificity (such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus <italic>versus</italic> peripheral tissue) in the core clock circuitry.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymatic (Catalytic) Control of Circadian TTFL</title><p>It has been shown that the core clock proteins are subject to phosphorylation and ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In both <italic>Neurospora</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the negative elements inhibit the DNA binding of the positive elements by recruiting kinases to phosphorylate the positive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Undoubtedly, these and other post-translational events contribute significantly to the generation of a robust TTFL with circadian periodicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Here, we have presented some basic biochemical facts regarding the contributions of the interactions of the proteins in the positive arm (CLOCK and BMAL1) and negative arm (CRY and PER) of the clock with one another on and off DNA to the generation of the circadian TTFL. We believe quantitative <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of the post-translational modifications of clock proteins are needed for a comprehensive description of the mammalian circadian clock.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec>
