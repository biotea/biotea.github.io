          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Glycosyl transferases transfer glycosyl groups onto their substrate. Localization partially defines their function. Glycosyl transferase 25 domain 1 (GLT25D1) was recently shown to have galactosyltransferase activity towards collagens and another well known substrate, mannose binding lectin (MBL). To gain more insight in the role of galactosylation of lysines in the Gly-X-Lys repeats of collagenous proteins, we investigated the subcellular localization of GLT25D1.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Immunofluorescence analysis of GLT25D1 expressed in the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7), revealed a perinuclear lattice like staining, resembling localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Possible targeting signals, an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal ER-retention signal, were identified using prediction programs. These signals were then investigated by constructing a series of epitope-tagged forms of GLT25D1 that were analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blotting. In agreement with the predictions our results show that GLT25D1 is directed to the ER lumen as a soluble protein and retained there. Moreover, using two endoglycosidase enzymes EndoH and EndoF, we demonstrate that the putative bi-functional glycosyl transferase itself is a glycoprotein. Additionally we examined co-localization of GLT25D1 with MBL and lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3, PLOD3), which is a protein able to catalyze hydroxylation of lysine residues before they can be glycosylated. We demonstrate overlapping localization patterns of GLT25D1, MBL and LH3.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Taken together our data indicate that galactosylation of collagenous proteins by the soluble GLT25D1 occurs in the early secretory pathway.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Hydroxylation and subsequent glycosylation of lysine residues is a characteristic of collagens and proteins containing a collagen-like region (collectins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These proteins contain repeats of Gly-X-Y motifs, where lysines present at the Y-position can be galactosylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Collagens and collectins are built up of three polypeptide chains, which wind together to form a triple helix. The Gly-X-Y repeats, where X is often a proline, allow tight coiling of the chains as the small glycines fit into sterically restricted spaces where the three chains come together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>The function of the lysine linked sugars is not fully understood, but this posttranslational event occurs before triple helix formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and mutations in these residues clearly affect the oligomerization state resulting in aberrant secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Mutation of two lysines to arginines in the Gly-X-Lys repeat of mannose binding lectin (MBL), which is involved in neutralization of invading microorganisms by triggering the complement cascade, resulted in inefficient complement activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. At the protein level glycosylated lysines are suggested to play a role in folding, stability and prevention of inter-chain cross-linking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>Lysyl hydroxylase enzymes catalyze the hydroxylation reaction on lysines, after which the residue can by glycosylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recently, two new genes responsible for the galactosylation of Gly-X-Y repeats were described. Using affinity chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, Schegg et al. identified two glycosyltransferase GT25 family members, GLT25D1 and GLT25D2, to encode galactosyltransferases involved in transfer of galactose to hydroxylysine residues in MBL and collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Attachment of galactose occurs via the Î² (1-O) bond to the hydoxylated lysine (CÎ´), assigning these proteins to Î² (1-O) galactosyltransferases.</p>
      <p>Most members of glycosyltransferases (GT) are localized to the Golgi, but GTs can also be observed in the cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria, ER, on cellular membranes, secreted from the cell or widely distributed between all these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Their distinct subcellular localization most likely reflects their role in glycosylation pathways. For example, the subsequent arrangement in which glycan synthesis takes place in the Golgi apparatus can often be related to the location of the glycosyltransferases in the cisternae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Here we examined the cellular localization of GLT25D1 relative to one of its reported substrates, MBL, which is produced in liver cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We also identified ER-targeting signals within GLT25D1 causing it to localize to the early secretory pathway.</p>

        <title>Plasmid construction</title>
        <p>To construct epitope-tagged GLT25D1 expression plasmids, the sequence was amplified by PCR from GLT25D1 full length clone, IRAKp961P01217Q (imaGenes, Berlin, Germany), using specific primers, see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The PCR products were digested with <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Xba</italic>I and ligated into pCDNA3.1mychisB (Invitrogen) similarly digested with <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Xba</italic>I. This resulted in the construction of expression vectors containing a 10-residue Myc-epitope-tag at its C-terminus. In order to construct C-terminal HA-epitope-tagged GLT25D1 expression constructs (GLT25D1-HA, Îsignal sequence-GLT25D1-HA), the Myc-epitope sequence was <italic>Xba</italic>I - <italic>Pme</italic>I cut and replaced with an <italic>Xba</italic>I - <italic>Pme</italic>I fragment coding for the HA-epitope. For construction of the RDEL at the extreme C-terminus (GLT25D1-MycRDEL, HA-GLT25D1-MycRDEL), the constructs were <italic>Age</italic>I - <italic>Pme</italic>I cut and replaced with a fragment coding for RDEL. For construction of GLT25D1 with an internal Myc-epitope-tag (GLT25D1 FL Myc-int.) after the signal sequence, two annealed oligos with protruding TGCA nucleotides (see table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were ligated into the GLT25D1 gene cut with restriction enzyme Sbf-I, which generates complementary ends (CCTGCA|GG).</p>

PFA was quenched using 50 mM NH4Cl in blockbuffer, which contained 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) in PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 in blockbuffer and stained with primary antibodies diluted in blockbuffer for 1 h. Next the coverslips were washed with blockbuffer and incubated with secondary antibody diluted in blockbuffer for 1 h. After washing with glycinebuffer (10 mM glycine in PBS), PBS and water, the coverslips were mounted with Prolong mounting medium (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were captured using Leica TCS SL confocal microscope, 63Ã Plan Apo oil immersion objective (zoom approximately three times), appropriate filter settings and sequential scan modes.

Dual staining of the internally Myc-tagged GLT25D1 transfected cells using antibody to the ER-resident protein, protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) together with the Myc-antibody demonstrated virtually complete overlap (yellow coloring), showing clear ER localization of GLT25D1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Colocalization can be quantified using Pearsons correlation, where -1 means no overlap and 1 complete colocalization. The Pearsons correlation calculated for PDI compared to GLT25D1 was 0.58, meaning considerable overlapping patterns. We furthermore examined the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi, using ERGIC53 and Giantin respectively. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, however shows only minor overlap between GLT25D1 and ERGIC/Golgi with Pearsons correlations of 0.13 and 0.04 respectively. Detailed inspection of many transfected cells showed no altered ER or Golgi distribution in GLT25D1 transfected compared to non-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and data not shown). Together these data indicate GLT25D1 mainly localizes to the early secretory pathway; particularly ER.</p>

        <title>Predictions of GLT25D1</title>
        <p>A first step towards identifying the mechanisms responsible for directing GLT25D1 to the ER is defining subcellular localization signals by using prediction algorithms (See Methods). Consistent with our observed ER localization, we noted that the N-terminal 40 amino-acids encompass a potential ER signal sequence, including a hydrophobic core region (h-region), a positively charged N-terminus (n-region) and a potential cleavage site between position 36 and 37 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Furthermore, upon examining the C-terminus of the protein we noticed that the four extreme C-terminal residues Arg-Asp-Glu-Leu (RDEL) strongly resemble the tetrapeptide sequence KDEL, which causes retention in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Both predictions point to possible insertion of GLT25D1 into the ER and, if cleavage occurs, release from the ER membrane into the ER lumen. In order to investigate these potential targeting signals a series of deletions from the N-terminus as well as the C-terminus, including epitope tags on the opposite side, were made to observe their effect on localization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p>

        <title>N-terminal signal sequence targets GLT25D1 to the ER</title>
        <p>We first studied the localization of GLT25D1 with the putative signal sequence deleted (GLT25D1-ÎSS-Myc-tagged) compared to full-length GLT25D1 (GLT25D1 FL-HA-tagged). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> little overlap was evident with the full-length protein and the ÎSS protein, the latter displaying a diffuse cytosolic staining. This strongly suggests that the extreme N-terminus is a genuine signal sequence and targets the protein to the ER. Furthermore when the N-terminal signal sequence of GLT25D1 was fused to GFP (SS-GFP), a reticular expression pattern was observed in a few cells (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Cleavage of the GLT25D1 signal sequence</title>
        <p>Next to the signal sequence a potential cleavage site is predicted (c-region, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Cleavage of this N-terminal signal of GLT25D1 was analyzed by blotting total cell lysate of cells transfected with N-terminally HA-tagged GLT25D1 construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>: HA-FL-Myc, construct 1). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, the N-terminal HA-tagged GLT25D1 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>: lane1, Total, anti-HA) was not visible with an anti-HA antibody, suggesting that the N-terminus was cleaved off. This construct is also tagged at the C-terminus with a Myc-tag that was detected in the total cell lysate, showing that the protein was indeed correctly expressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>: lane1, Total, anti-Myc). When Huh7 cells were transfected with GLT25D1 only Myc-tagged at the C-terminus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>: FL-Myc, construct 2) identical protein size was detected compared to GLT25D1 tagged on both sides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>: lane1 and 2, Total, anti-Myc). This furthermore indicates that the N-terminal signal sequence must be cleaved, since both proteins have a distinct N-terminus, which should have resulted in a different size in the absence of cleavage. Note the size difference between the full length GLT25D1 construct and the GLT25D1 construct with a deleted signal sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>: compare lanes 2 and 3, Total, anti-Myc), which is caused by protein glycosylation and will be explained below. Our findings are furthermore confirmed with other constructs, FL-MycRDEL, HA-FL-MycRDEL, HA-FL and HA-ÎRDEL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>: lanes 6, 7, 8 and 9, Total, anti-Myc and anti-HA). The N-terminal HA-tag is not detected in lanes 7, 8 and 9 and a similar molecular weight of the constructs HA-FL-MycRDEL and FL-MycRDEL is observed. Hence, apparent by these results, the signal sequence of GLT25D1 is cleaved.</p>

        <title>Carboxy terminal RDEL retains GLT25D1 in the ER</title>
        <p>Proteins targeted to the ER that lack a specific retention signal are secreted or transported to the cell-membrane. Since the hydrophobic signal sequence of GLT25D1 is clearly cleaved off and its potential hydrophobic membrane anchor lost, the protein could be secreted in the cell culture medium. In contrast, if the C-terminal residues RDEL represent an ER retrieval signal, GLT25D1 would be retained. We therefore examined the presence of the tagged GLT25D1 constructs in the cell culture medium. The constructs HA-FL and HA-FL with RDEL deleted (HA-FL-ÎRDEL) could not be shown to be present in the medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>: lanes 8 and 9, Medium, anti-HA), because the HA recognition epitope tag is cleaved off together with the signal sequence. Transfected HA-FL-Myc, FL-Myc and FL-HA could be detected with a C-terminal tag in the medium of Huh7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>: lanes 1, 2, and 4, Medium, anti-Myc and anti-HA). However addition of an epitope tag (either Myc or HA) at the C-terminus of GLT25D1 could interfere with the RDEL retention function, resulting in (partial) secretion. When we compare localization of GLT25D1-HA tagged and GLT25D1 internally Myc-tagged (GLT25D1 FL Myc-int.), we observe large overlapping patterns (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Assuming that the internal tag reflects in endogenous proteins best, the tagging seems to influence localization only slightly.</p>
        <p>In order to preserve the RDEL at the extreme C-terminus, we constructed RDEL at the end of two constructs, HA-FL-MycRDEL and FL-MycRDEL. In contrast to HA-FL-myc and FL-myc, both these constructs could not be detected in the medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>: lanes 6 and 7, Medium, anti-Myc), indicating that the RDEL is an ER-retention signal for GLT25D1. Additionally, as anticipated protein without the signal sequence ÎSS-Myc and ÎSS-HA, which are located in the cytosol, were not observed in the hepatocyte cell culture medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>: lanes 3 and 5, Medium, anti-Myc and anti-HA). Taken together these data clearly indicate that RDEL retrieves GLT25D1 to the ER.</p>
        <p>Cleavage and retrieval of GLT25D1 could indicate that the protein is soluble. To confirm this we performed a membrane floatation gradient experiment (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). As marker for integral membrane proteins we used Calnexin and PDI was used as a type of ER soluble protein. As anticipated, Calnexin is observed in the membrane floatation fractions with a peak signal present in fraction 7, while PDI is mainly found in the non-floating, bottom fractions. The bulk of GLT25D1 is observed in the bottom fractions of the gradient, indicating the protein is not an integral membrane protein.</p>

        <title>GLT25D1 is N-linked glycosylated</title>
        <p>Unexpectedly there is a substantial size difference between full-length GLT25D1 proteins, which are cleaved in the ER, and proteins with a deleted ER signal sequence (ÎSS) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>: compare lane 1 with 2 and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>: compare lanes 1, 2 and 4 with lanes 3 and 5, Total, anti-Myc and anti-HA). The signal sequence deletion constructs were made starting at the predicted signal cleavage site and should therefore be of equal size. The higher molecular weight of the processed full-length proteins might be explained by posttranslational modifications occurring in the ER, which can not take place on proteins with a deleted signal sequence contained in the cytosol. A potential modification increasing the molecular weight of a protein occurring in the ER is Asn-linked glycosylation. To assess glycosylation, we employed digestion with Endoglycosidase H and F (EndoH, EndoF), which cleave high mannose-containing oligosaccharides. GLT25D1 was purified from Huh7 cells transfected with FL-Myc (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>: construct 2) or ÎSS-Myc (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>: construct 3), then treated with EndoH/EndoF, separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) (See for more details Methods). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> shows that after de-glycosylation the full-length protein decreases in molecular weight similar to the delta-signal sequence protein. This illustrates that the size difference is caused by glycosylation. When the full-length protein was only shortly incubated with EndoH or EndoF, we could discern, besides the full-length protein, three additional products (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These four bands likely correspond to three glycosylations of GLT25D1.</p>

        <title>GLT25D1 colocalizes with mannose binding lectin and lysyl hydroxylase</title>
        <p>The report by Schegg et al., which elegantly demonstrated that GLT25D1 shows a strong galactosyltransferase activity towards mannose binding lectin (MBL), prompted us to compare the intracellular location of GLT25D1 and its substrate MBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To correlate the expression of GLT25D1 with MBL in liver cells, where MBL is synthesized, we transfected GFP-tagged MBL and internal Myc-tagged GLT25D1 into Huh7 cells and performed immunofluorescence analysis. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> GLT25D1 is shown in red and MBL in green (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>: top, first two panels), they both have a perinuclear and reticular staining. MBL localizes intracellular predominantly to the ER, though also accumulates in foci (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>: top, first panel) that were previously shown by Nonaka et al. to be ER exit sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In accordance with ER localization, substantial co-localization of GLT25D1 with MBL is illustrated by yellow coloring in the overlay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>: bottom, first panel).</p>

        <p>Hydroxylation of lysines, to which galactosyltransferases transfer galactose, is carried out by lysyl hydroxylases (LH). These enzymes act upstream of glycosyltransferases. We therefore triple labeled the cells with LH3, which is one of the three LH isoforms in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], depicted in blue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>: top, third panel).

In summary, there seem to be partially overlapping patterns of GLT25D1, MBL and LH3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>: bottom, third panel, white staining). To further substantiate co-localization, we generated an intensity graph of the signals from each of these three proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The human protein GLT25D1 was reported to have galactosyltransferase activity towards mannose binding lectin (MBL), transferring galactose to hydroxylysine residues in the Gly-X-Lys repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this report we examined the GLT25D1 localisation by immunofluorescence and made deletion mutants of GLT25D1 to ascertain whether the predicted subcellular targeting signal sequences were functional (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). It should be noted that exogenous over-expression might influence localization due to saturation of the transport machinery. We performed our studies with a human hepatoma cell line, Huh7, because MBL is produced mainly by liver cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Additionally, we confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis that GLT25D1 is normally expressed in these cells (Observed peptides are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Moreover identical results were obtained in an additional cell line VERO, derived from monkey kidney epithelial cells. We found that GLT25D1, after being targeted to and cleaved in the ER (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), appears primarily in the ER most likely due to a functional ER retention signal, RDEL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Although GLT25D1 gets secreted when a C-terminal tag is present, no secretion was found when the extreme four amino acids are RDEL, showing that these represent a functional ER retention signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). This modified but related to KDEL carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide has been shown to direct intracellular retention for several other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Moreover GLT25D1 is highly sensitive to Endoglycosidase H, which is able to cleave non-complex N-linked oligosaccharides present in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This not only shows targeting to the ER lumen, but also ER-retention of the soluble GLT25D1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p>
      <p>We furthermore demonstrate by partial digestion with Endoglycosidase H or F that at least three asparagine residues become N-glycosylated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In accordance with the number of glycosylated forms we distinguish, the NetNglyc server exactly predicted three asparagines to be N-glycosylated (residues 96, 184, 404) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), suggesting that all these three residues are modified.</p>
      <p>GLT25D1 is able to galactosylate MBL and other collagens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, we observe colocalization between GLT25D1 and MBL. Intracellularly MBL forms oligomers before it moves from the ER to the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and is secreted to serve as an activator of the lectin complement pathway. Binding of MBL to carbohydrates on pathogens not only can mediate an innate immune response towards microbes, but more and more data indicate a potential defense against viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The envelope glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola and Influenza A virus were demonstrated to attach to serum MBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Additionally a subcellular interaction between HIV glycoprotein gp120 and MBL was shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The presence of GLT25D1 mainly in the ER, where it colocalizes with MBL and LH3, suggests that galactosylation by GLT25D1 occurs early in bio-synthesis before being transported to the Golgi. This would be in line with the results of Heise et al., which demonstrate that glycosylation of MBL continues while transport to the Golgi complex is blocked by Brefeldin A treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Before galactosylation of the lysine in the Gly-X-Lys repeat, the lysine is hydoxylated. LH3 has hydroxylase, galactosyltransferase and glucosyltransferase activity (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). When performing domain prediction analysis of GLT25D1 (see Methods), we noticed that GLT25D1 is a modular glycosyltransferase (GT) composed of two GT family members, with the C-terminal one related to glycosyltransferase of family 25 (hence its name) and an additional N-terminal domain which displays distant relation to family GT2 transferases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). In both domains the conserved DxD motif, which binds one of the ribose hydroxyl groups, could be observed (See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>; Bernard Henrissat personal communications). Other examples of modular GTs are Heparin synthase, Chondroitin synthase and hyaluronan synthase, each involved in addition of alternating sugars, and each containing an N-terminal GT2 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Part of this GT2 domain of GLT25D1 surprisingly shows sequence homology to LH3, which suggests that they might function similarly either in substrate recognition or in glucosyltransferase activity.</p>
      <p>It is interesting to note that in a search for tumor-specific markers both GLT25D1 and LH3 genes were upregulated in a large majority of human malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], but the biological pathway involved is unknown. The location of a particular glycosyltransferase in the cell clearly defines its function and biological importance. Most glycosyltransferases reside in the Golgi, where glycan synthesis takes place in a sequential order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The presence of GLT25D1 early in the secretory pathway indicates its enzyme activity is displayed there, confirming that collagens and collectins are likely to be glycosylated in the ER before they move to the Golgi apparatus and are secreted. Yet the exact role of glycosylated hydroxylysine residues in collagenous proteins is still poorly understood. Nonetheless, our results strengthen the hypothesis that glycosylation of collagens and collectins occurs early in their biosynthesis.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Our experiments show that GLT25D1 is a soluble protein present in the lumen of the ER and is cleaved after its signal sequence and is N-glycosylated at three positions. The occurrence of GLT25D1 early in the secretory pathway, mainly ER, suggests that collagens and collectins are likely to be galactosylated before trafficking to the Golgi and are secreted.</p>

          <p><bold>GLT25D1 is a luminal ER protein</bold>. After 24 h, Huh7 cells transfected with GLT25D1 FL-HA were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Cell lysates were loaded under a sucrose gradient from 10-80% w/v. Fractions were taken from top (fraction 1) to bottom (fraction 12) and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis for Calnexin and PDI (protein disulfide isomerase). GLT25D1 FL-HA was visualized using an antibody against HA-epitope.</p>
