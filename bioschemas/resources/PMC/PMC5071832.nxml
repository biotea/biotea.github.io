      <abstract>
        <p>Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) play a central role in tryptophan metabolism and are involved in many cellular and disease processes. Here we report the crystal structure of human TDO (hTDO) in a ternary complex with the substrates <italic>L</italic>-Trp and O<sub>2</sub> and in a binary complex with the product <italic>N</italic>-formylkynurenine (NFK), defining for the first time the binding modes of both substrates and the product of this enzyme. The structure indicates that the dioxygenation reaction is initiated by a direct attack of O<sub>2</sub> on the C<sub>2</sub> atom of the <italic>L</italic>-Trp indole ring. The structure also reveals an exo binding site for <italic>L</italic>-Trp, located ~42 Ã from the active site and formed by residues conserved among tryptophan-auxotrophic TDOs. Biochemical and cellular studies indicate that Trp binding at this exo site does not affect enzyme catalysis but instead it retards the degradation of hTDO through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway. This exo site may therefore provide a novel <italic>L-</italic>Trp-mediated regulation mechanism for cellular degradation of hTDO, which may have important implications in human diseases.</p>

  <body>
    <p>TDO and IDO are heme proteins that catalyze the oxidative cleavage of <italic>L</italic>-Trp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), the first and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway for <italic>L</italic>-Trp catabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Trp is the least abundant essential amino acid. The majority of dietary Trp (~95%) is metabolized in the liver through this pathway to produce NAD<sup>+</sup>, while a small amount (~1%) is utilized to synthesize serotonin and melatonin through the serotonin pathway. TDO hence plays an important role in controlling the relative Trp flux along the two pathways. Its up-regulation can lead to over-production of neuroactive metabolites as well as serotonin deficiency. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, TDO is known as <italic>vermilion</italic>, responsible for the bright-red eye color, due to its involvement in ommochrome biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. TDO and IDO have been linked to a variety of human diseases including Alzheimerâs, Huntingtonâs, depression-associated anxiety, schizophrenia, and autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Recently, it was discovered that, in addition to the liver, TDO is highly expressed in certain cancer cells, where it plays a critical role in suppressing anti-tumor immunity via activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. These discoveries have triggered a great deal of new interest in targeting TDO and IDO for drug discovery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
    <p>TDOs are homo-tetrameric enzymes with 35â45âkD monomers and are well conserved from bacteria to humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In comparison, IDOs are monomeric enzymes and the sequence conservation between TDO and IDO is much weaker, with 16% sequence identity between hTDO and human IDO1 (hIDO1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). While the properties of TDO have been studied extensively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, the detailed dioxygenase mechanism remains poorly understood.</p>
    <p>Crystal structures of bacterial TDOs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> TDO (DmTDO)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, apo hTDO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, and hIDO1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> show that the overall folds and the active sites of TDO and IDO are highly similar, despite their weak sequence conservation. The binding mode of <italic>L</italic>-Trp to <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> TDO (XcTDO, with 34% sequence identity to hTDO, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) is known<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. However, it is unclear how O<sub>2</sub> is positioned with respect to <italic>L</italic>-Trp in the active site, which is essential for comprehending the dioxygenase mechanism. In addition, the binding mode of the reaction product NFK is not known either.</p>

        <title>Structure of hTDO in complex with <italic>L</italic>-Trp and O<sub>2</sub></title>
        <p>To define the binding mode of O<sub>2</sub> with respect to <italic>L</italic>-Trp and to obtain direct molecular insight into the catalytic mechanism, we prepared crystals of ferrous hTDO in complex with <italic>L</italic>-Trp under anaerobic conditions and then exposed them to an O<sub>2</sub>-saturated solution at room temperature. The reaction between O<sub>2</sub> and Trp in the active site was monitored by microscopic spectroscopy. We observed a large change in the absorption spectrum of the crystal after overnight exposure to O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), indicating O<sub>2</sub> binding and dioxygenation reaction. The crystal was then flash-frozen for X-ray diffraction data collection. The final atomic model, at 2.5âÃ resolution, has excellent agreement with the crystallographic data and the expected bond lengths, bond angles, and other geometric parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The majority of the residues (92%) are in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot. Several other data sets were collected on crystals exposed to O<sub>2</sub> using similar protocols, and comparable electron density was observed in the active sites of these crystals as well. In contrast, no electron density for O<sub>2</sub> was observed in crystals mounted directly in the glove box, and the structure of hTDO in this binary complex with <italic>L</italic>-Trp is mostly the same as that obtained following O<sub>2</sub> exposure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The hTDO monomer has an all Î±-helical structure, and the helices are named Î±A through Î±L, as in XcTDO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Three long helices (Î±B, Î±C, and Î±J), with 6â10 turns each, are at the center of the hTDO tetramer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2bâd</xref>). Two additional helices, Î±E and Î±H, combine to form another long helix, producing a four-helical bundle in each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The heme is located at one end of this four-helical bundle, with the proximal His328 ligand coming from the C-terminal region of helix Î±J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). A helix-loop-helix segment (Î±H<sub>1</sub>âÎ±H<sub>2</sub>) is located near the other end of this bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), which is also present in DmTDO but not XcTDO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Binding modes of the substrates <italic>L</italic>-Trp and O<sub>2</sub></title>
        <p>The crystallographic analysis revealed that the active sites of the four subunits of the hTDO tetramer are in different states in terms of the catalytic conversion of <italic>L</italic>-Trp, giving us several snapshots along the reaction coordinate. Clear electron density was observed for <italic>L</italic>-Trp and O<sub>2</sub> in subunits A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and B, allowing the definition of the relative regioorientation of the two substrates prior to the reaction for the first time. The O<sub>2</sub> substrate is coordinated to the heme iron as the sixth ligand. The Fe-O-O moiety is slightly bent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), with a Fe-O-O angle of ~150Â°. The angle is significantly larger than that expected for a typical ferrous iron bound neutral dioxygen (â Fe-O-Oâ=â120Â°)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, consistent with the [Fe<sup>3+</sup>-O<sub>2</sub><sup>â</sup>] electronic configuration revealed by earlier resonance Raman studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The terminal oxygen atom is situated next to the plane of the <italic>L</italic>-Trp indole ring, close to its C<sub>2</sub> (2.9âÃ distance) and N<sub>1</sub> (2.5âÃ) atoms. Intriguingly, the electron density for the terminal oxygen atom is connected to these two atoms of the indole ring in subunit A, although the origin of this connection is not clear and this connection is much weaker in subunit B. We tried different conformational states for <italic>L</italic>-Trp but none of them could satisfactorily explain the density connecting O<sub>2</sub> to the indole. The terminal oxygen also has strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the main-chain amide of Gly152 (2.5âÃ) in the DE loop (connecting helices Î±D and Î±E). This oxygen is 4.4âÃ from the main-chain ammonium ion of the <italic>L</italic>-Trp substrate, although earlier experimental and QM/MM studies suggested that they are within hydrogen-bonding distance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. These interactions strategically position O<sub>2</sub> next to <italic>L</italic>-Trp for the catalysis.</p>
        <p>The recognition of the <italic>L</italic>-Trp substrate by hTDO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) is similar to that by XcTDO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), as most of the residues in the active site region of the two enzymes are conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). His76 is hydrogen-bonded to the N<sub>1</sub> atom of <italic>L</italic>-Trp, although this interaction is not essential for TDO catalysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and this residue is replaced by Ser in IDO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The JK loop, with a Î²-reverse turn structure at its tip formed by a highly conserved GTGG motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), covers the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The hydroxyl group of the Thr side chain in this motif is hydrogen-bonded to the ammonium ion of <italic>L</italic>-Trp and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ala150, which may also help organize the active site for catalysis.</p>

        <title>Binding mode of the product NFK</title>
        <p>The electron density in the active site of subunit C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and subunit D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) is consistent with the product NFK, allowing us to define for the first time the binding mode of this product to TDO. The pyrrole ring of the Trp side chain has opened, but good electron density was observed only for the remaining six-membered ring and its <italic>N</italic>-formyl group, which is coordinated to the heme iron. In contrast, the indole ring of <italic>L</italic>-Trp does not fit well into the density, and the ring cannot explain the strong density connection to the iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). The JK loop is ordered in subunit C but disordered in subunit D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The rest of the structures of the two subunits are similar to each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The observation that two subunits of the tetramer are trapped in the O<sub>2</sub> and Trp bound state while the other two are in the product-bound state seems to indicate that the dioxygenase reaction is cooperative, but so far no cooperativity is observed in free solution reactions of hTDO. Nonetheless, EPR and MÃ¶ssbauer studies of a bacterial TDO do support that the four heme sites in TDO are not equivalent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p>

The first step of the reaction is initiated by radical addition of the heme-iron-bound dioxygen to C<sub>2</sub> of <italic>L</italic>-Trp to generate a ferryl and Trp-epoxide intermediate, via a 2-indolenylperoxo transition state. An alternative, electrophilic addition of O<sub>2</sub> to <italic>L</italic>-Trp in the first step of the reaction has also been proposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, but QM/MM calculations favor radical addition mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In the second step, protonation of the epoxide by the ammonium ion of <italic>L</italic>-Trp opens the epoxide ring and triggers the addition of the ferryl-oxygen to C<sub>2</sub>, ultimately leading to the breakage of the C<sub>2</sub>âC<sub>3</sub> bond and the formation of the NFK product. The formyl group of NFK is coordinated to the iron atom after the reaction. The disordering of the JK loop allows NFK to diffuse out of the active site, thereby enabling the binding of a new <italic>L</italic>-Trp for the next round of the reaction.</p>
        <p>Besides the disordering of the JK loop in subunit D, the structures of the four subunits in the immediate active site region are highly similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). On the other hand, large conformational differences in the segment connecting Î±E and Î±G (EG segment) are observed in the four subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). This segment contains a short helix (Î±F) in subunit A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), but is partly disordered in subunits B and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), and is a loop in subunit D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), where its conformation is partly stabilized by crystal packing. The Tyr175 side chain in this segment is positioned near the JK loop in subunit A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), but in subunit D it would clash with the JK loop if the loop were ordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In comparison, the EG segment in XcTDO is positioned further away from the active site due to a deletion in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). On the other hand, the EG segment, as well as the JK loop and helix Î±K are disordered in the apo hTDO structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), due to the absence of the heme and substrates.</p>
        <p>To assess the functional importance of the EG segment, we created the Y175G mutant and compared its activity to that of the wild-type (WT) enzyme with stopped-flow measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 4 and 5</xref>). As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, the mutation led to a 6-fold slower multiple turnover velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In addition, pre-incubation of the Y175G mutant with 8 mM NFK retards the formation of the ternary complex by ~100-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>) and impedes Trp binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Overall, the data suggest that the EG segment in hTDO plays a critical role in promoting NFK release, thereby allowing Trp binding during multiple turnover.</p>

        <title>An exo site for <italic>L</italic>-Trp binding in hTDO</title>
        <p>The structure revealed that a second <italic>L</italic>-Trp molecule is bound to each hTDO subunit, with well-defined electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). This exo site is located at the other end of the four-helical bundle and is ~42âÃ from the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The side chain of this <italic>L</italic>-Trp is sandwiched between Trp208 (helix Î±H) and Pro213, and is in direct contact with several other hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The main-chain carboxylate group has bidentate ion-pair interactions with the side chain of Arg211 (Î±H). The ammonium ion of <italic>L</italic>-Trp is positioned near the main-chain carbonyl of Arg103 and the side chain of Glu105, which also has ion-pair interactions with Arg303.</p>
        <p>Residues forming this novel exo site are well conserved among tryptophan-auxotrophic TDOs, but they are generally poorly conserved in other orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). This binding site does not exist in XcTDO, due to side-chain substitutions as well as main-chain conformational differences. Nonetheless, a second binding site for <italic>L</italic>-Trp was observed in XcTDO at the tetramer interface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), while the exo site in hTDO is located within each subunit.</p>
        <p>We next carried out isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments to verify the presence of two <italic>L</italic>-Trp binding sites in hTDO. Two transitions were observed, corresponding to association constants of 2.06âÂ±â1.34âÃâ10<sup>6â</sup>M<sup>â1</sup> (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>~0.5âÎ¼M) and 1.84âÂ±â0.04âÃâ10<sup>4â</sup>M<sup>â1</sup> (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>~54âÎ¼M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>), which we assigned to the exo site and the active site, respectively. To confirm this assignment, we generated a double mutant W208V/R211L (referred to as the WR mutant hereafter) and showed that the mutation abolished the high affinity site without significantly perturbing the low affinity site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Overall, the ITC data revealed that the exo site exhibits 100-fold higher affinity for <italic>L</italic>-Trp than the active site, and that the WR double mutation is sufficient to disrupt <italic>L</italic>-Trp binding to the exo site.</p>
        <p>We also examined whether the exo site has any effect on the catalytic activity of hTDO. While it might be expected that the exo site can regulate hTDO catalysis indirectly by modulating the organization of the four helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), our kinetic data indicate that a triple mutant, E105L/W208V/R211L (EWR mutant), had only a minor defect in catalysis as compared to the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>).</p>

        <title>The exo site regulates hTDO cellular stability</title>
        <p>Mouse TDO (mTDO) is one of the most rapidly degraded hepatic proteins, with a half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of ~2.5âh, versus a mean t<sub>1/2</sub> of ~2â3 days for total liver protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. This unusually short lifespan is consistent with the large number (15) of mTDO ubiquitination sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, which probably enables its rapid removal via ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent proteasomal degradation (UPD). A second Trp-binding site in mTDO was previously proposed based on <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. In addition, it was shown that binding of <italic>L</italic>-Trp, or its Î±-methyl analog (Î±MTrp), to this site not only stabilizes the enzyme against heat, urea or proteases, but also reduces its hepatic degradation.</p>
        <p>We hypothesized that the exo site observed in the current hTDO structure is equivalent to the second site functionally identified in mTDO and that binding of <italic>L</italic>-Trp to the exo site stabilizes hTDO against UPD, thereby regulating its biological lifespan. To test this hypothesis, we first carried out <sup>35</sup>S-pulse-chase analyses of a full-length His<sub><bold>6</bold></sub>-tagged hTDO protein expressed in a human liver HepG2 cell culture. We found that the inclusion of Î±MTrp, which primarily binds to the exo site (as its Î±-methyl group has steric clashes with the heme in the active site), in the culture media indeed increased the <italic>in vivo</italic> t<sub>1/2</sub> of hTDO protein by ~2-fold (from 90 to 172âmin), based on total radioactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>) as well as SDS-PAGE/fluorographic analyses of the pulled-down parent (47âkD) and ubiquitinated (&gt;56âkD) hTDO species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). In contrast, the EWR mutant was not stabilized by Î±MTrp, confirming that the stabilization is due to Î±MTrp binding to the exo site. We used Î±MTrp rather than <italic>L</italic>-Trp in these experiments as HepG2 cells require aerobic culture for viability, and exogenous <italic>L</italic>-Trp is readily consumed by the over-expressed hTDO under these conditions. Marked hTDO stabilization was also observed in HepG2 cells upon inclusion of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (10âÎ¼M), thereby attesting to its cellular UPD (data not shown). Together, these data verify that UPD is a major pathway for cellular hTDO disposal and that Î±MTrp/<italic>L</italic>-Trp binding to the exo site can enhance its intracellular stability by reducing its UPD.</p>
        <p>To identify the hTDO ubiquitination sites, we incubated the enzyme with two E2/E3 Ub-ligase complexes that are major participants in the UPD of some hepatic proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> and identified 15 ubiquitinated Lys residues by Ub-remnant profiling and LC-MS/MS analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). While similar proteomic analyses of mouse liver extracts identified ten of these sites in mTDO previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, 5 of the sites identified here (K17, K110, K185, K194 and K259) are entirely new (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, we found that the three E2/E3 complexes have different hTDO-ubiquitination efficiencies: Ubc7/gp78â&gt;âUbcH5a/CHIPâ&gt;âUbc7/Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p>
        <p>Molecular recognition of hepatic cytochromes P450 by these E2/E3 Ub-ligases involves electrostatic interactions between positively charged E2/E3-domains and negatively charged surface clusters of phosphorylated Ser/Thr and acidic Asp/Glu-residues. Lys residues within such clusters in P450 were shown to be predominantly targeted for ubiquitination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The 15 hTDO ubiquitination sites are distributed throughout the surface of the monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>) and tetramer. Intriguingly, the helix-loop-helix segment of hTDO is rich in negatively-charged Glu residues and 5 of its 15 identified ubiquitination sites are located within this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Conceivably, this segment is important for the molecular recognition of hTDO by these E2/E3 complexes, and the subsequent ubiquitination of Lys residues in this segment is required for UPD. As the exo site is located close to this helix-loop-helix segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), this offers a plausible molecular mechanism for this site to regulate hTDO ubiquitination and UPD. Our studies have thus provided novel mechanistic insights into the cellular regulation of hTDO degradation by its <italic>L</italic>-Trp substrate, which may have important implications for the role of this enzyme in human diseases. They also offer invaluable structural basis for future QM/MM studies to further refine the proposed ferryl-based dioxygenation mechanism.</p>

(<bold>e</bold>) Difference spectrum, (<bold>c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>) which likely represents the spectrum of NFK-bound ferrous hTDO (blue). The double peak feature of this spectrum indicates a six-coordinate low spin heme, consistent with the crystallographic observation that NFK is coordinated to the heme iron via its formyl group as the 6<sup>th</sup> ligand. This spectrum cannot be obtained by mixing hTDO and NFK due to the transient nature of this complex.</p>
