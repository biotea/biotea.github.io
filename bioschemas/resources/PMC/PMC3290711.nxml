        <p id="P1">Mitotic spindle positioning by cortical pulling forces<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> defines the cell division axis and location<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, which is critical for proper cell division and development<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Although recent work has identified developmental and extrinsic cues that regulate spindle orientation<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, the contribution of intrinsic signals to spindle positioning and orientation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that cortical force generation in human cells is controlled by distinct spindle pole and chromosome-derived signals that regulate cytoplasmic dynein localization. First, dynein displays a dynamic asymmetric cortical localization that is negatively regulated by spindle pole proximity resulting in spindle oscillations to center the spindle within the cell. We find that this signal is comprised of the spindle pole localized Polo-like kinase (Plk1), which regulates dynein localization by controlling the interaction between dynein-dynactin and its upstream cortical targeting factors NuMA and LGN. Second, a chromosome-derived Ran-GTP gradient restricts the localization of NuMA-LGN to the lateral cell cortex to define and maintain the spindle orientation axis. Ran-GTP acts in part through NuMAâs nuclear localization sequence to locally alter the ability of NuMA-LGN to associate with the cell cortex in the vicinity of chromosomes. We propose that these chromosome and spindle pole-derived gradients generate an intrinsic code to control spindle position and orientation.</p>

    <p id="P2">The position and orientation of the mitotic spindle are determined by forces generated at the cell cortex<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, where astral microtubules emanating from the mitotic spindle pole are anchored to the plasma membrane<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. To understand the intrinsic mechanisms that control spindle positioning, we first observed the mitotic cortical localization of established players that contribute to spindle orientation<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> including the minus end directed microtubule-based motor cytoplasmic dynein, dynactin, NuMA, and LGN, the human homologue of <italic>C. elegans</italic> GPR-1/2 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins. In HeLa cells, LGN localizes to the cell cortex from prometaphase through telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), whereas dynein and the dynactin subunit Arp1A accumulate at the cell cortex subsequently to LGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; data not shown). Consistent with this ordered temporal localization, we found that LGN was required for the cortical localization of dynein-dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a, b</xref>). LGN depletion specifically disrupts cortically localized dynein-dynactin, but not dynein localized to kinetochore, spindle, or spindle pole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>). Finally, consistent with previous work<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, we found that the LGN binding proteins GÎ±i and NuMA were required for LGN and dynein localization to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1d, e, f</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P3">Live-cell imaging revealed that LGN showed a symmetric distribution to the cell cortex during metaphase, even if the spindle is displaced from the center of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). NuMA and GÎ±i1 also displayed symmetric cortical localization, although GÎ±i1 showed more homogenous localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2a, c</xref>). In contrast, Arp1A accumulated asymmetrically at the cell cortex during metaphase such that it is preferentially localized to the cortex that is distal to the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). All tested dynein and dynactin subunits displayed similar asymmetric localization to the cell cortex in HeLa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2a, b, d, e</xref>) and non-transformed Rpe1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2f</xref>). To analyze the effect of asymmetric cortical dynein localization on spindle movement during metaphase, we acquired time-lapse movies of HeLa cells stably expressing dynein heavy chain (DHC)-GFP to monitor both cortical dynein and spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Kymographs of these movies revealed that the spindle moves toward the dynein-enriched side of the cell and oscillates as cortical dynein is dynamically redistributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3a, b</xref>). The vast majority of cells (n = 24/26) displayed at least one round trip spindle oscillation event with the spindle moving at ~0.4 Î¼m/min, but decreasing as the oscillations dampen and the spindle becomes aligned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3b</xref>). Importantly, we found that LGN depletion eliminates spindle oscillations as well as cortical dynein localization (n = 21; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that cortical dynein is responsible for generating this pulling force. Low dose nocodazole treatment, which has been shown to selectively disrupt astral microtubules<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, caused a dose-dependent impairment of spindle oscillations without affecting cortical dynein enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that cortical dynein-dynactin localization, but not LGN, is regulated to correct spindle positioning in HeLa cells by generating asymmetric forces to center the spindle within the cell.</p>
    <p id="P4">We next sought to precisely analyze the effect of the spindle pole on cortical dynein-dynactin localization. We found that this effect is strongly distance-dependent. Dynein localizes to the cortex when the pole-to-cortex distance is greater than ~3 Î¼m, but becomes delocalized when the pole moves to within 2 Î¼m of the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In addition, when the position of the spindle pole was manipulated by inducing monopolar spindles using the Eg5 inhibitor STLC, LGN localized to both sides of the cell cortex, whereas Arp1A only accumulates at the cell cortex distal from the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). In total, these data suggest that the spindle pole negatively regulates the cortical localization of dynein-dynactin downstream of LGN.</p>
    <p id="P5">The proximity of the spindle pole to the cell cortex creates a precise change in dynein localization, suggesting the presence of a signal emanating from the spindle pole. We hypothesized that a spindle pole-localized kinase may generate signals to regulate cortical dynein-dynactin localization. Indeed, we found that inhibiting Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) activity (using BI2536 treatment) in STLC treated cells allowed dynein to localize to the cell cortex in proximity of the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Plk1 inhibition has pleiotropic effects on spindle structure<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, preventing us from analyzing the effect of Plk1 inhibition on spindle oscillations. Therefore, as a complementary approach, we artificially targeted Plk1 to the plasma membrane. Membrane-targeted Plk1 severely reduced cortical dynein accumulation and eliminated spindle oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c, d</xref>). In contrast, targeting of the spindle pole-localized Aurora A kinase or the Aurora A-associated domain of TPX2 (1-43 aa)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> to the plasma membrane had no effect on cortical dynein localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3c</xref>). The effect of membrane-targeted Plk1 was dependent on its kinase activity as cortical dynein localization was unchanged following membrane targeting of kinase dead or polo-box mutants of Plk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3c</xref>). LGN remained localized to the cell cortex in the cells expressing membrane-targeted Plk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), consistent with the observed effect of spindle pole proximity in controlling dynein-dynactin localization, but not LGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">To define the biochemical interactions that underlie the regulation of asymmetric dynein localization during mitosis, we isolated GFP-LGN from HeLa cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole. Using mass spectrometry, we defined the complete set of interacting proteins identified in these purifications, but not unrelated controls. GFP-LGN co-purified with NuMA, as well as the dynactin complex and dynein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, if the isolated GFP-LGN complexes were incubated in the presence of Plk1 and ATP, this resulted in the disassociation of dynactin and dynein from LGN and NuMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Plk1 phosphorylated multiple different proteins in these samples including NuMA, p150<sup>Glued</sup>-Dynactin1, and p50-Dynactin2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3d, e</xref>), suggesting that Plk1 may coordinately regulate multiple downstream targets to control NuMA-dynactin interactions. Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation from spindle pole-localized Plk1 causes cortical dynein-dynactin to disassociate from LGN-NuMA when the spindle pole comes in close proximity to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). This regulated cortical dynein localization is critical for generating asymmetric pulling forces on astral microtubules to direct spindle positioning.</p>
    <p id="P7">To direct and maintain a defined spindle orientation axis, cortical force must be confined to lateral cell cortex. Indeed, we found that both LGN and dynein-dynactin were restricted from regions near the spindle midzone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1b</xref>). However, the mechanisms that exclude LGN and dynein from the center of the cortex remain unclear. We hypothesized that this might be controlled either by external regulation of the cell cortex by substrate interactions or polarity proteins <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, or internal signals from the spindle or chromosomes. To distinguish between these possibilities, we perturbed spindle organization in HeLa cells to analyze cells with tripolar spindles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4a</xref>), monopolar spindles generated by treatment with STLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), and cells treated with high doses of nocodazole to depolymerize the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In each case, LGN was excluded from the cortex in regions close to chromosomes. For example, LGN showed a uniform distribution throughout the cell cortex in nocodazole treated cells in which the chromosomes collapse to the center of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). However, in cases where the chromosome mass is located near the cell cortex, we found that LGN localization was locally disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). LGN is also selectively excluded from the cell cortex in regions proximal to even a single misaligned chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). A similar sensitivity of LGN to chromosome position was observed in Rpe1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4b, c</xref>). To define the properties of this chromosome-derived signal, we measured the distance between chromosomes and the cell cortex. We found that LGN is excluded from the cell cortex in cases where a chromosome is within ~2 Î¼m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">To identify the molecules responsible for this chromosome-derived signal, we tested two possible chromosome-localized signaling molecules: Aurora B kinase<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and Ran-GTP<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity by the specific inhibitor ZM447439 had no effect on cortical LGN localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4d</xref>). In contrast, transiently transfected dominant negative mCherry-Ran T24N<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> allowed LGN to localize homogenously throughout the cell cortex including to regions near chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e, f</xref>). Under these conditions, transfected cells entered mitosis and aligned their chromosomes, indicating that the disruption of interphase nuclear transport by RanT24N expression did not block cell cycle progression during the time course of these experiments. To test the effect of the Ran gradient in the absence of potential prior defects in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, we used the tsBN2 cell line which contains a temperature sensitive mutant of the Ran GEF, RCC1<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In tsBN2 cells arrested in mitosis at the permissive temperature using nocodazole, LGN is restricted from the cortex when chromosomes are close to the edge of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). In contrast, when arrested tsBN2 cells were subsequently shifted to the restrictive temperature, LGN localized throughout the cell cortex even when chromosomes are located close to the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4e</xref>). The temperature shift does not affect cortical LGN localization in the parental BHK cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4f</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that a chromosome-derived Ran-GTP gradient negatively regulates cortical LGN localization to generate a bi-lobed distribution. Prior work demonstrated that the Ran-GTP gradient contributes to spindle assembly, particularly in the absence of centrosomes<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. However, specific roles for this gradient in somatic cells have remained elusive. The implication of the Ran-GTP gradient in negatively regulating cortical LGN represents an intriguing new activity for this chromosome-derived signal.</p>
    <p id="P9">To test the functional contributions of restricted LGN localization to spindle orientation, we utilized âLâ-shaped fibronectin patterned coverslips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Recent work has established that HeLa cells orient their spindles along the hypotenuse of the âLâ with high efficiency<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Although &gt;70% of control cells orient their spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i, j</xref>), depletion of LGN or the dynactin subunit p150 randomized this orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Consistent with the regulation of cortical dynein localization by Plk1 described above, membrane targeted Plk1 disrupted proper spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Importantly, expression of mCherry-RanT24N also severely perturbed proper spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i, j</xref>). These data indicate that the bipolar pattern of LGN localization downstream of the Ran-GTP gradient is required to maintain the spindle orientation axis.</p>
    <p id="P10">We next sought to define the mechanisms by which LGN is regulated by the chromosome-derived Ran-GTP gradient. Previous work demonstrated that NuMA interacts with the N-terminus of LGN and is required to recruit LGN to the plasma membrane<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> by facilitating the interaction of the LGN C-terminus with GÎ±i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Importantly, NuMA is an established downstream target of the Ran gradient<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, we identified Importin Î± and Î² in affinity purifications of the NLS containing GFP-NuMA C-terminus from HeLa cells (data not shown), although we note that the Importin proteins are occasionally found at low coverage in control purifications. NuMA is released from Importin Î² by Ran-GTP, which has been suggested to promote spindle assembly in the vicinity of chromosomes<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In contrast to the effect of Plk1 on the GFP-LGN purifications described above, incubation of the GFP-LGN complex in the presence of GTP loaded Ran Q69L, a GTP hydrolysis defective mutant of Ran, did not disrupt this complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Thus, Ran-GTP likely acts by locally altering the ability of the NuMA-LGN complex to interact with the membrane instead of regulating NuMA-LGN interactions.</p>
    <p id="P11">To analyze the interactions and regulation of LGN, we assessed the localization of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of LGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5a, b</xref>). In contrast to full length LGN, the N-terminus of LGN (LGN-N) localizes to spindle poles during mitosis and to the nucleus in interphase, similar to NuMA<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5b</xref>). The C-terminus of LGN (LGN-C) shows increased interactions with GÎ±i and lacks NuMA binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), and localized throughout the cell cortex and to retraction fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), identically to GÎ±i1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5c</xref>) including near misaligned chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Interestingly, when the C-terminus of NuMA was fused directly to the C-terminus of LGN, this in frame fusion displayed similar restricted cortical localization to full length LGN in metaphase even in the absence of endogenous LGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). However, upon elimination of the Importin Î²-binding nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in NuMA, this fusion showed more homogenous mitotic cortical localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) and also localized to retraction fibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5d</xref>). These data suggest that chromosome-derived Ran-GTP acts at least in part to locally regulate binding of Importin Î² to the NuMA NLS, altering the ability of the LGN-NuMA complex to target to the membrane. However, it is possible that additional downstream targets for Ran-GTP to control LGN-NuMA localization may exist. We also note that others have suggested recently that Ran is required for spindle orientation in artificially induced asymmetric cell divisions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. However, in this case, the authors suggested that Ran plays a global positive role in promoting Mud-Pins (the NuMA-LGN counterparts) recruitment to membranes instead of locally inhibiting localization downstream of a chromosome-derived Ran-GTP gradient.</p>
    <p id="P12">Defining the mechanisms that control spindle position and orientation are key to understanding cell division. Here, we demonstrated that cortical dynein localization is regulated by two distinct intrinsic signals to correct spindle position and orientation in symmetrically dividing human cells: a spindle-pole derived signal of Plk1 and a chromosome-derived gradient of Ran-GTP. Plk1 negatively regulates cortical dynein localization downstream of LGN-NuMA and Ran-GTP restricts LGN-NuMA localization to the lateral cell cortex. These two gradients function cooperatively to center the spindle and maintain spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Movie 1</xref>). Future work will be required to define the functional contributions of these signals in larger cell types (where spindle positioning may be more critical) and asymmetrically dividing cells, as well as to define the precise biochemical basis for the regulation downstream of Plk1 and Ran-GTP. Importantly, these intrinsic signals are likely to cooperate with extrinsic information from cell shape and substrate interactions<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, we found that GÎ±i and LGN-C localize to retraction fibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5c</xref>), which have been proposed to dictate spindle orientation on patterned substrates<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Based on the connections between spindle orientation and tumorigenesis<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, this work also has important relevance to studies on cancer progression.</p>

Clonal cell lines stably expressing GFP<sup>LAP</sup> fusions were generated as described previously<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. HeLa cells expressing mouse DHC-GFP were obtained from MitoCheck<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. GFP-LGN and DHC-GFP cell lines functionally complement depletion of the corresponding endogenous protein based on dynein recruitment and spindle orientation respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5e, f</xref>; data not shown). To inactivate RCC1, tsBN2 cells were cultured at 39.7Â°C for 1.5-3 hrs. mCherry-Ran T24N and mCherry-membrane targeting constructs (âMemâ from Neuormodulin; Clontech) were tested following transient transfection using Effectene (Qiagen). To generate the NuMA NLS mutant, the NLS sequence QQRKR was removed by PCR. For drug treatment, HeLa cells were incubated for 1-3 hrs with drugs at the following concentrations: STLC: 10 Î¼M; Nocodazole: 100 nM (high dose), or 10-20 nM (low dose); ZM447439, 2 Î¼M; BI2536, 10 Î¼M; MG132, 20 Î¼M; Thymidine, 2 mM.</p>
        <p id="P14">RNAi experiments were conducted using RNAi MAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs guidelines. Pools of 4 pre-designed siRNAs against LGN-GPMS2 (GAACUAACAGCACGACUUA, CUUCAGGGAUGCAGUUAUA, ACAGUGAAAUUCUUGCUAA, UGAAGGGUUCUUUGACUUA), p150-DCTN1 (CUGGAGCGUGUAUCGUAA, GAAGAUCGAGAGACAGUUA, GCUCAUGCCUCGUCUCAUU, CGAGCUCACUACUGACUUA), DHC-DYNC1H1 (GAUCAAACAUGACGGAAUU, CAGAACAUCUCACCGGAUA, GAAAUCAACUUGCCAGAUA, GCAAGAAUGUCGCUAAAUU), siRNAs targeting NuMA (GGCGUGGCAGGAGAAGUUCUU)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> the three GÎ±i isoforms (CCGAAUGCAUGAAGCAUGUU, CUUGAGCGCCUAUGACUUGUU)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, and a non-targeting control were obtained from Dharmacon. For RNAi rescue experiments withLGN, a single siRNA (GAACUAACAGCACGACUUA) was used and target sequence on the plasmid was mutated to be insensitive to this siRNA.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence and Microscopy</title>
        <p id="P15">For live cell imaging, cells were cultured in CO<sub>2</sub> independent media (Invitrogen) with 50-100 ng/ml Hoechst33342 for 30 min prior to observation. Immunofluorescence in human cells was conducted as described previously<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> using antibodies against fibronectin (a generous gift from Richard Hynes, 1:10,000), tubulin (DM1Î±; Sigma, 1:500), p150 dynactin (610473, BD transduction Laboratories, 1:500), GÎ±i-1 (sc-56536, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200), and NuMA (ab36999, Abcam, 1:1,000). To test spindle orientation, cells were plated on L-patterned fibronectin coated coverslips (CYTOO). For RNAi experiments on patterned coverslips, cells were synchronized using a double thymidine block prior to plating.</p>
        <p id="P16">Images were acquired on a DeltaVision Core microscope (Applied Precision) equipped with a CoolSnap HQ2 CCD camera. 30 to 40 Z-sections were acquired at 0.5-Î¼m steps using Olympus 40x, 1.35 NA U-PlanApo, 20x, 0.75 NA UApo, or a 4x, 0.16 NA U-PlanSApo objective with 1Ã1 binning. Images were deconvolved using the DeltaVision software. Equivalent exposure conditions and scaling was used as appropriate. Fluorescence intensity and distance measurements were analyzed using Softworx (Applied Precision) and Metamorph (Molecular Devices). Line scans were generated using Metamorph (Molecular Devices). Kymographs were generated using Photoshop (Adobe).</p>
