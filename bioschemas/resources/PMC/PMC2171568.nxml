      <abstract>
        <p>Integrins are adhesion receptors that are crucial to the functions of multicellular organisms. Integrin-mediated adhesion is a complex process that involves both affinity regulation and cytoskeletal coupling, but the molecular mechanisms behind this process have remained incompletely understood. In this study, we report that the phosphorylation of each cytoplasmic domain of the leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 integrin mediates different modes of integrin activation. Î± Chain phosphorylation on Ser1140 is needed for conformational changes in the integrin after chemokine- or integrin ligandâinduced activation or after activation induced by active Rap1 (Rap1V12). In contrast, the Î² chain Thr758 phosphorylation mediates selective binding to 14-3-3 proteins in response to inside-out activation through the T cell receptor, resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements. Thus, site-specific phosphorylation of the integrin cytoplasmic domains is important for the dynamic regulation of these complex receptors in cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The heterodimeric cell surface receptors called integrins are exceptional in that they can function as bidirectional signaling devices, regulating cell adhesion and migration after so-called inside-out signaling, and they can also signal into the cell to regulate growth, differentiation, and apoptosis after ligand binding (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Giancotti and Ruoslahti, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hynes, 2002</xref>). The relatively small intracellular domains of integrins are involved in regulating signaling functions. Recently, separation of integrin cytoplasmic domains has been postulated as a mechanism of regulating integrin bidirectional signaling (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Vinogradova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>). Proximal events in the regulation of integrin activation and outside-in signaling presumably involve the binding of cytoplasmic molecules to the intracellular tails (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Dynamic adhesion is especially important in the immune system, where cells need to attach and detach continuously. The leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) integrin (Î±LÎ²2 or CD11a/CD18) is expressed exclusively in leukocytes and is of fundamental importance to the function of the immune system (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Springer, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gahmberg, 1997</xref>). LFA-1 mediates cell adhesion under various conditions, e.g., during immunological synapse formation between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell and during leukocyte emigration from the bloodstream into tissues. Whereas T cell receptor (TCR)âmediated adhesion is slow and sustained, chemokine-induced adhesion is fast and rapidly reversible. Both affinity-dependent and -independent mechanisms have been postulated as being important in the regulation of integrin activation (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">van Kooyk and Figdor, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carman and Springer, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood, 2004</xref>). These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and different modes of integrin activation may involve different mechanisms working alone or together. For example, TCR-induced activation of LFA-1 has not been shown to involve affinity regulation (conformational changes) in the integrin, but instead has been closely correlated with the spreading phenotype of T cells and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). In contrast, chemokines mediate rapid conformational changes in LFA-1, as measured by activation epitope expression with mAbs and the measurement of soluble ligand binding to the integrin (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Constantin et al., 2000</xref>). Chemokine-induced adhesion also involves the clustering of integrins (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Constantin et al., 2000</xref>). Ligands can also induce conformational changes and clustering of integrins (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Cabanas and Hogg, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kotovuori et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Phosphorylation is a common mechanism for the regulation of surface receptor function and has also been reported in integrins, but its role in integrin regulation has remained only partially understood (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fagerholm et al., 2004</xref>). LFA-1 is phosphorylated on both the Î± and Î² chains, with the Î± chain being constitutively phosphorylated, whereas Î² chain phosphorylation becomes detectable after inside-out stimulation of the integrin (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hara and Fu, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chatila et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Valmu and Gahmberg, 1995</xref>). The Î± chain phosphorylation sites have not been mapped, and their functions are completely unknown. In contrast, the Î² chain phosphorylation sites are known (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hibbs et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fagerholm et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hilden et al., 2003</xref>). The main phosphorylation site after phorbol ester stimulation of cells is Ser756, but this site is not involved in regulating adhesion (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hibbs et al., 1991</xref>). The threonine triplet (Thr758â760) in the Î²2 chain is important for adhesion, interactions with the actin cytoskeleton, and modulation of cell spreading (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hibbs et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Peter and O'Toole, 1995</xref>). Interestingly, threonine phosphorylation of the Î² chain has been reported (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Valmu and Gahmberg, 1995</xref>) and threonine-phosphorylated integrins distribute preferentially to the actin cytoskeleton in cells (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Valmu et al., 1999a</xref>). Additionally, it has been shown that 14-3-3 proteins from cell lysates interact with a Thr758-phosphorylated Î²2 integrin peptide in vitro (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fagerholm et al., 2002b</xref>), but whether the interaction occurs in vivo or plays a role in adhesion has not been discovered. In this study, we investigated the role of both Î± and Î² chain phosphorylations in the regulation of LFA-1âmediated adhesion.</p>

        <title>Î±L is phosphorylated on Ser1140 in T cells</title>
        <p>To establish the role of LFA-1 phosphorylation in integrin regulation, we first mapped the phosphorylation sites in Î±L. Endogenous Î±L is phosphorylated in both resting <sup>32</sup>P-labeled T cells and in cells activated by phorbol ester stimulation or through ligation of the TCR with the antibody OKT3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The labeled protein band was subjected to trypsin cleavage and phosphopeptide mapping, and only one major spot (radioactive peptide) was detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). The maps from resting cells and from phorbol esterâactivated cells were identical (unpublished data), thus no additional sites were phosphorylated after cell activation. Identification of the serine phosphorylation site was made using manual Edman degradation. The radioactive phosphorylated amino acid was detected as the fourth residue in the tryptic Î±L peptide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). This result indicates that Ser1140 in the Î±L cytoplasmic domain is the target of phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). To confirm this, we substituted Ser1140 with Ala. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type (wt) Î±L and S1140A-Î±L, together with wt Î²2, and cells were labeled with <sup>32</sup>P. The LFA-1 protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography. No radioactive labeling was detected in S1140A-Î±L transfectants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E). These data demonstrate that Ser1140 is the principal Î±L phosphorylation site.</p>

        <title>Ser1140 is phosphorylated at a high stoichiometry in resting T cells</title>
        <p>To estimate the stoichiometry of Î±L phosphorylation in leukocytes, we generated a phosphospecific antibody capable of recognizing Î±L only when it has been phosphorylated on Ser1140. The antibody was Î±L specific because it failed to react with lysates of Jurkat (J)-Î²2.7 cells, which are an Î±L-deficient Jurkat cell line, and reacted with the Î±L integrin in Î±L-transfected J-Î²2.7 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). This antibody was also tested for recognition of immunoprecipitated LFA-1 from T cells in the presence of blocking Î±L unphosphopeptide or phosphopeptide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). This phosphospecific antibody recognized Î±L in the presence of competing unphosphorylated peptide (to block any interactions mediated by antibodies that recognize nonphosphorylated forms of the integrins), but in the presence of phosphopeptide no recognition occurred. Specificity was also confirmed by Western blotting of immunoprecipitated Î±L from cells expressing wt Î±L and from cells where Ser1140 had been mutated to nonphosphorylatable Ala (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). The antibody reacted with wt Î±L, but not with S1140A-mutated Î±L. Thus, the experiments demonstrated that the antibody is sequence- and phosphospecific.</p>

<bold>Characterization of the phosphospecific Î±L-Ser1140 antibody and assessment of the stoichiometry of Î±L phosphorylation.</bold> (A) A Ser1140 phosphospecific antibody was made, as described in Materials and methods, and used in a Western blot of cell extracts prepared from J-Î²2.7 cells and wt Î±Lâtransfected J-Î²2.7 cells. (B) The antibody was tested for recognition of immunoprecipitated LFA-1 from T cells in the presence of 25 Î¼g/ml of blocking unphosphopeptide or 25 Î¼g/ml of phosphopeptide. An immunoprecipitation was made with the IB4 antibody, which recognizes only heterodimeric forms of the Î²2 integrin. The blots were stripped and reprobed with antiâÎ²2 integrin antibodies (R2E7B) to demonstrate equal loading. (C) wt Î±L and S1140A-Î±L integrins were immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected COS-1 cells, and phosphorylated Î±L was detected by Western blotting. (D) The stoichiometry of the Î±L phosphorylation was estimated using the phosphospecific Î±L-Ser1140 antibody. The T cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either the phosphospecific Î±L antibody or IB4. The remaining Î±L from phosphospecific Î±L immunoprecipitation was immunoprecipitated by IB4. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated Î±L was detected. Î²2 detection was used to demonstrate the total amount of integrin in samples. In the Western blot, the phosphospecific antibody was used in the presence of unphosphorylated peptide.</p>

        <p>We used this phosphospecific Î±L antibody to assess the stoichiometry of Î±L phosphorylation. The total amount of heterodimeric LFA-1 (100%) in T cell lysates was determined by immunoprecipitation with IB4, an antibody that recognizes heterodimeric LFA-1 rather than the monomeric Î²2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 1983</xref>). The phosphospecific antibody immunoprecipitated â¼40% of the total heterodimeric Î±L from resting T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D). The remaining Î±L from this lysate was immunoprecipitated with IB4, but no Î±L phosphorylation was seen in this sample when detected with phosphospecific Î±L antibody. We conclude that a maximum of 40% of Î±L is constitutively phosphorylated in T cells.</p>

        <title>Mutation of Ser1140 of Î±L abolishes T cell adhesion to ICAM-1 induced by the activating antibody MEM-83 and MEM-83âinduced affinity regulation of LFA-1</title>
        <p>We next generated stable J-Î²2.7 cell transfectants expressing wt Î±L and S1140A-Î±L to examine the role of the phosphorylation site in cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Mutation of Ser1140 to Ala did not affect the heterodimerization or cell surface expression of LFA-1. The phosphospecific Î±L antibody was used for the characterization of the J-Î²2.7 cell clones. The Î±L chain was easily detected in J-Î²2.7 wt Î±L cells, whereas no significant staining of Î±L was seen in J-Î²2.7 S1140A-Î±L cells with or without phorbol ester activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B).</p>

        <p>We went on to study the roles of the Î±L phosphorylation site in cells that were stimulated with different agonists. The binding of both wt Î±L and S1140A-Î±L transfectants to the immobilized ligand intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 was increased by TCR ligation and by phorbol ester treatment, as compared with resting cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). In contrast, cells expressing S1140A-Î±L bound less efficiently to ICAM-1 when activated by MEM-83. It has been speculated that MEM-83 activates LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 by changing the orientation of the I domain in the Î±L, which leads to conformational change at the ICAM-1 binding site (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2004</xref>). Mg/EGTA also induces a conformational change, probably at the MIDAS and ADMIDAS sites of the I-like domain of the Î²2 subunit (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shimaoka et al., 2002</xref>). Mg/EGTA increased the Î±L-mutated cell adhesion to ICAM-1, but not as effectively as in wt cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). These results indicate that Î±L phosphorylation could be involved in LFA-1 conformational changes needed for integrin binding to ligand, but not in integrin activation induced by TCR ligation and phorbol ester stimulation. The latter stimuli lead to increased binding of cells to coated ICAM-1, but previous studies have reported that they did not induce conformational changes in the integrin (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Cabanas and Hogg, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 1996</xref>). Whether a negative charge at position 1140 would be enough to affect adhesion was studied by using a Ser1140Asp mutation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, right). The result showed that the S/A and S/D mutations worked similarly.</p>

J-Î²2.7 transfectants expressing wt Î±L or S1140A-Î±L were allowed to bind to ICAM-1âcoated wells without stimulation (control) or after stimulation with 10 Î¼g/ml OKT3, 200 nM PDBu, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>/1 mM EGTA, or 10 Î¼g/ml MEM-83 in the presence or absence of the Î²2-blocking antibody R7E4. (right) Adhesion of S1140A-Î±L and S1140D-Î±Lâtransfected cells to ICAM-1 after phorbol ester or MEM-83 stimulation was compared. (B) Effects of the S1140A mutation on sICAM-1âbinding activity of LFA-1. J-Î²2.7 transfectants were activated with 10 Î¼g/ml MEM-83 or control antibody OKT3 in the presence of 150 Î¼g/ml ICAM-1Fc and binding was determined by flow cytometry. (C) The effects of the S1140A mutation on expression of the Î±L activation reporter mAb24 were examined. J-Î²2.7 cells were incubated with mAb24 in the presence of MEM-83 or R7E4, and mAb24 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Error bars represent SD.</p>

        <p>To further study the mechanisms of the different modes of adhesion, a soluble ICAM-Fc (sICAM-1Fc) binding assay was used to measure the ligand-binding activity. mAb MEM-83 greatly increased the binding of sICAM-1 to wt Î±L transfectants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B), whereas TCR stimulation had no effect. Importantly, only minimal sICAM-1 binding was observed for S1140A-Î±L cells after MEM-83 activation. Affinity modulation of LFA-1 can also be detected using mAb24 (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dransfield and Hogg, 1989</xref>). This epitope was not expressed in resting J-Î²2.7 transfectants, but there was enhanced expression on the wt cells after MEM-83 activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). The S1140A mutation abolished MEM-83âinduced expression of the mAb24 epitope (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). Together, the J-Î²2.7 cells expressing nonphosphorylatable S1140A-Î±L mutant show a marked reduction in ICAM-1 binding and expression of the high-affinity form of integrin.</p>

        <title>The phosphorylation site in Î±L is involved in chemokine- and ligand-induced affinity regulation of the integrin</title>
        <p>One of the best characterized examples of LFA-1 affinity modulation is the activation of integrin-dependent leukocyte arrest and migration through G proteinâcoupled receptors for chemokines (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Constantin et al., 2000</xref>). SDF-1Î±, a CXC chemokine, has been shown to induce a rapid and transient activation of LFA-1 in J-Î²2.7 wt Î±L cells that can be detected by expression of the mAb24 epitope (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 1999</xref>). To determine whether the S1140A mutation affected chemokine-triggered mAb24 expression, we stimulated J-Î²2.7 transfectants with SDF-1Î± and studied the mAb24 epitope by immunofluorescence. No mAb24 staining was seen in nonstimulated cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). Mg/EGTA treatment was used as a positive control to show the ability of transfectants to express the mAb24 epitope (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and E</xref>). After SDF-1Î± stimulation, clear staining of mAb24 was detected on the wt Î±L cells, but not on the S1140A-Î±Lâexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Thr758-phosphorylated Î²2 binds 14-3-3 in vitro and in vivo</title>
        <p>Having established the phosphorylation site in Î±L and its functional characteristics, we focused on the investigation of the Î²2 polypeptide phosphorylation. Both phorbol ester activation and TCR ligation induce phosphorylation of the Î² chain on Thr758 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hilden et al., 2003</xref>), which is the first threonine in the TTT motif that is important for adhesion and cytoskeletal interactions of the LFA-1 and other integrins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hibbs et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Peter and O'Toole, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fagerholm et al., 2004</xref>). 14-3-3 proteins from leukocyte lysates have previously been shown to interact with a synthetic Î²2 integrin peptide phosphorylated on Thr758 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fagerholm et al., 2002b</xref>), but whether the binding was direct or indirect and whether it occurred in cells was not established. In this study, we examined the binding of purified 14-3-3 proteins to the phosphorylated integrin cytoplasmic peptides. The proteins bound specifically to the phosphorylated, but not to the nonphosphorylated, Î²2 chain, as examined by peptide affinity chromatography with nonphosphorylated and Thr758-phosphorylated Î²2 chain peptides (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). 14-3-3 proteins could be eluted from the affinity column by the peptide ARAApSAPA, which specifically binds to the phosphopeptide-binding groove in 14-3-3 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Moorhead et al., 1999</xref>), but not by a control peptide (phospho-Î±L peptide; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). This shows that the binding is specific and occurs through the canonical 14-3-3 phosphopeptide binding motif (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). Phosphorylation of another major site in the Î²2 cytoplasmic domain, Ser756, has previously been shown not to mediate 14-3-3 binding (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fagerholm et al., 2002b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Mutation of Thr758 in Î²2 or blocking of 14-3-3 binding to the Î²2 chain reduces constitutive COS cell adhesion</title>
        <p>Mutation of Thr758 in the Î²2 chain has previously been shown to affect adhesion of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 when transfected into COS cells, where LFA-1 is constitutively active, and into LAD cells (a B lymphoblastoid cell line lacking LFA-1), where LFA-1 can be activated with phorbol ester (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hibbs et al., 1991</xref>). We used the COS cell system to investigate the effect of direct 14-3-3 association with the Î²2 chain without interfering with activating signals of the integrin and because a T cell model lacking Î²2 integrins is currently unavailable.</p>
        <p>Phorbol ester did not stimulate LFA-1âmediated adhesion to ICAM-1 in this system, but MEM-83 did have a stimulatory effect (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A). As previously reported, the Thr758Ala mutation significantly reduced the constitutive integrin-mediated adhesion of transfected cells to ICAM-1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A). MEM-83 could still activate the Thr-mutated integrin, albeit to a lower degree than for wt LFA-1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A), showing that activating conformational changes could still occur for the mutated integrin. However, when both Ser1140 and Thr758 were mutated, not even MEM-83 could activate the integrin-mediated adhesion (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A), even if the singly mutated Ser1140Ala-Î±L together with wt Î²2 could normally mediate adhesion in COS cells. Because the S1140A-Î±Lâmutated integrin is adhesion deficient in J-Î²2.7 cells, but not in COS-1 cells, it is clear that these cells are not a useful model for studying LFA-1 function in all cases.</p>

        <p>To examine whether the effects of the Thr758 mutation seen were attributable to the blockage of 14-3-3 proteins from binding to the integrin, we cotransfected cells with wt LFA-1 integrins and an EGFP-R18wt construct, which blocks 14-3-3 interactions with its cellular ligands by binding to the phosphopeptide-binding groove in 14-3-3 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2004</xref>). As a control, we used a mutant construct that does not bind to 14-3-3 proteins (R18mut). The level of GFP proteins and cell surface LFA-1 integrins in the EGFP-positive cells was equal in R18wt and R18mut cells, as examined by flow cytometry (unpublished data), Western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody and an LFA-1 blotting antibody (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B), and immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> C). R18wt cotransfected cells showed markedly reduced adherence to ICAM-1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>). The 14-3-3 proteins have many binding partners among cytoskeletal and signaling proteins that might affect adhesion, and R18 peptides have indeed been shown to alter the cytoskeleton in cells that do not express LFA-1 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2004</xref>). However, when the adhesion of endogenous COS cell integrins to fibronectin was examined there was no difference in adhesion between R18wt and R18mut-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> D, right). Thus, it is likely that 14-3-3 binding to the Thr758-phosphorylated integrin mediates the effect of Thr758 on cell adhesion.</p>

In contrast, TCR triggering and phorbol esters have been closely associated with a spreading phenotype of T cells (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, the TTT motif of the integrin has been closely associated with actin reorganization events, but not affinity changes, in integrins (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Peter and O'Toole, 1995</xref>). Indeed, the Thr758 mutation was shown to significantly reduce cell spreading on ICAM-1 as examined by FITC-phalloidin staining of polymerized actin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> B). In addition, R18wt-transfected cell spreading on ICAM-1 was almost completely abolished (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, C and D</xref>). Quantitation of transfected cell spreading showed that R18wt and LFA-1 cotransfected cells only spread at later time points, when other untransfected COS-1 cells started spreading unspecifically on ICAM-1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> D).

        <title>A talin head domain construct can activate the Thr758Ala-mutated Î²2 integrin in cells</title>
        <p>The head domain of the large cytoskeletal protein talin has been demonstrated to be a major player in activation of different integrins, including LFA-1 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>). It binds directly to the Î² chains of integrin cytoplasmic domains and, presumably, induces a separation of the cytoplasmic domains of the Î± and Î² chains, which leads to a conformational change in the extracellular domain (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we examined whether the effect of the T/A mutation of the Î²2 chain was attributable to an altered ability of talin to bind to and activate LFA-1. We cotransfected COS cells with wt or T758A-mutated Î²2 together with the F2/F3 domains of the talin head domain. The expression levels of LFA-1 and the talin head domain construct were similar in the different transfectants, as measured by Western blotting (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> A) and flow cytometry (unpublished data). We saw an increase in LFA-1âmediated adhesion to ICAM-1 in the talin head cotransfected cells as compared with cells without the talin head (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> B), although the occurrence of adhesion was somewhat less in T758A-Î²2âtransfected cells than in the wt controls. The talin head domain, like the antibody MEM-83, could activate S1140A-mutated Î±L in the COS cell system (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> B). Thus, in COS-1 cells, affinity-inducing stimuli of the integrin are also functional for S1140A-mutated Î±L, indicating the possibility that a leukocyte-specific restrictive factor working through the Î± chain is missing.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains of LFA-1 was initially reported more than a decade ago (for review see <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fagerholm et al., 2004</xref>), but the significance of these phosphorylation events in integrin regulation has remained unclear. Threonine phosphorylation of Î²2 has been reported (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Valmu and Gahmberg, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hilden et al., 2003</xref>), and it has also been shown that the threonine triplet in Î²2 (Thr 758â760) is important for both adhesion and cytoskeletal reorganization mediated by LFA-1 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hibbs et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Peter and O'Toole, 1995</xref>). The stoichiometry of the phosphorylation of Î²2 integrin in phorbol esterâstimulated T cells in the presence of okadaic acid was determined to be 0.92 mol/mol of protein (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Valmu et al., 1999b</xref>). Because several sites become phosphorylated under these conditions it is clear that each site is phosphorylated at a relatively low level (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fagerholm et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hilden et al., 2003</xref>). However, in comparison with receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, low stoichiometry phosphorylations may still play important biological roles by regulating proteinâprotein interactions.</p>
      <p>Î±L has been shown to be constitutively phosphorylated in T cells (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hara and Fu, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chatila et al., 1989</xref>), but the phosphorylation site and stoichiometry of Î±L phosphorylation has not been assessed. We have now mapped the phosphorylation site in the Î±L cytoplasmic domain to Ser1140 and shown that â¼40% of surface Î±L was phosphorylated in T cells. A similarly high stoichiometry of phosphorylation already found in resting cells has been shown for the Î±4 integrin (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2001</xref>). In analogy with the Î±4 integrin, where paxillin binding to the nonphosphorylated integrin rather than to the phosphorylated form excludes this adaptor protein from the leading edge of the cell and thus regulates cell migration (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Goldfinger et al., 2003</xref>), constitutive phosphorylation of the Î±L tail may play profound roles in spatiotemporal regulation of integrin functions.</p>
      <p>By mutating Ser1140, we have shown that the nonphosphorylatable LFA-1 Î± chain expressed in a T cell line can no longer be activated by agents that have previously been demonstrated to induce high-affinity forms of the integrin; i.e., by an activating antibody (MEM-83); by ligands or chemokines, as detected by adhesion to ICAM-1; by sICAM-1 binding; or by mAb24 that detects the high-affinity form of LFA-1. Thus, phosphorylated Ser1140 is involved in conformational changes occurring in LFA-1 in response to several different affinity-increasing stimuli. One possibility is that the negative charge induced by phosphorylation could facilitate the separation of the integrin cytoplasmic tails, leading to a conformational change in the extracellular domain (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adair et al., 2005</xref>). However, a Ser-Asp mutation did not lead to a different adhesion phenotype compared with the Ser-Ala mutation, indicating that simply substituting a negatively charged amino acid for serine is not enough to mimic phosphorylation. Thus, it is more plausible that the Î±L phosphorylation site works through selective binding to some cytoplasmic factor.</p>
      <p>The small GTPase Rap1 is an important mediator of various modes of LFA-1 activation in leukocytes, including activation by antibodies and divalent cations (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Katagiri et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">de Bruyn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Sebzda et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, Rap1 has been shown to act through the integrin Î± chain cytoplasmic domain and to influence integrin affinity for ICAM-1 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Tohyama et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we wanted to examine the effect of active Rap1 (Rap1V12) on the nonphosphorylatable S1140A mutant. Rap1V12 was able to induce binding of wt Î±Lâtransfected, but not mutant-Î±Lâtransfected, J-Î²2.7 cells to coated ICAM-1. The mutated Î±L may be locked in a low-affinity conformation that cannot be activated from outside of the cell by activating antibodies or other activating stimuli that increase integrin affinity for its ligands. However, it can still be activated with phorbol ester and TCR stimulation, which do not (and, if so, only marginally) influence integrin affinity.</p>
      <p>Rap1 may be working upstream of the Î±L phosphorylation, possibly influencing the binding of some cytoplasmic factor to the Î±L cytoplasmic tail. RapL is a Rap1-binding molecule that can activate LFA-1 and is found in leukocytes (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Katagiri et al., 2003</xref>). It will be of future interest to study the effect of RapL in this system.</p>
      <p>It has previously been reported that the 14-3-3 isoforms Î±Î² and Î´Î¶ from leukocyte lysates associate specifically with a Thr758-phosphorylated Î²2 integrin COOH-terminal peptide (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fagerholm et al., 2002b</xref>). We discovered that the Î²2â14-3-3 interaction is direct. Additionally, we have shown that the binding occurs in T cells that have been activated by stimuli that induce phosphorylation of the Î²2 chain on Thr758, i.e., phorbol ester and TCR engagement. Mutation of Thr758 or blocking of 14-3-3 binding to the Î²2 integrin by R18 peptides inhibited cell adhesion to ICAM-1. The Thr758 mutation or R18 peptide also inhibited integrin-mediated cell spreading on ICAM-1. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr758, which is induced by inside-out activating stimuli for the integrin, mediates binding to 14-3-3 proteins in cells, and this interaction seems to mediate the effect of the integrin on the cell cytoskeleton. The 14-3-3 proteins are dimers, and both monomers can independently bind to phosphorylated targets either within the same protein or in different proteins (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tzivion and Avruch, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">MacKintosh, 2004</xref>). It is possible that threonine phosphorylation of CD18 recruits 14-3-3 proteins to the plasma membraneâcytoskeleton connection and that the 14-3-3s in turn recruit other proteins to regulate downstream events.</p>
      <p>There are increasing amounts of evidence that talin plays a profound role in activating several integrins, including LFA-1 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). The head domain of talin binds to integrin Î² chains and induces a separation of Î± and Î² chain cytoplasmic domains. Therefore, we investigated the ability of the talin head domain construct to activate the Î²2-T758A mutant. It could still be activated by the talin construct in cells, as measured by increased adhesion of the transfected cells to coated ICAM-1. The talin-binding site in Î²3 integrins encompasses the first NPXY motif (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>) and corresponds to residues 747â755 in Î²2, which precede Thr758. Thus, the mechanism by which Thr758 regulates adhesion is presumably not related to talin.</p>
      <p>The cytoskeletal protein Î±-actinin has been shown to associate with the Î²2 tail at a membrane-proximal site, whereas the COOH-terminal portion of the tail (residues 748â762) inhibits this interaction (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sampath et al., 1998</xref>). Substitution of Thr758 with Ala or with the phosphate-mimic Glu stimulates binding of Î±-actinin to Î²2, suggesting that phosphorylation of Î²2 on Thr758 does not regulate Î±-actinin binding (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sampath et al., 1998</xref>). Additionally, deletion of the Î±-actinin binding site in Î²2 does not influence adhesion to ICAM-1. On the other hand, other proteins may bind to the TTT region and, indeed, filamin has been shown to do so (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, it is possible that threonine phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding may regulate such interactions.</p>
      <p>LFA-1 is involved in many different immunological adhesion events. It can be activated by different stimuli and is regulated both by conformational changes and by cytoskeletal attachment and clustering. It is now clear that phosphorylation of both the Î± and Î² chains plays a role in the molecular mechanisms involved in the different activation events. However, the Î±L and Î²2 polypeptides play distinctive roles in integrin activation. The integrin Î±L chain is constitutively phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation site (Ser1140) seems to be required for adhesion events that involve rapid changes in the conformation and affinity of the integrin heterodimer. In contrast, the Î²2-Thr758 phosphorylation that is induced after physiological triggering of T cells through the TCR works through interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. This form of adhesion is slower and involves actin reorganization and cell spreading. The contribution of the different phosphorylation events to overall adhesion may depend on the context of adhesion and provides the possibility for regulation of both fast, transient adhesive events and long-term, stable adhesion strengthening.</p>
