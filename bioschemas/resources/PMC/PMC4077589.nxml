        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>Searching and evaluating the Human Protein Atlas for transmembrane proteins enabled us to identify an integral membrane protein, TMEM115, that is enriched in the Golgi complex. Biochemical and cell biological analysis suggested that TMEM115 has four candidate transmembrane domains located in the N-terminal region. Both the N- and C-terminal domains are oriented towards the cytoplasm. Immunofluorescence analysis supports that TMEM115 is enriched in the Golgi cisternae. Functionally, TMEM115 knockdown or overexpression delays Brefeldin-A-induced Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport, phenocopying cells with mutations or silencing of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. Co-immunoprecipitation and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding experiments reveals that TMEM115 interacts with the COG complex, and might self-interact to form dimers or oligomers. A short region (residues 206â229) immediately to the C-terminal side of the fourth transmembrane domain is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi targeting. Knockdown of TMEM115 also reduces the binding of the lectins peanut agglutinin (PNA) and <italic>Helix pomatia</italic> agglutinin (HPA), suggesting an altered O-linked glycosylation profile. These results establish that TMEM115 is an integral membrane protein of the Golgi stack regulating Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport and is likely to be part of the machinery of the COG complex.</p>

  <body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The Golgi complex is a central station of the secretory pathway and plays a fundamental role in protein modifications such as glycosylation and protein sorting to multiple post-Golgi compartments (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">Glick and Nakano, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Ungar, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">Rosnoblet et al., 2013b</xref>). The Golgi is dynamically linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport, which is involved in the retrieval of resident ER proteins (such as luminal KDEL-containing proteins) that have escaped from the ER, as well as maintaining equilibrium of cycling membrane proteins (such as ERGIC53, KDEL receptors, p24 family proteins and SNAREs) in the early secretory pathway (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">FÃ¼llekrug et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="b70" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b69" ref-type="bibr">Tang and Wang, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b73" ref-type="bibr">Townsley et al., 1993</xref>). Retrograde transport from the endosomal compartments to the Golgi also links the endocytic pathway with the secretory pathway (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Chia and Gleeson, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">Lieu and Gleeson, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">Seaman, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">Seaman, 2009</xref>). Intracellular transport in the secretory and endocytic pathways is tightly regulated and involves the interactions of many organelles and machineries so that cargoes are delivered from one compartment to another while the integrity and the composition of proteins and lipids across these organelles are carefully balanced and maintained (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Cancino and Luini, 2013</xref>). Both the anterograde and retrograde transport pathways are crucial for the development and maintenance of the normal physiology of an organism. Although it is known that the secretory pathway is important for cell growth, defects in retrograde transport can indirectly result in the failure of the ER-to-Golgi transport pathway. It has been proposed that the defective biosynthetic trafficking observed in some yeast mutants of components of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) tethering complex might be an outcome of secondary trafficking defects arising from primary retrograde trafficking defects (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="b79" ref-type="bibr">Wuestehube et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The evolutionarily conserved COG complex has eight subunits (COG1âCOG8) and is implicated in the tethering of retrograde Golgi vesicles for intra-Golgi transport as well as retrograde endosomeâGolgi transport. Accordingly, malfunctions in the COG complex greatly impact on Golgi integrity, protein and lipid trafficking and glycosylation (<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Ungar, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b74" ref-type="bibr">Ungar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr">Willett et al., 2013</xref>). The COG complex is organized into two functionally and structurally distinct sub-complexes, Lobe A (COG1âCOG4) and Lobe B (COG5âCOG8) (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">Laufman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">Lees et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">Loh and Hong, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b76" ref-type="bibr">Walter et al., 1998</xref>). Subunits of Lobe A are essential for growth in yeast. Deletions or mutations of genes encoding these proteins cause severe glycosylation defects. Conversely, deletions of Lobe B subunits do not exhibit such severe phenotypes in yeast, suggesting that the Lobe B subcomplex has a regulatory or redundant role (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">Kudlyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b82" ref-type="bibr">Zolov and Lupashin, 2005</xref>). It has recently been shown that downregulation of COG function results in the mislocalization and degradation of resident Golgi glycosyltransferases and/or glycosidases (<xref rid="b66" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Lupashin, 2008</xref>). The COG complex is intimately involved in glycosylation homeostasis. It maintains a dynamic and finely tuned balance between anterograde and retrograde trafficking by coordinating intra-Golgi retrograde transport. This fine balance is required for the correct localization and distribution of the glycosylation enzymes in the Golgi (<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">Reynders et al., 2011</xref>). The functional importance of the COG complex in human is underscored by the identification of mutations in six out of the eight subunits (COG1, COG4, COG5, COG6, COG7 and COG8) in patients with the human disease congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type II (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">Foulquier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Foulquier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">Freeze and Ng, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">Kranz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">Kudlyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b67" ref-type="bibr">Spaapen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b78" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b80" ref-type="bibr">Zeevaert et al., 2008</xref>). The patients are characterized by abnormal glycosylation, although the clinical presentations are highly heterogeneous. Cellular depletion of COG subunits or fibroblasts derived from CDG type II patients exhibit resistance to Brefeldin A (BFA)-induced Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport and accelerated degradation of Golgi proteins such as GS15, GS28 mannosidase II, GPP130, CASP, giantin and golgin-84 (<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">Steet and Kornfeld, 2006</xref>). In humans, mutations of both Lobe A and Lobe B subcomplexes are associated with CDG, suggesting that the entire complex is essential for proper function of the Golgi complex to execute normal glycosylation of cargo proteins. Here, we describe a new player in the Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport pathway. TMEM115, also known as PL6, located on chromosome 3p21.3, was originally thought to function as a tumor suppressor (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">Ivanova et al., 2008</xref>). Our biochemical, cell biological and functional studies suggest that TMEM115 is an integral Golgi protein of â¼35âkDa with four predicted transmembrane domains. It interacts with COG4 of the COG complex and is involved in proper O-linked glycosylation and efficient Golgi-ER retrograde transport in response to BFA treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of new candidate Golgi membrane proteins</title><p>The Human Proteins Atlas database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/">http://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>) was searched for the term âtransmembrane proteinâ. The search was conducted using version 5.0 and produced a list of 3541 proteins, of which 103 had been validated by immunohistological staining. Further examination of the tissue expression pattern and subcellular localization of these 103 proteins on the database narrowed the list of candidate Golgi proteins to 11. In depth examination of the subcellular labeling patterns of these 11 proteins enabled us to focus on five proteins with clear perinuclear Golgi-like labeling (C11orf87, TMEM115, TMEM77, TMEM87A and TMEM17). We used BLAST to align the sequence of these five proteins against proteins in the yeast and fly databases and found that both TMEM115 and TMEM87A have structural homologs in these organisms (the process is outlined in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S1A</ext-link>). TMEM115 has been reported to have reduced expression in renal clear cell carcinomas and other VHL-deficient tumors and to exhibit Golgi localization (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">Ivanova et al., 2008</xref>). These observations suggest that it might be a potential tumor suppressor located in the Golgi. Therefore, we focused our study on TMEM115.</p><p>Hydrophobicity analysis of the TMEM115 sequence (351 residues) by TMpred (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html">http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html</ext-link>) revealed four hydrophobic regions in the N-terminal region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S1B</ext-link>). Alignment of amino acid sequences of TMEM115 from human, mouse, frog, zebrafish, fly, worm and yeast revealed they are well conserved throughout evolution. The C-terminal region (residues 206â351) is hydrophilic in nature, within which the epitope of the rabbit antibody used in the Atlas study (HPA015497) is located (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S1C</ext-link>). Accordingly, TMEM115 was predicted to have four transmembrane domains with both N- and C-termini facing either the cytoplasm (a model is shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S1C</ext-link>) or the lumen.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>TMEM115 is located at the Golgi complex</title><p>The endogenous levels of TMEM115 in various cell lines were examined by western blotting.

TMEM115 was found at the perinuclear region, adjacent to, but not co-localized with the cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130 (<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1B, panels c and c<sub>1</sub></xref>) or the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker TGN46 (<xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">Ponnambalam et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">Prescott et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1B, panels l and l<sub>1</sub></xref>). In cells stably expressing either GFP-tagged mannosidase II (manIIâGFP), a medial-Golgi marker or the GFPâGalT chimera [in which the catalytic domain of Î²1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (GalT) is replaced by GFP], a trans-Golgi marker (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">Colley, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">Rabouille et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">Velasco et al., 1993</xref>), TMEM115 was found to be well colocalized with manIIâGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1B, panels f and f<sub>1</sub></xref>) and the signal substantially overlapped with GalTâGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1B, panels i and i<sub>1</sub></xref>). Immunoelectron microscopy analysis showed that TMEM115 was localized to the Golgi complex and was distributed towards the outer periphery of the Golgi (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S2A</ext-link>, arrows). These results indicate that TMEM115 is likely to be enriched in the Golgi stack.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The C-terminal tail of TMEM115 is exposed in the cytoplasm</title><p>Evolutionary comparison and hydrophobicity analysis of its primary amino acid sequence predict that TMEM115 has a short cytoplasmic domain at the N-terminus, followed by four transmembrane domains and a C-terminal hydrophilic tail of â¼146 amino acid residues (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S1C</ext-link>), which contains a predicted coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2A</xref>). Immunofluorescence studies in semi-permeabilized cells (in which only the plasma membrane is permeabilized but the membrane of internal organelles such as the Golgi is intact) were carried out to investigate the proposed membrane topology of TMEM115, using an antibody that specifically recognizes an epitope (residues 255â344) located in the C-terminal tail. Low concentrations (5âÂµg/ml) of digitonin (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Diaz and Stahl, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Eckhardt et al., 1999</xref>) were used to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane. The cells were then simultaneously labeled with anti-GFP and anti-TMEM115 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2B, panels aâh</xref>), or with anti-GM130 and anti-TMEM115 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2B, panels iâp</xref>). As the catalytic domain of GalT is replaced by GFP in the chimera GalTâGFP (<xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">Schaub et al., 2006</xref>), the GFP tag is oriented to the lumen of the Golgi cisternae and is not accessible to the GFP antibody when the Golgi membrane is not permeabilized. Therefore if the C-terminal tail of TMEM115 is in the lumen of the Golgi, it too cannot be accessed by the TMEM115 antibody. In digitonin-treated cells, there were no significant detection of anti-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2B, panels a and d</xref>), indicating that the anti-GFP antibody was unable to react with the epitope located in the lumen of an intact Golgi complex. In contrast, the peripheral cytoplasmic protein GM130 (<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 1995</xref>) was readily labeled in digitonin-permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2B, panel i</xref>).

VSV-G protein transport in TMEM115-silenced cells did not exhibit any difference to the control cells (data not shown). To follow BFA-induced Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport, control and TMEM115-silenced cells were incubated with 5âÂµg/ml BFA at 37Â°C for various times. The redistribution of TMEM115 and the Golgi marker GalTâGFP were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3C</xref>). In control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3C, top panels</xref>), both TMEM115 and GalTâGFP were found in tubule-like structures spreading out from the perinuclear Golgi region after incubation with BFA for 10âminutes. By 30âminutes, the majority of GalTâGFP had been redistributed into an ER-like labeling pattern, whereas TMEM115 was found in both the perinuclear region and diffuse punctated structures. By 45â60âminutes, TMEM115 had been redistributed in punctated structures scattered throughout the cytoplasm. In marked contrast, GalTâGFP was found in a tight, compact structure at the perinuclear region in TMEM115 knocked-down cells 10â20âminutes after treatment with BFA. This labeling pattern of GalTâGFP persisted even after 30âminutes of incubation with BFA, after which the protein gradually redistributed to an ER-like pattern (at 45 and 60âminutes). Even after 45â60âminutes incubation, GalTâGFP had not completely re-distributed back to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3C, bottom panels</xref>). The quantification of these experiments was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3D</xref>. Similar results were also observed in other cell lines, such as A549, H460 using endogenous Golgi proteins such as giantin and GPP130 (data not shown), suggesting that silencing of TMEM115 markedly delays BFA-induced Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport.</p><p>The BFA-dependent Golgi disassembly was also examined in cells transiently overexpressing exogenous full-length TMEM115 (TMEM115-FL). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3E</xref> shows that transiently expressed TMEM115-FL was located to the Golgi complex and colocalized with GalTâGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3E, panels aâc</xref>). Interestingly, when cells were treated with BFA for 30âminutes, both GalTâGFP and TMEM115-FL were found in a compact structure at the perinuclear region, whereas in the surrounding untransfected cells, GalTâGFP was efficiently redistributed to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3E, panels dâf</xref>). This delay of BFA-induced Golgi disassembly is similar to that in TMEM115 knocked-down cells. The strength of inhibition of BFA induced Golgi redistribution also correlates with the level of expression of this construct [i.e. the higher the expression of TMEM115-FL, the slower the rate of BFA-induced Golgi redistribution (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S3A</ext-link>, panels a and b, asterisks)]. These observations suggest that both overexpressing and silencing TMEM115 inhibits BFA-induced Golgi disassembly; therefore, BFA-induced Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport might require finely regulated levels of TMEM115.</p><p>To rule out any possibility of off-target effects in the siRNA experiments, we proceeded to validate the effect of TMEM115 silencing in cells by using specific siRNAs from the siRNA pool against TMEM115. Immunoblotting analysis results showed that, of the four siRNAs, siRNA 3 had the least efficiency in silencing TMEM115 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3G, panel e</xref>). It also did not affect the redistribution of GalTâGFP to the ER in the presence of BFA, similar to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3F, panel w</xref>). By contrast, the other three siRNA duplexes were able to knockdown TMEM115 efficiently, and also had an inhibitory effect on GalTâGFP redistribution to the ER, similar to that of the pooled TMEM115 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3G</xref>). In addition, the Golgi complex (marked by GalTâGFP) appeared to be more compact in TMEM115-silenced cells as compared to the control cells. Similar to the Golgi disassembly assay by BFA, the degree of compactness correlates to the level of TMEM115 silencing. siRNA 3, which has the least efficiency for TMEM115 silencing, shows the least compact in Golgi morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3G</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S3B</ext-link>).</p><p>Silent mutations were introduced into TMEM115âFLAG to make it resistant to one (siRNA 1) of the siRNAs used in our experiments.

Similar to wild type, TMEM115 si#1R-FLAG, when expressed at very high levels, disrupts the Golgi complex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S4A</ext-link>, panel a,b, panel iâj, #).

However, when expressed at a moderate level, siRNA-resistant TMEM115 was located at the Golgi complex and colocalized with GalTâGFP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S4A</ext-link>, panels aâd; panels iâl, arrowheads). In control cells, upon 10âminutes treatment with BFA, both the FLAG-tagged protein and GalTâGFP were observed in a compact structure at the perinuclear region in 91% of the cells that were moderately expressing TMEM115 si#1R-FLAG, whereas in the surrounding untransfected cells, GalTâGFP was efficiently redistributed to the ER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S4A</ext-link>, panel f). This delay effect on the BFA-induced Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport is similar to that caused by the silencing of TMEM115 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S4A</ext-link>, panel n, arrow). Therefore, it seems that the BFA-dependent Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport is regulated by a finely balanced amount of TMEM115. The expression of TMEM115 si#1R-FLAG in TMEM115-silenced cells appears to be able to rescue this delayed phenotype in some (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.136754/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig.Â S4A</ext-link>, panels m and n, asterisks), but not all cells expressing the FLAG-tagged TMEM115. However, we are unable to differentiate whether this reversion to a wild-type phenotype is due to a true rescue event or due to the fact that the Golgi was already disrupted by a high level expression of TMEM115 si#1R-FLAG.</p><p>The effect of TMEM115 depletion on BFA-dependent Golgi disassembly is similar to the phenotype observed in cells deficient in COG proteins (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">Kranz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">Steet and Kornfeld, 2006</xref>) or upon silencing COG subunits (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">Laufman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Laufman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">Laufman et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that TMEM115 might play certain functions in COG-dependent transport pathways.

This chimera is called CD8âTM115. This approach has been used previously to functionally test the targeting function of cytoplasmic tails (<xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">Seaman, 2004</xref>). CD8 is a cell surface protein that is not normally expressed in HeLa cells and it does not appear to have intrinsic targeting information in the intracellular organelles. In CD8âfurin, the cytoplasmic tail of CD8 is replaced by that of furin. The cytoplasmic tail of furin has previously been shown to mediate the targeting of the CD8âfurin chimera to the Golgi (<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, if residues 206â229 of TMEM115 functions only as an ER export signal, the chimera CD8âTM115 would be expected to target to the plasma membrane, whereas, if it contains a Golgi-targeting signal, then the chimera would be retained in the Golgi.</p><fig id="f07" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Residues 206â229 of TMEM115 are sufficient for Golgi targeting.</bold> (A) Schematic illustration of various chimeric CD8 proteins.

CD8âTM115 was also found to colocalize with GalTâGFP at the perinuclear region. Additionally, there are some CD8âTM115 signals at a lower density found at the plasma membrane and punctated structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Fig.â7B, panel g</xref>). These results suggest that the fragment 206â229 of TMEM115 contains a signal that is necessary and sufficient for Golgi targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Silencing TMEM115 affects glycosylation</title><p>It has been reported that glycosylation is affected in COG-deficient cells (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">Kranz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">Reynders et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">Rosnoblet et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref rid="b80" ref-type="bibr">Zeevaert et al., 2008</xref>). Given that TMEM115 interacts with COG proteins and its knockdown also phenocopies COG mutant cells in BFA-induced Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">Kranz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">Laufman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Laufman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">Laufman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">Steet and Kornfeld, 2006</xref>), we proceeded to investigate whether glycosylation was also affected in TMEM115 knocked-down cells. TMEM115-silenced cells were fixed and labeled with fluorescent-dye-conjugated lectins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Fig.â8A</xref>). The immunofluorescence results showed that there were no obvious difference in the intensity and labeling pattern of Concanavalin A (ConA) or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Surface, but not Golgi, labeling by <italic>Helix pomatia</italic> agglutinin (HPA) was reduced, whereas surface labeling by peanut agglutinin (PNA) was almost completely ablated in the TMEM115 knocked-down cells. We also compared the cell surface biotinylation profile between TMEM115-silenced cells and control cells using surface biotinylation, lectin-binding and immunoblotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Fig.â8B</xref>). Total glycosylation appeared to be reduced in the knockdown cells. ConA-binding glycoproteins were decreased, albeit to a lesser extent as compared to that of PNA binding. ConA, WGA and HPA binds N-linked glycans (<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">Molin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">Nagata and Burger, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">Sharon, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr">Sheldon et al., 1998</xref>), whereas PNA binds to O-linked glycans (<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">Lotan et al., 1975</xref>). However, it has been recently shown that HPA was also capable of recognizing O-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)-containing glycoproteins (<xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">Rambaruth et al., 2012</xref>). These results suggest that the function of TMEM115, either directly or indirectly, is required for proper glycosylation to occur within the cell, especially for O-linked glycosylation.</p><fig id="f08" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Gene silencing of TMEM115 affects glycosylation.</bold> (A) Glycosylation is affected in TMEM115 knocked-down cells. HeLa cells stably expressing GalTâGFP were transfected with either pooled siRNA targeting TMEM115 (right panels) or control pooled non-target siRNA (left panels). Non-permeabilized cells were labeled with fluorescent-dye-conjugated lectins. HPA mainly stains the Golgi complex (<xref rid="b200" ref-type="bibr">Campadelli et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="b400" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen, 1990</xref>) with very weak staining at the cell surface (<xref rid="b300" ref-type="bibr">de Albuquerque Garcia Redondo et al., 2004</xref>).

In this study, we found that TMEM115 is likely localized at the medial- and trans-Golgi cisternae and that the protein is oriented in such a way that the C-terminal tail is exposed in the cytoplasm. Moreover, silencing of TMEM115 using siRNA leads to a delay in Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport in the presence of BFA, suggesting that TMEM115 might play a role in regulating this trafficking pathway. Surprisingly, transient overexpression of exogenous TMEM115 also causes a similar delay, indicating that a finely maintained expression level of TMEM115 is required for efficient BFA-sensitive Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport. Exogenously expressed TMEM115 was able to co-immunoprecipitate both Î²-COP and the COG complex, two of the key players regulating Golgi-to-ER retrograde trafficking pathway (<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that TMEM115 might participate in the regulation of the COPI- and COG-dependent Golgi-to-ER retrograde trafficking pathway.</p><p>A series of deletion mutants was created to study the functional domains of TMEM115. Interestingly, the mutant TMEM115-206CT, which does not contain any transmembrane domain and thus was expected to be expressed as a cytosolic protein, was found to target to the Golgi complex. Further investigation showed that when residues 206â229 were removed, the mutant lost its Golgi localization. These 24 amino acids, when added back to the ER-localized mutant (TMEM115-NT205), were able to target the longer version (TMEM115-NT229) to the Golgi complex. When the cytosolic tail of the plasma membrane protein CD8 was replaced with residues 206â229 of TMEM115, the resulting chimera CD8âTM115 was targeted to the Golgi complex instead of the plasma membrane, indicating that an autonomous Golgi-targeting signal is located within these 24 residues.</p><p>The TMEM115 expression profile in cancer cell lines shows that TMEM115 seems to be expressed at a higher level in invasive breast cancer cells, such as MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T; as compared to MCF7, a weakly invasive breast cancer cell line. When TMEM115 expression was reduced in MDA-MB-231 cells using siRNA, a substantial inhibitory effect on the growth of these cells was observed (data not shown). These results suggest that there might be an association between elevated TMEM115 expression level and cancer cell properties. However, by contrast, it has been reported that there is a loss of TMEM115 expression in renal clear cell carcinomas and other VHL-deficient tumors (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">Ivanova et al., 2008</xref>). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but it is possible that it is specific to the cell type. Future studies will be necessary to explore these possibilities.</p><p>Both the N-terminal transmembrane-containing mutant (TMEM115-NT229) and the cytosolic domain mutant (TMEM115-230CT) were able to interact with Î²-COP and COG3. Given that TMEM115 seems to be able to self-oligomerize through its N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.â5B</xref>), it is likely that NT229 might be able to form a complex with wild-type TMEM115 and thus be able to pull-down COG3 and Î²-COP. Interestingly, even though the cytosolic 230CT does not interact with wild-type TMEM115 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.â5B</xref>), it was still able to pull-down COG3 and Î²-COP. This indicates that TMEM115 might interact with COG3 and Î²-COP through the C-terminal domain. We have also shown that TMEM115 binds to COG4 with the highest affinity amongst the subunits of the COG complex. Therefore it is likely that associations of TMEM115 with the other COG subunits and the proteins involved in the retrograde transport pathway might be through its interactions with COG4.</p><p>Glycosylation appears to be defective in TMEM115-silenced cells, especially the glycosylation of PNA-binding glycans. PNA binds to terminal Gal-Î²1-3 acetylgalactosamine, a common O-linked glycoprotein motif (<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">Maupin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">Sheikh et al., 1999</xref>). The lack of PNA staining on TMEM115-silenced cells suggests that the presence of O-linked glycoproteins on the cell surface was greatly reduced. O-linked glycans have been implicated in multiple and diverse biological functions (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">Brockhausen, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Hang and Bertozzi, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b71" ref-type="bibr">Tarp and Clausen, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Ten Hagen, 2009</xref>). O-glycosylation can substantially increase the hydrophilicity and turgidity of cell surface glycoproteins and can affect the adhesive properties of cells or create binding sites for glycoproteins (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Hang and Bertozzi, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">Ley and Kansas, 2004</xref>). There have been numerous reports regarding the association between cancerous transformations and an increase in short O-glycans, perhaps because disturbance in cell adhesion could facilitate cell migration and metastasis (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">Brockhausen, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">Itzkowitz et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">Nakamori et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">Ogata et al., 1998</xref>). Changes in the cell surface glycosylation profile are often associated with malignant transformation in cancer (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">Hakomori, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Hakomori and Cummings, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">Ono and Hakomori, 2004</xref>). Regulation of O-glycosylation is thought to depend mostly on the expression levels of the initiating GalNAc-T enzyme. Recently, it has also been suggested that the COPI-dependent Golgi-to-ER relocation of initiation GalNac-T enzyme provides another mode of regulation for this glycosylation process (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">Gill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">Gill et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recently, TMEM165, a novel six transmembrane Golgi protein with no known biological function to date, has been identified to be involved in CDG type II. Mutations in TMEM165 were observed in patients with Golgi glycosylation defects. These mutations crucially changed the subcellular localization of the protein, suggesting that the glycosylation defects observed might be secondary, and that the primary defect could exist outside the glycosylation machinery. Zeevaert and colleagues proposed that TMEM165 is a member of the âCDG plusâ subgroup. This group encompass CDG that results from deficiencies of proteins that are not specifically involved in glycosylation but that have functions in the organization and homeostasis of the intracellular compartments and the secretory pathway (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Foulquier, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Foulquier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">Rosnoblet et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref rid="b81" ref-type="bibr">Zeevaert et al., 2013</xref>), such as the COG proteins (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Foulquier, 2009</xref>), SEC23B (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">Bianchi et al., 2009</xref>) and ATP6V0A2 (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Guillard et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this study shows that TMEM115 contains several functional domains: the N-terminal domain, which has several transmembrane domains and mediates the formation of TMEM115 homo-oligomers; residues 206â229, which contain an autonomous Golgi-targeting signal; and its cytosolic C-terminal tail, which mediates interaction with the cytosolic proteins of the retrograde transport machinery, such as the coat complex COPI and the tethering factor COG complex. O-linked glycosylation was shown to be greatly reduced in TMEM115 knocked down cells, although the mechanism by which TMEM115 silencing alters O-glycosylation has yet to be defined. One could speculate that because TMEM115 participates in the regulation of Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport, a defect in this trafficking pathway would thereby in turn affect the distribution and/or localization of glycosylation enzymes that are necessary for effective glycosylation. Therefore, TMEM115 might be a new member of the CDG subgroup âCDG plusâ, and future analysis of human patients displaying a CDG phenotype for possible mutations of TMEM115 will be of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines</title><p>The HeLa-GalT-GFP stable cell line was a gift from Jack Rohrer (Friedrich Miescher Institut, Basel, Switzerland).
