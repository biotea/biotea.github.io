      <abstract>
        <p>New domains were progressively added to cytoplasmic aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases during evolution. One example is the UNE-S domain, appended to seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) in species that developed closed circulatory systems. Here we show using solution and crystal structure analyses and <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> functional studies that UNE-S harbours a robust nuclear localization signal (NLS) directing SerRS to the nucleus where it attenuates vascular endothelial growth factor A expression. We also show that SerRS mutants previously linked to vasculature abnormalities either deleted the NLS or have the NLS sequestered in an alternative conformation. A structure-based second-site mutation, designed to release the sequestered NLS, restored normal vasculature. Thus, the essential function of SerRS in vascular development depends on UNE-S. These results are the first to show an essential role for a tRNA synthetase-associated appended domain at the organism level, and suggest that acquisition of UNE-S has a role in the establishment of the closed circulatory systems of vertebrates.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases (aaRSs) are enzymes essential for translation throughout the three kingdoms of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Each member of the tRNA synthetase family is responsible for charging one specific amino acid onto its cognate tRNA. Once the tRNA is charged and delivered to the ribosome, the amino acid can be transferred from the tRNA onto a growing peptide according to the genetic code. During the evolution of this ancient protein family, new domains and motifs were progressively added to aaRSs to expand their functionalities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. These appended domains, often dispensable for aminoacylation, are considered as markers for the aaRS-associated functions beyond translation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Although their appearance correlates with the increase of biological complexity in higher organisms, the functional significance of these aaRS-associated appended domains is not understood at the organism level.</p>
    <p>With this question in mind, we recently identified a unique domain (named UNE-S) at the carboxyl-terminus of seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) in all vertebrates from fish to humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Interestingly, three independent forward-genetic studies in zebrafish suggested a role for SerRS in vascular development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Disruption of the gene encoding the cytoplasmic SerRS by insertional mutagenesis results in a null mutation, and causes abnormal blood vessel formation and defective blood circulation in the embryo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Separately, two additional studies identified three <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea-induced mutations in SerRS that also cause vasculature defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Two of these mutations result in premature stop codons (Q402Stop and E421Stop) eliminating part of the aminoacylation domain and the entire UNE-S domain, while the third is a missense mutation (F383V) located in the aminoacylation domain and allows expression of the full enzyme. Microinjection of either human or zebrafish SerRS messenger RNA (mRNA) into <italic>ko095</italic> (Q402Stop) mutant zebrafish embryos rescued the vascular phenotype, indicating that the vascular role of SerRS is conserved between zebrafish and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Interestingly, an aminoacylation-defective SerRS (T429A SerRS) mRNA could also restore the vasculature phenotype, suggesting that the role of SerRS in vasculature development is independent of aminoacylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. This noncanonical activity of SerRS was linked to the expression of <italic>vegfa</italic>, the gene encoding vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a key regulator of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
    <p>Considering that UNE-S was joined to SerRS at the time of development of the closed circulatory system, we speculated that UNE-S is relevant to the noncanonical role of SerRS in vascular development. In this study, we identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence embedded in UNE-S, and designed a series of experiments to demonstrate that the essential role of SerRS in vascular development is dependent on UNE-S and its role to mobilize SerRS from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.</p>

        <title>UNE-S-dependent nuclear localization of SerRS</title>
        <p>From inspection of UNE-S, we identified a <underline>KKQKK</underline>QXEXX<underline>KKK</underline> sequence as a putative NLS sequence that is highly conserved in all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). This observation raised the possibility that, in addition to being present in the cytoplasm for protein synthesis, SerRS might also be distributed to the nucleus. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated nuclear localization of SerRS in human endothelial cells (that is, HUVECs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Cell fractionation analysis further confirmed the nuclear distribution of SerRS in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Nuclear distribution of endogenous SerRS was also detected in HEK 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), indicating that the mechanism for bringing SerRS into the nucleus is not restricted to endothelial cells. We estimated that for both cell types, â¼10% of cellular SerRS is located in the nucleus based on our western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p>The potential NLS in UNE-S has the profile of a bipartite localization signal with two stretches of positively charged lysines that could be recognized by a nuclear transport protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. To test its authenticity as an NLS, we added the corresponding sequence from human SerRS (<sup>482</sup><underline>KKQKK</underline>QHEGS<underline>KKK</underline><sup>494</sup>) to the carboxyl-terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The GFPâNLS fusion protein, when expressed in HeLa or HEK 293 T cells, predominantly localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, the native GFP protein localized both to the nucleus and to the cytosol. These results show that the predicted NLS sequence in UNE-S is sufficient to direct nuclear localization.</p>
        <p>To establish whether the <sup>482</sup><underline>KKQKK</underline>QHEGS<underline>KKK</underline><sup>494</sup> NLS sequence is necessary for nuclear localization of SerRS, we deleted or mutated the NLS and compared the nuclear localization of the mutants with that of wild-type (WT) SerRS. As expected, the transfected WT protein was distributed in the nucleus of HEK 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We then created two deletion mutations that removed either the entire UNE-S (Î470-514) or only the region from the NLS to the C-terminus (Î482-514). In contrast to the WT SerRS, both deletion constructs only appeared in the cytoplasm and had no detectable nuclear distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We also created mutants that replace lysine residues in the NLS with alanines. As the number of lysine substitutions increased, the amount of SerRS nuclear localization decreased. A single lysine mutant K493A had a slightly reduced nuclear localization (data not shown), but only trace amounts of the triple mutant K482A/K485A/K493A (designated as NLS<sup>mut</sup>) were detected in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the predicted bipartite NLS in UNE-S is critical for the nuclear localization of SerRS.</p>

        <title>SerRS mutants are defective in nuclear localization</title>
        <p>Among the three different mutations in the SerRS gene (<italic>SARS</italic>) that are linked to zebrafish vasculature abnormalities, two were nonsense mutations resulting in a premature stop codon after Y401 or V420<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> yielding C-terminal truncated SerRS proteins lacking UNE-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Based on our data above, neither of these truncated proteins would be localized to the nucleus. The question remains on the third mutation, which results in a F383V substitution that is located â¼100 amino acids upstream of the NLS. Interestingly, this F383V substitution completely abolishes nuclear localization of SerRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus, all three SerRS mutations linked to vasculature abnormalities in zebrafish would result in defective nuclear localization of SerRS. In contrast, the aminoacylation-defective T429A SerRS, which rescued the abnormal vascular phenotype, localizes to the nucleus as efficient as WT SerRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The correlation between vasculature abnormality and the lack of SerRS nuclear localization strongly suggests that the role of SerRS in vascular development is dependent on the NLS embedded in UNE-S.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Crystal structure analysis of human SerRS</title>
        <p>To understand how F383V affects nuclear localization, we determined the crystal structure of human SerRS at 2.9 Ã resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The human protein shares overall 81% sequence identity with the fish ortholog, and F383 is a strictly conserved residue from fish to humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Three independent homodimers of SerRS were found in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. While the conformation of the aminoacylation domain is almost the same for all three dimers in the asymmetric unit, the N-terminal tRNA-binding domains have more flexible structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Interestingly, the C-terminal UNE-S domain (including the NLS) was mostly disordered in all six subunits, suggesting a dynamic conformation of the NLS that would enhance its accessibility to the nuclear transport machinery. F383 is located near the end of a Î²-strand (Î²10) that is part of the core seven-stranded antiparallel Î²-sheet (Î²1âÎ²9âÎ²10âÎ²11âÎ²13âÎ²8âÎ²7) of the aminoacylation domain, and spatially close to the active site and the flexible NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,c</xref>). The side chain of F383 forms hydrophobic interactions with H170 and F316 to stabilize the Î²10âÎ²11 hairpin as part of the central core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). A stereo image of the electron density map surrounding F383 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4d</xref>. We speculated that the F383V substitution would destabilize the hydrophobic core and, in some way, create an internal binding site for the NLS. As a result, the NLS would become less accessible, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4c</xref>, and less able to facilitate nuclear localization.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Solution structure shows the effect of F383V on UNE-S</title>
        <p>To compare the conformational dynamics of the NLS between the WT and F383V SerRS in solution, we carried out hydrogenâdeuterium exchange analysis monitored by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). The rate and level of hydrogenâdeuterium exchange of each digested peptide throughout the protein are directly related to its local conformation: more solvent-accessible and less H-bonded peptides exhibit faster and greater deuterium exchange than less solvent-accessible and more H-bonded ones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The SerRS proteins in this work exhibited the EX2 exchange regime, which is typical for most proteins in physiological conditions. By comparing the level of hydrogenâdeuterium exchange of the same peptide segments in the WT and F383V SerRS, a difference map was constructed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The peptide covering the F383V mutation site (E380-L392) is the only area on the protein that exhibits a dramatic <italic>increase</italic> in HDX (41% over WT SerRS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), presumably because of the weakened hydrophobic core caused by the mutation. Remarkably, also as a result of the F383V mutation, the NLS region shows the most dramatic decrease in HDX (64% below WT SerRS), indicating that it is stabilized in the mutant. This result is consistent with our hypothesis that the NLS becomes less accessible in the F383V mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5a</xref>).</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Structure-based design of second-site revertant of F383V</title>
        <p>We next wanted to determine the F383V-induced internal binding site for the NLS. By analysing the surface electrostatic potential of SerRS, three negatively charged sites were identified as potential binding sites for the positively charged NLS. Those sites are spatially adjacent to both the F383V mutation site and the partially resolved UNE-S in the crystal structure. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3a,b</xref>, site I contains four negatively charged residues (D148, E149, E150 and D152), site II contains D178, E181 and E183, while site III contains D378, E380 and E391. Among them, site III is the closest to the F383V mutation site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref>). If some of those negatively charged residues are important for NLS binding, their substitution with neutral or positively charged residues would release the NLS and restore nuclear localization.</p>
        <p>To identify the NLS-binding site on F383V SerRS, we created mutations within each site (I or II or III) on top of the F383V background. While mutations within sites I and II did not have any effect on nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3c</xref>), a double mutation within site III (D378S/E380G) partially rescued the nuclear localization defect of F383V (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3c</xref>). The rescue effect was mostly contributed by the D378S mutation alone, while substitution of D378 with a positively charged arginine provided further rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These results suggest that D378 has a major role in tethering the NLS in F383V SerRS, and that this tethering effect is largely dependent on electrostatic interactions. Consistently, as a result of the NLS binding, the D378-containing peptide (V365-D378) exhibited a 23% decrease in HDX in F383V SerRS relative to the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Possibly, as the F383V mutation increases the conformational dynamics of the loop region of the Î²10âÎ²11 hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), a binding groove is opened up near the hydrophobic core to accommodate the NLS that is then tethered by D378.</p>

        <title>UNE-S is dispensable for SerRS aminoacylation</title>
        <p>Previous studies showed that the vasculature defect in zebrafish was rescued by the expression of an enzymatically inactive SerRS. This result suggested that the role of SerRS in vascular development is separate from its role in protein synthesis. Therefore, the NLS, if related to vascular development, might not be involved in the enzymatic activity of SerRS. To investigate this point, we studied the two-step aminoacylation reaction. In the first step, serine is condensed with ATP to from seryl-adenylate (Ser-AMP). In the second step, serine is transferred from Ser-AMP to tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>. Using standard assays, we showed that, indeed, mutation or deletion of the UNE-S did not affect either of the two steps of the aminoacylation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>However, the F383V mutation reduced the catalytic activity of SerRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This might be due to the proximity of F383 to the active site, and the disturbance to the hydrophobic core next to the active site caused by the F to V substitution, as seen in the HDX experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Remarkably, deletion of the NLS, which had no effect on the aminoacylation activity of WT SerRS, completely abolished the residual enzymatic activity of F383V SerRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The second-site mutation D378R, which reverts the nuclear localization defect of F383V, also completely abolished the enzymatic activity of F383V SerRS. These observations further support a strong interplay between the NLS and D378 in the F383V mutant. Presumably, through the interaction with D378, the NLS helps to partially restore the destabilized active site resulting from the F383V mutation. Removal of this interaction, either by deletion of the NLS or by mutation of D378, abrogates the restoration effect.</p>

        <title>Role of UNE-S in vascular development in the zebrafish</title>
        <p>To confirm a functional link between the NLS and vascular development in a vertebrate model, we tested the rescue of vascular abnormality in zebrafish by various SerRS mutants. A fish model for vasculature abnormalities was created by injecting an antisense morpholino (MO) directed against SerRS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Consistent with the previous report by Fukui <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, we show that injection of SerRS-MO results in abnormal intersegmental vessel (ISV) branching in 50.8% (<italic>n</italic>=96 out of 189) of morphants, in contrast to 1.4% (<italic>n</italic>=3 out of 207) in uninjected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Co-injection of human SerRS mRNA efficiently rescued the abnormal ISV branching (8.4%; <italic>n</italic>=16 out of 190) in SerRS morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>In contrast, Î482-514, NLS<sup>mut</sup> and F383V SerRS, which we showed to be defective in nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>), could not rescue the aberrant ISV branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Abnormal ISV branching was observed in 44.6% (<italic>n</italic>=79 out of 177), 51.0% (<italic>n</italic>=77 out of 151) and 45.1% (<italic>n</italic>=69 out of 153) of SerRS morphants injected with Î482-514, NLS<sup>mut</sup> and F383V SerRS mRNA, respectively. These results strongly suggested that the NLS introduced by UNE-S is essential for vascular development.</p>
        <p>To further establish this conclusion, the rationally designed second-site revertant that restores nuclear localization by a compensatory substitution distal to the NLS was tested. Strikingly, the double mutant F383V/D378R SerRS mRNA rescued the abnormal ISV branching defects (8.5%; <italic>n</italic>=13 out of 153) with efficiency comparable to that of the WT mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The result further demonstrated the critical link of the NLS and UNE-S with vasculature development.</p>
        <p>The critical role of the NLS in the UNE-S domain indicates a specific function for SerRS in the nucleus of vertebrate cells. Fukui <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> reported that the <italic>ko095</italic> SerRS mutant zebrafish had increased expression of <italic>vegfa</italic>, which was suppressed by microinjection of the aminoacylation-defective T429A SerRS mRNA, suggesting that the noncanonical role of SerRS is related to negative regulation of <italic>vegfa</italic> expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Consistently, Herzog <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> showed that inhibition of VEGF signalling rescued aberrant dilatation of the aortic arch vessels in SerRS mutant zebrafish. To address the question of whether the function of SerRS in regulating VEGFA was also linked to UNE-S, we examined <italic>vegfa</italic> mRNA levels in fish embryos obtained from our previous experiments. The observed vascular abnormality was clearly coincident with upregulation of <italic>vegfa</italic> expression. Compared with the uninjected group, embryos injected with the SerRS MO have more than a threefold increase in <italic>vegfa</italic> mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). This increase was largely suppressed when WT or F383V/D378R SerRS mRNA was co-injected with the SerRS MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). In contrast, co-injection of nuclear localization-defective Î482-514 or NLS<sup>mut</sup> or F383V SerRS did not suppress <italic>vegfa</italic> expression. Thus, regulation of <italic>vegfa</italic> expression was also dependent on UNE-S and the nuclear localization of SerRS. This observation suggested that the function of SerRS in the nucleus is related to VEGFA regulation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Blood vessel formation, or vasculogenesis, is one of the hallmarks of vertebrate development. During the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition, the open circulatory systems, where blood is pumped by the heart into the body cavities, of invertebrates evolved into the advanced closed circulatory systems, where vessels are developed to carry the blood to nourish organs and tissues. As the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition coincides with the appearance of UNE-S, and because UNE-S is shown here to be essential for vascular development, acquisition of UNE-S may have a role in the establishment of the closed circulatory systems of vertebrates.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that, as the tree of life ascended from bacteria to lower and higher eukaryotes, new domains or motifs were added to aaRSs in a progressive and accretive manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In the case of SerRSs, the acquisition consists of extensions beyond the C-termini of the bacterial orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). SerRSs from basal eukaryotes have short C-terminal extensions that, as shown for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, while appearing to be important for stability of the synthetase <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, are dispensable for aminoacylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, in going through the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates, the C-terminus of SerRS was significantly expanded into the UNE-S domain. While it remains not important for aminoacylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>), the expansion included the appearance of a robust NLS.</p>
      <p>Our work showed that, because of the NLS brought in by UNE-S, this novel appended domain can mobilize SerRS for translocation from the cytosol to the nucleusâa function that is orthogonal to aminoacylation. Once in the nucleus, SerRS has the additional function of regulating expression of VEGFA, a key regulator of vascular development, most likely at the level of transcription. This nuclear activity of SerRS is in some ways reminiscent of the reported activity of LysRS, which regulates transcription factors MITF and USF2 that alter expression of target genes in response to allergic stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. From another aspect, the role of nuclear SerRS mirrors that of the bifunctional GluProRS, which in response to interferon-gamma stimulation, silences translation of VEGFA mRNA in the cytoplasm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Thus, an increasing literature has reported the role of aaRSs in regulating gene expression. In this regard, the work reported here is the first to show how an appended domain mobilizes a synthetase for an ex-translational role related to gene transcription.</p>
      <p>A lysine-rich peptide derived from a putative NLS sequence at the N-terminus of <italic>Lupinus luteus</italic> GlnRS was shown to interact with DNA and was suggested to potentially regulate gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The NLS within the UNE-S domain of SerRS is also lysine-rich and has a flexible conformation, as revealed in our crystal structure of human SerRS (which is the first structure of a vertebrate SerRS). This flexibility was further demonstrated through the UNE-S conformational switch induced by the F383V mutation. As flexible protein motifs are known to adapt by induced fit to specific DNA sequence targets, UNE-S may not only mobilize SerRS for nuclear localization but also facilitate interactions with potential targets in the nucleus.</p>
      <p>Given that almost all aaRSs have their own distinct elaborations with new domains, our work provides further motivation to discover and understand the function and significance of other synthetase domain accretions in higher organisms. Among them, the N-terminal WHEP domain of TrpRS is of particular interest, because it also appears during the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates and has been shown to regulate the anti-angiogenic activity of human TrpRS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p>

The aminoacylation domains are superimposed to show the flexibility of the N-terminal tRNA-binding domains. (<bold>c</bold>) Spatial location of residue F383. F383 is located in the loop region of the Î²10âÎ²11 hairpin within the aminoacylation domain, and forms a hydrophobic pocket with residues H170 and F316. The hydrophobic pocket is close to the active site, which is indicated by a modelled Ser-AMP (aminoacylation reaction intermediate) molecule. The N-terminus of the UNE-S domain is located close to F383, and the rest of UNE-S including the NLS is disordered in the crystal structure. The F383V mutation might affect the conformation of UNE-S and obscure the NLS, as illustrated in a model of the F383V mutant shown on the right. (<bold>d</bold>) Stereo image of partial electron density around F383, F316, H170 and D378 (shown in sticks). The 2Fo-Fc electron density map at 1.5 Ï is shown in grey, and the backbone traces of the structure are shown in light green.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) HDX-MS analysis of WT and F383V human SerRS proteins in solution showing that the NLS is conformationally buried in F383V SerRS. The regions associated with major deuterium uptake differences between WT and F383V SerRS are mapped on the primary sequence and on the crystal structure of human SerRS with the same colour coding. The percentage difference of deuterium incorporation indicated under the primary sequence is calculated from the hydrogenâdeuterium exchange after 1 h for F383V mutant relative to WT SerRS. Deuterium uptake time-course curves for representative peptides are shown on the right. (<bold>b</bold>) Cell fractionation experiment showing that substitution of D378 with S or R rescues the nuclear localization deficiency of F383V SerRS. (<bold>c</bold>) Aminoacylation and ATP-PPi exchange assays showing that the NLS is dispensable for aminoacylation and the F383V mutant remains partially active. The partial activity of F383V SerRS is completely lost when the NLS is deleted or released by the second mutation D378R. Error bars represent the s.e.m of triplicate experiments.</p>

        <title>Rescue experiments in zebrafish demonstrating the role of UNE-S in vascular development.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Illustration of the phenotype rescue experiment in zebrafish. The SerRS morpholino (SerRS-MO, â¼5 ng per embryo) was injected into the yolk of zebrafish embryos (1- to 2-cell stage) to produce a model of intersegmental vessel (ISV) abnormality. Co-injection of SerRS-MO with the WT human SerRS mRNA (â¼250 pg per embryo) rescued the aberrant ISV branching. The ISV development is recorded at 72 h post fertilization and the abnormal ISV branches are indicated by red arrows. (<bold>b</bold>) Co-injection of SerRS-MO with the NLS-deleted Î482-514 or NLS<sup>mut</sup> human SerRS mRNA did not rescue the aberrant ISV branching. (<bold>c</bold>) Co-injection of SerRS-MO with F383V human SerRS mRNA did not, whereas with F383V/D378R SerRS mRNA did, rescue the aberrant ISV branching.
