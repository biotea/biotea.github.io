      <abstract>
        <p>Maintaining genomic integrity during DNA replication is essential for cellular survival and for preventing tumorigenesis. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) functions as a processivity factor for DNA replication, and posttranslational modification of PCNA plays a key role in coordinating DNA repair against replication-blocking lesions by providing a platform to recruit factors required for DNA repair and cell cycle control. Here, we identify human SDE2 as a new genome surveillance factor regulated by PCNA interaction. SDE2 contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) fold, which is cleaved at a diglycine motif via a PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) box and deubiquitinating enzyme activity. The cleaved SDE2 is required for negatively regulating ultraviolet damage-inducible PCNA monoubiquitination and counteracting replication stress. The cleaved SDE2 products need to be degraded by the CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> ubiquitin E3 ligase in a cell cycle- and DNA damage-dependent manner, and failure to degrade SDE2 impairs S phase progression and cellular survival. Collectively, this study uncovers a new role for CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> in protecting genomic integrity against replication stress via regulated proteolysis of PCNA-associated SDE2 and provides insights into how an integrated UBL domain within linear polypeptide sequence controls protein stability and function.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Preserving genomic integrity during DNA replication is essential for preventing tumorigenesis. The CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> ubiquitin E3 ligase plays a unique role in this pathway by coupling proteolysis to interaction with the DNA replication processivity factor PCNA, in order to ensure selective elimination of key factors in cell cycle regulation. However, the mechanisms by which CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> directly regulates replication-associated DNA repair remain elusive. In this work, we identify a new human protein called SDE2 that helps cells relieve replication stress and ensure completing DNA replication process, whose activity is regulated by PCNA interaction and CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>. We show that SDE2 is cleaved by PCNA interaction and ubiquitin signaling to generate a functional C-terminal product. The cleaved SDE2 negatively regulates PCNA monoubiquitination required for relieving replication stress. Conversely, the cleaved SDE2 fragments need to be degraded, and failure to degrade SDE2 impairs S phase progression and cellular survival. Our findings uncover the role of CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>-proteolytic signaling coupled to PCNA in protecting genomic integrity against replication stress. Knowledge on such mechanism will be useful to identify novel cancer therapeutic interventions exploiting deregulated ubiquitin signaling and SDE2 activities in cancer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Replication stress caused by aberrant DNA replication is a major source of genome instability [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Consequently, DNA mutations and chromosome aberrations arising from stalled and collapsed replication forks are closely associated with tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To counteract these genotoxic threats, cells make a concerted effort to activate cell cycle checkpoints and execute DNA repair, processes that are collectively referred to as the DNA damage response (DDR) [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Because many DNA lesions block replication fork progression in S phase, they need to be repaired or bypassed to complete DNA replication in time. Posttranslational modification of the DNA replication processivity factor Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) plays a key role in coordinating this process by providing a scaffold to recruit factors required for DNA damage tolerance mechanisms to replicate over a lesion that blocks replicative polymerase progression, which includes translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) or template switching. In particular, PCNA monoubiquitination triggers TLS to directly bypass base damage and temporarily relieve arrested DNA replication using low-fidelity TLS polymerases that can accommodate various types of template structures [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this mechanism, single-stranded (ss) DNA generated at stalled replication forks activates RAD18 ubiquitin E3 ligase to monoubiquitinate PCNA [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Subsequently, TLS polymerases are recruited to monoubiquitinated PCNA (PCNA-Ub) via both a specialized ubiquitin-binding domain that recognizes the monoubiquitin moiety of PCNA and a PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box motif [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The PIP box binds to a hydrophobic pocket of PCNA buried under the interdomain-connecting loop, and interaction among PIP box-containing proteins can be competitive [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Multiple pathways are required for regulating PCNA-mediated TLS steps, including RAD18 recruitment, PCNA deubiquitination, TLS polymerase extraction, and chromatin remodeling [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Importantly, deregulation of PCNA deubiquitination caused by a deficiency of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) leads to disruption of TLS and increased genome instability due to the spurious recruitment of TLS polymerases [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>Another important feature of PCNA-controlled DNA replication is proteolysis coupled to DNA synthesis and repair. PCNA interaction via the PIP box regulates the degradation of specific protein targets, which is required for proper cell cycle progression [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The best example is PCNA-dependent degradation of the licensing factor CDT1 [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To ensure single origin licensing per cell cycle, CDT1 in the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) is degraded by the CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> ubiquitin E3 ligase complex after recruiting the MCM2-7 complex to replication origins in G1 phase [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Interestingly, CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> only recognizes PCNA-associated CDT1, which represents the CDT1 population coupled to DNA replication [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The PIP box in the N-terminus of CDT1 functions as a degron that specifically recruits CDT2 to its target CDT1 only when it is bound to PCNA [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. DNA is also required for CDT1 degradation, indicating that PCNA<sup>DNA</sup>-PIP degron-CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> constitutes a ternary complex that targets substrates for destruction. In addition to CDT1, other PIP degron-containing proteins such as SET8 and p21 are degraded by CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> in S phase to prevent premature chromatin compaction and to relieve inhibition of PCNA, respectively, thus highlighting the role of CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>-dependent proteolysis in ensuring DNA replication [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> substrates are also degraded following DNA damage, suggesting that they must also be properly removed to facilitate DNA repair.</p>
      <p>Proteolysis is mediated by the covalent conjugation of polyubiquitin chains to a substrate, which is in turn targeted to the 26S proteasome for destruction [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This process is reversible, and removal of ubiquitin from a substrate is mediated by DUBs. DUBs cleave the isopeptide bond between the C-terminal diglycine residues of ubiquitin and the amino group of a lysine in a substrate [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Most DUBs are cysteine proteases that rely on the thiol group of a cysteine in the active site [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. DUBs antagonize the activity of ubiquitin E3 ligases, thereby fine-tuning the stability and activity of target proteins.</p>
      <p>In contrast to ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers covalently attached to target proteins via a lysine side chain, some proteins bear a ubiquitin-like (UBL) motif within their linear polypeptide sequence [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These so-called ubiquitin-domain proteins (UDPs) constitute a structurally and functionally diverse protein group that regulates ubiquitin signaling. For instance, Rad23, a protein involved in nucleotide excision repair, contains a UBL domain at its N-terminus, which interacts with the ubiquitin-interacting motif of the 19S proteasome regulatory subunit to deliver substrates for degradation [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Other variant ubiquitin-regulatory X (UBX) domain-containing proteins such as p47 and the Npl4/Ufd1 complex function as essential cofactors for ATPase p97 to remove misfolded proteins in the ERAD pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. UBL domains also regulate the activities of proteins that contain it. For example, USP1, a DUB that regulates the Fanconi anemia DNA interstrand cross-link repair and TLS, auto-cleaves the C-terminus of the integrated UBL at a diglycine motif via its catalytic activity, resulting in its subsequent degradation by the proteasome [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>C1orf55 (hereinafter referred to as SDE2) is a highly conserved human protein that contains an SDE2 domain of unknown function and a DNA-binding SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus and PIAS) domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s002">S1A Fig</xref>). SAP domains are frequently found in proteins participating in the DNA repair process, such as PIAS1, Ku70, and RAD18 [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s002">S1B Fig</xref>). SDE2 is also a target of ATM/ATR kinases, further suggesting its possible function in the DDR or in DNA repair [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Sde2 in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> is known to be involved in genome maintenance pathway, but its function in higher eukaryotes remains uncharacterized [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Here, we identify that the UBL domain of SDE2 plays an important role in regulating replication stress response. The N-terminal UBL has a PIP box that mediates its interaction with PCNA, which leads to the cleavage of SDE2 at a diglycine motif and subsequent degradation by CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>. The cleaved C-terminal SDE2 is required for antagonizing PCNA monoubiquitination triggered by ultraviolet (UV) damage. By contrast, failure to degrade SDE2, due to its defective cleavage, impedes S phase progression and cellular survival. We propose that CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>, a known regulator of the cell cycle and DNA repair, counteracts replication stress by balancing the activity of PCNA-associated SDE2 at replication forks, using ubiquitin-like fold of SDE2 as a signal for targeted cleavage and degradation.</p>

        <title>SDE2 releases an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain cleaved at a conserved diglycine motif</title>
        <p>To investigate the function of SDE2, we first cloned and expressed an N-terminal GFP-tagged full-length human SDE2 in HeLa cells, which is expected to migrate as an approximately 76 kD band in SDS-PAGE. However, we only observed a band below 37 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Because we did not find any mutations that may have caused accidental truncation, we reasoned that SDE2 may be cleaved close to its N-terminus to generate an 8 kD polypeptide fused to GFP. Analysis of the SDE2 amino acid sequence revealed conserved diglycine residues at Gly76 &amp; 77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s002">S1A Fig</xref>). The diglycine motif is found at the C-terminus of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers, and DUB-dependent cleavage releases single ubiquitin-like molecule or processes poly-ubiquitin precursors. Interestingly, the N-terminal 77 amino acid polypeptide of SDE2 exhibits a structural fold almost identical to ubiquitin that consists of an Î±-helix and several Î²-sheet folds, as revealed by homology-based structure prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>), suggesting that it constitutes a UBL domain. To confirm that SDE2 is cleaved at the diglycine motif, we mutated two glycine residues to alanines (GA) and examined the cleavage pattern of SDE2. In contrast to the wild-type protein, the N-terminal GFP-tagged GA mutant was not cleaved and present as full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g001">Fig 1E</xref>; compare lanes 1 &amp; 2). Comparison of the immunoblot bands for the C-terminally GFP labeled wild-type and GA SDE2 mutants further confirmed that the N-terminal UBL is cleaved at positions 76 and 77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g001">Fig 1E</xref>; lanes 3 &amp; 4). Furthermore, immunoblots of the SDE2 protein that contains both N-terminal HA- and C-terminal Flag-tags showed separation of SDE2 into the two fragments of the predicted lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Using an antibody raised against SDE2, we also confirmed that the endogenous SDE2 protein exists as a fully processed form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s002">S1C Fig</xref>). Taken together, these data show that proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal SDE2 at the site of a signature diglycine motif releases a UBL via DUB-like activity.</p>

        <title>The SDE2-UBL contains a PIP box required for the cleavage of SDE2</title>
        <p>Although the cleaved N-terminus of SDE2 (SDE2-UBL) exhibits a fold similar to that of ubiquitin, its primary amino acid composition is not identical. Therefore, we further analyzed the SDE2 sequence to gain insights into the role of UBL domain. Interestingly, the UBL contains a conserved PIP box, which resembles those frequently found in Y-family TLS polymerases, lacking the Q residue found at position 1 in canonical PIP boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s003">S2A Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To investigate the role of the PIP box in PCNA interaction and SDE2 cleavage, we examined the interaction between SDE2 and PCNA by GST pull-down. Full-length SDE2 (GA mutant) and the UBL domain of SDE2 interacted with GST-PCNA, whereas the PIP box mutant (F47A &amp; F48A) did not, showing that SDE2 interacts with PCNA and an intact PIP box is required for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s003">S2B Fig</xref>). Remarkably, when the PIP box mutation was introduced into wild-type SDE2, the GFP-fusion protein was not cleaved at the diglycine motif in cells, suggesting that the PCNA interaction is required for the cleavage of SDE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). We further confirmed our observation by visualizing GFP-SDE2 proteins with fluorescence microscopy. SDE2 was primarily present in the nucleus as determined by C-terminally GFP-tagged SDE2, while N-terminal GFP-SDE2 diffused throughout the cell, representing cleaved GFP-UBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). By contrast, GFP signals of the N-terminal GFP-SDE2 GA or PIP mutants were concentrated in the nucleus. Collectively, these data show that the cleavage of SDE2 is coupled to its interaction with PCNA via the PIP box located at the UBL.</p>

        <p>Since a diglycine motif of ubiquitin is recognized by a DUB to be cleaved from its substrate, we next sought to determine whether DUB activity is involved in SDE2 cleavage. When SDE2 was <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and translated using a reticulocyte-derived cell free expression system, where PCNA is detected, we observed that SDE2 was fully cleaved upon expression, whereas ubiquitin vinyl sulfone, or ubiquitin aldehyde, which are pan-DUB inhibitors, prevented this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g002">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s003">S2C Fig</xref>). This result indicates that DUB activity in the expression lysate is responsible for cleaving SDE2. Mutation of the diglycine motif or the PIP box, but not the SAP DNA binding domain, abolished the cleavage, suggesting that the interaction with PCNA stimulates DUB activity required for SDE2 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Indeed, recombinant SDE2 expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, which contains a Î² sliding clamp instead of PCNA in eukaryotes, retained its full-length form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s003">S2D Fig</xref>). Given its high efficiency of cleavage, SDE2 might function as a DUB to cleave itself. However, mutations in the conserved Cys (that constitutes an active site for cysteine protease) or His-Glu (for metalloprotease) near the SDE2 domain failed to prevent its cleavage, suggesting that SDE2 does not exhibit intrinsic catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s003">S2E Fig</xref>).</p>

        <title>The SDE2-UBL is degraded via CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>-mediated proteolysis</title>
        <p>PCNA-mediated cleavage of SDE2 is analogous to PCNA-dependent destruction of CDT1 by CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>, which is coupled to DNA replication and DNA repair. This process requires a modified PIP box called a PIP degron, which consists of a TD motif at positions 5 and 6 and a basic residue at position +4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s004">S3A Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The TD motif enhances substrate binding to PCNA, whereas the B+4 residue helps in the recruitment of CDT2, although a non-canonical PIP degron has been reported [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although the PIP box of SDE2 lacks the features of a canonical PIP degron, requirement of PCNA for the cleavage of SDE2 raises a possibility that CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> may be involved in regulating the function of SDE2.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, treatment with DNA-damaging agents that cause replication stress led to degradation of GFP-UBL that was generated from full-length GFP-SDE2, and proteasome activity was required for its degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s004">S3B Fig</xref>). Moreover, cellular levels of GFP-UBL increased at early S phase and then disappeared during S phase progression, similar to other known CDT2 substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s004">S3C Fig</xref>). Notably, CDT2 knockdown prevented the degradation of GFP-UBL following HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Also, CDT2 depletion slowed down the kinetics of GFP-UBL degradation without damage as measured by cycloheximide blocking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Furthermore, MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) that inhibits CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> activity [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], increased basal levels of GFP-UBL and inhibited degradation of GFP-UBL in the absence and presence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g003">Fig 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s004">S3D Fig</xref>). Additionally, G1 phase cells with CDT2 knockdown restored GFP-UBL levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s004">S3E Fig</xref>). These data show that CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> is required for the degradation of SDE2-UBL in a cell cycle- and DNA damage-dependent manner. Conversely, overexpression of CDT2 was sufficient to decrease GFP-UBL levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), and was able to enhance polyubiquitination of GFP-UBL <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). By contrast, CDT2 knockdown led to decreased levels of GFP-UBL polyubiquitin conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g003">Fig 3H</xref>).

        <title>The cleavage of SDE2 is prerequisite for degradation of C-terminal SDE2 in chromatin and is regulated by CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup></title>
        <p>Because degradation of N-terminal UBL is mediated by CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>, we next expressed full-length GFP-SDE2 and examined whether degradation of C-terminal SDE2 (C-SDE2) upon cleavage is subjected to similar regulation. When cells were fractionated using cytoskeleton (CSK) buffer, we observed that C-SDE2 was specifically degraded in the chromatin-enriched fraction following UVC irradiation, which was antagonized by proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s005">S4A Fig</xref>). The level of C-SDE2 also exhibited a cell cycle-dependent change in chromatin, which showed transient accumulation at G1/S transition followed by gradual decrease in S phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s005">S4B Fig</xref>). Since a SAP domain is known to mediate the interaction with DNA, we determined if the SAP domain of SDE2 is required for SDE2 degradation. Deletion of the SAP DNA binding domain did not affect the cleavage of SDE2 but abrogated the association of C-SDE2 in the chromatin fraction, therefore the SAP mutant failed to undergo degradation following UVC irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The half-life of the SAP mutant also increased in the absence of damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s005">S4C Fig</xref>). We observed a further processed form of the cleaved SAP mutant, whose identity is currently unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, asterisk). Importantly, both non-cleavable SDE2 GA and PIP mutants failed to undergo degradation in chromatin following UVC irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), and the half-life of the GA mutant greatly increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s005">S4D Fig</xref>), indicating that SDE2 needs to be cleaved for subsequent degradation as a normal turnover process and in response to DNA damage.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, similarly to SDE2-UBL, knockdown of CDT2 rescued endogenous C-SDE2 levels in chromatin that were decreased by UVC irradiation and during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s005">S4E Fig</xref>), and a decreased amount of C-SDE2 polyubiquitin conjugates was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s005">S4F Fig</xref>). Although CDT2 depletion is known to arrest cells in G2 phase, we observed that cells progressed proficiently through S phase as shown by increase in BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s005">S4G Fig</xref>), and C-SDE2 degradation of cells traversing to G1 from G2 arrest was abolished by CDT2 knockdown, indicating that the phenotype is not an indirect effect of S phase defect or G2 arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s005">S4H Fig</xref>). Furthermore, as is the case with SDE2-UBL, MLN4924 abolished UVC-induced C-SDE2 degradation in chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s005">S4I Fig</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that degradation of C-SDE2 could also be regulated by CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> similarly to its N-terminus. Although C-SDE2 itself does not contain a PIP degron, anti-Flag immunoprecipitation revealed that CDT2 interacts with C-terminally Flag-tagged SDE2, and exogenously expressed C-SDE2 without its UBL retains its interaction, indicating that C-SDE2 alone is sufficient to interact with CDT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Notably, deletion of the SAP domain abolished the interaction of C-SDE2 with CDT2, suggesting that the C-terminal region of SDE2 may contain an uncharacterized CDT2 degron motif different from a canonical PIP degron. Furthermore, the interaction between C-SDE2 and CDT2 was retained in the presence of Benzonase endonuclease, indicating that the interaction is direct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s005">S4J Fig</xref>). Accordingly, overexpression of CDT2 reduced C-SDE2 levels in chromatin and enhanced polyubiquitin conjugates of C-SDE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> is an important regulator that degrades both N-terminal UBL and C-terminal SDE2 products once generated by a DUB-dependent cleavage of SDE2. Given the role of the SAP domain in localizing SDE2 in chromatin, we do not exclude the possibility of DNA in contributing or strengthening the formation of the PCNA<sup>DNA</sup>-SDE2-CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> ternary complex.</p>

        <title>SDE2 prevents DNA damage arising from replication stress</title>
        <p>Many CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> substrates regulate cell cycle and DNA repair [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To investigate the possible role of SDE2 in regulating cell cycle progression and the DDR, we depleted SDE2 levels using multiple independent siRNA oligos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s006">S5A Fig</xref>). Depletion of SDE2 in HeLa cells led to significantly elevated Î³H2AX levels, but not phosphorylated CHK1 or RPA, following UVC irradiation as revealed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence, representing increased DNA damage in the absence of SDE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s006">S5B Fig</xref>). A persistent stalled replication fork leads to replication collapse, ultimately leading to double-strand breaks (DSBs). Activity of MUS81, a structure-specific nuclease, has been implicated in the processing of stalled forks [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Indeed, enhanced Î³H2AX signal resulting from SDE2 knockdown could be reduced by co-depleting MUS81, indicating that SDE2 depletion results in the formation of replication-associated DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Accordingly, cells depleted of SDE2 were hypersensitive to replication-associated DNA damage caused by UVC, HU, or aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s006">S5C Fig</xref>).

Also, we did not observe significant difference in cellular resistance to MMC and camptothecin in the absence of SDE2, indicating that SDE2 may be involved in a confined and specific DNA repair pathway, which is often the case with distinct DNA repair factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s006">S5E and S5F Fig</xref>).</p>

To further substantiate this finding, we assessed the ability of SDE2 to promote recovery from replication fork stalling by visualizing S phase progression following UVC irradiation. When we measured BrdU-positive cell population following UVC irradiation, SDE2-depleted cells exhibited decreased S phase cells in comparison to control cells that showed minimal reduction of cycling cells, indicating that replication recovery following UV damage is impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g005">Fig 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s006">S5H Fig</xref>). In addition, when we pulse-labeled cells with BrdU and followed labeled cells through S phase, we observed that loss of SDE2 led to a significant decrease of percentage in late S population with a concomitant increase in early S population, arguing for slower S phase progression in the presence of UV damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g005">Fig 5H</xref>).

        <title>Degradation of SDE2 is required for S phase progression and cellular survival</title>
        <p>CDT2 has been shown to degrade its substrates including p21, SET8, and FBH1 during S phase progression or following DNA damage to limit their potential negative effects on DNA replication and repair [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Degradation of C-SDE2 during S phase progression and after DNA damage suggests that SDE2 must also be properly removed. This would be required for preventing accumulation of SDE2 at DNA lesions near replication forks, which could be detrimental to cells. Therefore, we determined whether enforced expression of non-cleavable SDE2 mutants that cannot be degraded exerts any negative effect on counteracting replication stress. When wild-type SDE2 was overexpressed in HeLa cells, it marginally reduced cellular proliferation. By contrast, overexpression of SDE2 GA or PIP mutants led to a significant delay of cell doublings, indicating that aberrant accumulation of SDE2 impedes cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We next assessed the ability of these cells to progress through S phase following replication stress. HeLa cells synchronized at the G1/S transition by HU were pulse-labeled with BrdU, and progression into S phase was monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). When compared to vector control, cells expressing wild-type SDE2 exhibited a transient delay in progressing from early to late S phase, whereas cells expressing GA or PIP SDE2 mutants exhibited persistently delayed S phase progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g006">Fig 6C</xref>; compare 4 h vs. 8 h and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s007">S6A Fig</xref>). These data indicate that improper clearance of SDE2 and subsequent accumulation interferes with S phase progression. Importantly, deletion of the SAP domain abolished the effect of the PIP mutant in impairing cellular proliferation, suggesting that aberrant occupancy of SDE2 at DNA via the SAP domain impedes cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Accordingly, cells expressing GA or PIP SDE2 mutants were hypersensitive to HU treatment, supporting the notion that a defect in SDE2 turnover is detrimental to cellular survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Exogenous expression of the GA mutant itself did not cause elevated Î³H2AX levels in contrast to SDE2 deletion upon UVC damage, suggesting that mechanisms whereby loss-of-function or gain-of-function of SDE2 impact cellular survival may be distinct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s007">S6B Fig</xref>) Taken together, these results indicate that SDE2 needs to undergo timely degradation following cleavage to allow for cell cycle progression and recovery from DNA damage for ensuring cell survival.</p>

        <title>SDE2 negatively regulates PCNA monoubiquitination required for TLS</title>
        <p>Given that SDE2 is regulated by PCNA association and counteracts DNA damage in response to replication stress, we next determined whether SDE2 is involved in regulating the DNA damage tolerance pathway that helps cells deal with replication-blocking DNA lesions. USP1 is responsible for reversible deubiquitination of PCNA-Ub and thereby controls TLS [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Accordingly, deficiency of USP1 leads to elevation of PCNA-Ub levels and disrupts TLS regulation [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed that depletion of SDE2 using multiple independent siRNAs resulted in increased levels of PCNA-Ub in HeLa and U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s008">S7A Fig</xref>). SDE2 knockdown increased the formation of UVC-induced PCNA-Ub in a time- and dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g007">Fig 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s008">S7B Fig</xref>). Conversely, CDT2 knockdown disrupted the turnover of SDE2 and resulted in reduced PCNA-Ub, indicating that increased SDE2 can antagonize the PCNA modification process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s008">S7C Fig</xref>). Importantly, damage-induced PCNA-Ub levels were reverted to normal levels by introduction of siRNA-resistant full-length SDE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). However, expression of GA or the SDE2 domain-deletion mutant failed to decrease PCNA-Ub levels, suggesting that the SDE2 domain of cleaved SDE2 is essential for suppressing PCNA monoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Notably, exogenous expression of HA-tagged C-SDE2 was able to antagonize the elevated PCNA-Ub levels caused by USP1 knockdown and UVC damage, suggesting that activated SDE2 regulates PCNA modification process independently of USP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). Moreover, RAD18 depletion could decrease Î³H2AX levels elevated by SDE2 knockdown besides negating formation of PCNA-Ub following UVC damage, indicating that deregulation of PCNA-Ub levels could be one source of heightened replication-associated DNA damage caused by SDE2 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s008">S7D Fig</xref>).</p>

Deregulation of PCNA monoubiquitination caused by RAD18 or USP1 deficiency leads to impaired cellular survival against UVC damage [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

Collectively, our results implicate for the role of SDE2 in negatively regulating PCNA monoubiquitination, thereby contributing to the fine-tuning of PCNA modification during replication stress.

        <title>SDE2: A new player required for preserving genomic integrity</title>
        <p>In this study, we identify human SDE2 as a new factor required for counteracting replication stress. PCNA-dependent processing of SDE2 generates a functional protein that negatively regulates damage-inducible PCNA monoubiquitination, which in turn needs to be eliminated by proteolysis to allow for S phase progression and replication fork recovery in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Once cleaved, SDE2 may be required for restricting unscheduled PCNA modification before DNA replication or fine-tune monoubiquitination process in the context of replication stress. Accordingly, SDE2 depletion leads to elevated replication-associated DNA damage and impaired cellular survival. By contrast, prolonged accumulation of SDE2, due to a defect in cleavage or degradation, is expected to impede S phase progression, at least partly resulting from disruption of the balanced levels of damage-inducible PCNA ubiquitination. Similar phenotype of the GA and PIP mutants also suggests that aberrant accumulation of unprocessed SDE2 at DNA, presumably at replication forks via its SAP DNA binding domain, impedes cell cycle progression and is harmful to cells. Alternatively, the N-terminal UBL domain, if not properly degraded, may directly compete with TLS polymerases for occupying the surface of PCNA. Indeed, PIP-degron-containing peptides have been shown to impair Pol Î· foci formation [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>

        <p>Sde2 in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> was initially identified in the <italic>sde2</italic><sup>+</sup> (silencing defective 2) strain, which shows defective telomere silencing [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Yeast Sde2 was proposed to mediate the recruitment of SHREC, a histone deacetylase complex, to telomeres, thereby maintaining heterochromatin status. Interestingly, Sde2 lacks the C-terminal SAP domain and S/TQ ATM/ATR phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s002">S1A Fig</xref>), suggesting that higher eukaryotes have evolved additional functions in the DDR and DNA repair. Currently, our mutation analysis argues against the idea that SDE2 exerts auto-DUB activity or functions as a DUB for PNCA-Ub (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s003">S2E Fig</xref>). In addition, USP1, a DUB for PCNA-Ub, does not play a role in cleaving SDE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s009">S8A Fig</xref>). The exact mechanism by which SDE2 regulates PCNA ubiquitination is currently unknown. SDE2 may directly antagonize the activity of signaling proteins or nucleases, whose activity is required for remodeling replication forks and recruiting RAD18 ubiquitin E3 ligase to ssDNA. The SDE2 domain may mediate the interaction with this unknown factor, and loss of its interaction would lead to hyper-activation of RAD18-dependent PCNA monoubiquitination process. Suppression of Î³H2AX foci and PCNA monoubiquitination by co-depletion of MUS81 with SDE2 supports this possibility. Alternatively, SDE2 may function as an enzyme that directly regulates replication stress response. Failure to counteract replication stress may indirectly elevate PCNA monoubiquitination due to extensive ssDNAs or aberrant fork structures. Notably, SDE2 exhibits domain organization and regulatory principles that are similar to Wss1 and its human homolog DVC1 (SPRTN/C1orf124) DNA-protein cross-link proteases known to participate in DNA damage tolerance and replication stress response [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s009">S8B Fig</xref>). DVC1 regulates PCNA monoubiquitination and TLS polymerase extraction from PCNA-Ub [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The SprT-like metallopeptidase domain of DVC1 is associated with counteracting replication stress, premature aging, and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Targeting of Wss1 to DNA lesions requires DNA and SUMO interactions, whereas DVC1 utilizes the interaction with PCNA and ubiquitin via its PIP box and UBZ4 domain [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Their activity is further regulated either by self-cleavage (Wss1) or by proteasomal degradation (DVC1) [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Another Wss1-like protease family, Wlm2, contains an N-terminal UBL upstream of the SprT domain analogous to SDE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s009">S8 Fig</xref>). Although highly speculative, these observations suggest that the SDE2 domain may have uncharacterized catalytic functions to relieve replication stress at stalled replication forks. The exact mechanism by which SDE2 promotes response to replication stress, and how its deregulation impacts genomic integrity and tumorigenesis are important future directions to pursue.</p>

        <title>PCNA-dependent cleavage and degradation of SDE2 by CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup></title>
        <p>Our study identifies a new substrate of the CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> ubiquitin E3 ligase, whose activity is regulated by PCNA that provides a docking site for CDT2. Interestingly, SDE2 cleavage, a prerequisite for degradation, also requires PCNA association, revealing a complex layer of substrate regulation by the PCNA<sup>DNA</sup>-PIP degron-CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> ternary complex. The PIP box in the SDE2-UBL is used not only as a degradation signal but also as a targeting element for cleavage. Coupling of the PIP box to the UBL domain is likely to ensure that only the processed (i.e., functional) form is subjected to degradation in chromatin, coordinated by CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>-mediated proteolysis. Both the N- and C-terminal pieces may be held together by an unknown factor upon cleavage, such that CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> directly polyubiquitinates both fragments. A yet-to-be identified ubiquitin E3 ligase may cooperate with CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> to degrade C-SDE2, and activity of such an enzyme may be activated by the DDR to regulate damage-dependent C-SDE2 degradation. Unlike known CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> substrates, SDE2 does not contain a canonical PIP degron (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006465.s004">S3A Fig</xref>). For a substrate that lacks a TD motif and a B+4 residue in its PIP box, other motif often compensates for these suboptimal elements. For instance, CDT2-dependent degradation of FBH1 that does not have a TD motif in the N-terminal PIP box is compensated by an APIM motif, another PCNA-interacting element identified in the C-terminal FBH1 [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, a distinct motif can increase the regulatory capacity of PCNA-dependent proteolysis by CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>, and other regions of SDE2 such as the SAP domain may cooperate with its suboptimal PIP box for CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup>-dependent SDE2 degradation when degradation of two fragments is coordinated. The requirement of the SAP domain for CDT2 interaction and SDE2 turnover supports this idea. Our data also suggest that additional CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> substrates could be found that do not present the classical PIP degron consensus.</p>
        <p>The mechanism by which PCNA interaction leads to SDE2 cleavage remains unknown. Nearly completed cleavage of exogenously expressed SDE2 indicates that a DUB should be tightly associated to PCNA, and increased local concentration of substrates may aid in the processing of SDE2. PCNA interaction may induce a conformation change of SDE2 that exposes the N-terminal UBL, which is otherwise buried under the rest of SDE2.</p>

        <title>Ubiquitin-like domain: A new class of ubiquitin signaling for regulating protein function</title>
        <p>Processing of SDE2 via a diglycine motif provides a remarkable example of how a cleavable ubiquitin-like structural element is utilized to regulate protein localization, stability and function. The presence of a PIP box in the UBL allows SDE2 to target to replication forks and undergo activation by cleavage. Although not perfectly matched, the C-terminal sequence of the SDE2-UBL, <sub>72</sub>PRLCGG<sub>77</sub>, is analogous to ubiquitin <sub>71</sub>LRLRGG<sub>76</sub>, suggesting that recognition of these residues by a DUB is sufficient to induce cleavage along with additional structural information from a ubiquitin-like fold. DUB(s) responsible for cleaving SDE2 are currently unknown. It would be important to identify such DUB(s) to understand how ubiquitin signaling is coupled to PCNA association to regulate DNA replication and genome stability.</p>
        <p>Although many proteins have integrated UBL domains, the function of these domains remains largely unexplored. Interestingly, structural bioinformatics analysis revealed that UBL domains are frequently found in the USP DUB family, either inside or outside of their catalytic core [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Given the role of conjugated ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers, including SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15, in controlling diverse cellular processes, integrated UBL domains are expected to similarly regulate enzyme activity and substrate specificity [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Indeed, auto-cleavage of USP1 at its diglycine motif leads to USP1 degradation following DNA damage to potentiate PCNA monoubiquitination [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Analogous to UBL, the SUMO-like domain (SLD) of UAF1, the activator of USP1, recruits FANCD2-Ub and PCNA-Ub to USP1 via the interaction between SLD and the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) of FANCI and ELG1, binding partners of FANCD2 and PCNA, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1006465.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The growing list of UDPs, as revealed in this study, underscores the diversity of ubiquitin-like signaling in controlling fundamental cellular functions, including the DDR and DNA repair.</p>

The conserved diglycine motif is marked in a box. <bold>(B)</bold> A sequence alignment of the SDE2 SAP domain with known SAP domains. The SAP domain consists of two bipartite Î±-helices enriched with hydrophobic amino acids (i.e., Leu, Val; indicated with black asterisks), which are separated by an invariant glycine residue (red asterisk). A positively charged amino acid such as lysine (light blue asterisk) is expected to make contact with the backbone of DNA. The alignment was performed using Clustal Omega and presented using Jalview. <bold>(C)</bold> Endogenous SDE2 is processed to release its UBL. To determine the size of full-length and cleaved SDE2, cell lysates expressing C-terminal Flag-tagged SDE2 wild-type or GA mutants were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Flag and anti-SDE2 antibodies. The epitope of SDE2 antibody falls within amino acids 318â410. Only fully processed endogenous SDE2 is detected (compare lanes 1 and 3). * denotes nonspecific bands.</p>

          <title>The elements required for degradation of C-SDE2 (Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</title>
          <p><bold>(A)</bold> Degradation of C-SDE2 is proteasome-dependent. HeLa cells were left untreated or treated with 40 J/m<sup>2</sup> UVC for 4 h, fractionated into cytosolic/nucleoplasmic (S) and chromatin-enriched (P) fractions using CSK buffer, and the endogenous C-SDE2 levels were analyzed by Western blotting. Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 Î¼M MG132 for 4 h before harvest. <bold>(B)</bold> C-SDE2 levels are regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. HeLa cells were synchronized with nocodazole for 12 h and released into fresh medium after mitotic shake-off. Cells were harvested at the indicated times, and endogenous C-SDE2 levels were analyzed by Western blotting. The cell-cycle dependent change of C-SDE2 association in chromatin is quantified by ImageJ and indicated below the blots. <bold>(C, D)</bold> The half-life of C-SDE2 is extended by ÎSAP or GA mutations. (top) HeLa cells expressing full-length SDE2-Flag wild-type or mutants were with 50 Î¼g/mL of CHX, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. (bottom) Quantification of immunoblots by Image J. The dotted line indicates a half-life. <bold>(E)</bold> CDT2 is required for the degradation of C-SDE2 during cell cycle progression. HeLa cells transfected with siRNA control or CDT2 were synchronized with nocodazole and released, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting to check endogenous C-SDE2. <bold>(F)</bold> CDT2 is required for polyubiquitination of C-SDE2. Immunoblots of the <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g003">Fig 3H</xref> were reprobed with anti-SDE2 antibody to check the polyubiquitin conjugates of C-SDE2 in the absence of CDT2. <bold>(G)</bold> Cell cycle profile and BrdU incorporation of siRNA-transfected cells were analyzed by PI staining or 30 min BrdU incubation followed by flow cytometry, respectively. <bold>(H)</bold> siRNA-transfected cells were synchronized by G2/M phase by 100 ng/mL nocodazole, treated with 40 J/m<sup>2</sup> UVC, and released into G1 after mitotic shake-off. Degradation of C-SDE2 in chromatin was analyzed by fractionation and Western blotting. <bold>(I)</bold> Inhibition of CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> activity prevents SDE2 degradation in chromatin following DNA damage. HeLa cells were treated with 1 Î¼M MLN4924 (vs. DMSO) for 24 h, treated with 40 J/m<sup>2</sup> UVC for 4 h, and fractionated for Western blot analysis. <bold>(J)</bold> The Co-IP experiment was performed as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006465.g004">Fig 4E</xref> in the presence of 10 U Benzonase, and the immune complex was analyzed by Western blotting.</p>
