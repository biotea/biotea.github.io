      <abstract>
        <p><bold>Nep1 (Emg1) is a highly conserved nucleolar protein with an essential function in ribosome biogenesis. A mutation in the human Nep1 homolog causes BowenâConradi syndromeâa severe developmental disorder. Structures of Nep1 revealed a dimer with a fold similar to the SPOUT-class of RNA-methyltransferases suggesting that Nep1 acts as a methyltransferase in ribosome biogenesis. The target for this putative methyltransferase activity has not been identified yet. We characterized the RNA-binding specificity of <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> Nep1 by fluorescence- and NMR-spectroscopy as well as by yeast three-hybrid screening. Nep1 binds with high affinity to short RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to nt 910â921 of <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> 16S rRNA through a highly conserved basic surface cleft along the dimer interface. Nep1 only methylates RNAs containing a pseudouridine at a position corresponding to a previously identified hypermodified N1-methyl-N3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) pseudouridine (m1acp3-Î¨) in eukaryotic 18S rRNAs. Analysis of the methylated nucleoside by MALDI-mass spectrometry, HPLC and NMR shows that the methyl group is transferred to the N1 of the pseudouridine. Thus, Nep1 is the first identified example of an N1-specific pseudouridine methyltransferase. This enzymatic activity is also conserved in human Nep1 suggesting that Nep1 is the methyltransferase in the biosynthesis of m1acp3-</bold>Î¨ <bold>in eukaryotic 18S rRNAs.</bold></p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nucleotide modifications are widespread in functionally important classes of cellular RNA molecules including tRNAs, rRNAs and spliceosomal snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Presumably, the modifications are important for the proper folding, the stability and the function of these RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The two most commonly observed modifications in rRNAs are 2â²-<italic>O</italic>-methylations of ribose moieties and the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine but other modifications such as base methylations also exist. Clusters of modified rRNA nucleotides are found in functionally important domains such as rRNA regions associated with the peptidyltransferase center and the decoding center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Numerous dedicated enzymes acting on one or several specific nucleotides are responsible for the introduction of ribose 2â²-<italic>O</italic>-methyl groups and pseudouridines in prokaryotic rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In contrast, in eukaryotes and in archaea most 2â²-<italic>O</italic>-methylations and all pseudouridinylations are catalyzed by small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) consisting of snoRNAs and associated proteins simultaneously with the processing of the 35S rRNA precursor. The snoRNAs act as guides for the snoRNPs to the specific modification sites by virtue of their sequence complementarity with the respective rRNA target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). C/D box snoRNAs in concert with the Nop1 methyltransferase introduce ribose 2â²-O-methylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). H/ACA-box sno-RNAs together with pseudouridine kinase Cbf5 mediate the formation of pseudouridines [for a recent review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>)]. For other modifications, dedicated enzymes are required that modify specific nucleotides of the rRNA without the participation of snoRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Examples include the universally conserved Dim1/Ksga methyltransferase responsible for the N6-dimethylations of A1781 and A1782 in 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and Bud23 catalyzing the N7-methylation of G1575 in 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The Nep1 protein family, also referred to as Emg1, has been described as essential for ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Nep1 homologs are found in all eukaryotic genomes as well as in some archaea. It was demonstrated that the yeast and the human Nep1 proteins are localized in the nucleolus. Pre-rRNA processing of the 18S-rRNA precursor was blocked at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> in temperature sensitive Nep1 mutants at the restrictive temperature indicating that Nep1 plays a role in the biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). A mutation of a highly conserved aspartate to a glycine (D86G) in human Nep1 was shown to be the cause of the BowenâConradi syndromeâa severe developmental disorder resulting in early childhood death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Recent crystal structures of yeast Nep1 (<italic>Sc</italic>Nep1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and Nep1 from the archeon <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> (<italic>Mj</italic>Nep1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) revealed a protein fold unique to members of the so called SPOUT-family of RNA methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Furthermore, bound <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine and <italic>S</italic>-adenosylhomocysteine found in the two Nep1 crystal structures and a putative RNA-binding surface in close spatial proximity to the cofactor are in agreement with a putative RNAâmethyltransferase function for Nep1. So far SPOUT-class RNAâmethyltransferases have been shown to catalyze ribose 2â²-OH, guanine N1, uridine N3 and pseudouridine N3 methylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18â20</xref>). Numerous crystal structures have been reported for members of the SPOUT-family of RNAâmethyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24">21â24</xref>). However, their mode of interaction with their target RNAs has not yet been characterized experimentally with atomic resolution. In some cases, a possible RNA-binding mode could be deduced by modeling studies for SPOUT-family members carrying an additional RNA-binding domain such as ribosomal protein L30e-like domains, OB-fold domains and PUA domains as an extension of the core fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In other cases, bound sulfate ions in crystal structures revealed possible contact points for the phosphate backbone of the target RNA guiding subsequent modeling efforts and mutational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Nep1 contains two insertions with regard to the core fold of the SPOUT-class proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), a large, surface exposed loop and a Î²-Î±-Î² element with an antiparallel orientation of the two Î²-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The irregularly structured surface loop is rich in basic amino acids whereas the Î± -helix of the Î²-Î±-Î² element and its preceding loop contain three highly conserved arginine residues. This is suggestive of a role of the insertion elements in RNA-binding similar to other members of the family.

Right: Secondary structure and sequence of the same fragment of <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> 16S rRNA with the location of the only conserved copy of the RNA consensus motif highlighted in red.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp1189f1"/></fig></p><p>The actual RNA target for the putative methyltransferase activity of Nep1 is not known. However, yeast three-hybrid library screening revealed a 6-nt RNA consensus motif (5â²-C/UUCAAC-3â²) which binds to <italic>Sc</italic>Nep1 <italic>in vivo</italic> when it is presented in the context of hairpin loops or internal bulge structures. This motif occurs at three positions in the yeast 18S rRNA (nt 1566â1571 near helix 47, nt 1190â1195 near helix 35 and nt 349â354 near helix 12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Interestingly, nt 1566â1571 are in proximity to two nucleotides that are modified through methylation (G1572, 2â²-OH methylation and G1575, N7-methylation) whereas nt 1190â1195 include the hypermodified N1-Methyl-N3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) pseudouridine [m1acp3-Î¨ in position 1191 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B)]. The 2â²-OH methylation of G1572 is guided by the snoRNA snr57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). While earlier genetic data suggested a possible involvement of Nep1 in catalyzing the N7-methylation of G1575 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), the Bud23 protein was recently identified as responsible for this reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The biogenesis of the hypermodified m1acp3-Î¨ in position 1191 of 18S rRNA starts by a conventional U to Î¨ conversion mediated by snoRNA snR35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This pseudouridine then becomes N1-methylated in the nucleolus and the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl modification at the N3-nitrogen is probably introduced after the export of the assembled ribosome subunit into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The enzymes responsible for both reactions have not been identified yet.</p><p>Here we show that <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 is capable of recognizing the yeast consensus RNA sequence. In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches allowed us to identify high affinity RNA ligands for <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1. Their sequences include nt 913â918 (corresponding to nt 1190â1195 of yeast 18S rRNA) and proximal sequences of <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Structural insight into the basis of RNA recognition was gained from NMR-spectroscopic investigations of RNA binding to <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 by using chemical shift perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Furthermore, the high affinity RNAs were used as substrates in <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation experiments with <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1. Only when a Î¨ was present in position 914 corresponding to the m1acp3-Î¨ containing position 1191 in yeast 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 was able to catalyze a RNA methylation. By combining HPLC and NMR-spectroscopy the modified nucleotide was identified as N1-methylpseudouridine. Thus, <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 is a sequence specific pseudouridine N1-methyltransferase. The pseudouridine N1-methyltransferase activity is conserved in human Nep1 (<italic>Hs</italic>Nep1). Accordingly, Nep1 is most likely the methyltransferase responsible for the N1-methylation step in the biosynthesis of the hypermodified m1acp3-Î¨ nucleotide conserved in eukaryotic 18S rRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein overexpression and purification</title><p>Full-length <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 (aa1-205) was overexpressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Briefly, after induction with IPTG (250 mg/l) at an OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.8 for 12 h at 24Â°C cells were harvested and resuspended in sonication buffer (25 mM TrisâHCl, pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol).

Comparison of the HPLC-chromatograms for the unmodified RNA 12 and the <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 treated RNA 12 revealed the disappearance of a peak with a retention time of 5.5 min in the <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 treated RNA which can be assigned to Î¨ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and the appearance of a peak with a retention time of 10.4 min not present in the chromatogram of the unmodified oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Under our HPLC conditions commercially obtained N1-methylpseudouridine has a retention time of 10.3 min suggesting that this peak represents N1-methylpseudouridine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

For N1-methylpseudouridine a significant NOE is expected between the N1-methyl group and the H6 of the base whereas this NOE should be absent in N3-methylpseudouridine. This NOE was readily observable in a 2D-<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>1</sup>H-NOESY-spectrum of the isolated modified nucleoside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The chemical shifts of the methyl group and the H6 proton of 3.4 ppm and 7.8 ppm, respectively, correspond to those expected for a methyl group bound to a nitrogen atom and the aromatic H6 proton of a pyrimidine base. In addition, these chemical shifts are similar to those reported under slightly different NMR-conditions for chemically synthesized N1-methylpseudouridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Furthermore, the 1D-<sup>1</sup>H spectra of commercially obtained N1-methylpseudouridine and the isolated modified nucleoside are identical except for a stronger signal of uncharacterized impurities in the latter one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>Thus, <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 selectively methylates RNA-oligonucleotides with sequences resembling the 910â921 region of <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> 16S rRNA but only when they contain a pseudouridine at the position corresponding to nucleotide 914.

To this end RNA-oligonucleotides were designed that corresponded to nucleotides 1245â1255 of human 18S rRNA and contained either a pseudouridine (5â²-GAC<italic>Î¨</italic>CAACACG-3â²) or a uridine at position 1248 (5â²-GAC<italic>U</italic>CAACACG-3â²).

These NMR-signal assignments were transferred to conditions more suitable for NMR-based RNA-binding assays (37Â°C, 25 mM BisâTris, pH 6.0, 150 mM KCl) by carrying out temperature and pH-titrations as well as recording a subset of the standard 3D assignment experiments (data not shown). RNAs 10 and 11 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were used for mapping the RNA-binding site of <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 by chemical shift perturbation experiments due to their high affinity.</p><p><sup>15</sup>N-HSQC-spectra of uniformly <sup>15</sup>N,<sup>2</sup>H-labeled <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 revealed a number of signals losing intensity and novel signals appearing and increasing in intensity upon titration with the 8mer RNA 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). However, many other signals were unaffected by the titration. This indicates the formation of a high-affinity RNAâprotein complex with a dissociation rate which is slow on the NMR-time scale as well as specific binding of the RNA to a defined binding site on <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1. Interestingly, many but not all signals affected by binding of RNA 11 also showed gradual chemical shift changes upon titration with the low affinity RNA 1 containing only the consensus sequence 5â²-UUCAAC-3â² (see above). Quantification of chemical shift changes in the case of slow exchange between the bound and the free state is difficult without a complete reassignment of the NMR-signals for the bound state. Therefore, only signals that disappeared upon RNA binding and had novel peaks appearing at least one line-width apart from the old signal position were considered as indicating proximity of the corresponding amino acid to the RNA-binding site. Due to the large number of signals present this is difficult in the crowded central regions of the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC-spectra. Thus, we used selectively <sup>15</sup>N-lysine and <sup>15</sup>N-arginine labeled Nep1 samples. Although lysine is a very abundant amino acid in <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 (29 lysines), the signals of the lysine amide groups are well dispersed in <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC-spectra of the selectively lysine-labeled protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). The result of the titration of selectively <sup>15</sup>N-lysine-labeled <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 with the RNA 11 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B. Whereas the lysines are rather evenly distributed over the entire surface of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C) only a subset of the signals corresponding to lysines in the vicinity of the bound cofactor or located in the extension elements of the SPOUT-class fold on the same side of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C) is affected by RNA binding. This is in agreement with a site specific RNA-binding event and in contrast to what would be expected in the case of an unspecific electrostatically driven interaction between the positively charged lysine side chains and the negatively charged RNA-backbone. Nep1 contains four highly conserved arginines implicated in RNA binding by mutational studies. Since the signals corresponding to these arginines could not be tracked in the spectra of the uniformly <sup>15</sup>N,<sup>2</sup>H-labeled protein titrations were repeated with selectively <sup>15</sup>N-arginine-labeled <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 and RNA 11. For four of the eight arginine residues strongly shifted or disappearing signals were observed upon addition of the RNA. These four arginines correspond to the four highly conserved arginines R54, R95, R98 and R102 that line a basic groove along the dimer interface in the vicinity of the bound SAH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E).

This surface extends from the vicinity of the bound cofactor along the basic groove at the dimer interface including Î±-helix Î±4 of the Î²âÎ±âÎ² insertion element to the extended irregularly structured surface loop. Thus, the two insertion elements unique for Nep1 when compared to the canonical SPOUT-class core fold are both involved in RNA binding along with amino acids found in the core elements of Nep1. The RNA-binding site appears to be extended along the dimer interface spanning a length of â¼45 Ã. Notably, the RNA-binding site also includes the highly conserved aspartate (D56 in <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1) which is mutated in BowenâConradi syndrome in humans. It forms a salt bridge with and orients the side chain of the similarly conserved R54 which is also affected by RNA binding.</p><p>To define the orientation of the RNA in the binding site we took advantage of the high resolution available in the spectra of the selectively <sup>15</sup>N-lysine and <sup>15</sup>N-arginine-labeled samples. Chemical shift perturbation effects were compared for RNA 11 and RNA 10 which contains an extra C at its 3â²-end. Most signals behaved similarly in titration experiments with either RNA 10 or RNA 11 indicating a very similar binding mode for the two RNAs. However, a subset of signals not or only slightly affected in titrations using RNA 11 showed chemical shift changes upon titration with the 3â²-extended RNA 10. The signals only affected by the presence of RNA 10 correspond to K25 in the selectively <sup>15</sup>N-lysine-labeled sample (data not shown) and R24 and R27 in the <sup>15</sup>N-arginine-labeled samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). All three amino acids are located next to each other in the irregularly structured surface loop and are apparently involved in binding to the extra 3â²-nt of RNA 10.</p><p>Addition of nt 5â² to the position corresponding to nt 1190 in the 18S rRNA only lead to moderate increases in the binding affinity indicating that these nucleotides play only a minor role for RNA binding and might not be specifically recognized by the protein. Accordingly we employed a different technique to map the location of the 5â²-end of the RNA. A version of RNA 10 containing a nitroxyl spin label attached to the base of the 5â²-terminal uridine (equivalent to nt 913 in 16S rRNA) and a uridine instead of the pseudouridine in the adjacent position due to synthetic reasons was synthesized. The nitroxyl spin label is paramagnetic and NMR-signals corresponding to amino acids in close spatial vicinity of the spin label are reduced in intensity due to enhanced relaxation caused by the presence of the unpaired electron in the spin label. Titration of <sup>15</sup>N-lysine labeled <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 with this spin-labeled RNA 10 lead to the disappearance of the signals corresponding to K47, K49, K168, K170 and K188. These amino acids are all located close to the cofactor-binding site. Accordingly, the 5â²-end of RNA 10 must bind in the vicinity of the bound SAH. This immediately places the nucleotide corresponding to the modified nt 914 next to the active site of <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 as expected since this nucleotide is the methyl group acceptor in the reaction. Thus, <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 binds its RNA target along an extended basic surface cleft at the dimer interface that involves both insertions to the SPOUT-class core fold in an orientation consistent with the proposed methylation of nt 914 in <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> 16S rRNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1189/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Structural studies of Nep1 suggested that Nep1 might be a SPOUT-class RNA methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations of the RNA-binding specificity and enzymatic activity of <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 described here demonstrate that <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 is a specific pseudouridine N1-methyltransferase. To our knowledge, <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 is the first enzyme described to have such an activity and extends the known catalytic repertoire of SPOUT-class methyltransferases. The only other pseudouridine modifying methyltransferase identified so far is the bacterial protein and SPOUT-class family member YbeA (RlmH). In contrast to <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1, this enzyme transfers the methyl group to the N3 nitrogen of pseudouridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p><italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 methylates RNA sequences resembling nt 910â921 of <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> 16S rRNA but only when they contain a pseudouridine in position 914. While it is known that the equivalent position contains a hypermodified pseudouridine (m1acp3-Î¨) in yeast and human 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl-uridine in the archeon <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) it is not known whether and how this nucleotide is modified in <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> 16S rRNA. Our results now suggest that <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> 16S rRNA contains an at least N1-methylated pseudouridine at position 914. The pseudouridine N1-methyltransferase activity of Nep1 is conserved in the human enzyme where m1acp3-Î¨ in position 1248 of human 18S rRNA is the only known methylated pseudouridine. Therefore, Nep1 apparently catalyzes the <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine dependent N1-methylation step during the conversion of uridine to N1-methyl-N3-(3-methyl-3-carboxypropyl)-pseudouridine in 18S rRNA.</p><p><italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 binds its substrate RNAs with a surprisingly high affinity which might be detrimental for an enzyme optimized towards substrate turnover. Thus, the high substrate affinity of <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 might be either due to the extreme requirements of the thermophilic environment of its host organism or hint at an additional function of Nep1 besides its methyltransferase activity requiring this high substrate affinity. Such an additional function might be the replacement of the snoRNA required for the introduction of the pseudouridine [snR35 in the case of yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>)] from its substrate. Indeed, genetic experiments in yeast suggest a role for Nep1 in the replacement of snR57 from the 18S rRNA precursor which binds to the second copy of the Nep1-binding RNA consensus motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Alternatively, one can imagine a scenario where Nep1 keeps its RNA target effectively in a single stranded conformation and thereby prevents non-native interactions with other sequence elements during the folding of the 18S rRNA precursor and small ribosomal subunit biogenesis.</p><p>The RNA-binding mode of Nep1 as deduced from our NMR-studies resembles the RNA-binding mode of other SPOUT-class family members with respect to the utilization of extension elements not part of the core fold for RNA interactions. However, the structure of these extensions is unique to Nep1 homologs and does not resemble known RNA-binding domains. Notably, the experimentally mapped RNA-binding surface of <italic>Mj</italic>Nep1 includes the highly conserved amino acid D56. A mutation of the corresponding amino acid D86 in <italic>Hs</italic>Nep1 to a glycine has been recently identified as the cause for BowenâConradi syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Since the aspartate side chain of this residue orients the side chain of an arginine residue also shown to be involved in RNA binding it is conceivable that this mutation leads to a protein with an altered RNA affinity and/or specificity and consequently with an altered methylation activity. Fournier and coworkers recently analyzed the consequences of a knock-out of snR35 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This knock-out prevents the conversion of U1191 to a pseudouridine and consequently the methylation of this nucleotide by Nep1 but not the subsequent addition of the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group to the N3 occuring in the cytosol. They showed that the loss of methylation but not the loss of snoRNA binding in this region results in a reduced overall growth rate and the accumulation of 18S rRNA precursors in yeast. Thus, it is conceivable that an altered methylation activity in the Nep1 mutant might cause imbalances in ribosome biogenesis and thereby contribute to the symptoms of BowenâConradi syndrome.</p><p>In any case, the techniques and results described in this article for the identification and characterization of the enzymatic activity of Nep1 set the stage for detailed investigations of the functional, structural and dynamical consequences of the Nep1 mutation linked to BowenâConradi syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1189/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Aventis Foundation Endowed Professorship (to J.W.); Center for Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance (BMRZ); Cluster of Excellence âMacromolecular complexesâ, Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe-University Frankfurt, and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the SFB 579 âRNA-ligand interactionsâ (to J.W., J.W.E. and K-D.E.).
