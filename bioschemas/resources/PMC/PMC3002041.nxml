        <p>Phosphorylation of the muscle-specific formin splice variant FHOD3 by CK2 regulates its stability, myofibril targeting, and myofibril integrity.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Members of the formin family are important for actin filament nucleation and elongation. We have identified a novel striated muscleâspecific splice variant of the formin FHOD3 that introduces a casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site. The specific targeting of muscle FHOD3 to the myofibrils in cardiomyocytes is abolished in phosphomutants or by the inhibition of CK2. Phosphorylation of muscle FHOD3 also prevents its interaction with p62/sequestosome 1 and its recruitment to autophagosomes. Furthermore, we show that muscle FHOD3 efficiently promotes the polymerization of actin filaments in cardiomyocytes and that the down-regulation of its expression severely affects myofibril integrity. In murine and human cardiomyopathy, we observe reduced FHOD3 expression with a concomitant isoform switch and change of subcellular targeting. Collectively, our data suggest that a muscle-specific isoform of FHOD3 is required for the maintenance of the contractile structures in heart muscle and that its function is regulated by posttranslational modification.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The actin cytoskeleton is involved in a variety of functions from cell adhesion and migration, vesicle transport, and cell division to muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chhabra and Higgs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehler and Gautel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>). Because spontaneous formation of actin filaments happens quite slowly, several actin nucleators have been characterized that enhance this process. The ARP2/3 complex favors the formation of branched actin filaments, whereas members of the formin family promote F-actin assembly at the fast-growing barbed filament end to long unbranched filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>). Formins are characterized by the presence of an FH2 (formin homology 2) domain. Two FH2 domains form a doughnut-shaped dimer that can then processively move along the actin filaments and promote the addition of further actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goode and Eck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paul and Pollard, 2009</xref>). In addition, formins contain an FH1 domain that binds to profilin and probably serves to deliver G-actin, which is recruited for filament polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paul and Pollard, 2009</xref>). Formin family members have been found from man to yeast and show closest homologies in their FH2 domains. Formin homology domainâcontaining proteins (FHODs) are members of a formin subfamily that may also play a role in cell signaling and the regulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Young and Copeland, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>Striated muscle cells are characterized by a particularly regular arrangement of their actin cytoskeleton in the thin filaments of the sarcomeres, where the barbed end is anchored in the Z disc and the pointed end stretches to the middle of the sarcomere toward the M-band region. Thin filament length is strictly controlled by tropomodulin, which caps the pointed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gregorio et al., 1995</xref>). However, the concept that this extremely regular arrangement is totally static is misleading because metabolic labeling experiments have suggested a surprisingly high turnover rate of thin filament proteins, with an average half-life of only 3 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin, 1981</xref>). Myofibrillogenesis has been studied extensively over the years; however, the exact mechanism of thin filament assembly and turnover is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Littlefield and Fowler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sparrow and SchÃ¶ck, 2009</xref>). At the earliest stages of myofibrillogenesis in the developing heart, actin filaments assemble in close proximity to the plasma membrane, and they subsequently detach and stretch throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehler et al., 2004</xref>). Currently, it is unknown whether actin filament nucleation during myofibrillogenesis requires promoting factors and what their nature may be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sparrow and SchÃ¶ck, 2009</xref>). Recently, it could be shown that leiomodin, which is related to the pointed-end capping protein tropomodulin, has strong actin filamentânucleating activity and aids myofibril maintenance in cultured cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chereau et al., 2008</xref>). However, no information is available on leiomodinâs function during the initial stages of myofibril assembly. Based on observations on the actin cytoskeleton in other cell types, the construction of actin filaments may depend on multiple actin assemblyâpromoting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chesarone and Goode, 2009</xref>), and formins have been suggested as good potential candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sparrow and SchÃ¶ck, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>FHOD3, a diaphanous-related formin, is expressed at high levels in the heart, kidney, and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katoh and Katoh, 2004</xref>). Tissue-specific splicing in the N-terminal part results in two isoforms, of which only the larger is found in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanaya et al., 2005</xref>). When cloning full-length FHOD3 from the heart, we identified an additional alternative exon, which leads to the insertion of eight additional amino acids at the C-terminal end of the FH2 domain. Based on its amino acid sequence, we called this additional exon the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon. Inclusion of this exon is specific for striated muscle tissue and adds phosphorylation sites for CK2 (casein kinase 2). Phosphorylation of this site affects subcellular targeting and inhibits the interaction of FHOD3 with p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1), a protein involved in autophagy (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rusten and Stenmark, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrate a role for FHOD3 in actin polymerization and during myofibrillar maintenance in cultured cardiomyocytes, as well as the down-regulation of its expression in cardiomyopathy.</p>

        <title>The <italic>FHOD3</italic> gene contains an additional striated muscleâspecific exon that is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion</title>
        <p>Because FHOD3 is the formin with the highest expression level in the heart, we decided to clone its full-length cDNA from an adult heart library to study its role in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, schematic representation of FHOD3). During this process, we identified a novel alternative exon, which inserts as exon 26 in humans and as exon 25 in mice (available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. HM191478; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201005060/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>, exonâintron structure of the <italic>FHOD3</italic> gene in primates and rodents). This alternative exon is highly conserved between zebrafish and humans and encodes for eight mainly acidic amino acids that insert at the C-terminal end of the FH2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, A [scheme] and B). To avoid confusion caused by the complexity of the <italic>FHOD3</italic> gene organization between different species, we called this exon the âT(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exonâ based on its characteristic sequence.</p>

        <p>Because its high degree of conservation suggested a preserved function, we decided to investigate the role of the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon more closely. The presence of serine or threonine residues flanked by acidic amino acids indicated a potential CK2 consensus sequence motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, in a CK2 in vitro phosphorylation assay, phosphorylation by CK2 was detected only in FHOD3-FH2 domain constructs that contained the alternative exon (FH2L) but not in constructs lacking it (FH2S) or in the FHOD1-FH2 domain. Mutation analysis revealed that the second threonine (T1476) is the main target residue for phosphorylation and that change of both threonines to alanines totally abolishes the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These phosphorylation results could also be confirmed in a cellular environment and were prevented by incubation with the specific CK2 inhibitor DMAT (2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1<italic>H</italic>-benzimidazole; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p>
        <p>A previously identified larger FHOD3 isoform that is caused by N-terminal alternative splicing was reported to be specific for the mouse heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanaya et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore wanted to investigate whether the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon in the FH2 domain of FHOD3 was also spliced in a tissue-specific way. Different murine RNAs (tibialis anterior, soleus, atrium, ventricle, uterus, lung, liver, kidney, and cortex) were tested by RT-PCRs with two sets of primers: the splicing-specific primer set E25-27, with the forward primer located in the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon, and the splicing-independent primer set E24-27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Confirming the results of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanaya et al., 2005</xref>), the strongest expression of the fragment amplified by primer set E24-27 was found in the heart, kidney, and cortex. The decreased electrophoretic mobility with primer set E24-27, caused by the 24 additional bases, as well as the signal obtained with the primer set E25-27, indicated that the expression of the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon is highest in soleus muscle, cardiac ventricles, and atria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). This suggests that the novel FHOD3 isoform containing the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon is specifically expressed in striated muscle, where it is subjected to phosphorylation by CK2, predominantly at T1476.</p>

        <title>The T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon targets FHOD3 to the myofibrils</title>
        <p>To assess the effect of the alternative splicing on biological function, we transiently transfected FHOD3, either containing or lacking the alternative T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon, into neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCs). Interestingly, we observed a drastically changed targeting pattern depending on the presence of the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon. Constructs that contained the alternative T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon localized mainly to the myofibrils, whereas constructs lacking this exon formed mostly cytoplasmic aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p>

            <p><bold>The muscle-specific FHOD3 isoform is targeted to the sarcomere in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion.</bold> (A and B) NRCs were transfected with FHOD3-HA including or lacking the alternative T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon (A) or after mutation of residues T1474 and T1476 to alanine (T&gt;A) or aspartate (T&gt;D; B). After 48 h, cells were fixed and stained with monoclonal rat anti-HA and pRb antiâmyosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). Constructs including the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon targeted to the A band, whereas constructs lacking the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon formed cytoplasmic aggregates. Mutation of the threonine residues to alanine induced the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates as well. No change in localization was seen after mutation of the threonine residues to aspartic acid. (C) Untransfected NRCs were treated with 10 ÂµM of the CK2 inhibitor DMAT for 24 h and then fixed and stained with anti-FHOD3 and antiâÎ±-actinin antibodies. Untreated cells were used as a control. Similar to exogenous FHOD3, endogenous FHOD3 localizes to the A band but forms aggregates when phosphorylation by CK2 is inhibited.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To investigate whether this observed change in subcellular localization is caused by the inclusion of the acidic T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE peptide sequence by itself or whether the phosphorylation of the residues T1474 and T1476 by CK2 is responsible, both threonine residues were mutated to alanine or aspartate to mimic the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated state, respectively. Whereas the phosphomimicry T to D mutant of FHOD3 targeted to the myofibrils, constructs with the T to A mutation were found in cytoplasmic aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Analysis of transfected NRCs by phalloidin staining to visualize F-actin revealed colocalization of all FHOD3 constructs with filamentous actin, which was also found in the aggregates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201005060/DC1">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>). The presence or absence of the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE sequence, as well as its phosphorylation status (as indicated by the phosphomutant constructs), had also no effect on the general ability of transfected FHOD3 to affect actin polymerization in cells (Fig. S2 C). To ensure that these observations are not caused by overexpression of transiently transfected expression constructs, we looked at the localization of endogenous FHOD3 using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (for characterization see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201005060/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Again, FHOD3 was mainly localized at the myofibrils in control NRCs, but a dramatic relocalization to cytoplasmic aggregates was observed after incubation with the CK2 inhibitor DMAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). This suggests that the sarcomeric targeting of FHOD3 constructs containing the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE sequence, as well as of endogenous FHOD3, is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation.</p>

        <title>FHOD3 interacts with p62/SQSTM1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner</title>
        <p>We wanted to establish whether the differential subcellular targeting of FHOD3 constructs could be explained by distinct proteinâprotein interactions. Therefore, we searched for potential novel interaction partners of the FH2 domain by yeast two-hybrid screening of a human heart cDNA library. We identified p62, also referred to as SQSTM1, a protein involved in ubiquitin kinase signaling and proteasomal and autophagic protein degradation (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rusten and Stenmark, 2010</xref>), as a putative interaction partner of an FH2-LexA bait construct. A forced yeast two-hybrid assay revealed a stronger interaction with the shorter FH2 (lacking the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon; FH2S) compared with the longer FH2 (containing the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon; FH2L) construct because binding to the latter was already inhibited in the presence of 0.5 mM 3-AT (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole), whereas the construct lacking the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon was still growing in the presence of 5 mM 3-AT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>).</p>

            <p><bold>FHOD3 interacts with the p62-PB1 domain in a phosphorylation-regulated manner.</bold> (A) Yeast two-hybrid assay to test for the specificity and strength of the p62 interaction with the FHOD3-FH2 domain. p62-pGAD10 was transformed into yeast together with FH2L and FH2S-LexA, as well as with the empty LexA vector as a control, and grown on medium containing 0, 0.5, and 5.0 mM of 3-AT. p62 strongly interacts with FH2S and interacts much more weakly with FH2L. (B) GST pull-down assays to analyze the FHOD3âp62 interaction. Equal amounts of purified FH2L-GST, FH2S-GST, or CK2-phosphorylated FH2L-GST (CK2-P) were incubated with lysates of p62-GFPâtransfected COS-1 cells and subjected to immunoblotting with monoclonal mouse (mM) anti-GFP and, subsequently, polyclonal goat anti-GST. The successful phosphorylation of FH2L-GST was controlled by incubation with monoclonal mouse antiâphospho-threonine (pThr). Although the presence of the unphosphorylated T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon has no effect on the interaction with p62, CK2 phosphorylation of FH2L-GST before the incubation strongly reduces the interaction. Inp, input. (C) Coimmunoprecipitation (IP; CoIP) of full-length FHOD3 and p62. Lysates of COS-1 cells, which were transfected with p62-GFP and FHOD3-HA constructs containing (FHOD3L) or excluding (FHOD3S) the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon, as well as with constructs with residues T1474 and T1476 mutated to alanine (FHOD3A) or aspartic acid (FHOD3D), were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GFP and subsequently anti-HA antibodies. Mutation of the threonine residues to aspartic acid, but not to alanine, greatly reduced the interaction. (D) p62 domain structure and transfection constructs. Domains were constructed according to Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geetha and Wooten (2002)</xref>. ZZ, zinc finger domain (ZZ type). (E) To identify the minimal binding site, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with FHOD3S-HA and p62-GFP constructs containing the PB1 domain, the UBA domain, or the protein without the UBA domain (ÎUBA) as indicated in D. Lysates were treated as described earlier. Binding was found with the ÎUBA and the PB1 domain, indicating that binding of FHOD3 requires presence of the PB1 domain in p62. (F) Cotransfection of NRCs with p62-HA and FHOD3-GFP constructs. Cells were stained with monoclonal rat anti-HA. p62 recruits FHOD3 lacking the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon into aggregates. (G) Transfection of NRCs with FHOD3-GFP constructs and staining with pRb anti-p62 show colocalization of endogenous p62 only with FHOD3 lacking the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon. (H) Visualization of endogenous FHOD3 and p62 by immunofluorescence in NRCs that were treated with DMAT to inhibit CK2 demonstrates colocalization after the redistribution of FHOD3.</p>

        <p>GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed to confirm the interaction of p62 with the FHOD3-FH2 domain and full-length FHOD3 biochemically. Lysates of COS-1 cells that overexpressed p62 were incubated with purified FH2L- or FH2S-GST fusion proteins and FH2L-GST that had been incubated with CK2 before the GST pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) to obtain information about a potential role of the CK2 phosphorylation on the binding to p62. Indeed, although the interaction with p62 was not affected by the insertion of the alternative T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon, it was disrupted by phosphorylation by CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Similarly, the mutation of the threonine residues to aspartic acid inhibited the binding of the full-length FHOD3 construct to p62 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments from COS-1 cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p>
        <p>p62 is composed of an N-terminal Phox and Bem1p domain (PB1), followed by a zinc finger domain, a PEST region, and a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). The PB1 domain is responsible for polymerization and binding to other PB1-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moscat et al., 2006</xref>), whereas the UBA domain binds ubiquitin noncovalently, with a preference for polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seibenhener et al., 2007</xref>). In an attempt to identify the minimal binding site required for FHOD3 interaction, we cloned and tested different p62 deletion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Coimmunoprecipitation assays with lysates from COS-1 cells overexpressing GFP-tagged constructs of the p62-UBA domain (p62-UBAâGFP), the protein without the UBA domain (p62-ÎUBAâGFP), and the PB1 domain (p62-PB1âGFP), as well as HA-tagged FHOD3S, showed that the UBA-GFP construct did not bind but that interaction was detected with the PB1 domain alone and with p62 lacking the UBA domain. This suggests that the FHOD3 binding site resides in the PB1 domain of p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>).</p>
        <p>Upon cotransfection of FHOD3 and p62 into NRCs, a differential FHOD3 distribution was observed, depending on whether FHOD3 contained or lacked the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon. Only in the latter case, a colocalization with HA-tagged p62 to cytoplasmic bodies occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>, bottom). Endogenous p62 was detected in a partially overlapping staining pattern in NRCs transfected with FHOD3 lacking the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>, bottom), whereas no colocalization could be detected with T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exonâcontaining FHOD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>, top). In addition, endogenous FHOD3 that had lost its association with the myofibrils after DMAT treatment colocalized with p62 as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). To confirm the identity of the p62 and FHOD3 complexes as autophagosomes rather than other types of subcellular aggregates, we stained COS-1 cells and NRCs after double transfection with anti-LC3 antibodies. This revealed that the p62- and FHOD3-containing structures are also positive for LC3, which indicates their identity as autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Collectively, our biochemical analysis, colocalization experiments, and treatment of cells using CK2-specific inhibitors suggest that FHOD3 binds to p62 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. CK2 phosphorylation of the muscle-specific T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon in FHOD3 abolishes the interaction of the FH2 domain of FHOD3 with p62 and its location to autophagosomes and results in myofibrillar targeting. These two FHOD3 isoforms appear to have strikingly diverse functions in muscle cells, and their distinct roles are defined by their divergent posttranslational modification, which regulates the interaction with other proteins such as p62. In addition, the isoforms appear to show a different protein stability as analyzed by transfecting COS-1 cells with different FHOD3 constructs and treating them with cycloheximide after 24 h to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. The muscle isoform of FHOD3, as well as the construct that mimics phosphorylation, can still be detected by immunoblotting after 48 h, whereas constructs that can potentially interact with p62 are no longer seen at that time point (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201005060/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>FHOD3 localizes to the Z disc in adult heart tissue</title>
        <p>To investigate the expression and localization of endogenous FHOD3 in tissue, we generated an antibody against its N-terminal 339 amino acids, which are shared between all known isoforms (for characterization see Fig. S3 A). Attempts to create an antibody that would specifically recognize the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon were unsuccessful, presumably because of the low complexity of this sequence.</p>
        <p>Immunostaining of longitudinal sections of mouse left ventricles revealed a cross-striated staining pattern that overlapped with the signal for sarcomeric Î±-actinin (Fig. S3 B). Preabsorption of the FHOD3 antibodies with the antigen abolished this signal. Interestingly, the targeting of FHOD3 seems to be developmental stage specific and/or affected by culture conditions. In freshly isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes (ARCs), the signal was again concentrated at the Z discs with additional diffuse cytoplasmic signal. However, in NRCs in culture, FHOD3 shows a wider striation pattern that partially overlaps with the A band (Fig. S3 B; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, top). Because the same localization pattern is seen with transiently transfected full-length FHOD3 constructs in NRCs, we propose a differentiation stageâspecific targeting and that FHOD3 is mainly associated with the Z disc of the sarcomere in fully mature and healthy heart tissue.</p>

        <title>FHOD3 aids the polymerization of cardiac thin filaments in cyto</title>
        <p>RNAi-mediated knockdown of FHOD3 has been shown to disrupt sarcomeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). We confirmed these observations using a slightly different experimental approach. In our case, the FHOD3-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is transcribed from a vector rather than added directly, and identification of the few transfected NRCs is possible by GFP fluorescence, which is encoded by the same plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukuzawa et al., 2008</xref>). The shRNA constructs were designed to target conserved regions of the rat FH2 domain. Because of the typically low transfection efficiency of NRCs, we performed the initial characterization in COS-1 cells that were cotransfected with knockdown vectors and FHOD3 constructs containing the target sequences. Analysis by immunoblotting showed that only the specific shRNA construct, but not the construct encoding point-mutated shRNA, was able to reduce the expression levels of the FHOD3-GFP fusion protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201005060/DC1">Fig. S5 A</ext-link>). An efficient knockdown was also shown by staining for endogenous FHOD3 in shRNA-transfected NRCs, which indicated 70â90% knockdown after 5 d of transfection (Fig. S5 B).</p>
        <p>To investigate FHOD3 knockdown effects on the cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture, NRCs were transfected with FHOD3-shRNA or the control and incubated for 2, 5, and 8 d. NRCs were subsequently stained for sarcomeric markers (Î±-actinin, F-actin, myosin-binding protein C, and myomesin) to examine potential changes to their sarcomeres and cytoskeleton. Expression of the shRNA for 2 d did not significantly change the localization patterns of the sarcomeric proteins. Interestingly, the FHOD3 levels, as indicated by anti-FHOD3 staining, were also not significantly altered at that time (unpublished data). After 5 d, however, RNA knockdown resulted in shortening of myofibrils, accompanied by a reduction in the number of mature sarcomeres (Fig. S5, C and D). Patches of mature sarcomeres, as indicated by M-band localization of myomesin, were interspersed with stress fiberâlike structures, visualized by alpha-actinin staining. This phenotype may indicate impaired myofibril maintenance rather than defects in sarcomerogenesis and reflects a certain cross talk between thin and thick filaments, i.e., removal of one interferes with the integrity of the other over time in a contracting muscle cell. FHOD3 knockdown for 8 d further aggravated the phenotype in transfected myocytes (Fig. S5, E and F). Therefore, knockdown of FHOD3 expression levels results in a severe myofibrillar phenotype. Our knockdown data suggest that FHOD3 plays an important role for the homeostasis of sarcomeric structures.</p>
        <p>To investigate the importance of FHOD3 for the de novo actin polymerization in cardiomyocytes, we subjected NRCs with increased FHOD3 protein levels (gain of function) or in which endogenous FHOD3 levels were reduced by shRNA (loss of function) to latrunculin B treatment and recovery at different time points. Compared with untransfected controls, NRCs overexpressing FHOD3 display organized sarcomeres and recovered thin filaments already after 30 min, as judged by Î±-actinin and phalloidin staining, indicating that increased FHOD3 levels partially rescue latrunculin Bâinduced actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, bottom). Transfection of NRCs with HA-tagged mDia1, another member of the formin protein family, is less efficient because only comparatively short actin filaments surrounding Z bodies can be detected after 30 min of recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>, bottom). Knockdown of FHOD3 protein levels in NRCs using the FHOD3-specific shRNA construct results in reduced thin filament and myofibrillar recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>). Whereas myofibrils in control cells have fully recovered 2 h after latrunculin B removal, only residual sarcomeric striations were visible in NRCs in which FHOD3 expression was knocked down. Our results suggest that endogenous FHOD3 is required for myofibril maintenance and show for the first time that FHOD3 can aid actin filament polymerization in cardiomyocytes.</p>

        <title>Down-regulation and isoform switch during cardiomyopathy</title>
        <p>The observation that FHOD3 may be of importance for the assembly and maintenance of cardiac myofibrils led us to investigate the role of FHOD3 in cardiomyopathy. We first studied FHOD3 expression levels in heart tissue from muscle LIM protein (MLP) knockout mice, a model for dilated cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arber et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehler et al., 2001</xref>). Analysis of FHOD3 isoforms by RT-PCR revealed a dramatic loss of isoforms containing the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon with a concomitant up-regulation of T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exonâlacking isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). At the protein level, a down-regulation of total FHOD3 expression in MLP knockout compared with wild-type mice was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Investigation of the subcellular localization of FHOD3 by immunofluorescence revealed Z-disc and intercalated-disc staining in wild-type tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). In tissue from MLP knockout mice, these patterns were lost, and only weaker striations could be observed, which tended to overlap with the M-band protein myomesin. Higher magnification analysis revealed, in addition, vesicular staining patterns for FHOD3, which partially colocalized with p62. These results indicate a disease-associated isoform switch from the muscle FHOD3 isoform containing the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon to the isoform lacking the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon. This isoform switch is accompanied by changes to FHOD3 localization from the myofibrils to p62-positive autophagosomes and may account for the reduced FHOD3 protein levels observed in MLP cardiomyocytes.</p>

        <p>To see whether the down-regulation of FHOD3 in the failing heart is a peculiarity of a murine model or can be translated to human pathology, we investigated FHOD3 expression levels in different cardiomyopathy samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Interestingly, down-regulation was observed in all cases of heart disease no matter whether the samples originated from dilated cardiomyopathy or from ischemic heart disease patients. In addition, we stained longitudinal sections of a human left ventricle of an end-stage cardiomyopathy patient, as well as an unaffected control (an organ donor without indications for cardiac disease), with the anti-FHOD3 antibody. FHOD3 was localized to the Z discs and the intercalated discs also in healthy human ventricular cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). In the diseased heart, however, a general down-regulation of anti-FHOD3 staining was observed, whereas the intensity of the Î±-actinin staining remained comparable with the control.</p>
        <p>Collectively, our results suggest that striated muscle expresses a specific splice variant of FHOD3 that introduces CK2 phosphorylation sites at the C-terminal end of its FH2 domain. This posttranslational modification influences both its interaction with p62 and its targeting to the myofibrils. The presence of this isoform is a hallmark of differentiated muscle, and its expression is altered in a mouse model for dilated cardiomyopathy. General knockdown of FHOD3 in NRCs interferes with sarcomere integrity and thin filament organization, suggesting that FHOD3 is crucial for myofibril maintenance. This was confirmed by direct actin polymerization experiments in cardiomyocytes. Observations in failing human hearts suggest that a lack of FHOD3 may also be of relevance in the human setting of cardiomyopathy.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we describe a novel isoform of the formin family member FHOD3, which is specifically expressed in striated muscle. The isoform arises from the inclusion of an additional exon, called the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon, that encodes for eight amino acids at the C-terminal end of the FH2 domain of FHOD3. Inclusion of this exon creates a phosphorylation site for CK2, which in turn regulates the interaction of this FHOD3 isoform with p62/SQSTM1, a protein involved in muscle-specific kinase signaling, proteasomal degradation, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gautel, 2008</xref>). In addition, we show that FHOD3 is important for the maintenance of myofibrils and aids the polymerization of actin filaments in cultured cardiomyocytes and that its expression is down-regulated in murine and human samples of failing hearts. Our results are the first to demonstrate the importance of a formin family member in heart muscle and also to correlate distinct subcellular targeting and binding partner interaction of a formin to a posttranslational modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>, model).</p>

      <p>Different isoforms of FHOD3 showing expression restricted to striated muscle were already described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanaya et al. (2005)</xref>. However, these arise because of differential splicing in the N-terminal half of the protein. The T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon was missed in their work, presumably because a brain library was used for the cloning rather than a heart library as in our case. Although the function of different N-terminal splice variants is presently unclear, our results show the impact of the inclusion of the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon on FHOD3 function, affecting its subcellular localization in muscle cells as well as its interaction with p62. The known major role of the FH2 domain is the nucleation of actin filaments, which requires FH2 dimerization because monomeric FH2 domains inhibit actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shimada et al., 2004</xref>). The FH2 domain is the most conserved domain within the formin family and is therefore used to classify formin family members into different categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higgs, 2005</xref>). From the structural information that is available for the FH2 dimer of a yeast formin, it seems unlikely that the inclusion of the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon would affect dimerization because the main interaction occurs via the N-terminal and central part of the FH2 core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). Our results on efficient stimulation of actin polymerization by FHOD3 in cultured cardiomyocytes suggest that the function of the FH2 domain is not impaired by the insertion of the eight amino acids encoded by the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon. Also, comparison of the ability of the different FHOD3 constructs to stimulate F-actin formation in HeLa cells indicates that neither the presence of the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon nor the phosphorylation status (as indicated by phosphomutants) has an effect. Because recombinant FHOD3-FH2 aggregated in our hands, we have been unable to study potential differences in actin-nucleating activity between the FH2 and FH2-T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE isoforms directly so far.</p>
      <p>Splice variants have also been identified for other members of the formin family, causing differences in their actin polymerization behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wen and Rubenstein, 2009</xref>), their interaction with their activating small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lammers et al., 2008</xref>), and their susceptibility to inhibition by drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gauvin et al., 2009</xref>). The isoform switch from the muscle-specific FHOD3 isoform to the isoform lacking the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE exon in the diseased heart parallels changes that have been observed for many other proteins in the heart, in which embryonic expression patterns are recapitulated during cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarkova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacLellan and Schneider, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, a cardiac-specific knockout of the splicing factor ASF/SF2 results in severe cardiomyopathy, thus further stressing the importance of tissue-specific splicing for the correct function of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ladd et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalsotra et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>The interaction of the T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE-lacking FHOD3 with p62 may be of particular importance to the role of this FHOD3 isoform in cells. p62 is a signaling hub that also interacts with multiple other proteins, such as atypical PKC, TRAF6, Nbr1, and caspase 8, and has therefore been implicated in several cellular functions that comprise NF-ÎºB signaling and cell survival, autophagy, apoptosis, and several myopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gautel, 2008</xref>). Many of the p62/SQSTM1 interactions occur via its PB1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moscat et al., 2007</xref>), which is also the domain that appears to mediate binding to FHOD3. In addition to a potential effect on FHOD3 protein levels, the interaction between nonmuscle FHOD3 and p62 may also be relevant for the process of autophagy by itself. It has been shown that autophagosomes have to fuse with early endosomes for efficient degradation and that interference with this process inhibits autophagy and leads to the accumulation of p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Razi et al., 2009</xref>). Other members of the formin protein family, mDia1 and mDia2, were shown to be important for endosome formation, endosome transport, and phagocytosis in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wallar and Alberts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goode and Eck, 2007</xref>). It was also demonstrated that FNBP1L (formin-binding protein 1âlike) is necessary for autophagy of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huett et al., 2009</xref>). Whether the interaction between FHOD3 and p62 could hint at an involvement of formins such as FHOD3 in autophagy will be interesting to investigate.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that FHOD3 plays a major role in the maintenance of myofibrils in NRCs. This confirms recent observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taniguchi et al. (2009)</xref>, who also reported a disruption of sarcomeric structure after RNAi-mediated knockdown of FHOD3. However, in these knockdown experiments, an effect is already seen after 2 d. The delayed knockdown in our system may potentially be because the shRNA is transcribed from a vector rather than added directly by transfection. The mechanisms of thin filament assembly and maintenance are still under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sparrow and SchÃ¶ck, 2009</xref>). Although it is known that the average half-life of thin filament proteins such as actin and troponin is â¼3â5 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin, 1981</xref>), it is still not entirely clear where in the sarcomere and by which mechanism the exchange could happen in the contracting myocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Littlefield and Fowler, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Littlefield et al. (2001)</xref> have performed elegant experiments that show that actin exchange at the pointed end (toward the M band) is 1.6 times greater than at the barbed end (located in the Z disc), which would be the major candidate for actin incorporation based on actin filament dynamics in fibroblasts. We could show that FHOD3, which is a predicted barbed-end actin filament nucleator based on its analogy with other formins, is located mainly at the Z disc in the mature heart and may thus assist actin turnover or reduce barbed-end depolymerization. Another actin filament nucleator that has recently been identified is leiomodin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chereau et al., 2008</xref>). Leiomodin is related to the pointed-end capping protein tropomodulin but additionally contains a WH2 (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome homology 2) domain, which is a hallmark of actin-nucleating proteins. Knockdown of leiomodin similarly affects sarcomere maintenance in NRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chereau et al., 2008</xref>), which suggests that nucleators at both the pointed end (leiomodin) and the barbed end (FHOD3) may be needed to assemble and maintain functional thin filaments.</p>
      <p>Lastly, our observations on isoform switches and general down-regulation of FHOD3 expression in the human heart suggest its crucial involvement in myofibril maintenance in vivo and not just in cultured cardiomyocytes. There is a certain redundancy in the regulation of actin polymerization, as amply documented for nonmuscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chesarone and Goode, 2009</xref>), because thin filaments do not disappear completely. Nevertheless, other actin assembly factors cannot fully compensate for the down-regulation of FHOD3, or only to a limited extent as, for example, mDia1 in our de novo actin polymerization experiments in NRCs. Therefore, the loss of the adult heart isoform of FHOD3 might contribute to the progress of cardiomyopathies.</p>
