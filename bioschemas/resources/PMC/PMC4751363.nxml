      <abstract>
        <p>A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane metalloprotease that cleaves the extracellular regions from its transmembrane substrates. ADAM10 is essential for embryonic development and is implicated in cancer, Alzheimer, and inflammatory diseases. The tetraspanins are a superfamily of 33 four-transmembrane proteins in mammals, of which the TspanC8 subgroup (Tspan5, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 33) promote ADAM10 intracellular trafficking and enzymatic maturation. However, the interaction between TspanC8s and ADAM10 has only been demonstrated in overexpression systems and the interaction mechanism remains undefined. To address these issues, an antibody was developed to Tspan14, which was used to show co-immunoprecipitation of Tspan14 with ADAM10 in primary human cells. Chimeric Tspan14 constructs demonstrated that the large extracellular loop of Tspan14 mediated its co-immunoprecipitation with ADAM10, and promoted ADAM10 maturation and trafficking to the cell surface. Chimeric ADAM10 constructs showed that membrane-proximal stalk, cysteine-rich, and disintegrin domains of ADAM10 mediated its co-immunoprecipitation with Tspan14 and other TspanC8s. This TspanC8-interacting region was required for ADAM10 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. Truncated ADAM10 constructs revealed differential TspanC8 binding requirements for the stalk, cysteine-rich, and disintegrin domains. Moreover, Tspan15was the only TspanC8 to promote cleavage of the ADAM10 substrate N-cadherin, whereas Tspan14 was unique in reducing cleavage of the platelet collagen receptor GPVI. These findings suggest that ADAM10 may adopt distinct conformations in complex with different TspanC8s, which could impact on substrate selectivity. Furthermore, this study identifies regions of TspanC8s and ADAM10 for potential interaction-disrupting therapeutic targeting.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> are one of the major classes of proteases that regulate transmembrane protein function, turnover and signaling (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). ADAM10, and its most closely related family member ADAM17/TACE, are transmembrane zinc-dependent metalloproteases that contain an extracellular pro-domain, metalloprotease, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich and stalk domain, followed by a transmembrane region and C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. ADAM10 is ubiquitously expressed and has over 40 transmembrane protein substrates, which it cleaves within the extracellular region to release this region from the remaining transmembrane fragment. Important substrates for ADAM10 are the Notch cell fate regulators, as demonstrated by the embryonic lethality of ADAM10<sup>â/â</sup> mice at e9.5, which phenocopies the Notch1<sup>â/â</sup> phenotype (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Other substrates include the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the IgE receptor CD23, EGF receptor ligands betacellulin and EGF, the platelet-activating collagen receptor GPVI, cadherins, and transmembrane chemokines (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). As a result ADAM10 has been implicated as a potential target of modulation in diseases ranging from Alzheimer disease to heart disease and thrombosis to inflammation and cancer (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Yet the regulation of ADAM10 itself and protein interactants that control ADAM10 activation and localization are only beginning to be characterized.</p>
      <p>Three independent groups recently identified the TspanC8 subfamily of tetraspanin proteins as regulators of ADAM10 trafficking and maturation in multiple cell types and species (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">â</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Tetraspanins are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins, with 33 members in mammals, which contain four transmembrane spanning regions with two extracellular loops, one intracellular loop and intracellular N- and C-terminal tails. Tetraspanins interact with specific partner proteins and can form tetraspanin-enriched microdomains via tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions. Tetraspanins regulate important aspects of partner protein function, in particular intracellular trafficking and lateral mobility and clustering at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins consists of Tspan5, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 33 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The TspanC8s promote ADAM10 maturation, which is the process by which the prodomain is cleaved by proprotein convertases during biosynthesis, and are required for ADAM10 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trafficking to the cell surface (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">â</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). There is evidence that different TspanC8s might promote ADAM10 shedding of specific substrates, since Tspan5, Tspan10, and Tspan14 are regulators of ADAM10-dependent Notch signaling, but Tspan15 is not (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This theory is supported by distinct TspanC8 subcellular localizations (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This suggests that future therapeutic targeting to disrupt specific TspanC8-ADAM10 complexes might allow substrate- or cell type-specific ADAM10 targeting, while minimizing the toxic side effects that would result from global ADAM10 inhibition. However, the interacting regions of the TspanC8s and ADAM10 are not known, therefore such an approach cannot yet be undertaken.</p>
      <p>The major aim of this study was to identify the regions of ADAM10 and TspanC8 proteins that are required to mediate their interaction. We identify these as the extracellular region of ADAM10 encompassing the cysteine-rich and stalk regions, and the large extracellular loops (LELs) of the TspanC8s. However, we present evidence that different TspanC8s interact with ADAM10 by distinct mechanisms. Moreover, we show that different TspanC8s can differentially affect cleavage of ADAM10 substrates.</p>

            <p>For Western blotting immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy, primary antibodies were mouse anti-FLAG (M2) and rabbit anti-FLAG (Sigma), rabbit anti-HA (Cell Signaling Technologies (CST)), mouse anti-Myc (9B11) and rabbit anti-Myc (CST), mouse anti-human ADAM10, and goat anti-mouse ADAM10 (R&amp;D Systems), mouse anti-CD9 (C9-BB) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), mouse anti-human N-cadherin (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-GFP (ab290), and mouse anti-human calnexin (AF18) (Abcam). The new goat anti-Tspan14 polyclonal was generated by Everest Biotech against a C-terminal cytoplasmic region of Tspan14 (SDIEAVKAGHH) that is identical between human and mouse.</p>

            <title>Expression Constructs</title>
            <p>N-terminal FLAG-tagged tetraspanin constructs were produced using the pEF6/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal FLAG tag (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and cDNAs were cloned with stop codons to prevent C-terminal Myc-His tagging as described previously (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The human FLAG-tagged Tspan14-CD9 chimera series of constructs were made by a two-step PCR method using overlapping PCR products as the second PCR template (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). For Tspan14, the LEL was amino acids 114â232 and the variable (Var) region 153â221, and for CD9, the LEL region was 112â192 and the Var region 152â181. The C-terminal HA-tagged mouse ADAM10 and ADAM17 in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) have been described previously (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Further chimeras of these constructs were made using the two-step PCR method described above. The ADAM10 disintegrin region consisted of amino acids 458â552, the cysteine-rich region 553â647, and the stalk region 648â673. ADAM17 disintegrin region was defined as amino acids 475â563, the cysteine-rich region 564â642, and the stalk region 643â671. The C-terminal Myc-tagged human ADAM10 in pRK5M was from Addgene (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The truncated human ADAM10 constructs were generated by PCR and cloned into the pDisplay vector, which includes HA- and Myc-tag epitopes (Invitrogen). The human FcRÎ³ and C-terminal GFP-tagged human GPVI constructs were as described (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>

            <p>The human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T (HEK-293 cells expressing the large T-antigen of simian virus 40) and human HeLa epithelial cell lines were cultured in complete DMEM (cDMEM) medium (Sigma) that contains 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco), 4 m<sc>m</sc>
<sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (PAA). Transient transfections in HEK-293T cells were carried out using polyethylenimine (Sigma) as described (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For N-cadherin and GPVI shedding experiments, 10 Î¼<sc>m</sc> DAPT Î³-secretase inhibitor and 10 Î¼<sc>m</sc> GI254023X ADAM10 inhibitor (Sigma) were added 3 h post-transfection. For HeLa cell transfections, 2 Î¼g of plasmid DNA was incubated in 250 Î¼l of OptiMEM (Gibco) while 10 Î¼l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was incubated in 250 Î¼l OptiMEM for 7 min before mixing and incubating for 25 min. The Lipofectamine-DNA mix was added to 4 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> HeLa cells in 1.5 ml of cDMEM for 3 h before replacing the Lipofectamine-DNA mix for cDMEM. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated and cultured as described previously (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), using umbilical cords with consent from the Birmingham Women's Health Care NHS Trust and approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Birmingham.</p>

            <title>Generation of a New Tspan14 Antibody to Show That Tspan14 Interacts with ADAM10 in Primary Endothelial Cells and Platelets</title>
            <p>Previous data from our group and other groups demonstrated that the TspanC8 subfamily of tetraspanins interact with ADAM10 and are important for the maturation and cell surface expression of ADAM10 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">â</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, these studies used co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins that were overexpressed in cell lines. To confirm that a TspanC8 can interact with ADAM10 at endogenous expression levels, we generated a polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of human Tspan14. Tspan14 was chosen as a model TspanC8 because we had previously shown this tetraspanin to regulate ADAM10 in primary endothelial cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The antibody was first validated on FLAG-tagged human Tspan14 expressed in HEK-293T cells. Western blotting of whole cell lysates with the anti-Tspan14 antibody detected bands at 25â30 kDa for the FLAG-Tspan14 but not control transfections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>). This correlated with bands detected by the anti-FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>lower panel</italic>), confirming that the antibody detects Tspan14.</p>

            <p>To test whether Tspan14 interacts with ADAM10 in primary cells, platelets and endothelial cells were chosen because Tspan14 is expressed in these cell types (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Human platelets, mouse platelets, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were lysed in 1% digitonin lysis buffer, which we used previously to demonstrate ADAM10-TspanC8 interactions in transfected cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). ADAM10 or isotype control immunoprecipitates and cell lysate were then Western blotted with antibodies against ADAM10, Tspan14 or CD9, the latter as a non-TspanC8 control tetraspanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>BâD</italic>). For each cell type, the Tspan14 antibody detected bands at 25â30 kDa from the ADAM10 immunoprecipitate, but this was absent from the control immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>BâD</italic>, <italic>top panels</italic>). The 25â30 kDa size range is likely due to differential glycosylation of the single <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation site on Tspan14, as we have shown for another tetraspanin (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Tspan14 was not detected in whole cell lysates, possibly because Tspan14 is expressed at relatively low levels. ADAM10 expression was confirmed in each ADAM10 immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>BâD</italic>, <italic>middle panels</italic>). CD9 was undetectable in ADAM10 immunoprecipitates but was clearly observed in whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>BâD</italic>, <italic>lower panels</italic>), confirming the specificity of the ADAM10-Tspan14 interaction. These data are the first to show an endogenous ADAM10 interaction with a TspanC8 tetraspanin using specific antibodies.</p>

            <title>The Large Extracellular Loop (LEL) of Tspan14 Is Required to Interact with ADAM10</title>
            <p>To determine the region of Tspan14 required for interaction with ADAM10, four FLAG-tagged human Tspan14 and CD9 chimeras were made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>); CD9 was chosen as a representative non-TspanC8 tetraspanin. These chimeras involved exchange of the entire LELs, or exchange of the so-called variable regions of the LEL that are relatively divergent in sequence, since these have been implicated in mediating interactions between other tetraspanins and their partners (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These FLAG-tagged chimeric tetraspanins were then co-expressed with Myc-tagged human ADAM10 in HEK-293T cells. Cells were lysed using 1% digitonin lysis buffer, tetraspanins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies to detect ADAM10 and tetraspanins, respectively. The only chimera that co-immunoprecipitated with ADAM10 comprised of CD9 with the Tspan14 LEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>), and this interaction was significant but with a substantially lower efficiency than wild-type Tspan14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). In addition, this was the only chimera that promoted ADAM10 maturation, as detected by anti-Myc blotting of whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>B</italic>, <italic>middle panel</italic>, and <italic>D</italic>). Similar levels of immunoprecipitation were achieved for each of the chimeras, as detected by anti-FLAG blotting of the immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>, <italic>lower panel</italic>). These data suggest that, in the context of chimeric tetraspanins, the LEL of Tspan14 is necessary and sufficient to interact with ADAM10 and promote its maturation, whereas the variable region of the LEL is also necessary but not sufficient.</p>

            <p>Dornier <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that Tspan14 over-expression is able to increase the surface expression of ADAM10 in the HeLa cell line (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). To investigate whether these CD9-Tspan14 chimeras can increase cell surface expression of endogenous ADAM10 in HeLa cells, each chimera was co-expressed with GFP, to label the transfected cells, and flow cytometry was used to determine surface expression of ADAM10. Consistent with the interaction and maturation data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, only the CD9-Tspan14 LEL chimera and wild-type Tspan14 significantly elevated ADAM10 surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). To confirm that each of these chimeras had access to ADAM10 and were not simply localized to a different subcellular compartment, co-immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was performed in transfected HeLa cells. Some co-localization between each chimera and ADAM10 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), even for those which did not co-immunoprecipitate with ADAM10 or promote its maturation or cell surface expression. Together these data provide evidence that the LEL of Tspan14 mediates the interaction with ADAM10 to promote its maturation and trafficking to the cell surface.</p>

            <title>The Combined Disintegrin, Cysteine-rich, and Stalk Regions of ADAM10 Can Mediate the Interaction with TspanC8s</title>
            <p>Having determined that the LEL region of Tspan14 interacted with ADAM10, we focused on the membrane-proximal extracellular domains of ADAM10, namely the disintegrin (D), cysteine-rich (C), and stalk (S) domains, as the regions potentially involved in Tspan14 binding. Again a chimeric approach was employed, using the ADAM10-related ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). HA-tagged mouse ADAM10-ADAM17 chimeras were co-expressed in HEK-293T cells with or without FLAG tagged mouse Tspan14, the cells lysed in 1% digitonin and subjected to anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. The chimera comprising ADAM17 with the ADAM10 DCS region co-immunoprecipitated with Tspan14, but the chimera of ADAM10 with the ADAM17 DCS region did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). As controls, ADAM10 co-immunoprecipitated with Tspan14 but ADAM17 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). This suggests that the region of ADAM10 encompassing the disintegrin, cysteine-rich, and stalk region is necessary and sufficient to interact with Tspan14. To determine whether any of these regions alone were sufficient for the interaction, further chimeras were generated of ADAM17 containing each of the three individual ADAM10 domains. However, none of these individual ADAM10 extracellular domains enabled interaction with Tspan14 in the ADAM17 backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). It is possible that some of these chimeras might not be folded correctly. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the entire disintegrin, cysteine-rich and stalk region may be important to mediate the ADAM10-Tspan14 interaction.</p>

            <p>As all TspanC8s interact with ADAM10, we sought to examine whether each TspanC8 behaved similarly to Tspan14 by interacting with the region of ADAM10 comprising the disintegrin, cysteine-rich domain and stalk. Each of the FLAG-tagged mouse TspanC8 family members, or CD9 as a control, was expressed in HEK-293T cells with the ADAM17 10DCS chimera. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. All six of the TspanC8 family members significantly interacted with the ADAM17 10DCS chimera, but there were differences in the efficiency of the interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). In particular, the interactions with Tspan10 and 15 were substantially stronger than for other TspanC8s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>). This is in contrast to the similar levels of interaction previously observed for each TspanC8 with wild-type ADAM10 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Tspan5, and to a lesser extent Tspan14 and 17, consistently resulted in higher expression levels of the ADAM17 10DCS chimera in whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). It is possible that these TspanC8s can promote the stability of this chimera. Together these data suggest that different TspanC8s might bind to ADAM10 via subtly different mechanisms, and that this can be revealed by co-immunoprecipitation with the ADAM17 10 DCS chimera.</p>

            <p>To investigate how an inability to interact with TspanC8s impacts ADAM10, the HA-tagged ADAM10 17DCS chimera was transfected into HeLa cells in the presence or absence of FLAG-tagged Tspan14. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed a perinuclear localization for the ADAM10 17DCS chimera, which did not appear to colocalize with Tspan14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). In contrast, wild-type ADAM10 was not restricted to the perinuclear region when co-expressed with Tspan14 and strongly co-localized with Tspan14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). Co-staining with an anti-calnexin antibody, to label the ER (images not shown), revealed that the ADAM10 17DCS chimera was largely ER-restricted in the presence of Tspan14, unlike wild-type ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>).

            <title>The Combined Cysteine-rich and Stalk Regions of ADAM10 Mediate the Interaction with Tspan14</title>
            <p>To further isolate the region of ADAM10 with which Tspan14 interacts, truncations of the human ADAM10 DCS region were expressed using the pDisplay expression vector. This utilizes the murine Ig Îº-chain leader sequence to display the intended protein at the cell surface with HA and Myc tags, fused to the transmembrane domain of platelet derived growth factor receptor. Using transfected HEK-293T cells and anti-FLAG tetraspanin immunoprecipitations as described previously, comparable levels of co-immunoprecipitation were observed for ADAM10 wild-type, DCS or CS truncation constructs with Tspan14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). However, truncation down to just the ADAM10 stalk substantially reduced the ability of Tspan14 co-immunoprecipitate with ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). As controls in each of these experiments, no ADAM10 was detected in immunoprecipitations from CD9 or mock co-transfections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, <italic>AâD</italic>). The increase in Tspan14 molecular weight when co-expressed with ADAM10 CS or S truncation constructs was consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic> and data not shown), and is likely due to differential glycosylation of its single <italic>N</italic>-linked site. Together these data suggest that the minimal extracellular regions of ADAM10 required for substantial binding to Tspan14 are the cysteine-rich domain and stalk.</p>

            <title>The TspanC8 Subfamily Proteins Bind Differentially to the Disintegrin, Cysteine-rich, and Stalk Regions of ADAM10</title>
            <p>To determine whether, like Tspan14, each of the other TspanC8 subfamily members require the ADAM10 cysteine-rich and stalk regions for minimal binding, they were compared with Tspan14 for co-immunoprecipitation with each truncated ADAM10 construct. All TspanC8s co-immunoprecipitated with the ADAM10 DCS truncation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). Similarly, all TspanC8s interacted with the CS truncation of ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). Finally, only Tspan15 interacted substantially with the S truncation representing just the stalk region of ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>). Tspan10, 14, and 17 each interacted weakly but significantly with the stalk region, while Tspan5 and 33 did not interact at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>).</p>

            <p>To enable a direct comparison of TspanC8 interactions with the different ADAM10 truncation mutants, the quantitated data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figs. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> were combined and adjusted to make all values relative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>A</italic>). This analysis mitigated differences in expression between the TspanC8s by directly comparing each TspanC8 with itself, for the different ADAM10 truncations. Tspan15 bound equally to each of the ADAM10 truncations, indicating that the major contact site for Tspan15 is within the ADAM10 stalk region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>A</italic>). For all other TspanC8s, loss of the cysteine-rich region significantly reduced the interaction with ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>A</italic>). Furthermore, the Tspan17 interaction with the stalk and cysteine-rich region was inhibited by the presence of the disintegrin domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>A</italic>). These findings, represented in diagrammatic form in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>B</italic>, suggest that the six TspanC8s have key differences in their mechanisms of interaction with the region of ADAM10 encompassing the disintegrin, cysteine-rich, and stalk regions.</p>

            <title>Differential Effects of TspanC8s on ADAM10 Substrate Cleavage: Tspan15 Promotes Cleavage of N-cadherin and Tspan14 Reduces Cleavage of GPVI</title>
            <p>To assess whether the TspanC8s also have differential effects on cleavage of an endogenous ADAM10 target, the adhesion molecule N-cadherin was selected due to its expression in HEK-293T cells and because it appears to be specifically cleaved by ADAM10 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Cleavage was detected using an antibody to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of N-cadherin, by Western blotting lysates of HEK-293T cells over-expressing one of each of the FLAG-tagged TspanC8s. Tspan15, but not the other TspanC8s, promoted a significant increase in the relative amount of the C-terminal fragment of N-cadherin <italic>versus</italic> full-length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figs. 11</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref><italic>B</italic>). This promotion of N-cadherin cleavage by Tspan15 was likely to be more substantial than indicated by the quantitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>B</italic>), because only â¼50% of cells were transfected in these experiments, as assessed by flow cytometry of co-transfected green fluorescent protein (data not shown). This finding was not a consequence of TspanC8 expression levels, because anti-FLAG Western blotting demonstrated that Tspan15 was not the most highly expressed TspanC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>lower panel</italic>). These data suggest a specific role for Tspan15 in promoting ADAM10 cleavage of N-cadherin.</p>

            <p>To determine whether Tspan15 or other TspanC8s might promote cleavage of an additional substrate, the platelet collagen receptor GPVI was selected as a known substrate of ADAM10 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Since GPVI is not expressed by HEK-293T cells, they were co-transfected with constructs for GPVI with a cytoplasmic GFP tag, the GPVI-associated FcRÎ³ chain and TspanC8s. Anti-GFP Western blotting showed that expression of Tspan14 significantly reduced GPVI cleavage, almost to the same extent as the ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>C</italic>). None of the other TspanC8s significantly altered GPVI cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>D</italic>). Interestingly, Tspan14 is relatively highly expressed in the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and so may protect GPVI from cleavage in this cell lineage. Together with our N-cadherin data and that previously reported for Notch (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), these findings suggest that ADAM10 substrate specificity may be dictated by the TspanC8 with which it is associated.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>TspanC8 tetraspanins were previously shown to interact with ADAM10 in overexpression systems (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In this study, we generated an antibody to Tspan14 as a representative TspanC8, which we used to demonstrate that Tspan14 interacts with ADAM10 endogenously in human and mouse primary cells. To identify the ADAM10-interacting region of Tspan14, we concentrated on the LEL, since this region on other tetraspanins facilitates many characterized tetraspanin-partner protein interactions and is the most divergent region of tetraspanins, making this a likely partner protein binding surface (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">â</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Using chimeras of Tspan14 and CD9, we demonstrated that the LEL of the tetraspanin mediates its interaction with ADAM10. The variable region of this LEL was also critical but not sufficient. The CD9-Tspan14 LEL chimera did not co-immunoprecipitate ADAM10 to the same level or increase cell surface expression as much as wild-type Tspan14. This difference may be due to insufficient stabilization of the LEL of Tspan14 by the small extracellular loop (SEL) of CD9 in the chimera. The SEL of Tspan14 is predicted to be just 19 amino acids compared with 24 amino acids for CD9, with no sequence homology between them, and it has been hypothesized that the SEL interacts with the hydrophobic interface of the LEL N-terminal linker (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Nevertheless, our demonstration that the LEL of Tspan14 was important for its interaction with ADAM10 is analogous to similar data for other tetraspanin-partner protein interactions. The interaction of CD151 with Î±3Î²1 integrins has been extensively studied using a similar chimeric tetraspanin approach, demonstrating that the variable region of the LEL is required for Î±3Î²1 integrin binding, and antibodies that target the LEL also disrupt the interaction (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">â</xref><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Association of another tetraspanin, CD81, with its partner protein CD19 is also mediated by the LEL region (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In addition, CD81 facilitates CD19 surface expression and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), similar to the regulation of ADAM10 maturation and surface expression by the TspanC8s (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">â</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, for CD19 this also requires transmembrane domain 1 of CD81 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). For EWI-2 binding to the related tetraspanins CD9 and CD81, the CD81 LEL and transmembrane domains 3 and 4 are required, but for CD9 the LEL and transmembrane domains 2 and 3 are required (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). A CD82-CD81 LEL chimera is not sufficient for binding to EWI-2 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), yet the LEL of CD9 is able to facilitate binding to EWI-2 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), although it is substantially reduced, similar to that observed for our CD9-Tspan14 LEL chimera binding to ADAM10. It is therefore possible that a chimera containing additional transmembrane regions of Tspan14 may increase binding to wild-type Tspan14 levels.</p>
      <p>Despite over 40 known substrates for ADAM10, very few proteins have been shown to directly interact, biochemically, with ADAM10. The TspanC8s are the only proteins known to alter ADAM10 maturation and intracellular trafficking. Using chimeras of ADAM10 and ADAM17, we have discovered that the membrane-proximal regions of ADAM10, including the stalk, cysteine-rich and disintegrin regions, are required for TspanC8-ADAM10 interaction. To further isolate the interaction region, we used a series of pDisplay constructs with truncation of the extracellular region of ADAM10. Strikingly, the 26 amino acid stalk region of ADAM10 was sufficient for interaction with Tspan15, and this was not increased by inclusion of cysteine-rich and disintegrin domains. Tspan10, Tspan14, and Tspan17 each interacted relatively weakly to the stalk region, while Tspan5 and Tspan33 did not interact at all. Each of these five TspanC8s exhibited substantial interactions with the stalk plus cysteine-rich region of ADAM10. These interactions were not enhanced by the additional inclusion of the disintegrin domain and, for Tspan17, the interaction was partially impaired. These data suggest that different TspanC8s engage ADAM10 in subtly different ways, which may have implications for ADAM10 function. In particular, ADAM10 may have multiple conformations that are stabilized by different TspanC8s. Dornier <italic>et al.</italic> previously demonstrated that ADAM10-mediated activation of a Notch reporter is promoted by Tspan5 and Tspan14 expression, but not by Tspan15 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We have now demonstrated that Tspan15, but not the other TspanC8s, promotes ADAM10-mediated N-cadherin cleavage, and that Tspan14 reduces GPVI cleavage. We propose that different TspanC8s might direct substrate specificity by constraining ADAM10 into defined conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>B</italic>), and that the distinct Tspan15-ADAM10 interaction mechanism may favor cleavage of certain substrates such as N-cadherin, but may prevent cleavage of others such as Notch. An alternative, and currently unexplored, possibility is that TspanC8s could regulate ADAM10 substrate selectivity by directly binding to the substrates.</p>
      <p>We have previously shown Tspan14 to be the most highly expressed TspanC8 in mouse megakaryocytes at the mRNA level (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In the present study, we have used our new Tspan14 antibody to confirm Tspan14 protein expression in mouse and human platelets, and to demonstrate an association with ADAM10 in these cells. The best characterized ADAM10 substrate on platelets is the collagen receptor GPVI, which is emerging as a promising anti-platelet drug target for the treatment of arterial thrombosis (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Interestingly, GPVI can be rapidly shed from the platelet surface following platelet activation, but is protected from ADAM10-mediated cleavage by an undefined mechanism (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Since we have shown that Tspan14 significantly reduces GPVI cleavage in a cell line model, it is possible that Tspan14 functions as the GPVI protector on resting platelets.</p>
      <p>ADAM10 has both disease-promoting and disease-inhibiting activities, depending on the disease. Inhibition of ADAM10 activity could be beneficial for several diseases, in particular cancer, inflammatory diseases, asthma, and skin disorders (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In contrast, promotion of ADAM10 activity on neurons could alleviate Alzheimer disease by preventing the generation of pathogenic Î²-amyloid peptides (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), and on platelets could prevent heart attack and stroke caused by thrombosis, through collagen receptor GPVI shedding (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Our data suggest that a future therapeutic strategy could be to target the LEL of a specific TspanC8 to disrupt its interaction with ADAM10. This could lead to ADAM10 activation, or inactivation, or internalization and degradation, and further research is required to investigate such possibilities. Nevertheless, such a therapeutic approach might modulate ADAM10 activity toward only certain substrates, and without the toxic side effects of targeting ADAM10 on every cell type in the body.</p>
