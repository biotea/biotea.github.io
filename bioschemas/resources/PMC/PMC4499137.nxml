        <p>Efficient pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation on chromatin templates is crucial for the maintenance of genome integrity. However, the regulation of chromatin dynamics during this process has remained elusive. We found that a conserved protein, GRWD1 (glutamate-rich WD40 repeat containing 1), binds to two representative replication origins specifically during G1 phase in a CDC6- and Cdt1-dependent manner, and that depletion of GRWD1 reduces loading of MCM but not CDC6 and Cdt1. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (Seq) revealed significant genome-wide co-localization of GRWD1 with CDC6. We found that GRWD1 has histone-binding activity. To investigate the effect of GRWD1 on chromatin architecture, we used formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE)-seq or FAIRE-quantitative PCR analyses, and the results suggest that GRWD1 regulates chromatin openness at specific chromatin locations. Taken together, these findings suggest that GRWD1 may be a novel histone-binding protein that regulates chromatin dynamics and MCM loading at replication origins.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA replication is of fundamental importance in cells and is strictly regulated to occur precisely once per cell cycle. An essential step in DNA replication is the formation of a pre-replication complex (pre-RC) by the ORC, CDC6, Cdt1 and MCM helicase complexes at a replication origin during the low Cdk period. After activation of the MCM helicase by Cdk, reassembly of the pre-RC is strictly prohibited to prevent rereplication (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In human cells, Cdt1 strongly promotes MCM loading (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and its activity is tightly restricted by multiple mechanisms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Theoretically, loading of two MCM complexes at one replicon would be sufficient for replication. However, it has been demonstrated that excess MCM loading is crucial for maintenance of genome integrity. For example, although cells with depleted MCM replicate at normal rates, they are hypersensitive to replicative stress and defective in Rad17-dependent ATR-mediated replication checkpoint activation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Moreover, a mutation in MCM4 is viable but causes adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Similarly, mice with reduced expression of MCM2 develop normally but their life spans are greatly reduced (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These findings suggest that efficient MCM loading is critical for tolerance of replication stress and activation of the checkpoint.</p><p>The assembly of chromosomal DNA and histones into nucleosomes is the most fundamental step in eukaryotic chromatin structure. The nucleosome structure generally restricts access by various factors that facilitate a variety of DNA-templated processes. Therefore, the deposition, remodeling and eviction of nucleosomes are important for almost all DNA-related operations. In transcription, chromatin-remodeling proteins, histone chaperones and histone-modifying enzymes are thought to synergistically stimulate the reaction. The situation may be similar for efficient pre-RC formation on chromatin. In this regard, it has been reported that HBO1 enhances licensing through its acetylation activity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In addition, we demonstrated that the chromatin remodeler SNF2H promotes MCM loading by binding to Cdt1 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Histone chaperones bind histones and play crucial roles in mediating nucleosome assembly/disassembly (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In the case of pre-RC formation, however, the histone chaperones involved remain elusive.</p><p>We previously identified GRWD1 (glutamate-rich WD40 repeat containing 1) as a novel Cdt1-binding protein (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). GRWD1 is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Rrb1, the budding yeast homolog of GRWD1, is essential for growth, is involved in early ribosome assembly and genetically interacts with Orc6 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In addition, Rrb1 interacts with Yph1, which functions cooperatively with the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) and Mini Chromosome Maintenance (MCM) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, in metazoan cells, the function of GRWD1 is mostly unknown, except for a possible involvement in ribosome biogenesis (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and identification as a candidate substrate-receptor of Cul4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Here, we show that GRWD1 is a histone-binding protein regulating chromatin dynamics and MCM loading.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>ChIP-seq and data analysis</title><p>Preparation of cross-linked chromatin was carried out essentially as described for ChIP-qPCR. However, MNase treatment (New England Biolabs, 500 U/200Î¼l lysate, 37Â°C for 30 min) was added after sonication. The ChIP library was prepared with the Illumina protocol and sequencing analysis was performed using the Genome Analyzer GAIIx (Illumina KK). Sequencing for the MCM7 and HA-GRWD1 ChIP analysis was performed using the HiSeq1500 (Illumina KK). The sequence reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using Bowtie software (version 0.12.8; parameter -v3 -m1). Peak detection and identification of the binding sites were obtained by correcting from Input DNA, using MACS2 broad peak detection. Genomic annotations including transcription start sites (TSSs) and transcription end sites (TESs) were determined using RefSeq. Co-localization analyses of ChIP-Seq data were obtained as described previously (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>To estimate the ChIP-seq signals, we utilized the moving-average method in which the number of mapped reads was calculated every 0.1 kb interval with 1 kb window size. In addition, read numbers of the ChIP samples were normalized using Reads Per Million (RPM) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and further divided by the RPM of the input samples.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>FAIRE</title><p>HeLa cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mM, and the cells were rinsed with cold PBS and harvested. Cells were then lysed with 2% TX-100, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail and sonicated for 18 min (30 s on/60 s off cycles) using a Bioruptor (Diagenode) set at the highest intensity. Samples were centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 10 min at 4Â°C to precipitate cellular debris. For input control samples, prior to phenol-chloroform extractions, the soluble chromatin was treated with proteinase K and incubated for 6 h at 65Â°C to reverse cross-linking. Chromatin samples were then subjected to two consecutive phenol-chloroform extractions. FAIRE chromatin samples recovered in the aqueous layers were then subjected to reversion of cross-linking. Finally, the DNAs were ethanol precipitated. Input and FAIRE DNAs were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by EtBr staining.</p><p>For FAIRE-Seq, the DNAs were subjected to Seq (HiSeq1500, Illumina KK) and data analysis was performed essentially as described above. Read numbers of the FAIRE samples were normalized by subtracting those of the input samples. FAIRE-qPCR was performed on the input and FAIRE DNAs essentially as described for ChIP-qPCR.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="SEC3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="SEC3-1"><title>GRWD1 is present in the nucleus throughout interphase and is a chromatin/nuclear matrix-binding protein</title><p>GRWD1 is composed of 446 amino acids, including a glutamate-rich acidic domain and a WD40 repeat domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A similar acidic domain has been found in many proteins involved in histone binding, and the WD40 repeat domain of GRWD1 has homology with the p48 subunit of CAF1, which can interact with histones (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>GRWD1 is present in the nucleus throughout interphase and is a chromatin/nuclear matrix-binding protein.

(<bold>C</bold>) HeLa cells were allowed to grow asynchronously (AS), treated with hydroxyurea (HU) and then released for 2 h (for early S phase) or 9 h (for late S/G2/M phase), and then subjected to chromatin-binding assays.

W, whole cell extract; S, Triton X-100-extractable soluble fraction; and P, chromatin/nuclear matrix-bound fraction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkv509fig1"/></fig><p>We raised rabbit anti-human GRWD1 antibodies, which recognized a â¼55 kDa band in immunoblots (Supplementary Figure S1A) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and yielded nuclear signals in immunostaining (Supplementary Figure S1B). These signals were diminished when GRWD1 was silenced using siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S1A and B). Interphase nuclear GRWD1 staining was observed both in cyclin A-negative, G1-phase cells and in cyclin A-positive, S-phase and G2-phase cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We also carried out chromatin-binding assays in HeLa cells synchronized in early S phase or late S/G2/M phase as well as in asynchronous cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Cdt1 and ORC1 protein levels decreased during S phases, whereas MCM7 dissociated from chromatin in late S/G2/M phase, as expected (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In all situations tested, about half of the GRWD1 protein was detected in chromatin/nuclear matrix-bound fractions. Thus, GRWD1 is present in nuclei throughout interphase, and is a chromatin/nuclear matrix-bound protein. As shown below, GRWD1 is detached from chromatin in quiescent cells (Supplementary Figure S3D), suggesting that it is involved in cell growth control. We also found that GRWD1 is detached from chromatin at the onset of mitosis and rebinds at telophase when the pre-RC is formed (Supplementary Figure S1D and E).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>GRWD1 physically interacts with CDC6 and Cdt1</title><p>We previously showed that GRWD1 binds to GST-Cdt1 in pull-down assays and can be co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed T7-Cdt1 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Here, we further show that ectopically overexpressed T7-Cdt1 reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous GRWD1 (FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Endogenous CDC6 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous GRWD1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), and <italic>vice versa</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In these assays, coprecipitation of endogenous Cdt1 could not be observed. When overexpressed, the ternary complexes of GRWD1, CDC6 and Cdt1 were detectable (FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In pull-down assays, purified GRWD1 bound directly to purified GST-Cdt1 and GST-CDC6, respectively (FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). C-terminal amino acids 207â446 containing the WD40 repeats, but not the acidic domain, were required for binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>GRWD1 interacts with Cdt1 and CDC6 and binds specifically to replication origins at the <italic>lamin B2</italic> and <italic>MCM4</italic> loci during G1 phase in a CDC6- and Cdt1-dependent manner.

Therefore, recruitment of GRWD1 to origins may be dependent on Cdt1.</p><p>We also investigated the effect of CDC6 depletion in HeLa cells. Depletion of CDC6 and reduction in origin enrichment with anti-CDC6 antibody was confirmed by immunoblotting and ChIP-qPCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>). As is the case for Cdt1 silencing (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), the cell-cycle profile was not remarkably affected by CDC6 silencing at this level (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), probably due to the relatively high basal level of expression in HeLa cells. Similarly, silencing of MCM5 does not inhibit normal replication (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). As expected, MCM7 loading was significantly inhibited by CDC6 silencing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>). GRWD1 binding at origins was also decreased by CDC6 silencing while its binding to the origin-distal regions was not statistically significantly changed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>), suggesting that GRWD1 recruitment might depend on CDC6. However, because Cdt1 loading was inhibited by CDC6 silencing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>), we cannot exclude the possibility that this inhibition is mediated by Cdt1 downregulation. Collectively, these results suggest that GRWD1 is recruited onto replication origins via physical interaction with CDC6 and Cdt1. However, the possibility also remains that GRWD1 is recruited to open chromatin regions passively rather than specifically through its interaction with CDC6 and Cdt1. For example, manipulation of CDC6 or Cdt1 expression could primarily change chromatin openness by affecting HBO1 and SNF2H recruitment, and then such change of chromatin openness might influence GRWD1 recruitment. This issue should be addressed in future.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Silencing of GRWD1 suppresses loading of MCM, but not CDC6 and Cdt1, and perturbs DNA replication while GRWD1 overexpression alleviates MCM loading defect by Cdt1 silencing</title><p>We investigated the role of GRWD1 in MCM loading by siRNA-mediated depletion. Depletion of GRWD1 in asynchronous HeLa cells was confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and Supplementary Figure S3A). It has been reported that GRWD1 might be involved in ribosome biogenesis, and its depletion leads to a 20% reduction in total protein synthesis (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, protein levels of CDC6, Cdt1 and MCM7 were not significantly altered by GRWD1 depletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; see also Supplementary Figure S3D and E). Cell-cycle profile was slightly affected by GRWD1 depletion, with slight increases in G2/M-phase cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and Supplementary Figure S3B). The increase in G2/M-phase cells suggests that GRWD1 might be also involved in mitotic progression.

As expected, enrichment of origins by anti-GRWD1 antibody was reduced by GRWD1 knockdown. CDC6 and Cdt1 binding at origins was not changed. By contrast, MCM7 binding at origins was significantly suppressed. Similar results were observed with a second siRNA targeting GRWD1 (Supplementary Figure S3AâC). The inhibitory effect of GRWD1 silencing on MCM loading was also observed in chromatin-binding assays using T98G cells (Supplementary Figure S3DâG).

HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs, arrested in early S phase by hydroxyurea treatment, and then released. GRWD1 depletion slightly slowed S-phase progression and delayed entry into M phase (FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">E</xref> and Supplementary Figure S3H). Moderate inhibition of DNA replication by GRWD1 depletion was also observed in asynchronous untransformed fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). The relatively moderate effect of GRWD1 depletion on replication might be due to the fact that excess MCM is not necessarily required for normal replication, as mentioned above. Interestingly, GRWD1 depletion moderately activated the ATM DNA-damage checkpoint kinase in cells treated with hydroxyurea and released (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> and Supplementary Figure S3H). Moderate ATM activation was also observed in GRWD1-depleted asynchronous cells without drug treatment (Supplementary Figure S3I). These data suggest its importance in the maintenance of genome integrity. The phenotypes observed by GRWD1 depletion are partly similar to those by MCM5 depletion (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Thus, slowdown of S-phase progression and DNA-damage induction in GRWD1-depleted cells could be attributed, at least in part, to insufficient MCM loading. However, as GRWD1 may also function in other processes (see below), perturbation of these processes would also affect the integrity of chromatin and cell cycle progression.</p><p>As we have shown previously (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and above (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref> and Supplementary Figure S2C and D), Cdt1 depletion leads to decrease in GRWD1 and MCM7 binding at origins.

In metazoan cells, the pre-RC may not form strictly on specific sites due to the low sequence specificity of ORC DNA binding and the redundant and degenerated regulation in determination of pre-RC sites. It is now believed that the pre-RC may be formed with some preferentiality, albeit stochastically, in metazoan chromatin (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>â<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Indeed, in our qPCR assay on the <italic>lamin B2</italic> and <italic>MCM4</italic> loci, the data indicate that the pre-RC may be formed preferentially on âoriginâ regions, but also at lower frequency on the originâdistal regions. Overall, genome wide distribution of preferred pre-RC sites or pre-RC-enriched regions remains elusive in human cells. We addressed this end by performing ChIP-deep sequencing (Seq) with utilizing aggregation plots (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). For quality control of our ChIP-Seq analysis, see also Supplementary Figure S5A, B and D.</p><p>To determine preferred pre-RC sites accurately, we performed ChIP-Seq for both CDC6 and MCM7 using asynchronous HeLa cells (see also Supplementary Figure S6 for visual representation of the ChIP-Seq signal patterns for some representative genomic loci). MACS2 broad peak caller identified â¼458 000 peaks of CDC6 binding (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05) and â¼347 000 peaks of MCM7 binding (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.005) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). For accuracy of our MCM7 mapping, we confirmed that the MCM7 peaks are closely associated with short nascent strand (SNS) peaks, which may represent firing replication origins (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) (Supplementary Figure S5B). We then analyzed the association of CDC6 peaks with MCM7 peaks. In analysis of CDC6 peak distribution relative to MCM7 peak, significant enrichment of the CDC6 peaks was found around MCM7 peaks with a central sharp peak (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This pattern was lost when using the randomized (shuffled) data sets, which contain the same number and length of the corresponding data sets but are randomly located, to estimate correlation by chance, indicating the significance. Even if a stringent overlap criterion of 0.5 kb was used to consider co-localization, approximately â¼27% (â¼123 000 peaks) of total CDC6 peaks were accompanied by MCM7 peaks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). This association was statistically significant when compared with the data obtained with randomized CDC6 peaks (FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Hereafter, we use the term âCDC6_w0.5_MCM7â as representing CDC6 peaks that are accompanied by MCM7 peaks within 0.5 kb and âCDC6_wo0.5_MCM7â as representing the remaining CDC6 peaks that are not accompanied by MCM7 peaks within 0.5 kb. In visual inspection for three genomic regions, <italic>lamin B2, MCM4</italic> and <italic>c-myc</italic> loci, the selected CDC6 peaks (CDC6_w0.5_MCM7) and MCM7 peaks (MCM7_w0.5_CDC6) appeared to be clustered on some specific regions, forming pre-RC-enriched domains including known origins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Given that the size of the human genome is â¼3 Ã 10<sup>9</sup> bp, it can be estimated that the selected CDC6 peaks were distributed with an average interval of â¼25 kb. Note that this does not simply mean that pre-RCs are formed once per â¼25 kb in a single cell. Rather, it would mean that the sites on which pre-RCs potentially can be formed are spaced â¼25 kb apart on average but in each cell, pre-RCs are actually formed on some of these sites stochastically with some preferentiality (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>â<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In the â¼170 kb Epstein-Barr virus genome, 64 pre-RC-enriched zones can be detected with ChIP-microarray analysis (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, median distance between ORC binding sites is estimated to be â¼11 kb (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). On the other hand, it is thought that only a limited number of pre-RCs are fired during a given S phase (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>â<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In general, the number of the selected pre-RC peaks may be consistent with reasonable expectations. Recent genome-wide studies in human, mouse and fly cells reveal that origins often co-localize with TSSs (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).

Since the firing pre-RC sites with GRWD1 (CDC6_w0.5_MCM7_w0.5_sGRWD1_w0.5_SNS) have open chromatin structure (see below), it could be that such open chromatin structure facilitates origin firing by enhancing recruitment of initiation proteins such as CDC45. On the other hand, these data also indicate that GRWD1 is not recruited to all pre-RC sites.

Therefore, we finally characterized the chromatin architecture around pre-RC sites and understand the effect of GRWD1 depletion. We here used FAIRE (formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements), a method of isolating genomic regions with depleted or coarse nucleosomes (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>â<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p>We first confirmed the quality of our FAIRE analysis in several criteria (Supplementary Figure S7AâC).

In a visual inspection of the data, the origin regions of <italic>lamin B2, MCM4</italic> and <italic>c-myc</italic> loci showed prominent positive signals, indicating that these origins are in open chromatin structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). In addition, some candidate firing origins appear to be in open chromatin structure, as well (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). The FAIRE-Seq profiles for some pre-RC sites with GRWD1, including <italic>lamin B2</italic> and <italic>MCM4</italic> origins, appear to be altered by GRWD1 depletion, whereas the others, including <italic>c-myc</italic> origin, appear not to be affected by GRWD1 depletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). We examined the aggregated FAIRE signals around the identified pre-RC sites with or without GRWD1 to know the average statuses. The data clearly indicate that the pre-RC sites with GRWD1 (CDC6_w0.5_MCM7_w0.5_sGRWD1) have more open chromatin structure than the latter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). However, GRWD1 depletion did not obviously change the aggregated FAIRE profile at the pre-RC sites with GRWD1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). As suggested above at some representative origins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), the firing pre-RC sites with GRWD1 might have further open chromatin structure and might be affected more strongly by GRWD1 depletion. We therefore examined the aggregated FAIRE signals around the CDC6_w0.5_MCM7_w0.5_sGRWD1_w0.5_SNS. The data suggest that the openness of chromatin at the firing pre-RC sites with GRWD1 is further increased, which is suppressed by GRWD1 depletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). On average, â¼30% reduction in the FAIRE signals was observed for the firing pre-RC sites with GRWD1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that GRWD1 contributes to maintenance of chromatin openness genome wide. To gain further support for the notion obtained with our ChIP-Seq and FAIRE-Seq analyses, we performed following experiments. Referring to the Seq data, we picked two new candidates of replication origins regulated by GRWD1; i.e. two CDC6_w0.5_MCM7_w0.5_GRWD1_w0.5_SNS sites which may have GRWD1-dependent open chromatin structure. Here, these sites are tentatively termed <italic>PAF1</italic> origin and <italic>LRIG2</italic> origin, respectively (Supplementary Figure S8A). We examined quantitative ChIP signals and FAIRE signals by qPCR at these sites. Like <italic>LMNB2</italic> and <italic>MCM4</italic> origins, the origin sequences were significantly enriched with anti-CDC6, anti-Cdt1, anti-MCM7, anti-MCM3 and anti-GRWD1 antibodies (Supplementary Figure S8B and C). As is the case for <italic>LMNB2</italic> and <italic>MCM4</italic> origins, some enrichment of the origin-distal regions was also observed, but less efficient. Furthermore, silencing of GRWD1 decreased the GRWD1 and MCM ChIP signals, but not CDC6 and Cdt1 signals (Supplementary Figure S8B and C). These data indicate that pre-RCs are formed on these origins in a GRWD1-stimulated manner. We then carried out FAIRE-qPCR assay (Supplementary Figure S8D and E). The data indicate that the origin sites have open chromatin structure and GRWD1 plays a role in maintaining the chromatin openness, like <italic>LMNB2</italic> and <italic>MCM4</italic> origins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we show that GRWD1 is recruited to the <italic>lamin B2</italic> and <italic>MCM4</italic> locus origins, in a CDC6- and Cdt1-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Supplementary Figure S2), and stimulates MCM loading (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Supplementary Figures S3 and S8). Throughout the genome, GRWD1 may co-localize to â¼27% of pre-RC sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In accordance with this, GRWD1 depletion has an influence on replication and genome integrity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Supplementary Figure S3). At this time, it remains unclear how GRWD1 recruitment to specific pre-RCs is dictated. Some chromatin architectures and/or existence of additional factor(s) would affect the selection. Upon pre-RC sites not associated with GRWD1, other proteins might function as cofactors to stimulate MCM loading.</p><p>We found that GRWD1 has histone-binding and histone chaperone-like activities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Supplementary Figure S4). Given the activity and recruitment to certain pre-RCs, it is conceivable that GRWD1 may enhance chromatin accessibility at these sites. Our FAIRE analyses suggest that at least on some, but not all, GRWD1-bound pre-RC sites, including the <italic>lamin B2</italic> and <italic>MCM4</italic> origins, this may be indeed the case (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and Supplementary Figures S7 and S8). At unaffected GRWD1-bound pre-RC sites, other proteins might redundantly function. At the <italic>lamin B2</italic> and <italic>MCM4</italic> origins, changes in total histone H3 levels were not detected upon GRWD1 depletion (Supplementary Figure S7E). Therefore, it is possible that GRWD1, in cooperation with HBO1 and SNF2H, might relax histone-DNA interactions to increase the ratio of nucleosome-free DNA rather than simply evict most histones. Similar findings were observed at rDNA origins in fission yeast, where depletion of Sir2 HDAC may result in open chromatin structure, apparently without changing histone levels and positioning (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>Many co-factors that stimulate pre-RC formation have been reported. Several factors, such as the Myb, c-myc and E2F transcription factors, as well as ORCA, enhance chromatin loading of ORC and/or CDC6 (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>â<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). These factors may stabilize DNA binding of the MCM loaders. Another class of co-factors includes those that are recruited to origins by interaction with ORC, CDC6 and/or Cdt1 to enhance MCM loading. For example, the HBO1 and SNF2H are recruited to origins in a Cdt1-dependent manner (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The execution point of GRWD1 is similar to these two factors, and all of them are recruited to the pre-RC via Cdt1. Therefore, we now favor a model in which these factors function cooperatively. However, it is also possible that each factor acts individually on specific origins. In addition, at this time, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that GRWD1 stimulates MCM loading through other unidentified pathways.</p><p>Our ChIP-Seq analysis gives some insight into the genome-wide regulation of pre-RC sites in human cells. Metazoan ORC does not bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner; therefore, pre-RC binding sites may be determined by the chromatin environment in a redundant and degenerate fashion, as suggested by recent genome-wide studies (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Pre-RCs tend to be formed at open chromatin regions without common sequence motifs. Overall, our data for pre-RC sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) appear to be in line with this notion. Although open chromatin may promote ORC binding, it may not be sufficient, and additional proteins as above and/or specific DNA structures, such as negative supercoiling may also be required. However, it seems unlikely that only a limited number of factors execute functions in ORC and/or pre-RC recruitment. It is possible that suitable factors are selected for pre-RC recruitment in a manner that depends on the local chromatin environment.</p><p>Given that GRWD1 is a histone-binding protein regulating chromatin throughout the genome, it may function also in other DNA transactions. In support of this notion, we have identified several transcription factors and chromatin factors as novel GRWD1 binding proteins (data to be published elsewhere). In addition, GRWD1 is required for maintenance of genome integrity, because its depletion leads to DNA damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Furthermore, we have observed GRWD1 overexpression in cancer cells (Supplementary Figure S1C), also suggesting its importance in promotion of cell growth. Taken together, our findings warrant future in-depth study of GRWD1.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>ChIP-seq and FAIRE-Seq data were deposited with accession codes DRA000924, DRA001271 and DRA002539.</p><sec id="SEC5-1"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkv509/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></sec>
