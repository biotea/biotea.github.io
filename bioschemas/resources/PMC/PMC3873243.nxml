      <abstract>
        <p>Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is responsible for generating the majority of cellular ATP. Complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidoreductase) is the third of five OXPHOS complexes. Complex III assembly relies on the coordinated expression of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, with 10 subunits encoded by nuclear DNA and one by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Complex III deficiency is a debilitating and often fatal disorder that can arise from mutations in complex III subunit genes or one of three known complex III assembly factors. The molecular cause for complex III deficiency in about half of cases, however, is unknown and there are likely many complex III assembly factors yet to be identified. Here, we used Massively Parallel Sequencing to identify a homozygous splicing mutation in the gene encoding Ubiquinol-Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> Reductase Complex Assembly Factor 2 (UQCC2) in a consanguineous Lebanese patient displaying complex III deficiency, severe intrauterine growth retardation, neonatal lactic acidosis and renal tubular dysfunction. We prove causality of the mutation via lentiviral correction studies in patient fibroblasts. Sequence-profile based orthology prediction shows UQCC2 is an ortholog of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> complex III assembly factor, Cbp6p, although its sequence has diverged substantially. Co-purification studies show that UQCC2 interacts with UQCC1, the predicted ortholog of the Cbp6p binding partner, Cbp3p. Fibroblasts from the patient with <italic>UQCC2</italic> mutations have deficiency of UQCC1, while UQCC1-depleted cells have reduced levels of UQCC2 and complex III. We show that UQCC1 binds the newly synthesized mtDNA-encoded cytochrome <italic>b</italic> subunit of complex III and that UQCC2 patient fibroblasts have specific defects in the synthesis or stability of cytochrome <italic>b</italic>. This work reveals a new cause for complex III deficiency that can assist future patient diagnosis, and provides insight into human complex III assembly by establishing that UQCC1 and UQCC2 are complex III assembly factors participating in cytochrome <italic>b</italic> biogenesis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mitochondrial complex III deficiency is a devastating disorder that impairs energy generation, and leads to variable symptoms such as developmental regression, seizures, kidney dysfunction and frequently death. The genetic basis of complex III deficiency is not fully understood, with around half of cases having no known cause. This lack of genetic diagnosis is partly due to an incomplete understanding of the genes required for complex III assembly and function. We have identified two key proteins required for complex III, UQCC1 and UQCC2, and have elucidated the role of these inter-dependent proteins in the biogenesis of cytochrome <italic>b</italic>, the only complex III subunit that is encoded by mitochondrial DNA. We have shown that mutations in <italic>UQCC2</italic> cause human complex III deficiency in a patient with neonatal lactic acidosis and renal tubulopathy. This work contributes to an improved understanding of complex III biogenesis, and will aid future molecular diagnoses of complex III deficiency.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitochondrial disorders of ubiquinol-cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidoreductase (complex III, MIM 124000) represent a significant proportion of patients with OXPHOS dysfunction <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Skladal1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Meunier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Their identification is challenging due to (a) the sheer number of candidate genes, (b) their complicated interplay and (c) an incomplete understanding of complex III assembly. To date, mutations in only eight human genes have been identified as responsible for complex III deficiency. The first mutation was identified in the only mtDNA-encoded subunit of complex III, cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (<italic>MT-CYB</italic>, MIM 516020), in an adult patient with progressive exercise intolerance <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Dumoulin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Patients with <italic>MT-CYB</italic> mutations have since been reported with a range of phenotypes and symptoms including Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS, MIM 540000), mitochondrial myopathy, cardiomyopathy and multisystem failure <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Meunier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. While mtDNA mutations are the most common identified cause of complex III deficiency, mutations in nuclear genes can also be causative. Mutations have been reported in four nuclear genes encoding complex III subunits; the supernumerary subunits UQCRB (MIM 191330) <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Haut1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and UQCRQ (MIM 612080) <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Barel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and more recently the core subunit UQCRC2 (MIM 191329) <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Miyake1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and the catalytic subunit CYC1 (MIM 123980) <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Gaignard1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

        <p>We studied a consanguineous Lebanese patient presenting with severe intrauterine growth retardation, neonatal lactic acidosis and renal tubular dysfunction. Spectrophotometric enzyme assays revealed a severe complex III deficiency with residual activity of only 9% in skeletal muscle and 5% in skin fibroblasts when normalized to citrate synthase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Complex I activity was reduced to 29% and 37% and complex IV activity was reduced to 51% and 53% in muscle and fibroblasts respectively, whereas complex II activity was normal. Secondary deficiency in complex I and complex IV have been described in patients with primary complex III deficiency previously <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Lamantea1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004034-Diaz1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In our own experience, skeletal muscle from 4 previous patients with pathogenic mutations in genes encoding complex III subunits or assembly factors (<italic>CYC1</italic>, <italic>UQCRC2</italic>, and two <italic>BCS1L</italic>) had residual activities for complexes I, II, III and IV of 54Â±17, 117Â±17, 16Â±6 and 55Â±13 (expressed as % of control mean relative to citrate synthase; mean Â± S.E.M.). Given the severity of the complex III defect in regard to the activities of complexes I and IV, we thus regarded the patient as having a primary complex III defect. In order to uncover the molecular basis for the complex III defect, we performed âMitoExomeâ sequencing, involving the targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of the mtDNA and â¼1000 nuclear genes predicted to encode the entire mitochondrial proteome <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Calvo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This approach identified 829 single nucleotide variants or small insertion/deletions in the patient, which were analyzed to select the disease gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Three genes, <italic>TYMP</italic>, <italic>MTCH1</italic> and <italic>UQCC2</italic>, harbored rare (allele frequency &lt;0.005 in dbSNP version 132 <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Sherry1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and the 1000 genomes project release 20100804 <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Durbin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>) homozygous or compound heterozygous variants that were predicted to potentially impact protein function. Although <italic>TYMP</italic> is a known OXPHOS âdisease geneâ, the clinical and biochemical presentation of the patient, plus the consanguinity, suggested that the rare compound heterozygous <italic>TYMP</italic> mutations (c.242G&gt;A, c.148A&gt;C) were not causal. Patients with <italic>TYMP</italic> mutations typically present with combined OXPHOS deficiency associated with mtDNA deletions/depletion rather than a primary complex III deficiency, and have mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE, MIM 603041) as opposed to the primary lactic acidosis and renal tubulopathy observed in our patient <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Hirano1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Although the homozygous c.170C&gt;T mutation in the pro-apoptotic <italic>MTCH1</italic> was not reported in dbSNP version 132 <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Sherry1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> or the 1000 genomes project release 20100804 <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Durbin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, it was detected with a minor allele frequency of 0.005526 in the Exome Variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link> March 2013), suggesting it is likely to be too common to cause a rare mitochondrial disorder. Computational analyses suggested that the third candidate, <italic>UQCC2</italic> (previously called <italic>MNF1</italic>, <italic>M19</italic> or <italic>C6orf125</italic>) was likely causal based on 1) its orthology to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> complex III assembly factor Cbp6p, and 2) its co-expression with complex III subunits (see below). Further analyses indicated a wider conservation of complex III assembly factors, as the interaction partner of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Cbp6p, Cbp3p, also had a mammalian homolog, UQCC1 (previously called UQCC), which was co-expressed with <italic>UQCC2</italic> and similarly co-expressed with complex III subunit genes. The homozygous c.214-3C&gt;G <italic>UQCC2</italic> (NM_032340) mutation fell within a 30.7 Mb long contiguous stretch of homozygosity (LCSH) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004034.s001">Figure S1</xref>), consistent with both alleles being inherited from a common ancestor. The mutation was verified via Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and was not reported in dbSNP version 132 <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Sherry1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the 1000 genomes project release 20100804 <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Durbin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> or the Exome Variant Server. To investigate whether the c.214-3C&gt;G mutation might be a common variant found within the Lebanese population, a Sequenom assay was developed to genotype 86 Lebanese controls. The c.214-3C&gt;G variant was not detected, suggesting it is rare in the ethnically-matched population. To see if this gene might be the cause of complex III deficiency in other patients, we sequenced the coding regions of <italic>UQCC2</italic> in 11 patients with confirmed complex III deficiency who lacked a molecular diagnosis. No potentially pathogenic changes were identified.</p>

        <p>The c.214-3C&gt;G <italic>UQCC2</italic> mutation is found 3 bases upstream of exon 3. The third base upstream of exons generally has only moderate conservation, usually being a cytosine or a thymine and never a guanine <xref rid="pgen.1004034-McManus1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

To investigate whether the c.214-3C&gt;G mutation causes a splicing defect, Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed using RNA extracted from patient fibroblasts. Sequencing revealed aberrant mRNA splicing in the patient, with two major mRNA splice variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), both of which were generated by the use of cryptic acceptor sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g002">Figure 2BâC</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004034.s009">Text S1</xref>).

        <title>UQCC1 and UQCC2 are putative complex III assembly factors</title>
        <p>Human UQCC2 was previously postulated to have a role in mtDNA maintenance and was found to associate with mitochondrial nucleoids <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Sumitani1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, however, PicoGreen staining indicated mitochondrial nucleoids were not disturbed in patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004034.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).

Iterative orthology prediction using the Ortho-Profile method <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Szklarczyk1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> revealed that the <italic>UQCC2</italic> gene is an ortholog of the <italic>S. cerevisiae CBP6</italic> gene that is required for complex III assembly <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Dieckmann1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We used the Ortho-Profile method to investigate whether there was wider conservation of complex III assembly factors and found that Cbp3p, which cooperates with Cbp6p in complex III assembly, also has a predicted human ortholog, UQCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Both orthologous groups have diverged significantly among eukaryotes with UQCC2/Cbp6p having an overall low amino acid conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), while only the C-terminus of UQCC1/Cbp3p is conserved (human residues 135â279) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The N-terminal regions of UQCC1/Cbp3p proteins (residues 1â134 in human and 1â144 in yeast) are highly divergent in both metazoa and fungi, with homologous sequences recognizable only in closely related species (vertebrates for the N-terminal fragment of UQCC1 and the Saccharomyceta clade for Cbp3p). Interestingly, the amino acids from positions 12 to 96 have been shown to be relatively dispensable for Cbp3p function, explaining the lack of sequence conservation <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. To support the association of UQCC1 and UQCC2 proteins with complex III in mammals, we investigated the co-expression of the genes with complex III subunit genes in 91 mouse tissues and cell types. <italic>UQCC1</italic> and <italic>UQCC2</italic> genes co-express highly with each other at the mRNA level (Pearson correlation 0.636).

Both genes are conserved in amoebozoa indicating their ancient evolutionary origin, preceding the divergence of human and fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). UQCC1 is additionally conserved in distantly related eukaryotes that contain mitochondria, including the stramenopile <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>.

To assess complex III restoration, western blotting for the complex III subunit UQCRFS1 was performed as this subunit was clearly degraded in patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

We also transfected HEK293 cells with an siRNA targeting <italic>UQCC2</italic> that resulted in a 40% knockdown of the UQCC2 protein and 60% reduction in UQCC1 protein, supporting the requirement of UQCC2 for UQCC1 stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004034.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). In contrast to patient fibroblasts, no obvious defect in complex III subunit levels was observed in cells with <italic>UQCC2</italic> knockdown. This is likely a consequence of the less severe UQCC2 deficiency achieved in knockdown experiments, with 60% residual protein compared to no detectable protein in patient fibroblasts.</p>

Although UQCC2 stability appears to depend on UQCC1, we did not observe that over-expression of either UQCC2-TAP or UQCC1-TAP led to an increase of UQCC1 or UQCC2 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g006">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we report the first case of complex III deficiency due to <italic>UQCC2</italic> mutations. MitoExome MPS identified 3 genes with potentially pathogenic recessive-type variants, of which <italic>UQCC2</italic> was strongly linked to complex III by evolutionary and computational analyses. We demonstrated a <italic>UQCC2</italic> splicing defect resulting in a lack of UQCC2 protein and verified that this gene was causal by restoring complex III protein and activity levels in patient fibroblasts with lentiviral transduction of <italic>UQCC2</italic>. This patient was a singleton from a consanguineous family, and would have been slower to solve using only traditional methods such as homozygosity mapping, which identified 1894 candidate genes in regions of LCSH, at least 86 of which have a putative role in the mitochondria <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Pagliarini1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. MitoExome sequencing has already shown promise for the molecular diagnosis of patients with mitochondrial disease <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Calvo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and is likely to aid diagnoses in years to come.</p>
      <p>Patients with complex III deficiency present with great clinical heterogeneity. Symptoms typically provide little insight into the underlying genetic cause. Our patient shared some of the clinical features of previously reported complex III deficient patients such as tubulopathy and primary lactic acidosis with <italic>BCS1L</italic> patients <xref rid="pgen.1004034-deLonlay1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> but only identification of other pathogenic <italic>UQCC2</italic> mutations in unrelated individuals will provide a complete picture of the clinical spectrum of patients with UQCC2 dysfunction.</p>
      <p>Complex III deficiencies are commonly accompanied by a reduction in complex I and sometimes complex IV activity <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Lamantea1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004034-Bruno1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We also observed reduced presence and activity of complex I in muscle and fibroblasts from P<sup>UQCC2</sup>, which prompted us to provide additional evidence that both UQCC1 and UQCC2 are in fact assembly factors specific to complex III. One type of evidence comes from the analysis of the presence-absence patterns of the two genes among sequenced genomes. The presence and function of <italic>CBP3</italic> and <italic>CBP6</italic> and their orthologs in fungi that encode complex III but have lost complex I (<italic>S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>) substantiate their role in complex III biogenesis. Conversely, orthologs of these assembly factors are absent in <italic>B. hominis</italic>, a species that has lost complexes IIIâV but still encodes complexes I and II. A relative of <italic>B. hominis</italic>, <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>, which encodes complex III also encodes an ortholog of Cbp3p/UQCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Coevolution of orthologs of UQCC1 and UQCC2 with complex III and not with complex I indicates that these assembly proteins function primarily in the assembly of complex III.</p>
      <p>We elucidated the role of UQCC2, in cooperation with UQCC1, in human cytochrome <italic>b</italic> biogenesis and subsequent complex III assembly and function. No direct link between these proteins and human complex III has previously been described. Previous studies of human UQCC2 suggested that the protein localizes to mitochondrial nucleoids <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Sumitani1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and that it modulates respiratory chain activity in skeletal muscle and pancreatic cells <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Cambier1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, we found no disturbance of mitochondrial nucleoids or mtDNA copy number in patient fibroblasts. Previous studies of human UQCC1 have all focused on variation at this locus being associated with human height <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Soranzo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004034-Sanna1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Our data suggest that UQCC1 and UQCC2 are interacting and interdependent proteins, with the stability of UQCC2 depending on UQCC1, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. We also show that UQCC1 plays an important role in early complex III biogenesis via interaction with newly synthesized cytochrome <italic>b</italic> and recruitment of this mtDNA-encoded subunit into a complex III assembly intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

          <title>Proposed model of CIII assembly.</title>
          <p>Complex III assembly begins with the translation activation and/or stabilization of cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (MTCYB) by UQCC1:UQCC2, which then delivers MTCYB to an assembly intermediate containing UQCRQ and UQCRB. This module combines with a module containing CYC1, UQCRH and UQCR10 and a module containing UQCRC2 and UQCRC1. The resulting subcomplex then dimerizes. UQCRFS1 is bound and stabilized by the CIII assembly factor LYRM7, before being incorporated into CIII with the aid of the assembly factor, BCS1L. Finally UQCR11 is added, forming the complete CIII<sub>2</sub>. Assembly factors are indicated in gray. Proteins in which mutations are associated with complex III deficiency are bordered in red. The role of TTC19 is yet to be elucidated, although it is likely to be involved in early complex III assembly.

      </fig>
      <p>The direct effect of UQCC1 and UQCC2 dysfunction is an immediate lack of cytochrome <italic>b</italic> leading to disruption of the downstream complex III assembly process. Mutations in <italic>UQCC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and UQCC1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g007">Figure 7</xref>) both lead to reduced levels of the complex III subunits UQCRFS1, UQCRC1 and UQCRC2. A subcomplex containing UQCRC1 but not UQCRFS1 accumulates upon <italic>UQCC1</italic> knockdown, consistent with a defect early in CIII assembly before incorporation of the UQCRFS1 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g009">Figure 9</xref>). The role of UQCC1:UQCC2 in the initial stages of complex III assembly is further supported by the UQCC1 binding to newly synthesized cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g008">Figure 8C</xref>), although we have not shown that UQCC1 and UQCC2 bind to cytochrome <italic>b</italic> together.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Cbp3p and Cbp6p have been shown to provide a feedback loop modulating cytochrome <italic>b</italic> expression in response to complex III assembly <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Gruschke2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Cbp6p and Cbp3p, bind to <italic>MT-CYB</italic> mRNA to activate its translation and then deliver newly-synthesized cytochrome <italic>b</italic> to a complex III assembly intermediate. When early complex III assembly is disrupted, cytochrome <italic>b</italic> cannot be deposited by the Cbp3p:Cbp6p complex and so these factors remain bound to the cytochrome <italic>b</italic> protein. While bound in an assembly intermediate, the Cbp3p:Cbp6p complex is unable to activate further cytochrome <italic>b</italic> translation, thus modulating cytochrome <italic>b</italic> synthesis in response to complex III assembly. Such coordination between mtDNA translation and nuclear gene expression prevents the build-up of mtDNA-encoded proteins in the absence of functional complexes. It will be interesting to investigate whether UQCC1 and UQCC2 provide a similar feedback loop between cytochrome <italic>b</italic> translation and complex III assembly in mammalian mitochondria.</p>
      <p>The role of UQCC1 and UQCC2 in cytochrome <italic>b</italic> expression like their <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> orthologs Cbp3p and Cbp6p, is supported by the fact that no cytochrome <italic>b</italic> synthesis is detected in P<sup>UQCC2</sup> via a mitochondrial translation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Furthermore, mitochondrial translation is a prerequisite for the stability and function of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004034-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). The previously reported co-localization of UQCC2 with mitochondrial nucleoids would be consistent with a role in mitochondrial translation, as factors required for mitochondrial protein synthesis, such as ATAD3 and PHB, are often found to associate with mitochondrial nucleoids <xref rid="pgen.1004034-He1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Nevertheless, whether UQCC1 and UQCC2 are directly required for translation activation of <italic>MT-CYB</italic> remains to be established, specifically because the 5â² UTRs of mitochondrial mRNAs to which translational activators in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> bind are absent from human mitochondrial mRNAs. Furthermore, in the fungus <italic>S. pombe</italic> the function of the Cbp6p ortholog appears to be only post-translational <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Kuhl1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. One can speculate that the lack of sequence conservation of the N-terminus of the Cbp3p orthologs, even among fungi, could explain the lack of conservation of translation activation. Nevertheless, there is currently no information about which region of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Cbp3p is required for translation activation and the N-terminus of Cbp3p appears to be relatively dispensable for its function, even in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> itself <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. To date, only one putative human mitochondrial translational activator, TACO1, which is required for the translational activation of the COX1 subunit of complex IV, has been described <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Weraarpachai1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, here we have used MitoExome MPS in combination with computational and experimental analyses to identify the first case of complex III deficiency due to <italic>UQCC2</italic> mutation. We demonstrate that UQCC2 and its binding partner UQCC1 are required for early complex III assembly by mediating the synthesis, stability and/or assembly of the mtDNA-encoded complex III subunit, cytochrome <italic>b</italic>.</p>

        <title>Patient clinical summary</title>
        <p>The proband was the first child of first cousin Lebanese parents and was patient P12 in <xref rid="pgen.1004034-Calvo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The pregnancy was complicated by intrauterine growth retardation, and he was born at 36 weeks gestation by emergency caesarean section because of placental compromise. Birth weight was 1280 gm, length 41 cm and head circumference 29 cm. He had good Apgar scores (9 and 9 at one and five minutes respectively), but by 12 hours of age he became lethargic and had loose stools. He was found to have severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.16, lactate 9.6 mmol/L; normal range 0.7â2.0), and CSF lactate at around that time was 3.8 mmol/L (normal &lt;2.0). His blood electrolytes suggested he had a proximal renal tubular acidosis. His condition improved with rehydration and bicarbonate supplementation, but blood lactate remained high (5â14 mmol/L) even when well. In addition, he was mildly dysmorphic with synophrys, epicanthic folds, upward slanting palpebral fissures, a depressed nasal bridge and flattened nose, and had a unilateral undescended testis. He also had unilateral postaxial polydactyly, the skin tag being removed in the newborn period. His father had a similar facial appearance and had a history of a cleft palate. Seizures were effectively treated with phenobarbitone for 6 months, after which it was ceased. A CT and MRI scan of the brain revealed no abnormality. A vitamin cocktail including riboflavin, thiamine, vitamin C, biotin and coenzyme Q did not appear to have an effect on his blood lactate levels or clinical condition.</p>
        <p>He developed acute gastroenteritis at 5 months of age, at which time severe metabolic acidosis again developed, which again resolved with rehydration. Afebrile seizures recurred at two years of age, and were treated with sodium valproate and later with lamotrigine. EEG was normal at this time.</p>
        <p>Developmental milestones were delayed: he sat unaided at six months, crawled at 10 months, could cruise around furniture at 13 months, walked unaided at 15 months, but still had no formal speech by 2 years 3 months. By that age he could walk unaided, but frequently fell. Stamina was normal. Formal neuropsychological review at two years nine months revealed severe delay in fine motor and visuo-spatial performance, self-care skills and social play, with gross motor skills being only mildly impaired. There were no concerns with vision, but he had a mild sensorineural hearing impairment. Despite speech therapy, at six years of age he still had only several words in Arabic but no meaningful speech.</p>
        <p>He went on to develop a number of autistic features, including impulsivity, limited eye contact, extreme hyperactivity, aggressive behaviour, night time roaming, and continued to have no real expressive language, although he was felt to have reasonable receptive language. He required two minders at school because of concerns of his lack of regard for his physical safety. Ritalin caused him to become even more agitated, whereas clonidine appeared to be of some benefit. He was lost to follow up at nine years of age.</p>

Cyclophilin B and mock transfected cells were used as control. Loss of UQCC1 results in depletion of UQCC2 and reduced levels of UQCRC2 protein levels. Subunit levels of other OXPHOS-complexes: NDUFB8 (complex I), SDHB (complex II), COX2 (complex IV) and ATP5Î± (complex V) are not affected by UQCC1 knock-down. Antibodies used are indicated at the left. (B) Quantification of the immunoreactive bands is shown at the right.</p>
