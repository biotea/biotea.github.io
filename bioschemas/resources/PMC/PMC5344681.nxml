        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) regulates important patho-physiological processes through its attachment to different amino acids in proteins. Recently, by precision mapping on all possible amino acid residues, we identified histone serine ADPr marks in the DNA damage response. However, the biochemical basis underlying this serine modification remained unknown. Here we report that serine ADPr is strictly dependent on histone PARylation factor 1 (HPF1), a recently identified regulator of PARP-1. Quantitative proteomics revealed that serine ADPr does not occur in cells lacking HPF1. Moreover, adding HPF1 to inÂ vitro PARP-1/PARP-2 reactions is necessary and sufficient for serine-specific ADPr of histones and PARP-1 itself. Three endogenous serine ADPr sites are located on the PARP-1 automodification domain. Further identification of serine ADPr on HMG proteins and hundreds of other targets indicates that serine ADPr is a widespread modification. We propose that O-linked protein ADPr is the key signal in PARP-1/PARP-2-dependent processes that govern genome stability.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Many important biological processes are regulated by reversible post-translational modifications (PTMs). One of these, protein ADP-ribosylation (ADPr), is formed by adding adenosine diphosphate ribose molecules to target proteins, modulating their function at different levels, such as subcellular localization, stability, and activity. ADPr regulates many key cellular processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell differentiation and proliferation, cytoplasmic stress responses, and microbial virulence (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bock and Chang, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kraus and Hottiger, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Kraus, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rack etÂ al., 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p>One of the major protein families that catalyze protein ADPr in eukaryotes is poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), alternatively called ADP-ribosyl transferases (ARTDs). PARPs are best understood for their roles in DNA damage response and the regulation of chromatin structure and transcription (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Hernandez etÂ al., 2016</xref>). The most studied members of this family, PARP-1 and PARP-2 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Langelier and Pascal, 2013</xref>), play a critical role during these processes by modifying and recruiting many important chromatin factors, such as histones, p53, topoisomerases, and DNA repair proteins (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Caldecott, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Tallis etÂ al., 2014</xref>). PARPs modify proteins at specific sites. The general consensus is that acidic residues are the most common targets, but other modified residues, such as lysines, cysteines, and serines, have also been documented (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Messner etÂ al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sharifi etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Vyas etÂ al., 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recently, we identified histone PARylation factor 1 (HPF1; also known as C4orf27) as a PARP-1-regulating factor involved in cellular response to DNA damage (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs-Seymour etÂ al., 2016</xref>). We have demonstrated that, in the absence of HPF1, PARP-1 is unable to efficiently ADP-ribosylate its main substrates, histones, although the nature of the sites of this HPF1-dependent ADPr remained unresolved.</p>
      <p>The analysis of PTMs and their specific target sites has greatly benefited from mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. We recently established a mass spectrometric approach for the unbiased identification of ADPr sites (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>), which provides the methodological platform to investigate HPF1-dependent ADPr. This work identified serine ADPr (S-ADPr) of histones, which is strongly regulated during genotoxic stress, raising the possibility that other proteins involved in DNA damage response, such as PARP-1 itself, could also be modified at serine residues. Here we report that S-ADPr is a widespread modification and that HPF1 acts as aÂ specificity factor for PARP-1 and PARP-2, directing this modification.</p>

        <title>Histone Serine ADPr Is Dependent on HPF1</title>
        <p>Recently, we reported the unexpected discovery of ADPr on specific histone serine residues. Modification of these sites is dramatically increased during DNA damage and is blocked by the PARP inhibitor olaparib (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>). Given that PARP-1 is the primary enzyme responsible for ADPr during DNA damage and also the main target of olaparib (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Feng etÂ al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Krishnakumar and Kraus, 2010</xref>), we reasoned that PARP-1 could catalyze S-ADPr on histones. To test this hypothesis, we performed a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ong etÂ al., 2002</xref>) experiment in cultured human cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A), in combination with a histone purification protocol (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Collazo etÂ al., 2009</xref>) and our partial filter-aided sample preparation (partial FASP) digestion to increase the sequence coverage of histones (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>). Strikingly, all detected histone S-ADPr sites were radically decreased in Î<italic>PARP</italic>-<italic>1</italic> cells compared to wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>A; <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that PARP-1 is the major enzyme that ADP-ribosylates histones on serines.</p>
        <p>To characterize S-ADPr biochemically, we tried to reconstitute histone modification inÂ vitro using purified components. Intriguingly, we were not able to reproduce S-ADPr inÂ vitro by combining recombinant histones, NAD<sup>+</sup>, activating DNA, and recombinant PARP-1. Under these conditions, histones are comparatively poor ADPr substrates. Since we have previously shown that HPF1 affects the specificity of the PARP-1 reaction toward histones (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs-Seymour etÂ al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>B), we performed an inÂ vitro reaction of PARP-1/HPF1 with histone H3 as a substrate. The products were analyzed by mass spectrometry with electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) fragmentation. Significantly, we found that H3 was modified on the same serine sites previously identified in cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>), namely S10 and S28 (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Similarly, using histone H1 as a substrate, we observed three previously reported endogenous S-ADPr sites (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). To corroborate HPF1-induced S-ADPr in a more physiological context, we modified human recombinant mononucleosomes in the presence of HPF1. We identified three serine sites on the nucleosome, all of which were found both in cells and on recombinant histones. These experiments show that HPF1 is necessary and sufficient for PARP-1 to ADP-ribosylate histones on serine residues inÂ vitro (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>S-ADPr of core histones only occurs in the unstructured N-terminal histone tails, as do most canonical histone marks. Since synthetic peptides are commonly used to explore the dynamics of histone marks, especially on the N-terminal tails, we used synthetic H3 peptides to provide an independent confirmation of histone S-ADPr. Peptides corresponding to amino acids 1â21 of human H3 were synthesized as wild-type or an S10A mutant variant, in which the modified residue was replaced by alanine. As observed with full-length histones, no <sup>32</sup>P radioactivity was incorporated when these peptides were modified by PARP-1 alone. The addition of HPF1 to the reaction induced efficient modification ofÂ the H3 wild-type (WT) peptide, while this effect was dramatically reduced for the PARP-1-binding-deficient HPF1 mutants (Y238A/R239A point mutant and the Î3 mutant with a deleted C terminus) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>D) (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs-Seymour etÂ al., 2016</xref>). No modification was detected when the S10A mutant peptide was the substrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D), confirming our mass spectrometric identification of S10 as the modified residue (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Given that HPF1 also interacts with PARP-2 inÂ vivo (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs-Seymour etÂ al., 2016</xref>), we reasoned that PARP-2 could have the same effect as PARP-1 when combined with HPF1. Indeed, we observed that PARP-2 is also able to ADP-ribosylate histones inÂ vitro. The effect could be observed for core histones as well as histone H1 and the H3 peptide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>E, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>B, S1F, and S1G). In contrast, we could not observe the same effect for PARP3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>E, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>E, and S1F), another DNA repair PARP that has not been shown to interact with HPF1 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs-Seymour etÂ al., 2016</xref>) and whose catalytic domain is diverged from PARP1/2. Importantly, MS analyses confirmed S-ADPr of histones in the presence of PARP-2, but not for PARP-3 (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, to investigate the HPF1 dependence of histone S-ADPr in a cellular context, we performed a second SILAC experiment using HPF1-null cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>F). Compared to the WT cells, histone S-ADPr was abolished in Î<italic>HPF1</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>G and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>H; <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). For the vast majority of ADP-ribosylated peptides identified in the control cells, no signal was detected in the Î<italic>HPF1</italic> background, making the calculation of SILAC ratios impossible. Only a few very abundant peptides bearing ADPr on H2BS6 yielded ratios corresponding to an â¼200-fold decrease in ADPr in cells lacking HPF1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>G). Collectively, these results confirm our inÂ vitro data and demonstrate that histone S-ADPr is dependent on HPF1.</p>

As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C, the presence of HPF1 changes the ADPr pattern not only of histones but also of PARP-1. Until recently, PARP-1 ADPr was associated with modification on Asp and Glu residues (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chapman etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sharifi etÂ al., 2013</xref>). More recent reports have indicated that Arg and Lys residues are modified residues as well (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Daniels etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Messner etÂ al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rosenthal etÂ al., 2015</xref>), but S-ADPr on PARP-1 had never been reported. Given that HPF1 induces histone S-ADPr, we hypothesized that HPF1 could also have an influence on the amino acid specificity of PARP-1 automodification.</p>
        <p>To test this, we analyzed the products of inÂ vitro PARP-1 automodification reactions with and without HPF1. To be able to detect poly-ADPr as well as mono-ADPr, we also treated half of each PARP-1 inÂ vitro sample with a Nudix hydrolase (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Daniels etÂ al., 2015b</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Palazzo etÂ al., 2015</xref>). As expected, we did not detect S-ADPr on PARP-1 in the absence of HPF1, but we were still able to confirm previously characterized PARP-1 automodification on acidic residues following the conversion of poly-ADP-ribose to ribose phosphate with Nudix (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Daniels etÂ al., 2015a</xref>). In contrast, we detected S-ADPr on PARP-1 after the addition of HPF1 to the inÂ vitro reaction both with and without subsequent Nudix treatment. Specifically, we identified six S-ADPr sites on PARP-1, three of which lie in the unstructured part of the automodificaton region adjacent to the breast cancer suppressor protein-1 (BRCT) domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A, 2B, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>BâS2F). Importantly, we confirmed the presence of these three sites (S499, S507, and S519) inÂ vivo by analyzing endogenous PARP-1 purified from cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). Furthermore, we performed a SILAC experiment using HPF1-null cells to investigate the HPF1 dependence of PARP-1 S-ADPr in a cellular context (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>G). As with histones, PARP-1 S-ADPr was abolished in Î<italic>HPF1</italic> cells compared to the WT cells (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>H), demonstrating that PARP-1 auto-ADPr on serine is also dependent on HPF1.</p>
        <p>Next, we investigated the importance of these sites for HPF1-dependent auto-ADPr of PARP-1 by mutating the serine residues into alanines. Since all detected inÂ vivo sites are located in an unstructured loop of PARP-1 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Langelier etÂ al., 2012</xref>), we synthesized peptides corresponding to amino acids 494â524 of human PARP-1, encompassing all three sites. ETD analysis of the native synthetic peptide subjected to inÂ vitro ADPr reactions in the presence of HPF1 confirmed ADPr on S499, S507, and S519 (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Crucially, HPF1-dependent ADPr was abolished on the peptide when all three serine residues were changed to alanine, as no <sup>32</sup>P signal was detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C).</p>
        <p>To analyze PARP-1 automodification sites in the wider context, we expressed and purified the entire PARP-1 automodification domain (residues 374â525) along with mutants in which either four serines or six glutamate residues were mutated into alanines (4S/A and 6E/A). InÂ vitro reactions on these proteins showed that HPF1-dependent ADPr is dramatically reduced only in the serine mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D). Taken together, these results suggest that serines in the C-terminal part of the automodification domain are the major sites of PARP-1 automodification in the presence of HPF1.</p>

        <title>Additional Targets of Serine ADPr</title>
        <p>Many other proteins are targeted for ADPr (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gibson etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jungmichel etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang etÂ al., 2013</xref>), so we set out to identify additional substrates of S-ADPr with two different approaches.</p>
        <p>First, we employed our published histone purification protocol (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>) to search for ADPr in fractions depleted of histones. This method prevents artifactual enzymatic ADPr and non-enzymatic ADPr by lysing cells under denaturing conditions. We examined the fraction depleted in histones, since their ADPr sites have already been characterized (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>) and could only interfere with the identification of ADPr sites on other less abundant proteins. Proteins were digested by partial FASP to provide more ETD-compatible peptides (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>). High-resolution ETD analysis confirmed ADPr on S499, S507, and S519 in PARP-1, and it revealed five targets of S-ADPr as follows: HMGA1 (S8 and S9), HMGB1 (S181), HMGN1 (S7), NPM1 (S207), and TMA7 (S61) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>Aâ3C, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>A, and S3B). As this approach does not specifically enrich for ADPr, it only detects abundant ADPr sites. The identified substrates are thus likely to be among the main targets of ADPr. To increase the sensitivity of our analysis and identify more targets, we combined this fractionation protocol with phosphopeptide enrichment adapted to ADPr (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chapman etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Daniels etÂ al., 2014</xref>). This yielded the following three additional S-ADPr substrates: DEK (S279), HNRNPU (S187), and TMA16 (S9) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>C, and S3D).</p>
        <p>Second, we reasoned that reprocessing published, high-quality proteomic datasets could reveal previously overlooked S-ADPr sites from unidentified spectra (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Matic etÂ al., 2012</xref>). As illustrated by a recent study (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Griss etÂ al., 2016</xref>), computational strategies for mining published proteomic data have particularly benefited the discovery of unexpected protein modifications. To confirm our findings and investigate the scope of S-ADPr further, we reprocessed a high-quality phosphoproteomic study of human stem cells from the Coon group (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Phanstiel etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, a high-quality ETD spectrum unidentified in the original study provided independent confirmation of our identification of PARP-1 ADPr on S499 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>D). Our reanalysis alsoÂ confirmed two histone ADPr marks (H2BS6 and H3S28) and S-ADPr of HMGA1, although the corresponding higher-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) spectrum did not differentiate between modifications on S8 and S9 (both of which were identified as ADPr sites by our inÂ vivo ETD analyses described above).</p>

        <title>Serine ADPr Is a Widespread PTM</title>
        <p>As shown above, S-ADPr is not restricted to histones but alsoÂ targets PARP-1 and at least eight additional substrates, including three chromosomal high-mobility group proteins. Thus, we hypothesized that S-ADPr might be a widespread PTM. Recent large-scale proteomic studies have identified thousands of additional proteins as targets of ADPr in the DNA damage response, but the site specificity of these analyses has been, to a large extent, limited to Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Daniels etÂ al., 2015a</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gibson etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jungmichel etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Vivelo and Leung, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang etÂ al., 2013</xref>). This raises the question of whether some known ADP-ribosylated proteins may be modified on serine residues.</p>
        <p>To test this hypothesis, we applied our reanalysis approach to a recent site-specific ADPr proteomic study based on the enrichment of modified peptides with a macrodomain ADPr-binding module (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al., 2016</xref>). Although the enrichment strategy used in this study was not limited to modifications on particular amino acids (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gibson etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang etÂ al., 2013</xref>), the data search parameters restricted ADPr to Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg, but not other amino acids that have been suggested as targets of ADPr (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Daniels etÂ al., 2015a</xref>). Motivated by our unexpected identification of cysteine ADPr (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Vyas etÂ al., 2014</xref>), we broadened our computational analyses to consider ADPr on allÂ reactive amino acids. This approach made our discovery of S-ADPr possible (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>). Since the search parameters employed by <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al. (2016)</xref> preclude the discovery of ADPr on serine residues, we expected that S-ADPr could be hidden in the HCD raw files that they have made publicly available.</p>
        <p>While HCD consistently produces diagnostic ions demonstrating the presence of ADPr (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hengel and Goodlett, 2012</xref>), it is poor for localization of this modification, especially the extremely fragile serine linkage (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>). Standard-quality HCD spectra of ADP-ribosylated peptides contain few ions localizing the modification; but, given that <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al. (2016)</xref> employed a powerful enrichment approach and performed data acquisition at higher resolution and sensitivity, we reasoned that reprocessing these particular HCD files could allow the identification of some S-ADPr sites, though with lower localization confidence than that provided by ETD analyses (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hengel and Goodlett, 2012</xref>). To identify S-ADPr sites in these data, we manually inspected the matched spectra for information pinpointing ADPr on serine residues (see the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). When ADPr on serine was allowed, the dataset generated by <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al. (2016)</xref> yielded over 250 localized S-ADPr sites (<xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Gene ontology analysis of all of the above data combined revealed that S-ADPr is strongly enriched in proteins involved in processes maintaining genome stability, such as DNA repair and replication, transcription, mRNA splicing, and the regulation of chromatin structure and mitosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). This analysis also suggested a number of other protein functions commonly regulated by ADPr (<xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>) (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Daniels etÂ al., 2015a</xref>). These include chromatin remodelers, histone and DNA methylation systems, proteins central to a variety of DNA repair pathways (DNA ligase, DNA-PKScs, BLM, XPC, MSH6, Polbeta, FANCI, and Rad54B), high-mobility group (HMG) and heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle (HNRNP) proteins, and many zinc-finger-containing factors.</p>
        <p>S-ADPr of high-mobility group proteins appears to be characteristic, since we found that all three different families (HMGA, HMGB, and HMGN) are modified by ADPr on serine residues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C). Our reanalysis of the dataset generated by <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al. (2016)</xref> confirmed S-ADPr sites on HMGA1 and HMGN1 identified by our analyses of histone-depleted fractions. Strikingly, all five members of the high-mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) family were serine ADP-ribosylated in this dataset, and on all of them the modified serine was located in a highly conserved N-terminal region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B and 4C; <xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). ThisÂ further strengthens our suggestion that chromatin factors of the high-mobility group are among the main substrates of S-ADPr inÂ vivo. Using purified HMGA1, HMGB1, HMGN1, HMGN2, and HMGN4, we could reproduce the inÂ vivo sites (HMGA1 [S8 and S9], HMGB1 [S181], HMGN1 [S25], HMGN2 [S29], and HMGN4 [S29]) inÂ vitro in the presence of PARP-1 and HPF1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition to pinpointing ADPr on over 250 serine residues in the HCD dataset generated by <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al. (2016)</xref>, we also re-analyzed the data disregarding the limited localization information that HCD provides (see the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref> for details). We observed that a disproportionate number of ADP-ribosylated peptides identified by this unlocalized search contain serine and, more specifically, a serine preceded by a basic residue in the protein sequence. This conforms to the primitive consensus motif we proposed for histone sites (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>) and have further refined with the inÂ vivo sites observed in this study (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, and 3C). Since basic residues are trypsin cleavage sites, the modified serine is likely to be the first residue of a fully cleaved tryptic peptide. An analysis of the frequency of the first amino acids of the identified peptides (see the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref> for details) revealed a gross over-representation of serine in the first position of modified peptides compared to non-modified ones (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>E; <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). This indicates that many of the ADP-ribosylated peptides enriched by <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al. (2016)</xref> are likely modified on serine residues matching the proposed motif, and it shows that S-ADPr may be much more widespread than previously thought and well beyond the almost 300 sites identified above.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The covalent attachment of diverse PTMs to specific amino acid residues within proteins is the molecular basis for increasing the functional diversity of a proteome. The best-known PTMs, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, involve the attachment of small chemical groups. Recent technical advances, however, have allowed us to broaden our attention to increasingly complex PTMs. A prominent feature of larger PTMs is the functional versatility created by their structural complexity. For ADPr, versatility also arises from its broad amino acid specificity.</p>
      <p>In some cases, this broad amino acid specificity appears to be a property of a family of enzymes or even a single enzyme, as in the case of PARP-1, raising the question of how an enzyme can create diverse conjugation chemistries (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Daniels etÂ al., 2015a</xref>) and also catalyze highly specific reactions. We recently expanded the repertoire of ADP-ribosylated amino acids with the discovery of S-ADPr (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>). Our current study reveals the biochemical basis for S-ADPr, identifying HPF1 as the factor conferring serine specificity on both PARP-1 and PARP-2. Since PARP-1 is more abundant than HPF1 in cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs-Seymour etÂ al., 2016</xref>), it is likely that PARP-1 forms other protein complexes as well, in which other partners could steer PARP-1 and other PARPs to modify targets on different sites. Thus, our work provides a possible template for future searches for factors responsible for other types of ADP-ribose-protein attachments.</p>
      <p>Curiously, although the attachment of ADP-ribose to serine is chemically identical to the linkage between ADP-ribose monomers in poly-ADP-ribose (both are acetal bonds), ADP-ribose polymerization is clearly independent of HPF1. This suggests that the formation of the acetal bond on proteins ADP-ribosylated by PARP-1 is mechanistically different from the creation of the acetal linkages between molecules of ADP-ribose. DNA damage destabilizes the catalytic domain of PARP-1, which leads to poly-ADPr of PARP-1 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Langelier etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Similar structural studies are needed in the future to provide the structural basis for the HPF1-induced change of amino acid specificity of PARP-1.</p>
      <p>Our work establishes S-ADPr as a widespread modification in PARP signaling by identifying hundreds of protein targets for this type of ADPr. Specifically, our data suggest that serine is a much more common ADPr target than previously considered and that this signal is particularly utilized by processes important for genome stability. The identified serine sites on the primary substrates, histones, and PARP-1 itself have been shown to be dependent on HPF1, suggesting that HPF1 has a profound effect on PARP activity. Moreover, this specificity seems to extend beyond these primary targets to other substrates, including HMG proteins. HMG proteins have important roles in chromatin regulation, DNA repair, and cancer progression (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Reeves, 2015</xref>). Strikingly, the ADPr site shared by all HMGNs is at the interface between HMGNs and nucleosome core proteins (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Prymakowska-Bosak etÂ al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>We have reason to believe that many additional O-linked ADPr sites (on serine and possibly threonine and tyrosine residues) await discovery, since standard proteomic approaches for the identification of ADPr sites have generally not combined three key elements. First, an essential component of such a strategy is computational analysis that permits identification of O-ADPr sites. Second, while our data analysis can sometimes yield localizations from sensitive HCD data, the approach works best with high-resolution ETD fragmentation, which preserves ADPr (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hengel and Goodlett, 2012</xref>). Third, since around half of the sites we have identified unambiguously inÂ vivo by ETD on histones, PARP-1 and four other substrates fall in Lys- and Arg-rich regions, the detection of these sites is hampered by standard digestion protocols. In addition, ETD is inefficient with conventional tryptic peptides, while partial FASP generates longer peptides ideally suited for this fragmentation mode (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we propose that thousands of O-linked ADPr sites will be identified, once our partial FASP protocol and data analysis strategy are combined with high-resolution ETD and a powerful biochemical enrichment of ADP-ribosylated peptides.</p>
      <p>In summary, we provide the molecular mechanism for the recently discovered S-ADPr (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leidecker etÂ al., 2016</xref>). We identify HPF1 as the S-ADPr-inducing factor, and we show that S-ADPr is a widespread PTM that targets hundreds of proteins, including PARP-1 itself. We speculate that O-linked ADPr on serine (and possibly threonine and tyrosine) is the major type of ADPr in the regulation of DNA damage response and the maintenance of genome stability.</p>

Solutions A and B for the UPLCs were 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile, respectively. Samples were loaded in 0.1% formic acid in water to maximize retention of highly hydrophilic peptides. Gradients varied slightly in length (90 to 150Â min) and mixture, and may be extracted from the respective raw files.

Our method for targeted acquisition of ETD spectra of modified precursors used the product ion trigger feature in the decision tree of a TopSpeed acquisition method.

          <title>Data Analysis</title>
          <p>Raw files were analyzed with MaxQuant proteomics suite of algorithms (version 1.5.3.17) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>), integrated with the search engine Andromeda (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cox etÂ al., 2011</xref>).</p>
          <p>For the analysis of localization of ADPr, the data were searched against the human proteome database (downloaded 09.10.2015 from UniProt) with the following parameters. The maximum allowed mass deviation was set to 4.5 ppm for precursor ions and 20 ppm for fragment ions; the minimum peptide length was set to 6 amino acids and the maximum number of missed cleavages was set to 5Â with the maximum charge state 7. Variable modifications included oxidation (M), acetylation (Protein N-term and K), Amidation (C-term), ADP-ribosylation (DEKRSTCYNQHM) or phosphoribosylation (DEKRSTCYNQHM). The variable modification ADP-ribosylation allowed for neutral losses of adenine (m/z 136.0618); adenosine with loss of water (m/z 250.0935); AMP (m/z 348.0704); ADP (m/z 428.0367) and ADP-ribose (m/z 542.0684) (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hengel and Goodlett, 2012</xref>), with AMP listed first. FTMS top peaks per 100Â Da were set to 20. For confident identification of ADP-ribosylation sites, we considered only ETD MS/MS spectra and required a minimum Andromeda score of 100, mass deviation smaller than 3 ppm after MaxQuant recalibration and a localization score above 0.9. In addition, we manually validated all the representative spectra by requiring extensive coverage of the peptide backbone fragment ions. For localization we required the clear presence of multiple high-intensity fragment ions pinpointing the modification site. Unlike the HCD spectra, ETD spectra do not contain ADP-ribose specific diagnostic ions, which are not generated in the ETD reaction, and are thus not available as a criterion for validation of spectra. In all triggered spectra, however, the adenine peak was observed in the HCD fragmentation of the same precursor.</p>

          <p>For SILAC experiments on histones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>), HCD data were collected and searched against a human histone database (generated from a human proteome database downloaded on 09.10.2015 from UniProt) with the parameters given above with the following changes: Multiplicity was set to 2, with <italic>Lys8</italic> as the Heavy Label. Maximum labeled AAs were set to 7. Maximum missed cleavages were set to 6, and maximum charge was 7. The minimum peptide length was set to 6 amino acids. Variable modifications included acetylation (Protein N-term and K), methylation (KR) and ADP-ribosylation (S), since the localization of these ADPr sites was already well established with the preceding ETD experiments and the HCD data contained relatively little localization information.</p>

          <title>Reanalysis of Published High-Quality Proteomics Datasets</title>
          <p>For the reanalysis of published high-quality proteomics datasets, public raw files were searched against the human proteome database (downloaded 09.10.2015 from UniProt) with the parameters given above with the following changes: the maximum number of missed cleavages was set to 3 with the maximum charge state 7.</p>
          <p>For the high-quality phosphoproteomics study of human stem cells (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Phanstiel etÂ al., 2011</xref>), variable modifications included acetylation (Protein N-term and K), and ADP-ribosylation (DEKRSTCYNQHM) and, since isobaric labeling was used, we selected the option â4plex iTRAQâ under the âReporter Ion MS2â menu.</p>
          <p>For the ADPr proteomics study based on enrichment of modified peptides with a macrodomain ADPr-binding module (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al., 2016</xref>), variable modifications included acetylation (Protein N-term), Oxidation (M) and ADP-ribosylation (DEKRSTCYNQHM). We employed the MS/MS spectra generated by MaxQuant as the basis for our manual validation of spectra. To consider a peptide as modified on serine, we required the presence of fragment ions with either the intact ADP-ribose or phosphoribose (resulting from the loss of AMP) pointing to ADPr on serine. For localization we disregarded fragment ions for which it is impossible to distinguish between an original lack of modification and complete loss of ADPr during fragmentation. Manually validated spectra from the reanalysis of <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al., 2016</xref> dataset are in Mendeley Data and are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/pmvv5mdmrm.1" id="intref0060">http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/pmvv5mdmrm.1</ext-link>.</p>

          <title>Localization-free Searching</title>
          <p>We have previously observed prominent neutral loss behavior for ADP-ribosylated peptides undergoing HCD fragmentation (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sharifi etÂ al., 2013</xref>). Among the losses observed, that of AMP and of the complete modifier have appeared most prominently. While the loss of AMP provides information about possible modifier localization, modeling it requires definition of the possible amino acids modified.</p>
          <p>Modeling ADPr as an entirely labile variable modifier on the peptide C terminus has advantages as well. For one, we need make no assumptions about the amino acid specificity of ADPr â any peptide may be modified, regardless of composition. Second, assigning the modification to the terminus of the peptide means each possible peptide in the search space generates only two hypothetical spectra for matching, one with and one without the modifier, rather than a combinatorial set in which every permissible amino acid leads to a different hypothesis. Thus the search space is dramatically reduced and the search runs faster.</p>
          <p>Since the HCD data provided by <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martello etÂ al. (2016)</xref> was collected with higher than typical sensitivity it is still more likely to contain the native series ions arising from complete loss of the modifier.</p>
          <p>Searches were performed using the fast search engine Morpheus 1.68 (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wenger and Coon, 2013</xref>) â a version implementing neutral loss modeling, generously provided by Craig Wenger. The three HeLa HCD files provided (20140515_QE6_UPLC5_SCL_SA_Hela_PAR_PD_Rep1, 20140515_QE6_UPLC5_SCL_SA_Hela_PAR_PD_Rep2, 20140515_QE6_UPLC5_SCL_SA_Hela_PAR_PD_Rep3) were searched versus the same database of human proteins mentioned above with the following parameters: Tryptic peptides (no proline rule) - Miscleavages 3 â variable mods carbamidomethylation of C, oxidation of M, acetylation of protein N terminus, ADPRcompleteNL of C-term. Both precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set at 10 ppm and the precursor isotopic assignment was allowed to be off by up to 3.</p>
          <p>These searches identified 1818 unique ADPr modified peptides and 16982 unique peptides without ADPr. The amino acid composition of these two sets of peptides is compared in <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>.</p>

            <p>List of serine ADPr sites after manual inspection of spectra pinpointing ADPr on serine residues. To consider a peptide as modified on serine, we required the presence of fragment ions with either the intact ADP-ribose or phosphoribose (resulting from the loss of AMP) pointing to ADPr on serine. For localization we disregarded fragment ions for which it is impossible to distinguish between an original lack of modification and complete loss of ADPr during fragmentation.
