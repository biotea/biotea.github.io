      <abstract>
        <p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) plays a central role in endosome fusion, recycling, sorting, and early-to-late endosome conversion, but the mechanisms that determine how the correct endosomal PtdIns3P level is achieved remain largely elusive. Here we identify two new factors, SORF-1 and SORF-2, as essential PtdIns3P regulators in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Loss of <italic>sorf-1</italic> or <italic>sorf-2</italic> leads to greatly elevated endosomal PtdIns3P, which drives excessive fusion of early endosomes. <italic>sorf-1</italic> and <italic>sorf-2</italic> function coordinately with Rab switching genes to inhibit synthesis of PtdIns3P, allowing its turnover for endosome conversion. SORF-1 and SORF-2 act in a complex with BEC-1/Beclin1, and their loss causes elevated activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. In mammalian cells, inactivation of WDR91 and WDR81, the homologs of SORF-1 and SORF-2, induces Beclin1-dependent enlargement of PtdIns3P-enriched endosomes and defective degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor. WDR91 and WDR81 interact with Beclin1 and inhibit PI3K complex activity. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism that controls appropriate PtdIns3P levels in early-to-late endosome conversion.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>Delivery of intracellular cargoes to lysosomes involves maturation of early endosomes through homotypic fusion, early-to-late endosome conversion, and heterotypic fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes. These processes are mainly controlled by endosome-specific Rab GTPases and phosphatidylinositides (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Stenmark, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>). The Rab GTPases Rab5 and Rab7 are required for fusion of early and late endosomes, respectively. Rab5 recruitment to early endosomes is facilitated by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rabex-5, which converts Rab5 into an active GTP-bound form that interacts with Rabaptin-5 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Horiuchi et al., 1997</xref>). Rabaptin-5 further enhances the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of Rabex-5, establishing a positive feedback loop of Rab5 activation, leading to rapid recruitment of other Rab5 effectors including Vps34, a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET)/homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS), a tethering complex (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Christoforidis et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">LippÃ© et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Peplowska et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Plemel et al., 2011</xref>). This leads to assembly of trans-SNARE complexes between membranes to promote fusion and maturation of early endosomes (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wickner, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Balderhaar et al., 2013</xref>). Early-to-late endosome conversion requires replacement of Rab5 with Rab7, which is controlled by a complex consisting of Mon1/SAND-1 and Ccz1/CCZ-1 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Nordmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>). By recognizing the PtdIns3P level and size of early endosomes, SAND-1 displaces RABX-5/Rabex-5 from the endosome membrane, which probably interrupts the positive feedback loop of Rab5 activation. The SAND-1âCCZ-1 complex also recruits and activates Rab7 on endosome membranes (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Poteryaev et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Once activated, GTP-bound Rab7 (GTP-Rab7) recruits effectors including TBC-2, a Rab5 GTPase activating protein (GAP), which terminates Rab5 activity (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chotard et al., 2010</xref>), and the HOPS complex, which mediates fusion of late endosomes.</p><p>The characteristic phosphatidylinositide of early endosomes, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), plays key roles in the endosome-lysosome pathway (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Schink et al., 2013</xref>). PtdIns3P promotes homo- or heterotypic fusion of early endosomes through PtdIns3P-binding proteins, such as EEA1, Rabenosyn-5, and Phafin2 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Christoforidis et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gengyo-Ando et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2012</xref>). PtdIns3P is also important for cargo sorting to lysosomes or recycling back to the trans-Golgi network (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Futter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Henne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Seaman, 2012</xref>). PtdIns3P is mainly generated on endosomes by the class III PI3K complex, which consists of Vps34, p150/Vps15, and Beclin 1/Atg6 and is recruited by GTP-Rab5 (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Christoforidis et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Funderburk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>). PtdIns3P is most abundant on early endosomes and endosomal carrier vesicles, intermediates between early and late endosomes. PtdIns3P is not obviously present on multivesicular late endosomes (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gillooly et al., 2000</xref>), probably because of dephosphorylation by myotubularin family phosphatases or conversion by PIKfyve/Fab1 into the late endosomeâspecific phosphatidylinositide, PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, or degradation in the endosomal lumen (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wurmser and Emr, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Schink et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, control of PtdIns3P generation and elimination is crucial for early-to-late endosome conversion and the subsequent switch of endosome identities and endosome-to-lysosome trafficking. The interactions of Rab5 or Rab7 with PI3K or myotubularin phosphatases are thought to be critical for PtdIns3P turnover (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Christoforidis et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Stein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>); however, other factors or mechanisms regulating endosomal PtdIns3P levels remain to be identified.</p><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is an excellent model organism for studying membrane trafficking (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> has six macrophage-like cells (coelomocytes) that actively undergo fluid-phase endocytosis and contain endosomes and lysosomes that are easily distinguished with differential interference contrast (DIC) optics or organelle-specific fluorescent markers. Importantly, molecules controlling the fusion and fission of endosomes and lysosomes as well as early-to-late endosome conversion are well conserved (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fares and Greenwald, 2001a</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Grant and Sato, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2014</xref>). Previously, we found that deletion of the CORVET/HOPS subunit VPS-18 caused severe defects in endosome/lysosome fusion in <italic>C. elegans</italic> coelomocytes (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>). To search for additional components of the endosome-lysosome pathway, we performed <italic>vps-18</italic> suppressor screens and identified two novel factors, SORF-1 and SORF-2, which are essential for appropriate maintenance of PtdIns3P levels in early-to-late endosome conversion. SORF-1 and SORF-2 form a complex that further interacts with the BEC-1 subunit of the PI3K complex. Deletion of <italic>sorf-1</italic> or <italic>sorf-2</italic> led to enrichment of BEC-1 on early endosomes and enhanced PI3K complex activity, resulting in prolonged existence of endosomal PtdIns3P and delay in early-to-late endosome conversion. WDR91 and WDR81, the mammalian homologs of SORF-1 and SORF-2, also act in complex with Beclin1 to regulate endosomal PtdIns3P levels by suppressing PI3K activity. These findings reveal a conserved negative regulatory mechanism by which endosomal PtdIns3P is controlled in early-to-late endosome conversion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Mutations in <italic>sorf-1</italic> and <italic>sorf-2</italic> partially suppress defective endosome fusion in CORVET/HOPS mutants</title><p>To identify additional regulators in the endosome-lysosome pathway, we performed genetic screens for genes whose loss of function could partially rescue the endosome/lysosome fusion defect in coelomocytes in <italic>C. elegans vps-18(tm1125)</italic> CORVET/HOPS mutants (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>ZK563.5</italic> and <italic>F52C9.1</italic> were identified from an RNAi screen of genes on chromosomes V and X and an EMS mutagenesis screen, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201506081/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1, AâC</ext-link>).

In wild type, the PtdIns3P signal and the size of early endosomes increased from 0 to 13 min; the PtdIns3P signal was then stable for a short time (13â15 min) before disappearing quickly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201506081/DC1" id="supp2">Video 1</ext-link>).

These results suggest that SORF-1 and SORF-2 do not act through these phosphatases or kinases.</p><p>We next examined the requirement for the class III PI3K complex, which is composed of VPS-34, BEC-1, and VPS-15/p150. In <italic>bec-1(ok700)</italic> deletion mutants or its double mutants with <italic>sorf-1</italic> or <italic>sorf-2</italic>, 2xFYVE::GFP became more evenly distributed in the cytoplasm, and RME-8::RFP-labeled early endosomes were much smaller than in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). RNAi of <italic>rab-7</italic> did not induce giant early endosomes in these double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). These results suggest that BEC-1 is required for endosome enlargement and PtdIns3P persistence resulting from inhibition of both Rab switching and <italic>sorf-1</italic> or <italic>sorf-2</italic> functions. This is consistent with studies that the Beclin1/Atg6 subunit of the PI3K complex is required for endocytic trafficking in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Thoresen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Ruck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">McKnight et al., 2014</xref>).

No interactions were found between VPS-34 and SORF-1 or SORF-2 in coIP assays (Fig. S5, C and D). In addition, neither SORF-1 nor SORF-2 interacted with RAB-5, RAB-7, or their GTP- or GDP-bound forms in coIP assays (Fig. S5, EâH), excluding the possibility that SORF-1 or SORF-2 functions directly through RAB-5 or RAB-7. Thus, SORF-1 and SORF-2 likely inhibit PtdIns3P levels by specifically interacting with BEC-1. To test this, we immunoprecipitated BEC-1 from lysates of N2, <italic>sorf-1(tm3855)</italic>, and <italic>sorf-2(tm5210)</italic> animals expressing Flag-VPS-34 and measured PI3K activity.

In addition, MBP-SORF-1, but not MBP, specifically binds to PtdIns3P in a dose-dependent manner in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, H and I</xref>), and GFP-fused SORF-1 or SORF-2 are enriched on or in close proximity to endosomes, although they are also seen in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 J</xref>).

Endogenous EEA1 was enriched on the enlarged endosomes in WDR81 or WDR91 KO cells, although total EEA1 levels remained the same as in control HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). Given that EEA1 is a PtdIns3P-binding factor, this finding suggested that loss of WDR81 or WDR91 might result in elevated endosomal PtdIns3P. Consistent with this idea, an increase in endosome size was seen when endosomes were labeled with 2xFYVE-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 B</xref>), similar to our observations in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This effect is probably not caused by an increase in macropinocytosis, because no obvious difference was detected between control HeLa cells and WDR91 or WDR81 KO cells in internalizing dextran 405 without or with EGF, which reflects constitutive or growth factorâinduced macropinocytosis, respectively (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Schnatwinkel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kerr and Teasdale, 2009</xref>; Fig. S5, KâM).

Loss of <italic>sorf-1</italic> or <italic>sorf-2</italic> leads to elevation and prolonged existence of endosomal PtdIns3P, which induces excessive fusion of early endosomes. As a result, early-to-late endosome conversion and endosomal transport are delayed. Our results further suggest that negative regulation of endosomal PtdIns3P by SORF-1 and SORF-2 is likely achieved by their direct interaction with the BEC-1/Beclin1 subunit of the class III PI3K complex, though other mechanisms might also be involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>).</p><p>PtdIns3P can drive fusion of early endosomes through its effectors (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al., 2010</xref>). During early-to-late endosome switching, a protein interaction cascade consisting of RABX-5, SAND-1, CCZ-1, RAB-7, and TBC-2 suppresses RAB-5âmediated PtdIns3P synthesis, because the âactiveâ GTP-RAB-5 is responsible for recruitment of the PI3K complex to early endosomes (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chotard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pfeffer, 2013</xref>). SAND-1 senses the PtdIns3P level on early endosomes and displaces RABX-5 from endosome membranes; in the meantime, SAND-1 and CCZ-1 form a complex that converts RAB-7 into a GTP-bound âactiveâ form (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Nordmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>). GTP-RAB-7 further recruits TBC-2, the RAB-5 GAP, to inactivate RAB-5 on endosomes (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chotard et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, deletion of <italic>sand-1</italic>, <italic>ccz-1</italic>, <italic>rab-7</italic>, or <italic>tbc-2</italic> leads to enhanced RAB-5 activity, which in turn increases endosomal PtdIns3P levels. Intriguingly, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> coelomocytes, endosomal PtdIns3P still turns over in the absence of <italic>sand-1</italic>, <italic>rab-7</italic>, or <italic>tbc-2</italic>, suggesting that alternative mechanisms exist that either inhibit PtdIns3P synthesis or promote its degradation on endosomes. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which endosomal PtdIns3P levels are properly controlled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>). In this model, SORF-1 likely senses and binds to endosomal PtdIns3P and forms a complex with SORF-2. This complex interacts with BEC-1/Beclin1 and suppresses the activity of the PI3K complex, which acts in coordination with the protein interaction cascade (SAND-1âCCZ-1âRAB-7âTBC-2) that suppresses RAB-5 and hence RAB-5âmediated PI3K activity; thus, PtdIns3P synthesis on early endosomes is strongly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>). On the other hand, endosomal PtdIns3P may be dephosphorylated by myotubularin family phosphatases, converted into PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> by PIKfyve/Fab1, or invaginated into the endosomal lumen for degradation (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Schink et al., 2013</xref>), allowing early-to-late endosome conversion and endolysosomal cargo transport.</p><p>Our data also suggest that elevated PtdIns3P levels can partially rescue the endosome fusion defect caused by partial loss of function of the CORVET/HOPS complex. Studies in yeast and mammalian cells suggest that CORVET and HOPS serve as tethering complexes to mediate Rab5/Vps21-dependent early endosome fusion and Rab7/Ypt7-mediated late endosome fusion, respectively (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Peplowska et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Balderhaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pols et al., 2013</xref>).

One explanation for the compensatory effect of PtdIns3P is that the elevated level of PtdIns3P likely promotes membrane fusion through other PtdIns3P effectors, for example, RABS-5/Rabenosyn-5 and EEA-1/EEA1, which play nonredundant roles to drive endosome fusion by facilitating formation of SNARE complexes on two opposing membranes (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">McBride et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ohya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The negative regulation of endosomal PtdIns3P as revealed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is probably conserved in mammals, because knockout of WDR91 or WDR81 similarly results in Beclin1-dependent enlargement and PtdIns3P enrichment of endosomes, which impairs lysosome-mediated EGFR degradation. In addition, WDR91 and WDR81 interact with one another, and both of them interact directly with Beclin1 and inhibit PI3K complex activity, similar to the situation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>). WDR91 contains an extra WD40-repeat region compared with SORF-1, so other endosomal factors may interact with WDR91 through its WD40-repeat domain to regulate the activity of the WDR91-WDR81 complex. Our findings provide important clues for understanding the physiological functions of WDR91 and WDR81, and especially the role of WDR81 in developmental disorders such as cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and quadrupedal locomotion syndrome-2 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gulsuner et al., 2011</xref>). Given that WDR81 and WDR91 interact with Beclin1, it will be of interest to investigate whether WDR81 or WDR91 are involved in autophagy-related cellular events. It will be very interesting to investigate whether WDR91 mutation is involved in endosome/lysosome-related human diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s14"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s15"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and genetics</title><p>The Bristol strain N2 was used as wild type. <italic>sorf-2(yq4)</italic> and <italic>ppk-3(yq24)</italic> mutants were obtained by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. <italic>sorf-1(tm3855)</italic> and <italic>sorf-2(tm5210)</italic> deletion mutants were isolated with trimethylpsoralen and UV mutagenesis and PCR screening.
