      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a prominent human monogenic disease and affects over 12.5 million people worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It is characterized by the formation of fluid-filled renal cysts, leading to an increase in the total kidney volume and a decline in the renal function. Approximately 50% of ADPKD patients ultimately develop end stage renal disease and require dialysis or renal transplantation. ADPKD is, however, a systemic disease and its extra-renal manifestations include hepatic and pancreatic cysts, cerebral aneurysms, cardiovascular abnormalities and hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">ADPKD is caused by mutations in either the <italic>PKD1</italic> or <italic>PKD2</italic> gene encoding PKD1 and PKD2, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. PKD1, also called polycystin-1, is a receptor-like protein with 11 transmembrane segments, a large extracellular N-terminus predicted to bind unknown ligand(s) and a short intracellular C-terminus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. PKD2, also called polycystin-2 or TRPP2, is a cation channel of the transient receptor potential polycystin (TRPP) subfamily of the TRP superfamily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Recent evidences showed that PKD2 has high permeability to Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, but low permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. PKD2 shares an overall architecture with other TRP channels, i.e., six transmembrane segments (S1âS6), a pore loop between S5 and S6, and intracellularly localized N- and C-termini<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. PKD1 and PKD2 have been shown to form a complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, which is hypothesized to sense fluid flow on the membrane of primary cilia. However, this hypothesis remains debatable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Clinically identified pathogenic mutations in either <italic>PKD1</italic> or <italic>PKD2</italic> were thought to result in abnormal PKD1/PKD2 channel function and dysregulated cilium signaling, ultimately initiating cyst formation. There is no cure for ADPKD to date. The outcomes of recent clinical trials have been mostly negative, with the exception of the marginally effective Tolvaptan being approved in some countries to treat ADPKD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, understanding how the PKD1/PKD2 complex functions is crucial for elucidating the pathogenesis of ADPKD and developing therapeutic strategies.</p>
      <p id="Par5">PKD2 has been shown to assemble as either homotetrameric ion channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or heterotetrameric complexes with PKD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The heterologously expressed PKD1/PKD2 complex in HEK293 or CHO cells was recently shown to be activated by WNT molecules that bind to the PKD1 N-terminus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Whether WNTs serve as physiological ligands for the ciliary PKD1/PKD2 complex has yet to be determined. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was reported to increase the open probability of homotetrameric PKD2 channels at low concentrations while inhibiting channel opening at elevated levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. By directly measuring currents in primary cilia of renal collecting duct epithelial cells of conditional PKD1 or PKD2 knockout mice, PKD2 was recently shown to be an essential K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> permeable ion channel in primary cilia independent of PKD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Using screening mutagenesis, we identified an activating mutant F604P that gave rise to robust cation currents when expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, allowing us to further investigate PKD2 channel function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par6">PKD2L1 (also called polycystin-2L1 or TRPP3) is a homologue of PKD2 (54% amino acid identity), but is not involved in ADPKD. PKD2L1 was initially reported to be a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated non-selective cation channel in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. When heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, PKD2L1 also mediated measurable non-selective cation currents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. PKD2L1 associates with PKD1L1, a homologue of PKD1, in primary cilia and acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel regulating ciliary Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and hedgehog signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. PKD2L1, in complex with PKD1L3 or alone, is activated by protons in an off-response manner, i.e., activation occurs only after low extracellular pH is removed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par7">The molecular gating mechanisms of PKD2 and PKD2L1 channels have remained poorly understood. We recently identified and characterized hydrophobic gate (i.e., lower gate or activation gate) residues in the distal part of the pore-lining S6 helix of several TRP channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A hydrophobic gate residue allows the pore to close by forming a so-called hydrophobic barrier, preventing ion permeation even when the physical pore size is bigger than that of the ion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Whether PKD2 and PKD2L1 adopt a similar hydrophobic gating mechanism is unknown. We<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and two other groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> recently resolved PKD2 structures and revealed two constriction points in the distal portion of S6 formed by residues L677 and N681. However, it remains unclear whether both L677 and N681 or just one of them function as a gate in PKD2. Among the four PKD2 structures reported to date, three of them seem to be in a non-conducting state while the fourth one exhibits a wider pore opening. Whether the structure with the wider opening represents an activated state remains unclear. An extracellular tetragonal opening for polycystins (TOP) domain between the S1 and S2 helices contributes to channel assembly and likely participates in recognition of unidentified ligand(s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, but whether and how this domain is implicated in PKD2 channel activation has yet to be determined. Therefore, a PKD2 structure in an activated state is needed to provide insights into the PKD2 gating mechanism and associated conformational changes.</p>
      <p id="Par8">In this study, we reveal a PKD2 gating mechanism using a combination of functional and structural analyses. We first identify and analyze a series of gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutants of the hydrophobic residues in the distal part of the pore-lining S6 helix in PKD2L1 and PKD2, revealing that the two residues (L557-A558) and L677 residue alone form a hydrophobic gate in PKD2L1 and PKD2, respectively. We then show that PKD2 GOF gate mutants are able to rescue PKD2 knockdown-induced disease phenotypes in zebrafish. Lastly, we obtain a 3.5âÃ structure of the PKD2 activating mutant F604P by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (EM) and reveal that a transition from Ï- to Î±-helix in the middle of S6 leads to expansion of the activation gate via a combined twisting and splaying motion of the gate residues.</p>

        <title>Identification of hydrophobic gate residues in PKD2L1</title>
        <p id="Par9">According to the hydrophobic gate theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, replacement of a hydrophobic gate residue with a hydrophilic residue result in hydrophobic energy barrier collapse and an elevated hydration rate of the pore, thus giving rise to a constitutively open channel. To examine whether PKD2L1 adopts a hydrophobic gate, we replaced each of the eight hydrophobic residues (L552-I560) in the distal region of the pore-lining S6 helix (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) with hydrophilic asparagine (N) and assessed the channel activity of the resulting point mutants in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes by two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology. We found that compared with wild-type (WT) PKD2L1, two mutants, L557N (the PKD2L1 L557 residue corresponds to the PKD2 L677 which forms a pore constriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>) and A558N, exhibited dramatic 9.0âÂ±â1.4-fold and 11.9âÂ±â1.8-fold increases, respectively, in basal channel activity as assessed by Na<sup>+</sup> currents at â50âmV (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). Substitution of neighboring residues (F556N and I559N) only showed about 2.5-fold increases of channel activity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Similar results were obtained for currents measured at other membrane potentials using a ramp protocol (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Since leucine is similar in size to asparagine and alanine is smaller than asparagine, the L557N mutation would have negligible effect in the pore size and the A558N mutation would result in a smaller pore. Therefore, the increased channel activities observed in L557N and A558N mutants are presumably due to the removal of the hydrophobicity of L557 and A558, respectively. Biotinylation and immunofluorescence assays showed that the plasma membrane expression levels of these eight mutants are similar to that of the WT channel (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). We then performed noise analysis on whole-cell current traces obtained at â100âmV and found that both L557N and A558N mutants exhibited much higher open probability than WT PKD2L1 (0.65âÂ±â0.10 for L557N, 0.69âÂ±â0.12 for A558N, and 0.12âÂ±â0.03 for WT PKD2L1). Their single-channel currents were, however, comparable (13.5âÂ±â2.2 pA for L557N, 13.6âÂ±â2.4 pA for A558N, and 11.2âÂ±â1.6 pA for WT PKD2L1). The increased open probability without significant changes in single-channel current suggests that the helical-bundle-crossing (or physical constriction) mechanism plays a significant role in PKD2L1 gating in addition to the hydrophobic gating mechanism. Thus these data indicated that the consecutive L557 and A558 residues together form the hydrophobic gate in PKD2L1.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Identification of PKD2L1 hydrophobic gate in the S6 helix. <bold>a</bold> Left panel, membrane topology of polycystin channels.

        <p id="Par10">We then further replaced L557 with 12 additional amino acid residues of different hydrophobicity and/or sizes and found an interesting pattern of channel activity. Mutations to hydrophilic amino acids (E, D, N, Q, S, C, and T) all substantially increased channel activity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), suggesting that the high hydrophobicity of L557 is an important factor to keep the PKD2L1 pore closed in the resting state. Mutations of L557 to hydrophobic amino acids (G, A, V, I, F, and W) together exhibited a reverse correlation between the residue size and the channel activity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), suggesting that PKD2L1 can also be partially gated by the physical constriction formed at site 557. Mutations at A558 in general also revealed a positive correlation between the hydrophilicity of site 558 and channel activity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), with the exception that mutants A558T and A558G did not show any current increase at -50 mV as compared to the WT channel (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Examination of the currents at other membrane potentials revealed that mutants A558T and A558G (as well as mutant A558S) in fact exhibit strong outward rectification and show around 6-fold increases in channel activity at +80âmV compared to the WT channel (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), although the mechanism underlying the rectification remains unknown. Removal of divalent cations from extracellular solutions had little effect on the rectification (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), excluding the possibility of a blockade of inward currents by extracellular divalent cations as a cause of the rectification. Of note, the outward rectification was not observed in the corresponding L557 mutants (L557G, L557T and L557S) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). The mutations at L557 and A558 did not affect PKD2L1 targeting to the surface membrane as shown by biotinylation and immunofluorescence data (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>). These data indicated that the PKD2L1 pore is kept closed by two mechanisms: the hydrophobic barrier and physical constriction formed by the L557 and A558 gate residues. Disruption of either of them allows cation permeation through the pore.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Characterization of mutants at PKD2L1 sites L557 and A558. <bold>a</bold> L557 was replaced with different aa, as indicated.

        <p id="Par11">A mutation might have multifaceted effects, e.g., altering inter- or intra-subunit interactions or affecting local or even global channel structure. In order to confirm that the observed effects of mutations at L557 or A558 on channel activity are caused by changes in local hydrophobicity or pore size, we examined double mutants with each carrying two opposing mutations (one to hydrophilic N and the other to bulky hydrophobic W): L557N/A558W and L557W/A558N. We found that both L557N/A558W and L557W/A558N mutants exhibit robust channel activity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>), indicating that the A558W or L557W LOF mutant (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b, g</xref>) is rescued by increasing hydrophilicity through the L557N or A558N mutation. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that the adjacent L557 and A558 residues constitute the hydrophobic gate in PKD2L1 to prevent ion permeation in the closed state. Since only L677 was revealed to point to the central cavity and form the constriction in closed PKD2 structures (A678 points away from the cavity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, PKD2L1 might possess a slightly different ion-conducting pore from that of PKD2. We suspect that L557 and A558 in PKD2L1 together form the constriction in a way that both face the cavity but neither of them points directly to the cavity centre. Therefore, mutations at either L557 or A558 would alter the local pore hydrophobicity or size, thereby impacting the channel activity.</p>

        <title>Identification of hydrophobic gate residues in PKD2</title>
        <p id="Par12">We wondered whether human PKD2 would possess the same gate residues as PKD2L1 since 10 amino acids around the PKD2L1 gate (LLNMF<bold>LA</bold>IIN) are identical in PKD2 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Overexpression of WTÂ PKD2 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes produced no detectable current over background. We reasoned that a hydrophilic gate mutation would result in a constitutively open PKD2 channel and produce detectable currents. We therefore replaced each of the hydrophobic residues in the F676-I679 fragment (corresponding to the gate-containing segment F556-I559 of PKD2L1) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) with asparagine and found that only the L677N mutant (equivalent to the hydrophilic gate mutant L557N in PKD2L1) exhibits substantially increased channel activity, comparable to that of the GOF mutant F604P that we reported recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). Residue A678, which corresponds to PKD2L1 gate residue A558, did not conduct appreciable current when replaced with N (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Replacement of A678 with other hydrophilic residues (Q, S, and T) did not produce any detectable current either (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), suggesting that A678 is not part of the PKD2 gate. Surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence showed that the plasma membrane targeting of mutants A678N, -Q, -S and -T, L677N, and F604P is similar to that of the WT protein (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We next focused on L677 by substituting it with different amino acids and found that replacing L677 with N or G, but not with bulky hydrophobic residues (F, Y, and W), indeed produces robust currents (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Replacing it with the smaller hydrophobic residue alanine partially opened the pore (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). We also found that in the F604P mutant, replacing L677 with the small residue G further increases the activity while replacing it with large hydrophobic residues (F, Y, and W) substantially attenuates activity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e, f</xref>). These functional data support the conclusion that L677 but not A678 serves as a single-residue gate of PKD2. The functionally identified gate residue (L677) is in agreement with the known structures of PKD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, where L677 forms a physical constriction within the pore, and thus validates our methodology.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Identification and characterization of PKD2 hydrophobic gate. <bold>a</bold> Each single underlined aa of human PKD2 was mutated to N.

        <p id="Par13">Although both F604P and L677N mutations resulted in constitutively active PKD2 channels, we assumed that they open the pore in different ways, i.e., the F604P mutation induces a series of conformational changes in the PKD2 channel that ultimately leads to gate movements and pore opening (see below), whereas isosteric polar substitution L677N opens the pore by directly increasing the gateâs hydrophilicity. In other words, the F604P mutant would be in an activated conformation while L677N would still be in a resting conformation. Interestingly, we found that the channel activity of mutant F604P is abolished by each of the following mutations: W201A, K688A, D511V, Y684A and ÎY684 (Y684 residue deletion) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). These mutations may have prevented conformational changes required for channel activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Of note, D511V and ÎY684 are two naturally occurred mutations found in human ADPKD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In contrast, the channel activity of mutant L677N was not very affected by these mutations, except for ÎY684 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>), which supports our assumption that mutant L677N is in a different state from that of mutant F604P and gains channel function due to removal of hydrophobicity at L677.</p>
        <p id="Par14">In the PKD2 structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, the four N681 residues establish another narrow pore constriction (with a radius of 3.1âÃ) about one helical turn below the L677 residues that form a constriction with a radius of 2.5âÃ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, because of its hydrophilicity, we think that N681 is not as effective as L677 to block ion permeation. This is supported by the fact that the isosteric mutation L677N alone was sufficient to open the pore and resulted in a GOF PKD2 channel. In addition, replacing N681 with isosteric hydrophobic L in the open-gate channel, mutant L677N, closed the channel (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>), presumably because a new hydrophobic gate is formed by L681 in L677N/N681L. In other words, the PKD2 pore is conductive if both constrictions are formed by hydrophilic N (i.e., N677 and N681 in L677N), whereas it is closed if either constriction is formed by hydrophobic L (i.e., L677 in WT or L681 in L677N/N681L) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). Taken together, our data indicates that in the PKD2 WT channel, the pore is kept closed in the resting state by the hydrophobic residue L677.</p>

        <title>PKD2 GOF gate mutants in vivo</title>
        <p id="Par15">We next examined the function of PKD2 GOF gate mutants in zebrafish embryos in which knockdown of the PKD2 through injection of morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) resulted in tail curvature and pronephric cysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Although it remains unclear as to how tail curvature is induced by PKD2 knockdown, the presence of pronephric cysts is reminiscent of the renal cysts in human ADPKD patients and can be observed under regular light microscopy from 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) onward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Injection of 1âng PKD2 MO into one-cell zebrafish embryos within 1âh post-fertilization resulted in tail curling to various degrees at 3 dpf, which was divided into four groups: normal (no tail curling), moderate (significant curling,â&lt;â90Â°), substantial (90Â°â180Â°) and severe (&gt;180Â°) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Co-injection with mRNAs encoding human PKD2 WT or mutant L677G but not L677W significantly rescued the tail curling phenotype and showed similar rescuing effects as GOF mutant F604P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Furthermore, double mutant F604P/L677G gave rise to a more pronounced rescuing effect than either the F604P or L677G single mutant (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), which is in agreement with the larger currents observed in F604P/L677G as compared to that of F604P or L677G (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d, f</xref>). When pronephric cysts were counted by microscopy (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), about 20% of larval fish with PKD2 MO injection at 3 dpf had cystic pronephros (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).

Similar to the tail curling assay, the F604P/L677G double mutant showed a more pronounced rescuing effect than the corresponding single mutants. The reason why human PKD2 GOF mutants did not completely rescue pronephric cysts (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) remained unclear.

        <title>Allosteric gating mechanisms in PKD2</title>
        <p id="Par16">To elucidate the activation mechanism of PKD2, we resolved a structure of the PKD2 F604P GOF mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, which our data suggest to be trapped in an activated state. We employed a truncated human PKD2 channel, E53-D792, in our structural study since it was shown to exhibit enhanced biochemical stability and structural homogeneity over the full-length protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. When expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, both the full-length and truncated PKD2 showed constitutive channel activities in the presence of the F604P mutation (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

        <p id="Par17">The S4âS5 linker was previously proposed to participate in allosteric gating of TRP channels and containsÂ numerous pathogenicÂ GOF or LOF mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Interestingly, when comparing the PKD2 WT and F604P structures, the S4-S5 linker was shown to exhibit a notable conformational change: the N-terminal end of the linker in F604P moved outward, which led to a dramatic displacement of the cationic residue R581 that is normally conserved in the TRPP family (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Indeed, the R581A substitution in PKD2 substantially reduced F604P channel activity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>) and the corresponding K461A substitution in PKD2L1 significantly reduced its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced currents in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>). These results further support the involvement of this region in PKD2 and PKD2L1 allosteric gating. Interestingly, the outward movement of theÂ N-terminal end of the S4-S5 linker was also observed in TRPML1 in a proposed pre-open state, but not in a closed state (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, indicating that the S4-S5 linker may play a similar role in the gating of PKD2 and TRPML1.</p>
        <p id="Par18">We previously observed a Ï-helix, formed by <sup>668</sup>MFFIL<sup>672</sup>, in the middle of S6 in PKD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and such a Ï-helix was also observed in TRPV1, -A1, -ML1, -ML3, -M4 and NOMPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). By comparing the TRPV2 and TRPV1 structures, transition of this Ï-helix to a canonical Î±-helix was previously hypothesized to mediate TRPV2 gating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Here, by directly comparing S6 of PKD2 WT and F604P mutant, we found a transition of the Ï-helix in WT PKD2 to the canonical Î±-helix in F604P mutant. This transition in PKD2 induced a combined twisting and bending motion of the distal S6 below the Ï-helix, resulting in twisting and splaying of gate residue L677 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) that expands the pore from 5 to 7.6âÃ (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The pore dilation observed in the F604P mutant is similar to that of TRPV1 (from 5.3 to 7.6âÃ by capsaicin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, TRPML1 (from 5.6 to 8.4âÃ by ML-SA1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and TRPML3 (from 5.3 to 10.4âÃ by ML-SA1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, despite the fact that they result from different gating motions (see Discussion and Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). In contrast to the dramatic changes of distal S6, the proximal S6 above the Ï-helix remained rather stationary in PKD2 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), suggesting that the transition from Ï- to Î±-helix alone is sufficient to induce pore opening and channel activation. The twisting motion in PKD2 not only induced the gate residue L677 to rotate and point away from the pore center, but also resulted in turning of the precedent residue F676 towards the pore (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). In other words, the F676 points away from the pore in the PKD2 WT and mutant L677N (resting state), but faces the pore in the F604P mutant (activated state) as a result of the twisting. We next examined the functional consequences of the rotation of F676. In the presence of the L677N mutation, replacing F676 with either a large hydrophobic residue (Y or W) or with a small residue (G or A) had little effect on PKD2 channel activity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>), consistent with the WT PKD2 structure where F676 points away from the pore. In mutant F604P, however, the channel activity was significantly blocked by substitution of F676 with Y or W, but not with G or A (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>), consistent with the observation that residue F676 now points towards the pore. Because large hydrophobic residue substitutions at L677 also significantly blocked F604P channel activity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>), these data suggest the presence of a double-residue gate F676-L677 when PKD2 is in an activated state.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>PKD2 S6 conformational changes induced by F604P mutation. <bold>a</bold> Side view of superposition of S6 in the PKD2 WT (blue) and F604P (orange).

        <p id="Par19">Taken together, our structural and functional data suggested a gating mechanism of PKD2 whereby a transition of Ï-helix to Î±-helix in the middle of S6 induces twisting and splaying of the hydrophobic gate residue that leads to expansion of the pore and channel activation.

      <p id="Par20">The gate of an ion channel is defined as the part of the ion conducting pore that effectively prevents ion passage when the channel is in a closed state and undergoes conformational changes to allow ion permeation upon channel activation. TRPV1 structures revealed two physical constrictions along the ion conducting pore, one formed by the hydrophilic G643 residue in the selectivity filter (also called upper gate) and the other by hydrophobic I679 residue at the lower gate (also called activation gate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Interestingly, agonist capsaicin only induced widening of the activation gate, while resiniferatoxin (RTX) and spider double-knot toxin (DkTx) together induced widening of both the activation gate and selectivity filter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, suggesting that the hydrophobic I679 may serve as a primary gate and the hydrophilic G463 as a secondary gate involved in activation by only a subset of TRPV1 agonists, e.g., RTX/DkTx. All reported PKD2 structures revealed two similar constrictions along the pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Compared to the PKD2 WT structure captured in a closed state, the constitutively active F604P mutant showed no significant change in the selectivity filter (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8b</xref>), suggesting that the selectivity filter does not act as a gate in F604P mutation-induced activation. It remains to be determined whether it could serve as a secondary gate in the presence of some unidentifiedÂ agonists. The activation gate in PKD2 was previously proposed to be constituted by L677 and N681, based on the observation that each of them forms similar physical constriction points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, the activation gate of PKD2 has not yet been functionally characterized. Our data now indicated that the PKD2 activation gate is primarily defined by the hydrophobic L677 and that the hydrophilic N681 is less effective than L677 in preventing ion permeation. Interestingly, all resolved structures of TRP channels in closed states to date revealed that pore diameters at gates are all within 5â6âÃ (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>), which is comparable to the sizes of hydrated Na<sup>+</sup> (5.5âÃ) and K<sup>+</sup> (4.6âÃ) ions. Therefore, the effect of physical constriction alone would be insufficient to completely prevent ion permeation in the closed state, which explains why gate residues in TRP channels have all converged to be hydrophobic during evolution. Taken together, activation gates in TRP channels block ion permeation in closed states via two synergistic mechanisms: hydrophobic barrier and physical constriction.</p>
      <p id="Par21">Although PKD2L1 and PKD2 are close homologues (54% overall amino acid identity) and share 10 identical amino acids around the lower gate, we found that they adopt distinct gate apparatuses, i.e., the single-residue gate (L677) in PKD2 vs. the double-residue gate (L557-A558) in PKD2L1. Interestingly, PKD2 is highly conserved during evolution and its orthologs have been identified in lower organisms such as yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. PKD2L1, meanwhile, is currently only found in higher organisms. We speculate that PKD2L1 may first arise via duplication of the PKD2 gene, and during revolution residues outside the pore diverged from PKD2, which necessitates a concerted accommodating structural changes at the pore (e.g., gate residue twisting), resulting in a double-residue gate. We previously also identified double-residue gates in TRPV5 and TRPV6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. It would be interesting to examine whether and how these double-residue gates are related to biophysical properties and physiological function of PKD2L1, TRPV5, or TRPV6.</p>
      <p id="Par22">The gating of an ion channel may involve complex conformational changes that ultimately lead to movements of the gate and pore opening. To date, at least three generic modes of gating motion have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The first one consists of a rigid-body iris-like rotation of the pore-lining helices around the pore axis (e.g.,Â in MscS channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>). In the second mode, a hinge in the middle of pore-lining helices allows the distal helices to kink at the hinge to open the gate upon activation. A conserved glycine residue in many K<sup>+</sup> channels has been identified to act as such a hinge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The third mode involves a hinge together with additional retraction of an aromatic gate residue which is found in several K<sup>+</sup> channels, including KirBac1.1 and KirBac3.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In this study, we revealed a gating motion in PKD2 that involves the transition of a Ï-helix to Î±-helix in the middle of the pore-lining S6, resulting in a combined twisting and bending motion of the distal S6, which led to twisting and splaying of gate residue L677 and pore opening (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Such a transition was initially proposed as a gating mechanism in TRPV2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. It should be kept in mind that a truncated PKD2 mutant E53-D792 was used in our structural studies while the full-length PKD2 was used in the functional assays. The structure of this PKD2 truncated mutant might be different from that of full-length PKD2, which may lead to misinterpretation of our functional data in the structural context. This Ï-helix structure is present in several other TRP channels, including TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPML1, TRPML3, NOMPC, TRPM4, and TRPV6, but not in TRPV2 or TRPM8 (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>), suggesting that the Ï-helix may represent a shared gating element for many TRP channels, similar to the gating hinge (conserved glycine residue) in K<sup>+</sup> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the most recently published TRPV6 structures in closed and open states revealed an Î±-helix to Ï-helix transition during TRPV6 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, which is opposite to the Ï-helix to Î±-helix transition associated with PKD2 activation. Of note, the Ï-helix could function differently in the gating of individual TRP members. In TRPV1, the Ï-helix more likely acts as a hinge to allow bending of the distal S6 upon activation induced by agonist capsaicin (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), analogous to the glycine hinge in K<sup>+</sup> channels mentioned above. In TRPML1 and TRPML3, the Ï-helix does not seem to play a critical role in agonist ML-SA1-induced channel activation, which is accomplished by displacement of the entire S6 helix (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). The diverse roles of Ï-helices possibly reflect the fact that TRP channels are polymodal receptors responding to multiple stimuli. Future efforts are needed to resolve more open-state structures in the presence of different stimuli to elucidate the dynamic functions of the Ï-helix in the gating of TRP channels.</p>
      <p id="Par23">To date, several studies have reported that cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> can act as an agonist of PKD2 at low concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. It is highly possible that PKD2 also has other unidentified agonists. These agonists, including Ca<sup>2+</sup>, may utilize gating mechanisms distinct from that associated with the F604P mutation. Cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was reported to increase the probability of PKD2 opening at low concentrations while inhibiting PKD2 opening at high concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Consistent with the two modes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation, two distinct PKD2 structures in complex with Ca<sup>2+</sup> were determined. The more open structure has one Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion bound below the selectivity filter while the other structure, hypothesized to be in an inactivated state, is bound with multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Interestingly, comparison of the two structures revealed a local conformational change in the middle of S6, resulting in a prominent movement of the L677 and pore opening (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>), which is distinct from the movement induced by the F604P mutation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>). Both the PKD2 F604P and WT structures with one Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion bound showed a pore diameter of 7.6âÃ at the lower gate (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>), whereas a functional study using organic monovalent cations of various sizes predicted the PKD2 pore diameter to be around 11âÃ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. It could be that the PKD2 channel in the functional study resides in a state that is different from those revealed by the structural studies. Although it remains unclear how PKD2 is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, an EF-hand domain containing two helix-loop-helix (or EF-hand) motifs was identified in the PKD2 C-terminus for Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the number and location of EF-hand motifs were shown to be important for the regulation of PKD2 function by Ca<sup>2+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In human PKD2, the first EF-hand motif lacks Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding capability due to loss of four evolutionarily conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating residues in the loop region. In lower species such as sea urchin, however, both EF-motifs are functional and act cooperatively, resulting in a much higher affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The addition of the four missing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding residues to the first EF-hand motif in human PKD2 restored a functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site and enhanced the regulation of PKD2 channel function by Ca<sup>2+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. At low Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to an EF-hand may lead to conformational changes in the PKD2 C-terminus, which may then propagate to the lower gate and result in pore opening. Meanwhile, at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site(s) outside the PKD2 C-terminus with low Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity, such as the selectivity filter and outer pore regions, may start to bind with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and inactivate the PKD2 channel.</p>
      <p id="Par24">Our current functional and structural studies demonstrated that PKD2 can form a homotetrameric channel in heterologous expression systems. In physiological conditions, PKD2 is generally hypothesized to function in a complex with PKD1 in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells. This concept was challenged by a recent report showing that PKD2 forms an essential ion channel independent of PKD1 in the primary cilium of the renal collecting duct epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This ciliary PKD2 channel was shown to preferentially conduct Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> over Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Our structures of PKD2 WT and F604P mutant provided guidance for mutagenesis studies to explore the structural basis underlying PKD2 preference for monovalent cations over Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Although exhibiting low Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance, PKD2 was found to be inhibited by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and potentiated by intraciliary Ca<sup>2+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The positive regulation by intraciliary Ca<sup>2+</sup> could be dependent on the C-terminal EF-hand domains, which are not resolved in our PKD2 structures. The structure of full-length PKD2 would be valuable to provide insights into the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of PKD2 activity.</p>
      <p id="Par25">It is currently unclear how exactly the F604P mutation induces the transition of Ï-helix to Î±-helix and consequently pore opening. Superimposition of WT and F604P structures revealed no notable changes in the TOP domain, S1âS4 helices and selectivity filter (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), suggesting that these parts are not involved in F604P-induced channel activation. Interestingly, we observed dramatic changes in the N-terminus of the S4âS5 linker induced by the PKD2 F604P mutation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>), and intramolecular proximity among the S4âS5 linker, pre-S1 and TRP/TRP-like domain in structures of TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV6, TRPA1, and NOMPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. We thus proposed a gating mechanism of PKD2 that depends on interactions/coupling among S4âS5 linker, pre-S1 and TRP-like domain (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). In this gating scenario, the mutation F604P creates a kink in the middle of S5 and results in a bending of the bottom half of S5, which induces an outward movement of N-terminus of the S4âS5 linker. This displacement in the S4âS5 linker is then coupled by synchronized movements of the pre-S1 and TRP-like domain, which together induce energy release in the Ï-helix in S6, triggering a transition to an Î±-helix. Of note, the TRP-like domain in PKD2 is a continuation of the S6 helix and is almost perpendicular to the membrane whereas the TRP/TRP-like domain in TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPA1, or TRPV6 is largely parallel to the membrane and perpendicular to S6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par26">Since PKD2 and PKD2L1 share a conserved S6 sequence and overall tetrameric architecture with other TRP channels, our strategy of generating GOF mutants via gate residue substitutions is likely generally applicable to other TRPs without known agonists, e.g., TRPC1. Gene knockout animals were reported to show no expected phenotypes via activation of compensatory networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Here, we identified a series of GOF gate mutants with channel activity increasedÂ to various extents, which would allow generating alternative GOF animal models through knock-in technology to study the in vivo function of TRP members, including PKD2L1 and PKD2. This approach is encouraged by our zebrafish experiments, which showed that the PKD2 GOF gate mutants are functional in vivo. However, knock-in of a strong GOF mutant may also be deleterious, e.g., due to cytotoxic cation overload.</p>
      <p id="Par27">In summary, we have identified hydrophobic gates in PKD2L1 (L557-A558) and PKD2 (L677) in the distal part of the S6 helix and obtained a series of GOF and LOF gate mutants. PKD2 GOF gate mutants showed rescuing effect on PKD2 knockdown-induced tail curling and pronephric cysts in embryonic zebrafish. We also resolved a structure of the PKD2 F604P mutant by cryo-EM and identified a PKD2 gating mechanism involving a Ï- to Î±-helix transition within S6, which induces twisting and splaying of the gate residue and consequently channel activation. Our findings provided insights into the fundamental channel function of PKD2, which is essential for developing therapeutic interventions for ADPKD.</p>

Seveenty-two hours of post-transduction, cells were harvested to obtain crude membrane for affinity purification using amylose resin (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA).

CTF parameters for micrographs were obtained using CTFFIND4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. Semi-automated particle selection was performed using Simplified Application Managing Utility for EM Labs (SAMUEL, written by Maofu Liao, Havard Medical School) scripts and displayed in SamViewer (program written by Maofu Liao) for interactively removing ice and protein aggregates. RELION<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> was used for all 2D and 3D processing steps. Particles were sorted into 2D classes with âbadâ particles rejected (i.e., those thatÂ are incoherent or poorly resolved classes) by downstream analyses. Specifically, 661,905 particles were initially selected from 1992 micrographs, which was followed by a round of 2D classification and another round of 3D classification to reject bad particles from further analyses (e.g., in silico purification), which lead to a final dataset of ~387,454 particles for subsequent 3D reconstruction. The PKD2 structure (EMD-8354, low-pass filtered to 60âÃ), with C4 symmetry imposed, was used as the starting model for 3D classification and refinement. We also carried out reconstruction without imposing 4-fold symmetry, which yielded a map that exhibits C4 symmetry except at disordered loops and the amphipol belt that surrounds the transmembrane region of the channel. Since the map calculated with C4 symmetry was better resolved, we used this map for model building and structural analyses. RELION post-processing using unfiltered half maps with automatic mask resulted in a 3.5âÃ resolution map. The automask option in RELION generated a mask that extends 6 pixels beyond a preset density threshold of 0.016. Local resolution was calculated by RELION. UCSF Chimera was used to visualize and segment density maps, and generate figures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.

The model was refined in real space with PHENIX, and assessed in Molprobity (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). To test for overfitting, the model was randomly displaced by 0.2âÃ and refined against one of the half maps (half map 1) generated in RELION. FSC curves were then calculated between the refined model vs. both half maps generated in RELION, which revealed a general agreement between the two plots that indicates that the model is not overfitted (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>
