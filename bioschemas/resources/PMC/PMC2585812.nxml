      <abstract>
        <p>Adaptor protein (AP) complexes regulate clathrin-coated vesicle assembly, protein cargo sorting, and vesicular trafficking between organelles in eukaryotic cells. Because disruption of the various subunits of the AP complexes is embryonic lethal in the majority of cases, characterization of their function <italic>in vivo</italic> is still lacking. Here, we describe the first mutation in the human <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene, encoding the small subunit Ï1A of the AP-1 complex. This founder splice mutation, which leads to a premature stop codon, was found in four families with a unique syndrome characterized by mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratodermia (MEDNIK). To validate the pathogenic effect of the mutation, we knocked down <italic>Ap1s1</italic> expression in zebrafish using selective antisens morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO). The knockdown phenotype consisted of perturbation in skin formation, reduced pigmentation, and severe motility deficits due to impaired neural network development. Both neural and skin defects were rescued by co-injection of AMO with wild-type (WT) human <italic>AP1S1</italic> mRNA, but not by co-injecting the truncated form of <italic>AP1S1</italic>, consistent with a loss-of-function effect of this mutation. Together, these results confirm <italic>AP1S1</italic> as the gene responsible for MEDNIK syndrome and demonstrate a critical role of <italic>AP1S1</italic> in development of the skin and spinal cord.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>We describe a novel genetic syndrome that we named MEDNIK, to designate a disease characterized by mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, ichthyosis and keratodermia. This syndrome was found in four French-Canadian families with a common ancestor and is caused by a mutation in the <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene. This gene encodes a subunit (Ï1A) of an adaptor protein complex (AP-1) involved in the organisation and transport of many other proteins within the cell. By using rapidly developing zebrafish embryos as a model, we observed that the loss of this gene resulted in broad defects, including skin malformation and severe motor deficits due to impairment of spinal cord development. By expressing the human <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene instead of the zebrafish <italic>ap1s1</italic> gene, we found that the normal human <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene could rescue these developmental deficits but not the human <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene bearing the disease-related mutation. Together, our results confirm <italic>AP1S1</italic> as the gene responsible for MEDNIK syndrome and demonstrate a critical role of <italic>AP1S1</italic> in the development of the skin and the spinal cord.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein trafficking between organelles in eukaryotic cells is mainly mediated by clathrin-coated vesicles and their assembly requires adaptor protein (AP) complexes <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Bonifacino1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The AP complexes also determine protein cargo selection for transport between the trans-Golgi network (TGN), endosomes, lysosomes and the plasma membrane <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Boehm1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and clathrin is important in establishing the basolateral domain <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Deborde1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Four ubiquitous AP complexes (AP 1â4) have been characterized and each of them is composed of four subunits. The large subunits (Î±, Î³, Î´ or Îµ and Î²1â4) mediate binding to the target membrane and clathrin recruitment. The small subunit Ï is part of the AP complex core and has been suggested to contribute to the stabilization of the complex, in conjunction with the medium subunit Î¼, which is primarily involved in protein cargo sorting <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Ohno1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although the molecular understanding of the role of AP complexes in vesicular transport is progressing rapidly, the evidence for their role <italic>in vivo</italic> and in disease is more limited <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Boehm1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Ohno2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Knockdown or knockout of various AP-complex subunits has been attempted in different animal models, including the mouse Î³ and Î¼ subunits and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Ï subunits of AP-1A <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Boehm1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Ohno2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, these are all embryonic lethal, further emphasizing the importance of these complexes for appropriate development.</p>
      <p>So far, a few but severe genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding AP complex components have been described in humans. One of the most studied involves a mutation in the Î²3A subunit of AP-3 which underlies the HermanskyâPudlak syndrome 2 (HPS-2) <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Huizing1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This syndrome is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis with absence of platelet dense bodies and abnormal depositions of ceroid lipofuscin in various organs. Mutated <italic>AP3B3A</italic> is believed to cause abnormal formation of intracellular vesicles from the trans-Golgi network or late endosomes, and probably mistrafficking of lysosomal proteins <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Ohno2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Huizing1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recently, three mutations in <italic>AP1S2</italic>, encoding the Ï1B isoform of AP-1, have been associated with X-linked mental retardation <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Tarpey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. As AP-1 is associated with synaptophysin and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, it was suggested that these mutations cause abnormal synaptic development and function.</p>
      <p>Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by erythematous lesions and hyperkeratosis caused by mutations in two epidermally expressed connexin genes, <italic>GJB3</italic> (Cx31) and <italic>GJB4</italic> (Cx30.3) <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Richard1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Macari1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Because a significant proportion of EKV families do not have mutations in <italic>GJB3</italic> and <italic>GJB4</italic>, additional EKV genes remain to be identified <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Richard1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We previously described the identification a new locus on chromosome 7q22 for an atypical form of EKV, in families with EKV lesions, as well as lamellar and erythrodermic ichthyosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000296.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Saba1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition to the skin lesions, affected individuals from these families exhibit severe psychomotor retardation, peripheral neuropathy, and sensorineural hearing loss, together with elevated very-long-chain fatty acids and severe congenital diarrhea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000296.s003">Table S1</xref>). Given the similarities with the more recently described CEDNIK syndrome <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Spreche1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, we used the related acronym MEDNIK for <underline>m</underline>ental retardation, <underline>e</underline>nteropathy, <underline>d</underline>eafness, <underline>n</underline>europathy, <underline>i</underline>chthyosis, and <underline>k</underline>eratodermia to designate this unique syndrome. These MEDNIK families live in a relatively isolated population descended from a limited number of ancestors, and the gene responsible for this autosomal recessive syndrome was mapped by identifying a common homozygous region <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Saba1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In this study we present a novel splice mutation in human <italic>AP1S1</italic>, a ubiquitously-expressed gene encoding the small subunit Ï1A of AP-1, in four families with MEDNIK syndrome from the Quebec population. This founder mutation is predicted to cause the skipping of exon 3, leading to a premature stop codon at the beginning of exon 4. To further validate the <italic>AP1S1</italic> mutation, we knocked down native <italic>Ap1s1</italic> using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMOs) in the developing zebrafish and examined the ability of wild-type (WT) and mutated human mRNA to rescue the developmental phenotype. Overall, our results confirm that mutation of the <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene causes MEDNIK syndrome and suggest a critical implication for the <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene in development of the skin and spinal cord.</p>

        <title>Identification of Mutated <italic>AP1S1</italic> in Individuals with MEDNIK</title>
        <p>The region harbouring the causative gene for MEDNIK syndrome, previously named Erythrokeratodermia Variabilis type 3 (EKV3), was recently mapped to a 6.8 Mb segment of chromosome 7p using a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) panel in 3 families originating from the Bas-St-Laurent region in the province of Quebec (Canada), sharing a common ancestor at the 10th or 11th generation <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Saba1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. We genotyped a fourth pedigree, which enabled us to reduce the critical region to 5.3 Mb between markers D7S2539 and D7S518 (data not shown). Among the candidate genes mapping to that interval, <italic>GJE1</italic> (encoding a connexin) and <italic>CLDN15</italic> (encoding a claudin) were sequenced but no mutation was found. Recently, a mutation in a SNARE protein (SNAP29) was associated with cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis and palmoplantar keratoderma (CEDNIK) <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Spreche1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Since clinical manifestations of CEDNIK show striking similarities to the MEDNIK syndrome described here, we hypothesized that a mutation in <italic>AP1S1</italic>, a functionally related gene mapping to the candidate interval, may cause the disease. By sequencing the gene, we identified a mutation in the acceptor splice site (A to G) of exon 3 in all individuals with MEDNIK (IVS2-2A&gt;G). This splice mutation is predicted to cause skipping of exon 3, leading to a premature stop codon at the beginning of exon 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). All parents and an unaffected sibling were heterozygous for this mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g001">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>). This mutation was not observed in 180 CEPH controls.</p>

Relative expression levels of each mRNA species (scaled to 100% of control values on the y-axis) are shown for normal controls (N; nâ=â2) carriers (C; nâ=â6) and affected individuals (A; nâ=â3). Values were averaged from three independent experiments. 18S RNA was used to normalize the mRNA quantity. The expression levels from this latter mRNA species could not be distinguished from the wild-type in the carriers in this figure. The expression levels are indicated as percentage of the control values Inset: RT-PCR showing the different species observed. The upper band (166 bp) contains the full-length species in both the control (N) and the carrier (C), whereas the lower band (57 bp) corresponds to the species lacking exon 3. A third mRNA species lacking 9bp, generated by the use of a cryptic splice site, was confirmed by sequencing the upper band (157 bp) of the affected individual (A). D) Schematic representation of the Human AP1S1 gene. The A&gt;G mutation in the acceptor splice site of exon 3 predicts skipping of this exon, leading to a premature stop codon. The use of an alternative acceptor splice site within exon 3 results in a mRNA lacking 9 bps coding for an in frame protein. The location of the two different morpholinos used to knockdown <italic>Ap1s1</italic> in zebrafish, targeting either ATG or exon 3 acceptor splice site, are shown in green.</p>

        <p>In order to confirm the loss of exon 3, RT-PCR analyses were performed on mRNA isolated from fibroblasts using primers located in exons 2 and 4. As expected, a single band was observed in the controls. In contrast, two bands were detected in the carriers and patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Direct sequencing confirmed that the lower band corresponded to an mRNA isoform lacking exon 3. The higher band from the affected individuals corresponded to another RNA isoform, in which a cryptic splice acceptor site located 9 bp downstream of the start of the third exon was used. The resulting in frame protein is thus predicted to lack only three amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The full-length <italic>AP1S1</italic> mRNA species was not detected in these individuals. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from mutation carriers and controls fibroblasts. Whereas heterozygous carriers had wild-type mRNA levels ranging form 40 to 75% of the expected value, the relative expression levels of both mutant isoforms was very low in affected individuals, corresponding to less than 10 % of the expected amount of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

<italic>Ap1s1</italic> Knockdown in Zebrafish: Morphological Phenotype</title>
        <p>To validate whether the <italic>AP1S1</italic> mutation found in MEDNIK patients alters the biological function of this gene, we first knocked down <italic>Ap1s1</italic> in zebrafish by inhibiting mRNA translation using an AMO <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Nasevicius1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> targeting its start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The morphological deficits of 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf) knocked down (KD) larvae (nâ=â68/91) are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g002">Figure 2</xref>, as the treatment was embryonic lethal at later stages. The 48 hpf <italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae were well formed but smaller in size compared to WT, and had reduced pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g002">Figures 2A and 2D</xref>). In addition, the KD larvae revealed prominent changes in the skin organization which were most visible in the fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g002">Figures 2B and 2E</xref>). In contrast to the well-defined, fan-like, ray structure of the WT caudal fin, the fin of the <italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae was disorganized with rounded-up cells conferring a rough outline. Immature WT larvae did not show abnormal morphology of the skin and fin, suggesting that this phenotype is specific to the morpholino treatment rather than a general developmental retardation. The specificity of the AMO effect was confirmed by using Ap1s1 Western blotting and immunolabelling in wholemount larvae. With both methods we observed a decrease in the intensity of the Ap1s1-specific labeling in the <italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g002">Figures 2F and 2C</xref>).

        <p>To determine if an increase in cell death underlies the skin phenotype in the KD embryo, we stained these larvae with the vital dye acridine orange <xref rid="pgen.1000296-FurutaniSeiki1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We did not observe a difference compared with control (not shown), suggesting that the skin and fin disorganization was not due to an initial outgrowth followed by tissue degradation. We further tested whether the skin malformation was due to a problem in early epidermal patterning by using immunolabeling for p63, a marker of basal keratinocyte nuclei <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Despite the prominent changes in the size and the shape of the tail, p63-positive keratinocytes were present both in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and KD larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To look for a change in the population of proliferating cells, we performed immunolabelling with the phosphorylated-histone-H3 (PH3) antibody to visualize cells undergoing histone modification during mitosis, which did not reveal any obvious difference between the KD and control larvae (not illustrated). Similar results were obtained with co-immunostaining against p63 and PH3, suggesting unaffected proliferation level of basal keratinocytes population in the KD larvae (not illustrated). To further investigate whether the keratinocytes in the KD larvae exhibit specific abnormalities, we immunolabeled WT and KD larvae for laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>) and for cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g003">Figures 3E and 3F</xref>). Laminins, in particular laminin 5, are synthesized by keratinocytes and are their main anchor to the basement membrane <xref rid="pgen.1000296-OToole1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, while cadherins are localized to the keratinocyte cell membrane and are essential in maintaining cell-cell adhesion <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

The number of newly born neurons in KD larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g004">Figure 4H</xref>, nâ=â3, 41Â±3) significantly decreased to 51% of control, WT, levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g004">Figure 4C</xref> , nâ=â3, 81Â±9, p&lt;0.001).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we demonstrated that the autosomal recessive MEDNIK syndrome, described in the population of Quebec, is caused by a founder mutation in <italic>AP1S1</italic>. More specifically, we have shown that the A to G mutation in the acceptor splice site of exon 3 of <italic>AP1S1</italic> (IVS2-2A&gt;G) was associated with skipping of this exon, leading to a premature stop codon. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a mutation in the human <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene. We also demonstrated that the IVS2-2A&gt;G mutation produced a loss of function effect in zebrafish. These findings support the conclusion that the <italic>AP1S1</italic>-exon 3 mutation is indeed pathogenic. Our results are consistent with the recent description of a mutation in SNAP29, a regulator of vesicle fusion to target membrane, found in CEDNIK syndrome. Indeed, the CEDNIK syndrome shows striking similarities to MEDNIK and mutated genes in these two diseases play a role in vesicular trafficking <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Spreche1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>

<italic>In Vivo</italic> Characterization of AP1S1 Function</title>
        <p>Little is known about the Ï subunit role in AP complex formation and function <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is suggested that AP1S1 contributes to the AP complex core stabilization <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Ohno1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, in AP-1 and AP-3, the Ï subunit is suggested to interact with âdileucine-basedâ recognition signal on cargo proteins, in combination with the Î³ or the Î´ subunit respectively. Therefore, this implicates the Ï subunit in protein sorting as well <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Janvier1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, attempts to interfere with AP1S1 function <italic>in vivo</italic> were not successful so far, as they resulted in embryonic lethality. Similar results were obtained by interfering with most of the other subunits of the AP-1 complex, further emphasizing its importance for appropriate development <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Boehm1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Ohno2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In this study, we knocked down <italic>Ap1s1</italic> in zebrafish and were able to rescue the morphological and behavioral phenotypes observed in KD larvae by co-injecting WT human <italic>AP1S1</italic> mRNA, which further support the specificity of the <italic>Ap1s1</italic> knockdown. The remaining levels of Ap1s1 protein may explain viability in zebrafish, at least for the first 48 hours of development. However, because some of the AP complexes have overlapping function, compensation by other AP complexes cannot be excluded <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Ohno1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Folsch1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Nevertheless, since the <italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae exhibit severe deficits, neither residual levels of AP-1A and B, nor the activity of other AP complexes were sufficient for appropriate development of many cell types (skin, pigment and neural).</p>
        <p>In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that disruption of an AP-1 subunit, more specifically the Ï1A subunit, causes perturbation in epithelial cell development <italic>in vivo</italic>. The presence of p63 immuno positive basal cytokeratinocytes in the KD larva suggested that knocking down <italic>Ap1s1</italic> did not interfere with early epidermal patterning. The skin phenotype was not accompanied by an increased cell death or in the level of proliferating basal keratinocytes. Carney <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Carney1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> observed an increase in proliferating basal keratinocytes in zebrafish mutants suffering from severe epithelial disintegration and suggested that this phenomenon is a secondary consequence of inflammation and consequent loss of epithelial integrity. The lack of increased proliferation in our study could be explained by the presence of sufficient residual laminin to provide some anchoring for the keratinocytes, allowing the maintenance of some epithelial properties. However these residual levels of laminin appeared insufficient for appropriate basement membrane development. Interestingly, zebrafish embryos carrying a mutation in the gene encoding for laminin 5 suffer from severe deficits in fin formation due to disruption in basement membrane integrity <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Webb1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In <italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae, we also found an alteration in the localization of cadherin in basal keratinocytes, which was not accompanied by changes in cytokeratin localization, suggesting that this component of epithelial cells cytoskeleton remain unaffected by <italic>AP1S1</italic> dysfunction. Interestingly, the nature of the specific adaptor complex that recognizes the cadherin dileucine sorting motif is unknown, although AP-1 is a candidate <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Based on these observations, we suggest that <italic>Ap1s1</italic> knockdown resulted in failure to localize cadherin to the basolateral cell membrane which, together with an abnormal pattern of expression of laminin 5, lead to a loss of epidermal layer integrity.</p>

        <title>Behavioral Deficits and Abnormal Neural Development</title>
        <p>The well-formed 48 hpf <italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae showed a severe behavioral phenotype. Instead of reacting to touch by swimming, the KD larvae coiled in a motility pattern distinctive of younger embryos. Consistent with this observation, detailed examination of the spinal cord revealed an abnormal development. The extent of axonal processes was diminished and the number of newly born neurons was reduced to half of the WT levels due mainly to a decrease in the interneuron population, but not in motoneurons. Interestingly, as observed in the skin, no change was seen in the levels of neuronal progenitors in the spinal cord. There is mounting evidence that AP complexes such as AP-2 and AP-3 are implicated in neural function <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Bonanomi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. For example, mice with knockout of the AP-3 Î¼3Î subunit are susceptible to epileptic seizures because of deficient GABAergic vesicle formation and function <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Nakatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

The loss of AP-3 in these mice affected spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release in hippocampal mossy fiber synapses <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Scheuber1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. AP-2 is implicated in selective endocytosis and recycling of synaptic vesicles and also of receptors and transporters from the plasma membrane of nerve terminals <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Bonanomi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Nakatsu2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. For example, internalization of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors by binding to AP-2 is essential for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced long-term-depression in the hippocampus and therefore to synaptic plasticity <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Kastning1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

Moreover, AP-1 binds to the ubiquitous microtubule-associated motor protein KIF13A, a member of a protein family implicated in neuronal transport of membranous organelles, synaptic vesicles and proteins from the cell body to the axons and dendrites <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Nakagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Hirokawa1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Mice with mutations in members of this protein family (KIF1A, KIF1BÎ²) show reduced synaptic vesicles in the synaptic terminals and suffer from in sensory-motor deficits <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Also, mutations in <italic>KIF1BÎ²</italic> cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary peripheral neuropathy type 2A in humans <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. It is thus possible that AP1S1, in addition to its possible implication in synaptic vesicles regulation and formation, could be implicated in their transport toward the neural processes. Although not much is known about the precise role of AP-1 in the developing central nervous system, we show here that the disruption of the AP-1 function is associated with substantial perturbation of a subset of spinal interneuron differentiation.</p>

        <title>The Zebrafish <italic>Ap1s1</italic> Knockdown and Its Contribution to Understanding of the MEDNIK Syndrome</title>
        <p>
<italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae exhibit abnormal development of neurons and skin cells, a phenotype that shows similarities to the clinical manifestations observed in individuals with MEDNIK. Based on the observation of reduced neurogenesis we have made in zebrafish, we speculate that MEDNIK syndrome in affected patients is caused by an impaired development of various neural networks, including the spinal cord (ataxia and peripheral neuropathy) and possibly the brain (microcephaly and psychomotor retardation) and inner ear (sensorineural deafness). We also hypothesize that disruption of AP1S1 in humans may be associated with more extensive perturbation of organogenesis. Indeed, growth retardation, digestive tract malformations and dysfunction (chronic diarrhea), and elevation of very long chain fatty acid observed in individuals with MEDNIK syndrome might reflect more widespread perturbation of vesicular transport and of epithelial cell development. One intriguing question is why the <italic>AP1S1</italic>-exon 3 mutation is not lethal in homozygous individuals with MEDNIK. Indeed, overexpression of human <italic>AP1S1</italic>-exon3 mRNA failed to rescue the phenotype observed in <italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae, suggesting a loss of function of this critical protein. However, co-injection of the <italic>AP1S1</italic>-9bp human mutant mRNA with AMO, the alternative RNA species detected in our MEDNIK patients, rescued the phenotype, suggesting that this alternative splicing results in a functional protein. The expression of that protein isoform in patients may thus explain their viability. The fact that the <italic>AP1S1</italic>-9bp mRNA is expressed at low levels (less than 10 % of normal levels in fibroblasts) could explain why it is not sufficient to sustain normal development and function and further highlight the important role of AP1S1 in normal development. Furthermore, the expression levels of the different AP1S1 isoforms may vary from one tissue to another, as well as between individuals, thereby contributing to the variability of the phenotype.</p>
        <p>Overall, these observations in zebrafish, in light of previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Bonanomi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Scheuber1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1000296-Folsch2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000296-Valencia1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, suggest that AP1S1 and AP-1 complex are most likely implicated in appropriate protein sorting and transport. Interference with these pathways could therefore result in perturbation of cellular organization and be detrimental for the development of specific cell subpopulations, as we observed respectively in the skin and the spinal cord of the <italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae. The results suggest avenues for both basic and clinical research, in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying MEDNIK and related neuro-cutaneous syndromes.</p>
