      <abstract>
        <p>The gene encoding a DNA/RNA binding protein <italic>FUS/TLS</italic> is frequently mutated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations commonly affect its carboxy-terminal nuclear localization signal, resulting in varying deficiencies of FUS nuclear localization and abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation. Increasing evidence suggests deficiencies in FUS nuclear function may contribute to neuron degeneration. Here we report a novel FUS autoregulatory mechanism and its deficiency in ALS-associated mutants. Using FUS CLIP-seq, we identified significant FUS binding to a highly conserved region of exon 7 and the flanking introns of its own pre-mRNAs. We demonstrated that FUS is a repressor of exon 7 splicing and that the exon 7-skipped splice variant is subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Overexpression of <italic>FUS</italic> led to the repression of exon 7 splicing and a reduction of endogenous FUS protein. Conversely, the repression of exon 7 was reduced by knockdown of FUS protein, and moreover, it was rescued by expression of EGFP-FUS. This dynamic regulation of alternative splicing describes a novel mechanism of FUS autoregulation. Given that ALS-associated FUS mutants are deficient in nuclear localization, we examined whether cells expressing these mutants would be deficient in repressing exon 7 splicing. We showed that FUS harbouring R521G, R522G or ÎExon15 mutation (minor, moderate or severe cytoplasmic localization, respectively) directly correlated with respectively increasing deficiencies in both exon 7 repression and autoregulation of its own protein levels. These data suggest that compromised FUS autoregulation can directly exacerbate the pathogenic accumulation of cytoplasmic FUS protein in ALS. We showed that exon 7 skipping can be induced by antisense oligonucleotides targeting its flanking splice sites, indicating the potential to alleviate abnormal cytoplasmic FUS accumulation in ALS. Taken together, FUS autoregulation by alternative splicing provides insight into a molecular mechanism by which FUS-regulated pre-mRNA processing can impact a significant number of targets important to neurodegeneration.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>
<italic>FUS/TLS</italic> is a frequently mutated gene in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is characterized by a progressive degeneration of motor neurons. The abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of mutant FUS protein is a characteristic pathology of ALS; however, recent evidence increasingly suggests deficiencies in FUS nuclear function may also contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS. Here we report a novel autoregulatory mechanism of FUS by alternative splicing and nonsense mediated decay (NMD). We show FUS binds to exon 7 and flanking introns of its own pre-mRNAs. This results in exon skipping, inducing a reading frame shift and subsequent degradation of the splice variants. As such, this mechanism provides a feedback loop that controls the homeostasis of FUS protein levels. This balance is disrupted in ALS-associated FUS mutants, which are deficient in nuclear localization and FUS-dependent alternative splicing. As a result, the abnormal accumulation of mutant FUS protein in ALS neurons goes unchecked and uncontrolled. Our study provides novel insight into the molecular mechanism by which FUS regulates gene expression and new understanding of the role of FUS in disease at the molecular level. This may lead to new potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of ALS.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neuronal degenerative disorder caused by progressive loss of motor neurons in brain and spinal cord, leading to paralysis and death <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. <italic>FUS</italic> is a frequently mutated gene in ALS (combining familial and sporadic ALS), in addition to C9ORF72, SOD1 and TDP-43 <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Robberecht1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Most ALS-associated <italic>FUS</italic> mutations are within the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the carboxyl terminus <xref rid="pgen.1003895-DaCruz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-LagierTourenne1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-LagierTourenne2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, resulting in increased cytoplasmic FUS localization <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Kino1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Dormann1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The abnormal cytoplasmic aggregation of FUS mutants in neuron and glial cells is a pathological hallmark of ALS and some cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Kwiatkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It's noteworthy that there is a correlation between the observed cytoplasmic FUS accumulation and the age of ALS onset, with the more cytoplasmic FUS accumulation the earlier age of disease onset <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Kwiatkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Bosco1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Waibel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Several studies suggest that cytoplasmic accumulation of FUS mutant protein can lead to direct cytoplasmic cytotoxicity or may indirectly result in the loss of FUS function in the nucleus. Studies in yeast models demonstrated that expression of ALS-associated FUS mutants can lead to protein aggregation and cytotoxicity that recapitulate FUS proteinopathy <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Fushimi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Investigations in some <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and rat models showed that expression of ALS-associated FUS mutants can lead to motor neuron dysfunction and neurodegeneration <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, some <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish models support that the loss of FUS function can lead to behavioral and structural defects of motor neurons <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Kabashi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Iijima1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Exactly how the loss of FUS nuclear function and/or the gain of cytoplasmic cytotoxicity contribute to neurodegeneration at the molecular level is still unknown.</p>
      <p>FUS is predominantly a nuclear protein <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and binds both DNA and RNA <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Zinszner1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Baechtold1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. FUS is involved in multiple steps of RNA metabolism including transcription, pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA transport for site specific translation <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Dormann2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The alteration of FUS-regulated RNA processing is a proposed key event in ALS pathogenesis, given that RNA binding proteins and splicing misregulation are linked to neurological diseases <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Kwiatkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Anthony1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Rabin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. To understand the normal function of FUS in RNA processing, it is essential to identify FUS RNA targets. Recently a large number of FUS RNA targets in various cell lines and neural tissues were identified by CLIP-seq (cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, followed by high-throughput sequencing), a method to purify protein-RNA complexes coupled with deep sequencing <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ishigaki1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Nakaya1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The challenge now is to begin to understand what the biological significance of FUS-regulated RNA processing is, and how these processes are altered in FUS mutants and may therefore contribute to ALS pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>Our CLIP-seq data in HeLa cells show that FUS binding is enriched in introns flanking cassette exons of pre-mRNAs. Among the identified FUS-binding cassette exons and their flanking introns, the most highly enriched target is exon 7 and flanking introns of <italic>FUS</italic> pre-mRNA itself. Here we demonstrate that FUS is a repressor of exon 7 and that the exon 7-skipped splice variants of <italic>FUS</italic> are subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Overexpression of <italic>FUS</italic> leads to repression of exon 7 splicing and predictably a reduction of endogenous FUS protein levels. Conversely, knockdown of FUS protein reduces the repression of exon 7. Moreover, the reduction of exon 7 repression can be rescued by the expression of EGFP-FUS. Taken together, these studies show that FUS dynamically autoregulates its own protein levels by directly modulating the alternative splicing of exon 7. Furthermore, our data show that ALS-associated FUS mutants are deficient in nuclear localization, exon 7 repression and autoregulation of its own protein levels. We propose that the compromised FUS autoregulation in ALS forms a feed-forward loop, exacerbating the abnormal cytoplasmic FUS accumulation, and as such, provides a molecular mechanism that can potentially contribute to ALS pathogenesis.</p>

        <title>FUS CLIP-seq identified significant FUS binding to introns flanking cassette exons</title>
        <p>To identify RNA targets of FUS, we performed FUS CLIP-seq in HeLa cells. Western blot and autoradiography showed successful immunoprecipitation of FUS protein and FUS-RNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g001">Figure 1A, 1B and 1C</xref>). Sequencing of FUS CLIP RNA yielded 1,879,212 non-redundant reads mapped to human genome GRCh37, with the majority (1,305,507 reads) to pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003895.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Using the peak-finding algorithm CisGenome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/cisgenome/">www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/cisgenome/</ext-link>) <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ji1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, we identified 1928 FUS CLIP clusters (sites containing significantly enriched overlapping FUS CLIP tags) corresponding to 1149 target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003895.s010">Table S1</xref>) in HeLa cells. FUS RNA targets identified by our CLIP-seq were compared with those previously identified by other CLIP-seq <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ishigaki1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-LagierTourenne3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Nakaya1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, PAR-CLIP <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Hoell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and RIP-chip <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Colombrita1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003895.s002">Figure S2</xref>). HeLa and HEK293 cells <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Hoell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> share 845 common target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003895.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003895.s011">Table S2</xref>), accounting for 74% of all identified targets in HeLa cells. Gene Ontology (GO) biological process (BP) analysis of these 845 genes showed an enrichment of genes regulating gene expression and transcription. Analysis of various CLIP-seq datasets of mouse brains or neurons <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ishigaki1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-LagierTourenne3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Nakaya1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> identified 508 common genes, which are enriched for genes regulating cell adhesion, synaptic transmission, glutamate signaling pathways and nervous system development. 120 genes are common to all the datasets analyzed, and show an enrichment of genes regulating cell motion and protein dephosphorylation. Taken together, our analyses revealed cell-type specific and common RNA targets of FUS.</p>

        <p>Seventy five percent of our FUS CLIP clusters were located within introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with previous reports <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ishigaki1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Nakaya1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. To address the function of FUS in alternative splicing, we analyzed the association between FUS CLIP clusters and known alternative splicing events. Using the UCSC Known AltEvent database as a reference, we scored a FUS CLIP cluster as associated with an alternative splicing event if the CLIP cluster overlapped the alternative splicing event itself or overlapped its immediate flanking introns and/or exons, as described previously <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Our analysis identified âcassette exonâ as the top category of alternative splicing events associated with FUS CLIP clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003895.s003">Figure S3</xref>). FUS CLIP clusters are associated with 206 cassette exons in total (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003895.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To identify FUS binding regions flanking cassette exons, we used 87 FUS-associated cassette exons that are flanked by constitutive exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003895.s012">Table S3</xref>) to generate a normalized complexity map as previously described <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Licatalosi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We found that FUS binding was enriched in the flanking introns, particularly proximal to splice sites flanking the cassette exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The peak at 5â² splice sites, within 100 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the cassette exons, showed the highest enrichment of FUS CLIP tags. The peak proximal to 3â² splice sites was about 150 nt upstream of the cassette exons, instead of immediately upstream of 3â² splice sites (less than 50 nt), as previously described <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Hoell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We also observed a peak at about 400 nt downstream of the cassette exons and a peak at about 300 nt downstream of the upstream constitutive exons. The locations of all these four peaks in our complexity map were also detected as statistically significant FUS binding sites in the complexity map from Lagier-Tourenne <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pgen.1003895-LagierTourenne3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

FUS-RNA binding may be both position and sequence dependent.</p>

        <p>To assess whether the splicing of exon 7 is affected by FUS protein levels, a gain of function assay with the EGFP-FUS plasmids and a loss of function assay with FUS siRNA were performed in HEK293 cells. Our results showed that the repression of exon 7 was enhanced significantly in both pDUP-FUS-E7L (from 48.3%Â±0.6% to 93.1%Â±2.7%, mean Â± SD, nâ=â3) and pDUP-FUS-E7S reporters (from 74.9%Â±1.3% to 91.0%Â±0.6%) when EGFP-FUS was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g003">Figure 3B, 3C</xref>). As a control, the splicing of exon 5 in the pDUP-FUS-E5 reporter was not affected by FUS overexpression. Conversely, the level of the exon 7-skipped products decreased strikingly in the pDUP-FUS-E7L reporter (from 48.7%Â±4.5% to 3.7%Â±1.4%) when endogenous FUS protein was reduced by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g003">Figures 3D, 3E</xref>). The exon 7-skipped splice variant in pDUP-FUS-E7S reporter was also decreased but to a lesser extent, from 64.8%Â±4.8% to 46.0%Â±4.1%, which suggests that more regulatory elements in the entire intron6-exon7-intron7 region are required to control exon 7 alternative splicing.</p>
        <p>To further test the dependence of exon 7 splicing on FUS protein levels, a rescue assay with the pDUP-FUS-E7L reporter was performed by knocking down endogenous FUS using siRNAs that target the 3â² UTR of <italic>FUS</italic> pre-mRNAs, followed by expressing EGFP-FUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g004">Figure 4A, 4B</xref>).

The level of exon 7-skipped variants (bottom band, lane 6) was reduced to 15% of the mock transfection (bottom band, lane 4), while the level of the exon 7-included variant (top band, lane 6) was only reduced to 50% of the mock transfection control (top band, lane 4) upon siRNA knockdown of FUS and CHX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). A lesser reduction in exon 7-included variants than in exon 7-skipped variants was also observed without CHX treatment (lane 3). This result is consistent with the splicing reporter minigene assay, indicating that FUS is a repressor of exon 7 and reduced FUS protein levels results in less exon 7 repression.

This observation led us to hypothesize that FUS can autoregulate its own protein levels by regulating the alternative splicing of exon 7. If our hypothesis is correct, we predict that exogenous expression of FUS will downregulate endogenous FUS protein levels by promoting exon 7 skipping and consequently NMD. Western blot analysis using FUS antibody detected both endogenous FUS and EGFP-FUS.

        <p>To test the function of the FUS mutants in exon 7 alternative splicing, the splicing reporter minigene pDUP-FUS-E7L together with either wildtype or mutant EGFP-FUS plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Expression of wildtype EGFP-FUS protein resulted in repression of exon 7 as expected, with an increase of the exon7-skipped products from 40.4%Â±1.7% to 89.3%Â±3.0% (mean Â± SD, nâ=â3). Expression of the ALS-associated mutants, compared to the wildtype FUS, resulted in significantly compromised repression of exon 7 (<italic>P</italic>â¤0.05, nâ=â3). The more cytoplasmic localization of the ALS mutants, the less exon 7 repression, with exon 7 skipping ratio of 87.6%Â±2.8% for R521G, 70.6%Â±2.4% for R522G and 33.3%Â±10.1% for ÎE15 mutant. Expression of the EGFP-FUS RRM 4F-L mutant only resulted in a mild reduction of exon 7 repression with a ratio of exon 7 skipping of 82.1%Â±4.3%, which was statistically different from the EGFP-FUS wildtype protein (<italic>P</italic>â¤0.05, nâ=â3). While the RRM 4F-L mutant was reported incompetent to bind RNA <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, its expression did increase the nuclear concentration of FUS protein, which may result in more endogenous FUS binding the intron6-exon7-intron7 region in the reporter minigene and repression of the exon 7 splicing. This may explain the slight reduction of exon 7 repression when the RRM 4F-L mutant was expressed. Our data suggest that both the nuclear concentration of FUS protein and RNA binding are critical for the regulation of <italic>FUS</italic> exon 7.</p>
        <p>Consistent with the splicing data, western blot analysis confirmed that increased exon 7 skipping led to a decrease in endogenous FUS protein levels by 55.5%, when EGFP-FUS wildtype protein was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Conversely expression of various EGFP-FUS ALS mutants, which showed reduced nuclear localization and exon 7 skipping, resulted in less reduction of the endogenous FUS protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Expression of the ÎE15 mutant that is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm only downregulated the endogenous FUS protein by 14.6%. This mild downregulation of FUS protein is consistent with little increase of exon 7 skipping observed in the splicing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). We also confirmed in human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y that ALS-associated FUS mutants were deficient in regulating exon 7 repression in the context of the pDUP splicing reporter minigene, and that the deficiency correlated with the extent of cytoplasmic localization of the mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003895.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>
        <p>We observed that wildtype endogenous FUS protein was co-localized with the cytoplasmic aggregates of FUS ÎE15 mutant in both HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) and mouse motor neuron cells NSC-34 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003895.s008">Figure S8</xref>), using an antibody which detects only the endogenous FUS protein but not the ÎE15 mutant by recognizing a C-terminal FUS epitope. These data suggest that the FUS mutants may sequester the wildtype FUS protein in the cytoplasm and further contribute to the aggregation. This is consistent with a recent report that GFP-FUS ALS mutant is co-localized with MYC-FUS wildtype protein in the cytoplasmic aggregates <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Vance2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. We report here the localization of the endogenous FUS protein in the cytoplasmic aggregates of ALS-associated FUS mutants.</p>
        <p>Taken together, our data suggest that the severity of FUS cytoplasmic accumulation correlates with the deficiency of exon 7 repression and autoregulation of FUS protein levels. The deficiency of ALS-associated FUS mutants in alternative splicing and autoregulation may exacerbate the cytoplasmic accumulation of ALS-associated FUS mutants.</p>

        <title>Exon 7 skipping can be induced by antisense oligonucleotides</title>
        <p>Our data showed FUS autoregulation is deficient in cells expressing ALS-associated FUS mutants. Moreover, this deficiency increases with the relative severity of the cytoplasmic accumulation of individual FUS mutants, which would be expected to exacerbate the rate of cytoplasmic accumulation and FUS proteinopathy. Use of splicing-modulating antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) is a therapeutic strategy of great potential to treat diseases arising from splicing defects <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Spitali1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Hua1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. We rationalized that ASOs promoting <italic>FUS</italic> exon 7 skipping should mimic the repression of exon 7 by FUS and thereby have the potential to restore the deficient FUS autoregulation in patients with ALS-associated <italic>FUS</italic> mutations. We designed FUS-ASOs to target the junction of intron 6 and exon 7. FUS-ASOs were synthesized using 2â²-O-methyl-oligoribonucleotides with phosphorothioate linkages to increase ASO stability and then tested with the pDUP-FUS-E7L minigene in HEK293 cells. Our results showed that FUS-ASOs induced repression of exon 7 in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests a possibility that deficient FUS autoregulation can be therapeutically restored to reduce or alleviate the extent of abnormal FUS cytoplasmic accumulation occurring in ALS patients with <italic>FUS</italic> mutations.</p>

      <p>Here we report a novel autoregulatory mechanism of FUS by alternative splicing and NMD. The model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g008">Figure 8A</xref> illustrates FUS autoregulation as a feedback loop to control the homeostasis of FUS protein levels. High levels of FUS protein lead to increased FUS binding to exon 7 and its flanking introns, promoting exon 7 skipping and NMD to reduce excessive FUS protein. Low levels of FUS protein would favor exon 7 inclusion, resulting in increased FUS protein production. Alternative splicing-mediated NMD and highly conserved intronic sequences represent an emerging common mechanism utilized by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) to maintain their homeostasis <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Rossbach1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Wollerton1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Dredge1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. FUS now joins this increasing list of autoregulated RBPs, including PTB, hnRNP L, Nova and TDP-43 <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Rossbach1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Wollerton1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ayala1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. FUS regulates many aspects of gene expression including transcription, alternative splicing and RNA transportation <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Dormann2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Dynamic regulation and conserved targets suggest it is important to keep these functional activities of FUS in tight control, and that FUS likely has a co-factor role in coordinating them. For example, loss of <italic>FUS</italic> can cause genomic instability and developmental defects in mouse, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Zebrafish <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Kabashi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Iijima1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Hicks1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Conversely, high levels of FUS are associated with cancer and ALS, and moreover, are known genetic determinants of these diseases. Overexpression of <italic>FUS</italic> is observed in liposarcoma and leukemia with <italic>FUS</italic> translocations <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Spitzer1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.

          <title>Proposed model of FUS autoregulation and its contribution to ALS pathogenesis.</title>
          <p>A) A model illustrates FUS autoregulation as a feedback loop to control the homeostasis of FUS protein levels. When FUS protein levels are high, FUS downregulates its own protein by repressing exon 7 inclusion to produce exon 7-skipped transcripts for NMD. When FUS protein levels are low, the repression of exon 7 is reduced and more splice variants with exon 7-included are produced for translation. B) The deficient FUS autoregulation in ALS-associated FUS mutants may contribute to its abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation. Mutations within the nuclear localization signal result in cytoplasmic retention of FUS mutants and reduction of nuclear FUS. The reduction of nuclear FUS leads to the reduction of <italic>FUS</italic> exon 7 repression, which would in turn produce more exon 7-included transcripts for translation, thereby driving elevated FUS protein synthesis. This compromised FUS autoregulation forms a feed-forward loop, potentially exacerbating the abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of FUS mutants. <italic>FUS</italic> mutations and FUS mutants are indicated with a red asterisk.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003895.g008"/>
      </fig>
      <p>In ALS, another frequently mutated gene TDP-43 is also an RNA binding protein that autoregulates its own protein levels <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ayala1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Polymenidou1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. The direct mechanism of TDP-43 autoregulation is different from what we report here for FUS. TDP-43 binds to the 3â² UTR of its own pre-mRNA to trigger either NMD <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Polymenidou1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> or exosome-dependent degradation <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ayala1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. To our knowledge, we are the first to report a FUS autoregulatory mechanism through alternative splicing and NMD. Autoregulation of both FUS and TDP-43 by post transcriptional mechanisms suggests their functional activities are tightly controlled and that unbalancing of this regulation may underpin molecular mechanisms that promote neurodegeneration in ALS. Mice and rats expressing TDP-43 without the autoregulatory sequence developed more severe neurodegeneration than those expressing autoregulated wildtype or ALS-linked TDP-43 mutants, strongly suggesting deficient TDP-43 autoregulation contributes to neurodegeneration <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ling1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. This is also likely the case for FUS autoregulation, which needs to be experimentally tested in rodent models. Interestingly, in both FUS-associated ALS and cancer, loss of heterozygosity of the <italic>FUS</italic> gene is never observed. This suggests, at least genetically, that while compromised FUS autoregulation contributes to the initiating or driving events resulting from <italic>FUS</italic> mutations in these diseases, the activity of the wild-type <italic>FUS</italic> allele is required or selected to maintain this pathological state. In this regard, it is important to understand how both mutant and wild-type FUS activities may contribute to the progression of ALS and cancer.</p>
      <p>Compromised FUS homeostasis by autoregulation is expected in cells harbouring ALS-associated mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003895-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). The majority of ALS-associated mutations are located in the nuclear-localization signal (NLS) of <italic>FUS</italic>, resulting in both a cytoplasmic retention of FUS mutants and a reduction of FUS protein levels in the nucleus. The reduction of nuclear-localized FUS leads to the reduction of <italic>FUS</italic> exon 7 repression, which in turn likely induces production of more exon 7-included transcripts for translation, thereby driving elevated protein synthesis of FUS. In our model of FUS autoregulation, a deficiency of FUS in the nucleus would favour a feed-forward mechanism, and thereby actually exacerbate the abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of FUS mutants. Our observation that endogenous wildtype FUS protein was co-localized with the cytoplasmic aggregates of FUS mutants in both HEK293 cells and NSC-34 motor neuron cells suggests that the FUS mutants may further sequester the wildtype FUS protein in the cytoplasm and form more aggregates. In ALS, FUS cytoplasmic accumulation is a progressive process and increases with disease duration <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The deficient FUS autoregulation may lead to long term detrimental effects, and could be part of the mechanism underlying age-dependent neurodegeneration and death of neurons with ALS-associated <italic>FUS</italic> mutants.</p>
      <p>Indeed, a genotype-phenotype relation between different <italic>FUS</italic> mutations and FUS cytoplasmic accumulation or the age of ALS onset is observed <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Kwiatkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Bosco1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Waibel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The stronger the NLS mutation (severity of cytoplasmic retention), the earlier the age of ALS onset. The three <italic>FUS</italic> mutants we constructed, R521G, R522G and ÎE15 (last 12 amino acids truncation) represent minor, moderate and severe cytoplasmic accumulation, respectively. The reported mean age of disease onset is 43 for R521G, 28.5 for R522G and 18 for R495X (last 32 amino acid truncation) in the later generation <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Kwiatkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Bosco1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Here, we demonstrated that in HEK293 cells and SH-SY5Y cells expressing these same R521G, R522G and ÎE15 <italic>FUS</italic> mutants, increased cytoplasmic localization of FUS directly correlated with increased deficiencies of exon 7 skipping and FUS autoregulation. We speculate that <italic>FUS</italic> exon 7-skipped splice variants are reduced in the tissues or cell lines derived from ALS patients with <italic>FUS</italic> mutations, which can be further experimentally tested.</p>
      <p>Regulated splicing of exon 7 is a good model to examine FUS-dependent alternative splicing in detail, since it is one of the most significant FUS CLIP clusters identified in our FUS CLIP-seq. Our finding is also consistent with the report that FUS binds to highly conserved introns of genes encoding RNA binding proteins <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Nakaya1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. <italic>FUS</italic> exon 7 and its flanking introns were also identified previously as RNA targets of FUS and of TDP-43 respectively from FUS CLIP-seq and TDP-43 CLIP-seq of mouse brains <xref rid="pgen.1003895-LagierTourenne3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Polymenidou1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, but the functional significance of this implicated region was not experimentally tested. Interestingly, the prime molecular target of two genetic determinants of ALS converges on the same highly conserved <italic>FUS</italic> alternative exon and its flanking introns. This makes a compelling argument that the processing of <italic>FUS</italic> pre-mRNA specifically, and by extension, the role of FUS in alternative exon splicing in general, is an important molecular determinant of ALS. Lagier-Tourenne <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that FUS binding to <italic>FUS</italic> intron6-exon7-intron7 may result in retention of intron 7 to make a shorter <italic>FUS</italic> transcript with an alternative 3â² UTR <xref rid="pgen.1003895-LagierTourenne3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We noticed that both NCBI RefSeq database (NR_028388.2) and Ensemble database (ENST00000566605) annotated a <italic>FUS</italic> splice variant without exon 7, which is predicted to undergo NMD. We experimentally validated that the exon 7-skipped variant of FUS was expressed in multiple human and mouse cell lines and that the steady state levels of the exon 7-skipped variant was increased after inhibition of NMD. Furthermore, we demonstrated that FUS is a repressor of its own exon 7 by splicing assays of both splicing reporter minigenes and endogenous <italic>FUS</italic> pre-mRNAs.</p>
      <p>FUS-regulated alternative splicing of cassette exons is not just limited to its own exon 7. We found FUS CLIP clusters were significantly associated with alternative splicing events of cassette exons. Our normalized complexity map of 87 FUS-associated cassette exon events revealed that FUS CLIP clusters were enriched in the introns flanking cassette exons, proximal to upstream 3â² splice sites and downstream 5â² splice sites, with the highest peak overlapping the downstream 5â² splice sites. FUS binding proximal to 5â² splice sites suggests that FUS may be associated with the assembly of spliceosome at 5â² splice sites, consistent with previous reports that FUS, as well as the related family member TAF15, are in the U1 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) complex <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Kameoka1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Leichter1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. FUS binding proximal to 3â² splice sites suggests it may also affect the spliceosome assembly at 3â² splice sites; this functional significance is yet to be determined <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Hoell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Activation or repression of cassette exon splicing can be dependent on RNA binding positions, as suggested in Nova <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Licatalosi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and FOX2 <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Yeo1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> CLIP-seq data, which showed that Nova and FOX2 binding proximal to 3â² splice sites repressed cassette exons, while conversely binding proximal to 5â² splice sites promoted cassette exons. However, splicing factors such as hnRNP A1 and PSF binding to introns proximal to 5â² splice sites can also repress cassette exons <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ray1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>; which suggests that activation or repression of cassette exon splicing is likely more complex. We experimentally demonstrated in this paper that FUS is a repressor of its own exon 7. However, it does not rule out the possibility that FUS may activate other cassette exons. The repression or activation of a given cassette exon by FUS in a tissue specific manner might be controlled by different signaling pathways and/or cell type specific splicing factors involved in the complex in a spatio-temporal manner.</p>
      <p>Sequence motif analysis of FUS CLIP clusters in our data set did not identify a significant common consensus motif (data not shown). We found variable motifs throughout the four binding peaks in the complexity map (data not shown), suggesting limited or context-dependent FUS binding specificity, consistent with previous reports <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ishigaki1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Rogelj1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Hoell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Nakaya1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Analysis of CLIP clusters within the region encompassed by the highest binding peak in the normalized complexity map (5â² splice site downstream of cassette exons) did identify an enrichment of a CAGGUU motif, which is similar to the human 5â² splice site consensus sequence MAG|GURAGU <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. While this might be expected, it is interesting to note that GGU is the most common FUS binding site consensus sequence. This was originally reported in a SELEX assay (GGUG) <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Lerga1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and subsequently by CLIP-seq analysis from Lagier-Tourenne <italic>et al</italic>. (GUGGU) <xref rid="pgen.1003895-LagierTourenne3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and Rogelj <italic>et al.</italic> (GGU) <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Rogelj1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A detailed examination of consensus RNA motifs within <italic>FUS</italic> intron 6 and intron 7 did reveal that GU or GGU containing sequences were statistically enriched, which provides FUS intron6-exon7-intron7 as a model for further experimental determination of FUS binding sites.</p>
      <p>FUS CLIP-seq data and RNA-seq data revealed a wide range of pre-mRNAs as candidate targets of FUS <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ishigaki1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-Nakaya1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Dichmann1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. However, the biological significance of FUS-regulated RNA processing is only now being examined. Here we demonstrated that FUS-regulated cassette exon splicing of its own pre-mRNA leads to NMD, suggesting that FUS-regulated alternative splicing may be a common post transcriptional mechanism for the regulation of gene expression. This function of FUS in regulating cassette exon splicing is likely conserved in different tissues and species, since FUS-associated cassette exons were also observed in human and mouse neural tissues <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ishigaki1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003895-LagierTourenne3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Our evidence demonstrating FUS is a splicing repressor of its exon 7 strongly supports the hypothesis that alternative splicing of many other neuronal- and disease-associated genes containing FUS-targeted cassette exons may also be regulated by FUS.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study uncovers an autoregulatory mechanism of <italic>FUS</italic> expression through alternative splicing and NMD, and demonstrates that its function in splicing regulation is deficient in ALS-associated FUS mutants. This study addresses a biological significance of FUS-regulated alternative splicing, and its potential relevance to ALS pathogenesis. Furthermore, our findings have important implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches to target alternative splicing in treating ALS. Taking advantage of our findings, splicing-modulating antisense oligonucleotides can be developed to induce exon 7 skipping and produce the <italic>FUS</italic> splice variants undergoing NMD. This may be a promising strategy to reduce the abnormal FUS cytoplasmic accumulation in ALS. Moreover, FUS autoregulation by alternative splicing provides insight into a molecular mechanism by which FUS-regulated pre-mRNA processing can impact a significant number of targets important to neurodegeneration.</p>

        <p>CLIP-seq was performed as described <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ule1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Briefly, HeLa cells on 15 cm dishes were UV crosslinked <italic>in vivo</italic> at 400 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> using Stratalinker (Stratagene 1800). Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer <xref rid="pgen.1003895-Ule1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, followed with partial RNase A (Sigma, R6513) digestion at different final concentrations ranging from 0.001 Âµg/ml to 0.1 Âµg/ml. FUS-RNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using mouse monoclonal anti-FUS antibody 10F7 pre-bound with protein G agarose beads (Pierce, 22851). 10F7 is a mouse monoclonal antibody previously developed in the Hicks laboratory by immunizing BALB/c mice with GST (glutathione-s-transferase)-FUS fusion protein. Various clones were screened using western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry, and the 10F7 antibody performed best for all three methods. This antibody recognizes amino acids 34â51 of FUS. Immunoprecipitation using mouse IgG (Sigma, I5381) prebound with protein G agarose beads was performed in parallel as a control. While FUS-RNA complexes were still bound to beads, the 5â² end of CLIP RNA was radiolabeled with [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP, and the 3â² end of CLIP RNA was ligated to a 3â² RNA linker. The radiolabeled FUS-RNA complex was separated onto a 10% (w/v) Bis-Tris gel (Novex NuPAGE), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, 162-0115), and exposed to X-ray film (Amersham Hyperfilm MP) for autoradiography. The appropriate shifted FUS-RNA bands were cut out of the nitrocellulose membrane and subject to protein digestion using proteinase K (Roche, 3115879001). RNA was recovered using phenol chloroform extraction and sodium acetate, ethanol-isopropanol (1â¶1) precipitation. The recovered RNA was further ligated to a 5â² RNA linker, and subject to DNase (Promega, M6101) digestion and RNA recovery again. The final RNA product was reverse transcribed to cDNA using linker specific primers and subject to deep sequencing using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II (single end, 72 bp) at the Center of Applied Genomics in Toronto (TCAG).</p>

          <p>Endogenous FUS protein is localized in the cytoplasmic aggregates of FUS ÎE15 mutants expressed in mouse motor neuron cells NSC-34. A) Confocal fluorescent microscopy showing the cellular localization of EGFP-FUS mutants in NSC-34 cells. Magnification, 40Ã. Scale bar, 20 Âµm. Endogenous FUS protein was detected using anti-FUS antibody (Bethyl, BL1355). DNA in the nucleus was stained with DAPI or NucRed Dead 647. B) Confocal fluorescent microscopy showing the localization of endogenous FUS protein in the cytoplasmic aggregates of EGFP-FUS ÎE15 mutants expressed in NSC-34 cells. Anti-FUS antibody (Bethyl, BL1355) recognizing a C-terminus epitope detected only endogenous FUS protein but not ÎE15 mutants. Magnification, 40Ã. Scale bar, 20 Âµm.</p>
