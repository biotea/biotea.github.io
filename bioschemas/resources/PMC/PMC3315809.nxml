        <p>Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D constitute a family of ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-bearing cytoplasmic proteins.

      <abstract>
        <p>The mechanism of ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of cell surface proteins is not completely understood. Here we examine the role of the ankyrin repeat domain (Ankrd) 13A, 13B, and 13D proteins, which constitute a functionally unknown family of ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)âbearing proteins, in the process. Stimulation of human HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) rapidly induced direct binding of Ankrd 13 proteins to ubiquitinated EGF receptor (EGFR) via the UIMs. The binding was inhibited when the Ankrd 13 proteins underwent UIM-dependent monoubiquitination, suggesting that their activity is regulated by ubiquitination of themselves. Ankrd 13 proteins bound specifically to Lys-63âlinked ubiquitin chains, which was consistent with a previous report that EGFR mainly undergoes Lys-63âlinked polyubiquitination. Ankrd 13 proteins were anchored, via the central region and UIMs, to the plasma membrane, where they colocalized with EGFR. Finally, overexpression of wild-type as well as truncated-mutant Ankrd 13 proteins strongly inhibited rapid endocytosis of ubiquitinated EGFR from the surface in EGF-treated cells. We conclude that by binding to the Lys-63âlinked polyubiquitin moiety of EGFR at the plasma membrane, Ankrd 13 proteins regulate the rapid internalization of ligand-activated EGFR.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ubiquitin (Ub) is a 76âamino acid (aa) protein highly conserved in eukaryotic cells. Via the C-terminal carboxyl group, Ub is conjugated to the Îµ-amino group of Lys residues in numerous intracellular proteins, a posttranslational modification referred to as monoubiquitination. Ub is also conjugated to one of seven Lys residues or the N-terminal amino group in another Ub molecule, forming eight structurally different polyUb chains. Among them, Lys-48â and Lys-63âlinked chains are most abundant in the cell. Target proteins are often conjugated with polyUb chains, and this modification is referred to as polyubiquitination. The fate or function of ubiquitinated proteins is regulated in different ways, depending on the linkage pattern of conjugated Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Ikeda and Dikic, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Komander, 2009</xref>).</p><p>On the plasma membrane, monoUb and/or Lys-63âlinked polyUb chains serve as an endocytosis (internalization) signal that is tagged to a variety of cell surface integral membrane proteins in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Mukhopadhyay and Riezman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Traub and Lukacs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Lauwers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The role of Ub in endocytosis, however, is more complicated because not only cargo proteins, but also proteins of the endocytic machinery are regulated by their own ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Acconcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR), belonging to the receptor tyrosine kinase family in mammals, is a cell surface protein whose mechanisms of endocytosis have been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Madshus and Stang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Sorkin and Goh, 2009</xref>). Following stimulation with EGF, EGFR undergoes rapid ubiquitination (mainly Lys-63âlinked polyubiquitination) by the Cbl family of Ub ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Levkowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Inhibition of the Cbl activity results in suppressed internalization of ligand-activated EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Jiang and Sorkin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bertelsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). By contrast, in-frame fusion of Ub to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of EGFR induces its internalization in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Haglund <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Mosesson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bertelsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). These observations suggest that for EGFR, similar to other cell surface proteins, ubiquitination serves as a trigger that drives endocytosis from the cell surface.</p><p>The Ub-interacting motif (UIM) is an â¼20-aa sequence that specifically binds to Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Hofmann and Falquet, 2001</xref>). Although originally identified in the protein S5a, a component of the 19S regulatory subunit of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Young <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), UIMs are found in multiple proteins involved in endocytic trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Hofmann and Falquet, 2001</xref>). Among UIM-bearing proteins, epsin and eps15 participate in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of ubiquitinated cell surface proteins. While binding to the Ub moiety of EGFR via three tandem UIMs, epsin also binds to clathrin, adaptor protein-2, which recruits clathrin to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, and a plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate, thereby incorporating ubiquitinated EGFR into the clathrin-coated vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Maldonado-BÃ¡ez and Wendland, 2006</xref>). eps15, which binds to epsin, bears two tandem UIMs and also sorts ubiquitinated EGFR into the clathrin-coated vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Maldonado-BÃ¡ez and Wendland, 2006</xref>). However, depletion of epsin or eps15 using RNA interference only modestly inhibits EGFR internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Kazazic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Binding of the ligand-activated hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-Met, which also undergoes ubiquitination, to eps15 requires the coiled-coil region, but not the UIMs, of eps15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Parachoniak and Park, 2009</xref>). In yeast epsins (Ent1 and Ent2), a role for the UIMs in the interaction between proteins of the endocytic machinery was suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Dores <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Therefore the overall picture of UIM-mediated endocytosis is unclear. Because there are other UIM-bearing proteins whose cellular functions have not been identified, the possible involvement of these proteins in endocytosis also remains to be examined.</p><p>The ankyrin repeat domain (Ankrd) 13 family of proteins consists of four members (13A, 13B, 13C, and 13D), with two characteristic features in primary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the N-terminal region, they have three ankyrin repeats, a proteinâprotein interaction domain found in numerous intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In the C-terminal region, Ankrd 13A and 13D harbor four potential UIMs and Ankrd 13B harbors three. Ankrd 13C has no UIM. Recently Ankrd 13C was shown to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it serves as a molecular chaperone that facilitates the trafficking of newly synthesized seven-transmembrane receptors to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Parent <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). However, the functions of other Ankrd 13 proteins, which are distinguished from Ankrd 13C by the presence of UIMs, are completely unknown. In this study, we examine the cellular functions of Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D and show that these proteins regulate the internalization of ubiquitinated EGFR from the cell surface.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D bind to EGF-activated EGFR directly.

HeLa cells were transfected with Ankrd 13 proteins tagged with a FLAG epitope at the N-terminus. After treatment with EGF for 5 or 30 min, EGFR was immunoprecipitated from the cells and analyzed by immunoblotting. Blotting with anti-EGFR and anti-Ub antibodies detected ubiquitinated EGFR after 5 min of EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, asterisks). Blotting with anti-FLAG antibody showed that Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D, but not 13C, bind to EGFR upon EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The binding reached its maximal level within 5 min after the stimulation and decreased in 30 min, correlating with the level of EGFR ubiquitination.</p><p>To determine the region required for EGFR binding in Ankrd 13A, we examined the binding of truncated mutants lacking the three ankyrin repeats (ÎAR) or four UIMs (ÎUIM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Whereas deletion of the ankyrin repeats had no effect on EGFR binding, that of the UIMs completely abolished it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results suggested that Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D bind via the UIMs either directly to the Ub moiety of ligand-activated EGFR or to another ubiquitinated protein associated with activated EGFR. To discriminate between the possibilities, we performed a pull-down experiment using purified Ankrd 13A and EGFR. FLAG-Ankrd 13Aâtransfected HeLa cells were lysed at 100Â°C in the presence of 1% SDS to strip associated ubiquitinated proteins from FLAG-Ankrd 13A (a hot-lysis method; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, C and D, later in the paper</xref>). FLAG-Ankrd 13A was then precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody from the lysate and eluted with the FLAG-competing peptide. Similarly, untreated and EGF-treated (5 min) HeLa cells were lysed with the hot-lysis method, and endogenous EGFR was precipitated with anti-EGFR antibody coupled to protein A beads. The EGFR-immobilized beads were incubated with eluted FLAG-Ankrd 13A, and, after washing of the beads, bound Ankrd 13A was detected by anti-FLAG immunoblotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, binding of Ankrd 13A to EGFR from untreated cells, as well as its nonspecific binding to EGFR-free beads, was undetectable. However, Ankrd 13A was pulled down by EGFR when EGFR was isolated from EGF-treated cells. These results suggested that Ankrd 13 proteins bind to ubiquitinated EGFR directly.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Endogenous Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D bind to EGF-activated EGFR.

Expression of endogenous Ankrd 13A, 13C, and 13D, but not 13B, was detected with the antibodies in untransfected HeLa cells, whereas they all detected overexpressed FLAG-tagged versions strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Because expression of Ankrd 13B mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptaseâPCR experiments (unpublished data), the antibody was probably not sensitive enough to detect endogenous Ankrd 13B expressed at a low level. To examine the interaction between endogenous Ankrd 13 proteins and EGFR, untransfected HeLa cells were treated with EGF for 5 or 30 min, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated from the cells. Blotting of the precipitates with the antiâAnkrd 13 antibodies showed that endogenous Ankrd 13A and 13D, but not 13C, bind to EGFR upon EGF treatment with the same time course as transfected Ankrd 13 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ankrd 13A undergoes monoubiquitination</title><p>When FLAG-tagged Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D, but not 13C, were expressed in HeLa cells, minor bands that migrate slightly more slowly than the major bands were detected with anti-FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, open arrowheads). Because several other UIM-bearing proteins undergo monoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Polo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), we examined whether the minor bands represent monoubiquitinated forms of Ankrd 13 proteins. HeLa cells were cotransfected with FLAG-Ankrd 13A and HA-tagged Ub, and their lysates were precipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-EGFR antibody. Again, blotting of the anti-FLAG precipitates with anti-FLAG antibody produced major (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, closed arrowhead) and minor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, open arrowhead) bands. Blotting with anti-HA antibody gave the minor band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, open arrowhead), which was still detected when cell lysates were prepared using a hot-lysis method to strip associated proteins from Ankrd 13A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), suggesting that it represents monoubiquitinated Ankrd 13A. The Ub-positive, highâmolecular weight smear that was coprecipitated with Ankrd 13A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, asterisk) represents endogenous ubiquitinated proteins that bound to the UIMs of overexpressed Ankrd 13A, because it was not precipitated from cell lysates prepared using the hot-lysis method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Blotting with anti-EGFR antibody showed that FLAG-Ankrd 13A mainly coprecipitates ubiquitinated, but not unmodified, EGFR, indicating that Ankrd 13A specifically binds to ubiquitinated EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Blotting of the anti-EGFR precipitates with anti-FLAG antibody produced only unmodified Ankrd 13A, indicating that when monoubiquitinated, Ankrd 13A loses the ability to bind to ubiquitinated EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).

We therefore examined whether Ankrd 13 proteins bind to Lys-63âlinked Ub chains. COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-Ankrd 13 proteins and lysed with a hot-lysis method to strip Ankrd 13âbound ubiquitinated proteins. FLAG-Ankrd 13 proteins were then precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody coupled to protein A beads, and the Ankrd 13-immobilized beads were incubated with Lys-48â or Lys-63âlinked Ub oligomers (dimer [Ub<sub>2</sub>] to heptamer [Ub<sub>7</sub>]). After washing the beads, bound Ub chains were detected by anti-Ub immunoblotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D, but not 13C, pulled down Lys-63âlinked, but not Lys-48âlinked, Ub chains.

Incubation of the Ankrd 13âbound beads with Lys-63âlinked Ub chains caused a substantial decrease in the amount of Ankrd 13 proteins bound to the beads, suggesting that for some reason, binding of Ub chains to FLAG-Ankrd 13 proteins destabilizes their binding with anti-FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom). In addition, Ankrd 13A-ÎUIM did not pull down Ub chains, indicating that UIMs are responsible for the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4:</label><caption><p>Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D bind to Lys-63âlinked Ub chains.

HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Ankrd 13A and treated with or without EGF for 5 min. The cell surface was labeled with biotin on ice, and EGFR was precipitated from their lysates with anti-EGFR antibody. Biotinylated EGFR was then detected with streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>) and the intensity of the bands corresponding to unmodified (open arrowhead) and ubiquitinated (asterisk) EGFR in the blotting membrane was quantified. The surface level of unmodified EGFR was scarcely affected by Ankrd 13A overexpression in both untreated and EGF-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>). Ankrd 13A overexpression also did not drastically affect the surface level of ubiquitinated EGFR in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>, left). However, it was elevated by â¼2.2-fold at 5 min after EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>, right). This must be an underestimate because in our transfection experiments, FLAG-Ankrd 13A was overexpressed in at most 50% of the cells (unpublished data). These results suggested that the internalization of ubiquitinated EGFR is inhibited by Ankrd 13A overexpression. As noted before, the same results were obtained, although somewhat less clearly, in a converse experiment in which biotinylated proteins were first precipitated with streptavidin and the precipitates were blotted with anti-EGFR antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, asterisk).</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of Ankrd 13A, 13B, or 13D does not inhibit EGFR degradation</title><p>Degradation of EGFR was not yet observed in HeLa cells at 5 or 30 min after EGF stimulation, and overexpression of wild-type or truncated Ankrd 13 proteins did not affect the amount of EGFR at these time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, B and C</xref>, top). To examine whether the inhibition of rapid EGFR internalization by Ankrd 13 overexpression affects the rate of EGFR degradation at later time points, we incubated HeLa cells overexpressing FLAG-Ankrd 13 proteins for 1 or 3 h in the presence of EGF and examined the total cellular level of EGFR by immunoblotting of the lysates. The EGFR level was comparable between untransfected cells and those overexpressing each of the Ankrd 13 proteins throughout the duration of EGF treatment (Supplemental Figure S6). These results were consistent with the observation that EGFR is normally internalized in Ankrd 13âoverexpressing cells after 1 h of EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7, HâHâ²</xref>â², and Supplemental Figure S4).

The results presented in this study strongly suggest that the Ankrd 13 family of Ub-binding proteins acts at the plasma membrane to regulate the internalization of ubiquitinated cell surface proteins.

It is unclear whether this observation indicates that ubiquitination of EGFR is dispensable for its internalization or an undetectable level of ubiquitination is sufficient for normal internalization. Our finding that the interaction of Ankrd 13 with ubiquitinated EGFR plays a role in its internalization supports the latter possibility and further implicates EGFR ubiquitination in the internalization process.</p><p>Although EGFR internalization was significantly inhibited in Ankrd 13âoverexpressing cells at 5 min after EGF treatment, the intracellular distribution of EGFR was unaffected by Ankrd 13 overexpression 1 h after the same treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> and Supplemental Figure S4). Therefore EGFR internalization was delayed but not completely inhibited in Ankrd 13âoverexpressing cells. In addition, the rate at which ligand-activated EGFR is degraded was not affected by Ankrd 13 overexpression either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplemental Figure S6), suggesting that the delay in internalization does not have a profound effect on degradation. On the basis of these results, we propose that Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D regulate the rate of rapid internalization but are not essential for internalization. Further study is necessary to elucidate the biological significance of this Ankrd 13 function.</p><p>When overexpressed, Ankrd 13 proteins were detected also intracellularly, where they colocalized with endosome markers at least partly (Supplemental Figure S1). Furthermore, the intracellularly overexpressed Ankrd 13 proteins caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the same compartments (Supplemental Figure S2). Therefore Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D may also play roles intracellularly in the endocytic pathway. To address the possibility, it is important to elucidate whether endogenous Ankrd 13 proteins are also distributed intracellularly.

This, however, would not be the case for Ankrd 13 because a series of combined mutations in individual UIMs did not change the specificity of Ankrd 13A toward Lys-63âlinked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and Lys-48âlinked (unpublished data) Ub chains, although the binding affinity to Lys-63âlinked chains was reduced by the mutations. Because several mammalian plasma membrane proteins, including EGFR, undergo Lys-63âlinked polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Geetha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Duncan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Varghese <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Goto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), the specific binding of Ankrd 13 proteins to Lys-63âlinked Ub chains is consistent with their role in the internalization of cell surface proteins in mammalian cells. In addition, the requirement of Ankrd 13A's four individual UIMs for Ub binding differed considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Because mutations in the UIMs affected Ub binding more severely when mutated UIMs were located closer to the C-terminal end of the protein, the proximity of UIMs to the C-terminus of Ankrd 13 may be important in determining the contribution to Ub binding.</p><p>Ankrd 13A underwent monoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Similar to other UIM-bearing endocytic proteins, such as epsin, eps15, and Hrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Polo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), an Ankrd 13A mutant lacking the UIMs was not ubiquitinated, indicating that its own UIMs are required for the modification. In addition, monoubiquitinated Ankrd 13A lost the ability to bind to ubiquitinated EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). As previously suggested for other UIM-bearing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Hoeller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), this is possibly due to a masking effect of conjugated Ub, which binds to the UIMs of Ankrd 13A and inhibits its interaction with ubiquitinated cargo proteins. Therefore monoubiquitination is likely to serve as a negative-regulatory mechanism of Ankrd 13 function.</p></sec><sec><title>How do Ankrd 13 proteins regulate EGFR internalization?</title><p>Overexpression of not only wild-type Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D, but also of truncated mutants of Ankrd 13A, which were expected to act as dominant-negative versions, inhibited EGFR internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), raising the question of whether Ankrd 13 proteins have a stimulatory or inhibitory role in the process. To discriminate between the possibilities, we tried RNA interference experiments that examine the effect of Ankrd 13 depletion on EGFR internalization. We generated multiple small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that can knock down Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D individually in HeLa cells. Because the results in this study strongly suggested a redundant role for Ankrd 13 proteins in endocytosis, we examined cells transfected with a mixture of three siRNAs for Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D. When mixed, however, these siRNAs failed to deplete the three Ankrd 13 mRNAs/proteins simultaneously. Therefore, although EGFR internalization was not significantly affected by the siRNAs, this is possibly due to an incomplete inhibition of the Ankrd 13 function (unpublished data). Nonetheless, we suggest a positive-regulatory role for Ankrd 13 for the following reason. Because Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D are multidomain proteins, they possibly serve as an adaptor that couples ubiquitinated EGFR to a third protein in the endocytic machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). If so, when wild-type Ankrd 13 proteins are overexpressed, some bind only to ubiquitinated EGFR, whereas others bind only to the unidentified endocytic protein, thereby preventing the formation of the trimeric complex of EGFR, Ankrd 13, and the endocytic protein. We thus speculate that ectopic overexpression of not only truncated but also wild-type Ankrd 13 inhibits the function of endogenous Ankrd 13. In summary, we propose that Ankrd 13A, 13B, and 13D positively regulate the internalization of ligand-activated EGFR by binding to the Ub moiety of ubiquitinated EGFR at the plasma membrane. The uptake of transferrin was also substantially suppressed by Ankrd 13A overexpression (Supplemental Figure S5). Because the transferrin receptor normally does not undergo ubiquitination, these results suggest that overexpressed Ankrd 13 also inhibits internalization of nonubiquitinated cargo proteins without binding to them. This effect could also be caused by an excessive, unbalanced interaction of overÂ­expressed Ankrd 13 proteins with the endocytic machinery.</p><p>Both epsin and esp15 recruit ubiquitinated EGFR to the clathrin-coated vesicle through interaction with the coat components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Maldonado-BÃ¡ez and Wendland, 2006</xref>). To understand the mechanism by which Ankrd 13 proteins facilitate EGFR internalization, we examined the interaction of Ankrd 13A with clathrin heavy and light chains, as well as the Î± and Î²2 subunits of adaptor protein-2, in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. However, we did not detect interaction with any of the proteins (unpublished data). We also did not detect any interaction with membrane phospholipids, including various phosphoinositide species, in a lipidâprotein overlay experiment using purified Ankrd 13A-ÎUIM as a probe (unpublished data). Nevertheless, the ankyrin repeats are known as proteinâprotein interaction domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). We also found that the central region of Ankrd 13A contributes to its association with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The identification of molecules that interact with these regions will help elucidate the precise role of Ankrd 13 in endocytosis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>cDNA expression constructs</title><p>The cDNA for human Ankrd 13A was cloned from a human brain cDNA library (Clontech, Mountain View, CA).
