      <abstract>
        <p>The mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) serves as the site for ATP production by hosting the oxidative phosphorylation complex machinery most notably on the crista membranes. Disruption of the crista structure has been implicated in a variety of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we characterize ChChd3, a previously identified PKA substrate of unknown function (Schauble, S., King, C. C., Darshi, M., Koller, A., Shah, K., and Taylor, S. S. (2007) <italic>J. Biol. Chem.</italic> 282, 14952â14959), and show that it is essential for maintaining crista integrity and mitochondrial function. In the mitochondria, ChChd3 is a peripheral protein of the IM facing the intermembrane space. RNAi knockdown of ChChd3 in HeLa cells resulted in fragmented mitochondria, reduced OPA1 protein levels and impaired fusion, and clustering of the mitochondria around the nucleus along with reduced growth rate. Both the oxygen consumption and glycolytic rates were severely restricted. Ultrastructural analysis of these cells revealed aberrant mitochondrial IM structures with fragmented and tubular cristae or loss of cristae, and reduced crista membrane. Additionally, the crista junction opening diameter was reduced to 50% suggesting remodeling of cristae in the absence of ChChd3. Analysis of the ChChd3-binding proteins revealed that ChChd3 interacts with the IM proteins mitofilin and OPA1, which regulate crista morphology, and the outer membrane protein Sam50, which regulates import and assembly of Î²-barrel proteins on the outer membrane. Knockdown of ChChd3 led to almost complete loss of both mitofilin and Sam50 proteins and alterations in several mitochondrial proteins, suggesting that ChChd3 is a scaffolding protein that stabilizes protein complexes involved in maintaining crista architecture and protein import and is thus essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are ubiquitous and dynamic organelles that undergo frequent fission and fusion and are actively transported to specific cellular locations based on energy requirements. The highly organized structure of mitochondria and the nature of mitochondrial protein complexes enable them to sense the cellular environment and regulate ATP synthesis, metabolism, and other key physiological processes according to the energy requirements. In the past decade, several crucial regulators of mitochondrial structure, dynamics and function, have been identified and characterized in fungi, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Evolutionarily conserved large GTPases, mitofusin1 and 2 (Mfn1 and Mfn2) located on the outer membrane (OM)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) located on the inner membrane (IM) and intermembrane space (IMS), have been identified as key modulators for mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). On the other hand, the large GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1/DLP1/DNM1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) along with fission protein 1 homolog (FIS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) on the OM have been well characterized as the proteins responsible for mitochondrial fission. Mutations in some of these proteins have been associated with debilitating conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and type II diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Although significant advances have been made in identifying the proteins involved in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, very little is known about the protein complexes that control the biogenesis of cristae and crista junctions (CJs). Recent studies have suggested the involvement of IM proteins F<sub>1</sub>,F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), OPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), mitofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and MICS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) in regulating the crista morphology. Furthermore, OPA1 and mitofilin are suggested to be at the CJs and involved in CJ formation and control the CJ opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p><underline>C</underline>oiled-coil <underline>h</underline>elix <underline>c</underline>oiled-coil <underline>h</underline>elix <underline>d</underline>omain-containing protein 3 (ChChd3/FLJ20420/LOC54927/RIKEn cDNA 0610041L09) was previously identified in our laboratory as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) substrate in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Proteomic studies and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments identified ChChd3 as a highly abundant protein at synaptic membranes and in neurons of rat brain throughout the gray matter, dorsal root ganglion, and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Furthermore, ChChd3 was found to be significantly down-regulated in mitochondrial proteomic analysis of a cell line model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis expressing SOD1 mutant G93A compared with the control cells expressing WT SOD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), suggesting its possible role in the pathophysiology of human disease.</p><p>ChChd3 is highly conserved in mammals with human and mouse protein sharing â¼92% sequence similarity. Orthologs of the protein are present throughout the metazoans, whereas no homologs are so far seen in fungi or plants. In humans, the ChChd3 gene maps on chromosome 7 (7q32.3-q33), and the coding sequence of the protein has 8 exons that can potentially generate nine splice variants. Full-length ChChd3 has 227 amino acids with an N-terminal myristoylation motif followed by a DUF737 domain (<underline>d</underline>omain of <underline>u</underline>nknown <underline>f</underline>unction), and a coiled-coil helix-coiled-coil helix (chch) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). DUF domain belongs to the large set of protein families in the data base whose function is not known. The C-terminal chch domain, on the other hand, is primarily seen in mitochondrial proteins and was known to be involved in the protein import and metal binding in the IMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Each helix in the chch domain contains two of the four conserved cysteines arranged in C<italic>X</italic><sub>9</sub>C or C<italic>X</italic><sub>3</sub>C manner, and in the functional mature protein the cysteines are known to be oxidized forming two intramolecular disulfide bonds, essential for the proper folding and structural stabilization of the protein. The mitochondrial disulfide relay system mediated by Mia40 and Erv1 has been proposed as the principal mechanism for the transport and subsequent folding of the cysteine-containing proteins in the IMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>Although there is some evidence that ChChd3 is an abundant protein and localized to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), the role of the protein has remained poorly understood with no systematic study describing its cellular localization and/or biological function. In this comprehensive study, we describe a potential role of this protein in regulating mitochondrial structure and function. We show that ChChd3 is localized to the IM facing the IMS and exists in a complex with the IM proteins mitofilin and OPA1 and the OM protein Sam50. Furthermore, we analyzed the consequence of down-regulation of ChChd3 in HeLa cells by using the RNAi method and demonstrate that ChChd3 plays an essential role in maintaining CJ architecture, crista morphology, and mitochondrial function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Antibodies and Plasmids</title><p>Polyclonal antibodies against internal peptide sequence corresponding to ChChd3 mouse (QAKKESEHQRRLKQARDLERER) and human (QAKKESEDQKRLKQAKELDRER) protein sequence were generated in rabbits (Invitrogen).

The 80-nm sections were post-stained in Sato lead for 1 min, and the stained sections were imaged onto negatives using a JEM-1200EX I electron microscope operated at 80 kV.

Two sizes of colloidal gold particles, 15 and 20 nm in diameter, were deposited on opposite sides of the section to serve as fiducial cues. For stability in the beam, the section was coated with carbon. For each reconstruction, a single series of images was collected with a JEOL 4000EX intermediate high voltage electron microscope operated at 400 kV. The specimens were irradiated for about 30 min before initiating a tilt series to limit anisotropic specimen thinning during image collection. During data collection, the illumination was held to near parallel beam conditions. Single-tilt series were recorded using a 4 Ã 4k slow scan CCD camera controlled by serial EM at 12,000 magnification. Angular increments of 2Â° usually from â60 to +60Â° about an axis perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope were achieved using a computer-controlled goniometer to increment accurately the angular steps. The pixel resolution was 1.2 nm. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, each image was binned down two times by averaging adjacent pixels so that the final pixel resolution was 2.4 nm. The IMOD software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) was used for the complete image processing unless there were problems, and then TxBR software was used to refine the alignment and reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).

At the CJs, ChChd3 would form a complex with mitofilin and OPA1, and at the contact sites it would associate with mitofilin and Sam50 thereby influencing the regulation of crista biogenesis and mitochondrial protein import, respectively. <italic>MF,</italic> mitofilin; <italic>IBM,</italic> inner boundary membrane.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0071147260007"/></fig><p>Following our findings, Xie <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) reported ChChd3 as a part of the 340-kDa complex immunoprecipitated with the mitofilin antibody. Sam50, metaxin 1, and metaxin 2, the components of the SAM complex on the OM involved in Î²-barrel protein assembly, have also been immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) in the same complex. Because the reported study was restricted to immunoprecipitation with mitofilin antibody alone, we further sought to systematically analyze the specificity of these protein-protein interactions in which ChChd3 is involved. Because of the lack of availability of antibodies for metaxin 1 and 2, we restricted our studies to Sam50 and mitofilin in this complex. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged ChChd3 from HEK293 cells showed the presence of Sam50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). In a reciprocal experiment, endogenous ChChd3 was co-purified from the immunoisolated samples of mitofilin FLAG and Sam50 FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>) further confirming these protein-protein interactions.</p><p>To characterize the binding regions of mitofilin and Sam50 on ChChd3, we mapped the regions of ChChd3 that are required for their interaction. For this, we used transiently expressed C-terminally FLAG-tagged mutants that lack the N-terminal 14 amino acids (ÎNT) or the chch domain (ÎCT) in HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitation of these mutant proteins from HEK293 cells showed that ÎNT associates with mitofilin similar to that of the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>). However, interaction between ÎCT and mitofilin is significantly reduced compared with that of WT or ÎNT. In contrast, Sam50 showed efficient binding to ÎCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>). On the other hand, ÎNT failed to bind Sam50 indicating that ChChd3 binds to mitofilin through the chch domain and to Sam50 through its N terminus. As we identified that ChChd3 is myristoylated at the N terminus, we hypothesized that <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation may be involved in binding to Sam50. To test this, we generated the G2A mutant of ChChd3 and assessed the ability of this mutant protein to pull down Sam50 and mitofilin. Although G2A can efficiently pull down mitofilin, it was unable to bind Sam50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>), thus suggesting that ChChd3 binds to Sam50 via its myristoyl moiety or in a myristoylated conformation. It seems that in mitochondria, myristoylation recruits the N terminus of ChChd3 to the OM where the SAM complex is located, whereas the chch domain is recruited to the IM where it associates with mitofilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>I, model</italic>). HSP70 did not show any preference and was found to be associated with all the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>). The chch domain proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and are imported into the mitochondria in a completely reduced form. Molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP90 are known to bind the preproteins and prevent premature folding and to assist in transport to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Hence it is likely that HSP70 associates with ChChd3 in the reduced state in the cytoplasm before it is imported into the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>I, model</italic>).</p><p>Down-regulation of ChChd3 resulted in reduced OPA1 protein levels, impaired mitochondrial fusion, and crista remodeling along with narrowing of the CJ diameter. OPA1 has been shown to be involved in regulating crista remodeling independently of its role in mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Oligomers of OPA1 at the CJs are known to control the CJ opening diameter. Because the loss of ChChd3 leads to the alterations in crista morphology along with narrowing of CJ opening diameter, we hypothesized a plausible functional connection between ChChd3 and OPA1. Additionally, mitofilin, ChChd3, and OPA1 are localized in the same compartment in mitochondria, with IM facing the IMS. Hence we assessed the possibility of the complex between these three proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that both the ChChd3 and mitofilin could efficiently interact with OPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>). Interestingly, the soluble IMS form of OPA1 preferentially associated with both ChChd3 and mitofilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>). Furthermore, ChChd3 mutants ÎNT, G2A, and ÎCT showed reduced affinity toward binding to OPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>G</italic>). Analysis of these mutant proteins by immunofluorescence revealed that although WT protein is exclusively localized to mitochondria, ÎCT failed to localize to mitochondria. On the other hand, ÎNT and G2A are diffused throughout the cell and exhibit partial mitochondrial localization.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>4</sup></xref> Hence, it is likely that the interaction between OPA1 and ChChd3 is specific to mitochondrial IMS where soluble OPA1 is generated by the cleavage of the full-length transmembrane OPA1. To further confirm this complex in mitochondria, we immunoprecipitated ChChd3 from purified mouse liver mitochondria and analyzed for OPA1 and mitofilin binding. ChChd3 showed efficient binding to mitofilin and to the soluble IMS form of OPA1 in mitochondrial samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>H</italic>). The interaction of ChChd3 with OPA1 together with a decrease in the protein levels of OPA1 and reduced mitochondrial fusion in ChChd3 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref><italic>D</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) suggest that ChChd3 may play an essential role in regulating OPA1 function, specifically the soluble IMS form.</p></sec><sec><title>ChChd3 Knockdown Cells Show a Drastic Reduction in the Protein Levels of Mitofilin and Sam50</title><p>Because we found that ChChd3 interacts with mitofilin, Sam50, and OPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), and ChChd3 knockdown cells show reduced OPA1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>), we analyzed the protein levels of mitofilin and Sam50. Immunoblot analysis of the total cell lysates of control-shRNA and ChChd3-shRNA cells revealed a drastic reduction in both the mitofilin and Sam50 proteins in ChChd3 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>).

To determine whether the loss of Sam50 in ChChd3 knockdown cells resulted in defects in the assembly and stability of these proteins, we initially assessed the total cell lysates of control-shRNA- and ChChd3-shRNA-expressing cells for changes in these protein levels. No changes in TOM40 protein levels were observed. However, VDAC protein levels were reduced in ChChd3-shRNA cells (data not shown). To look for specific changes in mitochondrial protein levels, we separated soluble (cytoplasmic) and insoluble fractions (containing mitochondria) from the control-shRNA and ChChd3-shRNA cells and analyzed for VDAC and Tom40 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>).

To determine the cause for reduced cell number, we analyzed the control and ChChd3 knockdown cells for changes in apoptosis.

Also, no detectable changes in cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were found in both the untreated as well as staurosporine-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>B</italic>). As there was no indication of increased apoptosis, the reduction in ChChd3 knockdown cell number is most likely attributable to decreased cellular proliferation.

Although growing evidence points toward the role of autophagy in maintaining homeostasis by degrading the dysfunctional organelles and proteins, autophagy has also been specifically shown to associate with the type II (nonapoptotic) programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Because ChChd3 knockdown cells display severe defects in mitochondrial IM structure, it is likely that these abnormal mitochondria are being targeted for destruction by autophagy, and the elevated autophagy is also a possible reason for the decreased cell number observed in ChChd3 knockdown cells.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>ChChd3 belongs to the subset of chch domain family proteins that are known to be primarily in the IMS of mitochondria and are characterized for their roles in protein import and as metallochaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Although ChChd3 was identified in our laboratory a few years ago as a substrate for protein kinase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), the function of this protein is so far completely unknown. In this study, we describe the characterization of ChChd3 as a novel protein essential for maintaining crista integrity and mitochondrial function. We provide evidence suggesting that ChChd3 is one of the key proteins that stabilizes protein complexes involved in maintaining crista architecture and protein import, the two primary processes that regulate mitochondrial structure and function.</p><p>Down-regulation of ChChd3 in HeLa cells resulted in fragmentation and clustering of the mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). Studies with the dominant negative mutant of Drp1, DRP1<sup>K38A</sup>, which is resistant to fission, showed that the mitochondria in ChChd3 knockdown cells have impaired fusion activity. Additionally, ChChd3 interacts preferentially with the soluble IMS form of OPA1. Recent studies have suggested the essential role of OPA1 not only in mitochondrial fusion but also in remodeling of cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Even though both the long and short isoforms have been shown to be essential in regulating mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) and crista morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), the individual role of these isoforms is not clearly understood. A recent immuno-EM study identified a differential distribution of the two yeast isoforms of OPA1 (Mgm1) across the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Long Mgm1 was found strongly enriched in the crista membrane, and the short Mgm1 was preferentially localized on the OM/inner boundary membrane. Furthermore, by using various mutations in the GTPase domain, these authors showed that the functional GTPase domain is only required in short Mgm1 but not in long Mgm1 suggesting the idea of distinct function of each of these isoforms in mitochondria. It is likely that the fusion activity of OPA1 along with mitofusins on the OM is controlled by the s-OPA1 on the inner boundary membrane, whereas the crista morphology is regulated by long OPA1 on the crista membrane. Interaction of ChChd3 preferentially with soluble OPA1 and impaired fusion in ChChd3 knockdown cells indicate toward the potential involvement of ChChd3 in regulating the function of this isoform.</p><p>Depletion of ChChd3 resulted in major remodeling of the cristae and the CJ architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that mitofilin and OPA1 are located at the CJs and involved in regulating crista morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). We demonstrate that ChChd3 interacts with mitofilin and OPA1, and loss of ChChd3 results in near loss of mitofilin and 50% reduction in OPA1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). This suggests the possibility that all three proteins are in a complex at the CJs, where ChChd3 is a scaffolding protein that stabilizes the protein complexes and thus is involved in maintaining the integrity of CJs and in the formation/stabilization of cristae.</p><p>We also found that ChChd3 and mitofilin interact with Sam50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), the component of the SAM complex on the OM, involved in Î²-barrel protein assembly. Very few proteins have so far been known to regulate both the protein import and organelle morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The yeast protein, Mdm10, originally characterized for its role in mitochondrial dynamics and morphology has been shown to interact with SAM complex and is required for the Î²-barrel protein assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). To date, no mammalian proteins have been identified with dual functions in biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins and organelle morphology. Our results suggest the possible involvement of ChChd3 in protein import and/or assembly via SAM complex in addition to its role in regulating crista architecture.</p><p>The N-terminal POTRA domain of Sam50 is located in the IMS and has been shown to bind Î²-barrel precursor proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). In the IMS, ChChd3 may have a role in transporting the precursor proteins to the SAM complex. A similar function was suggested for IMS-translocase of inner membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). However, so far there is no evidence showing the association of translocase of inner membrane proteins with the SAM complex.</p><p>As ChChd3 is localized to both the OM and IM fractions in the fractionated mitochondria and associates with both OM and IM proteins, we predict that ChChd3, together with mitofilin and Sam50, is located at contact sites where both the inner and outer membranes come together. These membrane contacts are known to be essential for various mitochondrial functions, including metabolite channeling, coordinated fusion, fission, protein transport, and also for maintaining structural integrity of outer and inner membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Because CJs and contact sites are suggested to be two distinct structures on the IM and are not in preferential proximity to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), we propose that ChChd3 may be localized in discrete complexes at CJs and contact sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>I, model</italic>). At the CJs, ChChd3 is likely to be associated with mitofilin and OPA1, and at the contact sites it is expected to be in a complex with mitofilin and Sam50. It is likely that ChChd3 is dynamically distributed between these two distinct complexes under different conditions in the mitochondria.</p><p>The distinct morphological changes observed due to the knockdown of ChChd3 are more severe than the knockdown phenotypes of mitofilin, OPA1, or MICS1, the mitochondrial proteins previously known to be involved in regulating crista morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Loss of mitofilin resulted in an increase in the surface area of IM, with the cristae having degraded to the form of concentric sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Down-regulation of OPA1 caused fragmentation of mitochondria and remodeling of cristae to reticular, curved, or ring-shaped structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The cristae in MICS1-depleted mitochondria were observed to be curved and ring-like invaginations of the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In contrast, mitochondria in ChChd3 knockdown cells often did not contain any cristae. Those with cristae transitioned partly from lamellar to tubular cristae and overall showed a 50% reduction in the crista membrane surface area, indicating that either cristae were not formed properly or were disassembled more rapidly. Furthermore, loss of ChChd3 leads to a remarkable change in the CJ opening diameter without any significant changes in CJ number. This suggests that ChChd3 is not necessary for the formation of CJs; however, it is important for maintaining CJ architecture. On the contrary, loss of mitofilin was shown to affect the formation of CJs. Recent studies have established that CJ opening size depends on the OPA1 oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), which are important to our finding that ChChd3 associates with OPA1 and are thus likely to have a role in OPA1 oligomerization and in maintaining CJ architecture. Consistent with the reduction in crista surface area, cells lacking ChChd3 also showed reduction in several IM protein levels. At this point, it is not clear if reduced crista content has triggered the reduction in IM proteins or the decreased crista content is the result of reduced levels of the proteins necessary for the proper formation and stabilization of the cristae.</p><p>The severe defect in mitochondrial morphology of ChChd3 knockdown cells is also reflected in strikingly lower rates of cellular respiration indicating a clear defect in mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the decrease in mitochondrial respiration is not compensated by an increase in glycolysis. It is likely that the deficiency of ChChd3 resulted in an overall reduced rate of substrate oxidation, energy production, and energy utilization that is consistent with the observed decreased rate of cell proliferation.</p><p>Our studies clearly suggest that ChChd3 is indispensable for maintaining crista structure and cellular metabolism. In a recent review, Perkins <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) compiled findings showing that the central nervous system has significantly greater crista to mitochondrial surface area compared with the peripheral nervous system. Accordingly, ChChd3 (referred to as FLJ20420), which we showed to be essential for crista integrity, is highly abundant at synaptic membranes and in the neurons of rat brain throughout the gray matter, spinal cord, and at the dorsal root ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have shown altered levels of ChChd3 in disease models of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Increasing lines of evidence have now indicated that the impairment of mitochondrial structure and function is one of the primary mechanisms behind motor neuron death in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and cell death and injury in ischemia. Hence, it will be interesting to further understand whether ChChd3 plays a role in disease pathogenesis.</p><p>Our characterization of ChChd3 as a scaffolding protein for the SAM complex on the OM and mitofilin and OPA1 complex on the IM suggests that ChChd3 could be one of the key proteins that coordinate protein import and mitochondrial morphology, the two essential processes involved in proper functioning of mitochondria. Further studies are warranted to understand the dynamic localization of ChChd3 in these protein complexes and how ChChd3 regulates each of these protein complexes mechanistically. This will provide a better insight into the possible link between the essential processes that regulate organelle structure and function.</p></sec>
