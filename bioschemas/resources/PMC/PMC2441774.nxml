      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Myosin VI has challenged the lever arm hypothesis of myosin movement because of its ability to take ~36-nm steps along actin with a canonical lever arm that seems to be too short to allow such large steps. Here we demonstrate that the large step of dimeric myosin VI is primarily made possible by a medial tail in each monomer that forms a rare single Î±-helix of ~10 nm, which is anchored to the calmodulin-bound IQ domain by a globular proximal tail. With the medial tail contributing to the ~36-nm step, rather than dimerizing as previously proposed, we show that the cargo binding domain is the dimerization interface. Furthermore, the cargo binding domain seems to be folded back in the presence of the catalytic head, constituting a potential regulatory mechanism that inhibits dimerization.</p>

    <p id="P2">Myosin VI (M6) is a class of unconventional myosins that translocates along actin filaments to move and localize components within eukaryotic cells. Dimeric M6 undergoes processive motion, with a single molecule taking large, ~36-nm steps along an actin filament and traveling hundreds of nanometers without dissociation<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. M6 is unique in the myosin superfamily as it moves to the (â) end of actin filaments<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, as a result of the addition of a unique insert of ~40 residues that forms a hairpin turn inserted in its lever arm just as it exits the catalytic head at the converter domain<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P3">The processive step of M6 (refs. <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) is similar in size to that of myosin V<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, even though its lever arm is composed of only two calmodulin light chains<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, three times fewer than the six light chains of myosin V. It was therefore unclear whether M6 could work by the lever arm hypothesis<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> given the apparent lack of reach. This dilemma was partially resolved when it was shown that the M6 lever arm swings through ~180Â°<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, compared to only ~70Â° for myosins II and V<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, thus allowing for a large stroke size despite its short lever arm. This ~180Â° swing requires an unexpected change in the conformation of the converter, and the movement of the end of the IQ domain should be ~12 nm<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. How the M6 reaches the additional ~24 nm to achieve a stride of ~36 nm remains to be understood. One possibility is the presence of a flexible element located C-terminal to the lever arm, presumably just proximal to it, which allows the free head to diffuse forward the additional ~24 nm. This flexibility was suggested to be in the ~70-residue region just proximal to the lever arm, possibly configured as a random coil, with the next ~70 residues or medial tail region forming a coiled coil for dimerization<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Here we show that the proximal tail is actually structured, and the medial tail does not dimerize but provides the additional needed reach as a single Î±-helix, as was suggested by previous work that revealed an analogous structure in the tail of myosin X<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P4">Whereas full-length M6 is monomeric<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, recent studies indicate that M6 loaded onto vesicles is dimeric<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and that increasing the effective concentration of M6 leads to dimerization<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, showing that dimerization is possible. With the determination that the medial tail does not act as a dimerization domain, the assembly of M6 dimers became perplexing. Here we demonstrate that the cargo binding domain dimerizes the tail, but only in the absence of the M6 head. Additionally, the monomeric full-length protein has the cargo binding domain folded back onto the head, potentially in a regulated state that inhibits dimerization. This is consistent with previous results showing that full-length chicken M6 is monomeric and compact<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p>

        <title>The M6 tail is composed of four distinct domains</title>
        <p id="P5">The sequence of the ~450 residues immediately following the catalytic head and the known lever arm of M6 can be divided into four regions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> online). The characteristic heptad repeat pattern of a coiled coil with hydrophobic residues dominating the <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> positions is identifiable only in the first ~70 residues, which we call the proximal tail (PT, Pro835âGlu907; numbering is based on the human sequence). A transition to the second domain, also ~70 residues, occurs somewhere between Glu907 and Gln915. After Gln915, an extended run of alternating charge appears with only a few hydrophobic residues, the medial tail (MT, Glu908âArg980) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This alternating-charge pattern abruptly ends at residue Arg980, and the C-terminal tail sequence of ~50 residues just before the cargo binding domain has no obvious primary-sequence motifs; we call this region the distal tail (DT, Ile981âArg1035). We refer to the fourth and final region of ~250 residues as the cargo binding domain (CBD, Arg1036âLys1285).</p>

        <title>The PT is a folded domain required for long steps</title>
        <p id="P6">The PT has been proposed to be a random coil acting as the flexible element in the M6 tail that spans the remaining ~24-nm gap<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. To explore this model, we created three M6 mutants with altered PT domains (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref> online). The three constructs changed the sequence to varying degrees ranging from point mutations that removed nine core hydrophobic residues, proposed to be <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> positions on the basis of coiled-coil prediction algorithms<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> (altered A&amp;D), to randomization of up to 58 residues (850â907 random and 857â907 random). These changes were not expected to impair function if the proximal tail is a random coil, and hence these mutants would be expected to show the same stepping behavior of the control M6 dimer<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>; however, they would be expected to disrupt any organized tertiary structure. By labeling the motors with fluorophores, the motion of single molecules along actin filaments on the surface can be observed in a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope, allowing the rate of motion to be determined. Each of the three mutant constructs showed velocities in TIRF motility assays at 80 Î¼M ATP that were only ~50% of that of the control M6 dimer (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Because velocities can be altered by changing either step size or the rate of stepping, detailed optical trap assays were undertaken for one of the mutants. In this case, two beads are attached to an actin filament, one at each end, and held in two separate optical traps. The filament is then positioned above a single motor on the surface, and individual interactions between the motor and the filament are observed. Processive motors produce a characteristic staircase pattern where the displacement between plateaus measures the step size and the duration of the dwell measures the rate of stepping. These assays showed that the altered velocities result from a shortened step size and not altered stepping rates (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Therefore, the model of the PT as a random coil is unlikely.</p>
        <p id="P7">CD spectroscopy was used to determine what secondary-structure elements were present in the PT. CD revealed that the PT has a classic Î±-helical spectrum with minima at 222 nm and 208 nm and a maximum at 194 nm (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We estimated that ~80% of the residues in the PT are in an Î±-helical conformation. The strong minimum at 222 nm was measured as a function of temperature to track the stability of the PT. It unfolds in a cooperative manner characteristic of compact proteins, where tertiary contacts stabilize the secondary structure (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). These results indicate that the PT is a compact domain with a defined structure. This conclusion agrees with the hydrodynamic radius determination from gel filtration, which is that predicted for a spherical compact protein<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). An estimate of the PT structure (residues 835â915, in the human sequence) from the Rosetta 2.2.0 structure prediction algorithm<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> consistently yielded (7 out of 10 runs) a three-helix bundle with an end-to-end distance of ~3 nm, which is in good agreement with all experimental data and is considered to be a good estimate of the PT structure (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref> online).</p>

        <title>The MT is a single Î±-helix providing reach for 36-nm steps</title>
        <p id="P8">Two previous models have been put forward for the MTof M6. First, it has been suggested that at high concentrations M6 dimerizes via coiled-coil formation<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Second, M6 contains a charge-repeat pattern homologous to a domain in myosin X that has been shown to be a single Î±-helix in solution<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, suggesting that M6 may take the same conformation. To test these models, the MT and DT domains were expressed together in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified to homogeneity. A clear difference between the two models is that the coiled coil would be dimeric and the single Î±-helix would be monomeric. Multiple-angle light scattering (MALS) is capable of determining molecular weights in solution by measuring scattering as a function of angle while simultaneously measuring the protein concentration. Using MALS, we found that the MT-DT is monomeric, consistent with the single Î±-helix hypothesis. This was corroborated by dynamic light scattering, which measures light scattering as a function of time to determine the hydrodynamic radii (<italic>R</italic><sub>h</sub>). The measured <italic>R</italic><sub>h</sub> of 3.6 nm is consistent with an extended structure rather than a globular one (1.8 nm predicted<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, the CD spectrum and thermal melt curves of the MT-DT are those expected of a single Î±-helix, with a strongly Î±-helical spectrum and a broad thermal unfolding transition spanning ~70 Â°C, as shown for charged synthetic peptides<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). To directly assess the global structure of the domains, we recorded small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles and used <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstructions to develop low-resolution structural models of the MT-DT construct. The reconstruction for MT-DT (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), as well as that for the PT-DT construct (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), shows a long, bent, slender cylinder, similar in length to that expected with the 70-residue MT configured as a single Î±-helix.</p>
        <p id="P9">Although the MT-DT is monomeric under these conditions, it is possible that it was not assayed at a high enough concentration to dimerize. To increase the effective concentration, a Gly-Gly-Cys sequence was placed at the C terminus of the natively cysteine-free MT-DT construct, so that two copies could be held in close proximity by a specific disulfide bridge. This mechanism, which has been used in the study of the GCN4 coiled coil<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, does not inhibit coiled-coil formation and results in an apparent concentration of at least 4 mM<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. The CD spectrum and melt profile of this oxidized dimer were essentially identical to that of the MT-DT monomer (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), showing that even under these conditions the MT-DT is unable to form a dimeric coiled coil.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S5">
        <title>Constraining the MT eliminates processive stepping</title>
        <p id="P10">The above results are consistent with the MT providing the reach needed for the 36-nm step of M6. If the MT-DT domain is the long element that allows the two heads of M6 to separate during processive stepping, removing that reach will alter that processive stepping. A GCN4 sequence was placed just beyond the PT-MT boundary at residue 920 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, MT locked). This locks the two copies of M6 together in a coiled coil at this position and eliminates any contribution of the MT to processive stepping. The impact on motion was tested in gliding filament assays, where fluorescently labeled actin filaments glide across a motor-covered surface. This geometry is useful as it can assay both processive and nonprocessive motors, whereas the TIRF motility assay can assay only processive motors. Control M6 dimer at 2 mM ATP moved at 110 Â± 21 nm s<sup>â1</sup>, and MT locked moved at 75 Â± 26 nm s<sup>â1</sup>, significantly different results as assessed by a <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>n</italic> = 20 per group, <italic>P</italic>-value &gt; 0.001). The 75 nm s<sup>â1</sup> velocity is that expected for a stroke size of ~20 nm, which derives from the ~180Â° swing of the lever arm extended by the globular PT.</p>
        <p id="P11">Gliding filament assays are capable of testing more than just the velocity of a motor. Other parameters, such as the rate at which filaments land on the surface and the fraction of filaments that move greater than their length, can also be counted. The theoretical framework of the landing and continuous movement assays allows for quantitative predictions of the landing rate and the fraction of filaments that will move greater than their length as a function of motor density and the number of motors it takes to attach a filament to the surface<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. We created models in which either one motor (processive movement) or two motors (nonprocessive movement) were needed for filament attachment. Data from the control M6 dimer were more consistent with the processive model, whereas the MT locked construct was more consistent with the nonprocessive model in both assays (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Optical trap assays also indicate that a single motor of MT locked is incapable of producing the characteristic staircases of a processive motor. Instead, single bind-and-release events, characteristic of nonprocessive motors, were seen with a mean displacement of 23 Â± 26 nm (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>) and kinetics similar to the control M6 dimer with a mean dwell of 0.9 Â± 0.02 s. From these data, we conclude that the MT is the primary element in M6 that allows the heads to sample a large space and processively step along the 36-nm pseudorepeat of the actin filament.</p>

        <title>The CBD regulates dimerization of M6</title>
        <p id="P12">Neither the PT nor the MT dimerize at ~1 Î¼M (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). To further explore M6 dimerization, we examined the role of the CBD. Indeed, MALS analysis showed that a construct extending from the beginning of the PT to the end of the CBD is dimeric at concentrations in the micromolar range, which indicates reasonable affinity (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Because the PT and the MT-DT do not self associate at these concentrations, we conclude that the CBD is needed for this dimerization. However, under the same conditions, the full-length M6 is monomeric (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), in agreement with previous work<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. From these results, we conclude that the CBD dimerization must be inhibited by the M6 head. This is corroborated by the compactness of the SAXS envelope of full-length M6 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). If the model for the PT-MT (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) is fused to the structure of the M6 head and a globular CBD, the resultant full-length M6 monomer cannot fit into the experimental SAXS envelope without a high degree of bending (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This implies that the full-length M6 monomer is in a folded-back state, with an interaction occurring between the CBD and the M6 head, and that this interaction inhibits dimerization. It is likely that the binding of cargo to the CBD helps regulate the equilibrium between this folded-back monomeric state and the dimeric form of M6, especially given the orientation of the CBD when bound to the membrane<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and the observation that M6 dimerizes when binding to membrane<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P13">The average spacing between the two heads of the processively stepping M6 dimer is 36 nm, yet the lever arm structure that encompasses the two calmodulin binding domains swinging through an angle of ~180Â° explains the protein structure for only ~12 nm of this distance<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. This leaves a large 24-nm gap that needs to be spanned by relatively few residues. One possibility is that this gap is filled by both the PT and the MT, and the CBD self-associates to hold the two copies of the full-length M6 together. Because PT is a globular folded domain that immediately follows the calmodulin binding domains, the PT could extend the lever arm by as much as ~3 nm. Owing to the ~180Â° lever arm rotation, this ~3-nm extension would increase the stroke size of the motor by ~6 nm to a total of 18 nm<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. This would leave an ~18-nm gap in the stride distance of the two heads of the stepping dimer that must be filled by the MT-DT. The MT, owing to its stable single Î±-helix, is ~10 nm long, with the DT adding an additional ~3 nm, assuming a somewhat folded DT structure (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Thus, two copies of MT-DT are more than sufficient to bridge the gap between the two heads and would also allow step sizes larger than 36 nm, as has been reported<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This model is supported by the linear arrangement of the PT-MT-DT domains suggested by the SAXS envelope (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), where the IQ-based lever arm is simply being extended by an additional rod-like segment.</p>
      <p id="P14">It should be emphasized that the angle between the folded PT and the canonical calmodulin-IQ lever arm is unknown, and the PT may be orientated such that it does not add its full-length to the working stroke of the motor. In fact, it is even possible that the PT may actually shorten the stroke if it is able to fold back onto the IQ-bound calmodulin, in an arrangement made possible because the MT is long enough to bridge the gap between the heads without help from the PT. This model of the PT folding back onto the IQ-calmodulin lever arm actually leads to a better fit into the monomeric full-length SAXS envelope (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This raises the possibility that the purpose of the PT may not be to extend the lever arm, but rather to mediate interactions with other proteins. This fits with the observation that the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> protein Echinoid was identified as binding M6 at the PT<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. It is also possible that the PT is part of the binding site for the M6 CBD in the folded-back structure in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. The role of the PT is most likely to be some hybrid of the two orientations described, emphasizing the need for additional structural studies to completely characterize the IQ and PT junction and the role of the PT.</p>
      <p id="P15">The ~10-nm single Î±-helical structure of the MT is remarkable, with few other natural examples<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> in known protein structures. The characteristic i to i+4 alternating-charge pattern (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, inset) has been shown previously to stabilize Î±-helical peptides in solution<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>; it has also been noted that the MT is similar to the single stable Î±-helix that has been described for myosin X and is proposed to extend the myosin X lever arm<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Studies on the material properties of other single Î±-helices indicate that the Youngâs modulus for lateral bending is ~2.5 GPa<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, which would lead to a persistence length of ~12 nm. This suggests that the MT would not be a rigid rod at the scale of these lengths, which is supported by the observation that synthetic Î±-helical peptides have radii of gyration shorter than expected for rigid rods<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. This seems contradictory with the MT adding to the stroke of M6, but the previously studied peptides have only one stabilizing i to i+4 interaction per helical turn, whereas the MT has as many as four of these interactions, potentially enhancing its rigidity and enabling it to extend the lever arm. A rigid MT is supported by the <italic>R</italic><sub>h</sub> measurement of 4.3 nm, which is in agreement with the predicted 3.7-nm radius of gyration from the suggested structure, indicating that the static model has similar properties to the dynamic object in solution. The hypothesis of the rigid tail domain is made more plausible with the recent observations that the M6 head can adopt many lever angles that could explain the highly variable step size of M6 (refs. <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), without requiring a flexible tail domain. Further experimentation is needed to clarify the material properties of the MT and its exact contribution to the M6 stroke.</p>
      <p id="P16">With the PT and MT spanning the distance between the two heads, the CBD does not need to add to the reach of the M6 dimer. Here we show that at ~1 Î¼M the PT-DT is monomeric, whereas the CBD can initiate dimerization of the tail. Notably, it was previously reported that, when the effective M6 concentration is increased using monoclonal antibody binding to the C terminus or rigor binding of M6 monomers to F-actin, a construct ending at residue 992 in the DT seems to dimerize, as judged by rotary-shadowing EM and single-molecule processive movement<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Remarkably, this dimerization persists under dilute conditions (less than nanomolar concentrations) used in single-molecule assays. Further experiments are necessary to explain the persistent dimerization observed in their construct, given that our studies show that PT-DT does not dimerize at 1 Î¼M. However, our experiments suggest that the CBD is the preferred dimerization interface for the M6 helical tail, as depicted in our model (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P17">We find that the full-length M6 structure is compact, resulting from a folding back of the CBD onto the M6 head. It has recently been observed that a high degree of flexibility exists in the M6 motor domain<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. This flexibility exists before the beginning of the lever arm and presumably relates to the ability of the lever arm to adopt multiple angles relative to the head. This variability in the lever arm angle could influence the folded-back state that we observe, but it is clear that a separate new flexibility is needed to create the folded-back state proposed here. It is unclear from where this new flexibility originates, given that all of the tail fragments seem rigid. One possibility is that the joints between the domains are flexible, enabling the domains to bend with respect to each other. Another possibility is that the energy released upon CBD docking to another part of the structure may be enough to induce a change in one of the tail domains, creating a bend. Thus, there could be two possible IQ-PT connection angles: one in the monomeric folded state (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) and another in the extended dimeric state (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Alternatively, the MT might rearrange as there are several places where the repeating-charge pattern is less robust and the MT is presumably more likely to bend.</p>
      <p id="P18">We propose a model for M6 regulation where the cytoplasmic CBD dimerization is inhibited by binding of the CBD to the M6 head, and upon binding to cargo the CBD releases the head and initiates dimerization. This allows us to draw a scale model of stepping M6 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) that successfully accounts for the behavior of the motor and assigns the necessary functions to each domain.</p>

        <p>M6 tail domains and experimental constructs. The tail domains of M6 are indicated in the context of the full-length protein, with the position of the first residue of each domain in the human sequence annotated. The calmodulin binding domains are the heretofore known elements of the lever arm (LA); the end of the IQ helix is residue 835. Sequences from the MT from four species are presented to show the repeating-charge pattern, which switches approximately every four residues. The <italic>E. coli</italic> â expressed tail fragments are shown along with the construct name. The control M6 dimer, the MT locked mutant and the PT mutant constructs were modified by insertion of a GCN4 segment (black regions) to ensure dimerization at the low concentrations used for single-molecule analyses and by replacing the cargo binding domain (CBD) with YFP to provide a specific surface-attachment point via a YFP monoclonal antibody. The location of the randomized PT is gray.</p>

Inset, thermal melt curves showing that both constructs have a broad thermal unfolding transition as expected for a single Î±-helix. The similarity of the spectra and melt curves of the monomer and dimer indicates that no structural changes occur when the MT-DT is placed in conditions mimicking high concentrations. This indicates an inability of the MT-DT to dimerize.</p>

        <p>A scale model of a M6 dimer moving along an actin filament. The F-actinâdocked myosin model is based on that proposed by Holmes <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Monomers corresponding to the two protofilaments are colored in light and dark gray, respectively, to emphasize the pseudorepeat at 36 nm. Using a structural alignment in PyMOL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net">http://pymol.sourceforge.net</ext-link>), the post-stroke structure of the M6 head (PDB 2BKI<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) was docked onto the filament. The prestroke structure (PDB 2V26<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) was also docked onto the actin filament 13 monomers removed from the post-stroke head. These structures along with the associated light chains are shown in purple. The tail model presented in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, with the same color scheme, has been fused to the end of the IQ domains such that the PT projects along the same vector as the IQ helix (cyan) and then rotates around the Gly839 to remove steric clashes. This represents an orientation where the PT maximally contributes to the M6 stroke, which is one of many potential angles at which it meets the IQ domain. The cargo binding domains are shown in close association, as their dimerization suggests. The SAXS envelopes were then superimposed on the model to place the data in context of a working motor using Chimera<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>. This model shows that the proposed roles for the tail domains are clearly compatible with a 36-nm processive step for a M6 dimer.</p>
