      <abstract>
        <p>S100A8 and S100A9 are two calcium binding Myeloid Related Proteins, and important mediators of inflammatory diseases. They were recently introduced as partners for phagocyte NADPH oxidase regulation. However, the precise mechanism of their interaction remains elusive. We had for aim (i) to evaluate the impact of S100 proteins on NADPH oxidase activity; (ii) to characterize molecular interaction of either S100A8, S100A9, or S100A8/S100A9 heterocomplex with cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558</sub>; and (iii) to determine the S100A8 consensus site involved in cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558</sub>/S100 interface. Recombinant full length or S100A9-A8 truncated chimera proteins and ExoS-S100 fusion proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> respectivel<italic>y</italic>. Our results showed that S100A8 is the functional partner for NADPH oxidase activation contrary to S100A9, however, the loading with calcium and a combination with phosphorylated S100A9 are essential <italic>in vivo</italic>. Endogenous S100A9 and S100A8 colocalize in differentiated and PMA stimulated PLB985 cells, with Nox2/gp91<sup>phox</sup> and p22<sup>phox</sup>. Recombinant S100A8, loaded with calcium and fused with the first 129 or 54 N-terminal amino acid residues of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ExoS toxin, induced a similar oxidase activation <italic>in vitro,</italic> to the one observed with S100A8 in the presence of S100A9 <italic>in vivo</italic>. This suggests that S100A8 is the essential component of the S100A9/S100A8 heterocomplex for oxidase activation. In this context, recombinant full-length rS100A9-A8 and rS100A9-A8 truncated 90 chimera proteins as opposed to rS100A9-A8 truncated 86 and rS100A9-A8 truncated 57 chimeras, activate the NADPH oxidase function of purified cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558</sub> suggesting that the C-terminal region of S100A8 is directly involved in the molecular interface with the hemoprotein. The data point to four strategic <sup>87</sup>HEES<sup>90</sup> amino acid residues of the S100A8 C-terminal sequence that are involved directly in the molecular interaction with cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> and then in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase activation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Myeloid-Related Proteins (MRP), S100A8 (MRP8) and S100A9 (MRP14), are two calcium-binding proteins of the multigenic S100 family, specifically linked to innate immunity <xref rid="pone.0040277-Roth1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. They are mainly expressed in cells of myeloid origin such as neutrophils or monocytes, but are absent in Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV) immortalized B lymphocytes <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. They were also identified in epithelial cells and keratinocytes <xref rid="pone.0040277-Benedyk1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Voss1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In phagocytes, S100A8 and S100A9 associate to form physiologically oligomeric structures (dimer or tetramer) that bind polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid in a calcium dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0040277-Kerkhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> S100A8/S100A9 heterocomplex, named S100A8/S100A9, accounts for the entire arachidonic acid-binding capacity of neutrophil cytosol. The fatty acid carboxyl group is bound by consecutive histidine residues within the unique C-tail of S100A9 <xref rid="pone.0040277-Sopalla1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>S100 proteins such as S100A8 and S100A9, form non-covalent and antiparallel associated S100A8/S100A9 complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>, which exhibit various functional intra and extra cellular properties <xref rid="pone.0040277-Goyette1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In neutrophils, they are involved in cell differentiation, inhibition of casein kinase II, and trans-endothelial migration. But one of their main functions is to be partners of phagocyte NADPH oxidase regulation <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Indeed, S100A8/S100A9 favors the activation of NADPH oxidase. The process is dependent on the transfer of arachidonic acid to plasma membrane level onto cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558</sub>; during this transfer, S100A8/S100A9 associates with p67<sup>phox</sup> and Rac <xref rid="pone.0040277-Kerkhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Doussiere1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. p67<sup>phox</sup> translocates with other associated cytosolic factors, p47<sup>phox</sup> and p40<sup>phox</sup>, at the plasma membrane to form an active NADPH oxidase complex with cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>. Moreover, the relevant role of S100A8 and S100A9 in the oxidative response depends on the presence of calcium and on a phosphorylation-dependent translocation to plasma membrane where NADPH oxidase assembles and is activated <xref rid="pone.0040277-Roth2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Schenten1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Schenten2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. S100A8 and S100A9 are also secreted outside of the cells through a Golgi-independent pathway <xref rid="pone.0040277-Rammes1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. They bind to heparin sulfate proteoglycans resulting in accumulation at the endothelium surface of extracellular complexes of S100A8 and S100A9 that interact with specific binding sites. In this context, both proteins were reported at local sites of inflammation, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Gebhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Baillet1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> in neoplastic tumors <xref rid="pone.0040277-Nicolas1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and in skin diseases <xref rid="pone.0040277-Benedyk1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, where they trigger a crucial danger signal. The term âAlarminâ was introduced recently for these molecules <xref rid="pone.0040277-Foell1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However S100A8, and to some extent S100A9, are also particularly susceptible to oxidation: recent data suggest that post-translational oxidative modifications of both S100 proteins may act as a regulatory switch and have an important protective role in inflammation <xref rid="pone.0040277-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. An oligomeric structure of S100A8/S100A9 was reported: while S100A8/S100A9 heterodimers are formed in the absence of calcium, a tetramer structure construction is strictly calcium dependent <xref rid="pone.0040277-Vogl1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and was recently crystallized <xref rid="pone.0040277-Korndorfer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. S100A8 and S100A9 contain two calcium-binding sites of EF-hand type; the heterodimer binds four Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. Besides calcium, S100A8 and S100A9 are also able to bind zinc, but the binding requires a heterodimer structure that is necessary to form a zinc-binding site. The heterotetramer displays a high affinity for Zn<sup>2+</sup>: two HXXXH motifs per dimer (residues 83â87) in S100A8 and (residues 91â95) in S100A9 were suggested to be responsible for Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding. The HXXXH motifs are located at the interface between the respective S100 sub-units; a similar motif was also involved for the zinc-dependent matrix metalloproteinase activity <xref rid="pone.0040277-Roth1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, it was reported that the binding of zinc could reverse the calcium-induced arachidonic acid-binding capacity of S100A8/S100A9 heterocomplex <xref rid="pone.0040277-Kerkhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Two prominent roles were assigned to S100A8/S100A9 hetero-oligomers : not only a role in regulation of inflammatory processes, immune response, and wound repair, but also a role in zinc sequestration, inhibiting zinc-dependent enzymes, as well as microbial growth <xref rid="pone.0040277-Korndorfer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Nox2 is the prototype of the NADPH oxidase Nox-Duox family, from which 7 members were characterized in humans <xref rid="pone.0040277-Bedard1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In neutrophils, cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> is the redox core of NADPH oxidase <xref rid="pone.0040277-Morel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Vignais1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and the membrane anchorage site for assembly with cytosolic factors, p67<sup>phox</sup>, p47<sup>phox</sup>, p40<sup>phox</sup>, and Rac1/2. NADPH oxidase is unassembled and inactive in resting cells, but upon stimulation by inflammatory mediators or during phagocytosis, the phosphorylation of phox proteins induces intra and intermolecular rearrangements that stabilize all the partners as an oxidase complex at the plasma membrane. This gives an optimal cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558</sub> conformation and NADPH oxidase activity.</p>
      <p>An allosteric regulation of NADPH oxidase activity was reported <xref rid="pone.0040277-Paclet1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>: gp91<sup>phox</sup> or Nox2, was introduced as the catalytic sub-unit of cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>, while p22<sup>phox</sup> may stabilize the Nox2/p22<sup>phox</sup> heterodimer. The cytosolic activating factors are regulatory effectors: p47<sup>phox</sup> behaving as an adaptor, while the interaction between p67<sup>phox</sup> and Nox2 initiates both assembly and activation. In fact, the binding of p67<sup>phox</sup> to cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558</sub>, mediates the transition from an inactive to an active conformation of the hemoprotein <xref rid="pone.0040277-Paclet2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Recent data suggested that S100A8/S100A9 could be new allosteric effectors of NADPH oxidase activation in neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>; they might potentiate activation of NADPH oxidase and radical oxygen species production. However the mechanisms by which the S100A8/S100A9 heterocomplex increases NADPH oxidase activity remain unknown.</p>
      <p>The present article emphasizes the respective functions of S100A8 and S100A9 in neutrophils, and their role in NADPH oxidase activation. Our data confirm that S100A8 is the privileged interactive partner of cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558.</sub> Furthermore, we show that four amino-acid residues of the C-terminal sequence of S100A8 are directly involved in NADPH oxidase activation. But the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction of S100A8 with cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558</sub> proceeds through a strategic calcium mediated 3D structure conformation involving both S100A8 and S100A9.</p>

        <title>Generation of Monoclonal Antibodies Against S100 Proteins</title>
        <p>In order to study the function of S100 proteins, we first generated monoclonal antibodies raised against S100A8 and S100A9 by intra-peritoneal injection of 4 mice with S100 proteins purified from cytosol of human neutrophils. The IgGs were produced from hybridoma in ascetic fluid and were purified as described in Material and Methods. The specificity of two selected clones, 5A10 (IgG1) and 2H9 (IgG2a), was controlled referring to rS100A8, rS100A9, or S100 proteins purified from cytosol of neutrophils, and rS100A9-A8 chimera proteins. Moreover, a purified rHIS-S100A12 expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> was used as negative control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040277.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) and identified by Western blot with monoclonal antibodies anti-S100A12 (19F5), and anti-histidine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040277.s001">Figure S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). 2H9 and 5A10 antibodies both recognized native S100 proteins in the neutrophil cytosol and in differenciated PLB985 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>) but not rS100A12 proteins. Additionally, 2H9 antibody labeled specifically native (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) or denatured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 3) rS100A9 but not rS100A8. On the contrary, 5A10 bound only native S100 proteins prepared from cytosol of neutrophils but not rS100A8 or rS100A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, 5A10 antibody seemed to recognize S100 proteins only when they were in their native (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, in the neutrophil cytosol and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 8) or chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, line 4) dimerisation states but not when S100 proteins are in monomer status. These results suggest that 5A10 is a conformational antibody and therefore that rS100A9-A8 chimera protein may be in a correct native 3D-like conformation. Finally, as shown on lane 7 of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">figure 1C</xref> and on lane 7 of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">figure 1D</xref>, the rS100A9-A8Î57 chimera protein was not labeled by 5A10 which suggests that the epitope targeted by this antibody could be located between the 86 and 57 amino acid residues of S100A8. A polyclonal antibody (pAb), recognizing both S100A8 and S100A9, was used as a control.</p>

<italic>Ex vivo</italic> S100 Protein Delivery by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Type Three Secretion System (TTSS) into EBV-B Lymphocyte Cells Stimulates NADPH Oxidase Acticity</title>
        <p>In a previous work, we have shown that the NADPH oxidase activity was enhanced after transfection in EBV-B lymphocytes of the genes encoding for S100A8 and S100A9 <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To further confirm this finding and to investigate the impact of S100A8 and S100A9 alone or as heterodimer on NADPH oxidase activity, we decided to use the TTSS of Gram (-) <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to deliver both proteins inside the cytosol of EBV-B lymphocytes. This delivery system was previously successfully used to reconstitute a functional NADPH oxidase in p67<sup>phox</sup> deficient EBV-B lymphocytes of Chronic Granulomatous Disease patients by injecting ExoS129-p67<sup>phox</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0040277-Polack1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Furthermore, the EBV-B lymphocytes constitute an appropriate cellular model for this study since they are totally devoid of S100A8 and S100A9, and also because they display a very low NADPH oxidase activity <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
        <p>rExoS-S100A8 and rExoS-S100A9 fusion proteins were constructed in frame with the first 54 or the first 129 N-terminal amino acid residues of Exotoxin S (ExoS) toxin sequence, from <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> as described in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g002">Figure 2</xref>. An adequate folding status was maintained by a specific interaction with chaperone Orf-1 (design of constructions in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040277.s003">Table S1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0040277-Derouazi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0040277-Polack2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We first verified that rExoS-S100A8 and rExoS-S100A9 were effectively secreted by the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CHA strain. After induction by calcium-depletion, the fusion proteins with an apparent molecular mass of â¼30â35 kDa were identified by specific polyclonal antibodies raised against S100 proteins of neutrophil cytosol and were found only in the extracellular medium of induced <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We next used <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CHA-S100A8 and CHA-S100A9 to deliver the hybrid fusion rExoS129 or rExoS54 proteins into the cytosol of normal EBV-B lymphocytes. NADPH oxidase activity of (phorbol-myristate-acetate) PMA-stimulated EBV-B lymphocytes was then measured by chemiluminescence. There was no enhancement of oxidase activity of EBV-B lymphocytes over the control value when CHA strain was transformed with the empty vector pUCP20 or with CHA-ExsA-, a mutated strain unable to secrete proteins (not shown). Interestingly, we observed an increase of the NADPH oxidase activity after the delivery of rExoS129-S100A8 into EBV-B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) but not for rExoS-S100A9. It can be also observed that injection of both rExoS-S100A9 and rExoS-S100A8 had no positive activation of oxidase mediated by rExoS-S100A8 on its own, probably because of an unbalanced secreted rExoS-S100A9/rExoS-S100A8 ratio. Indeed, the amount of rS100A9 secreted by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CHA strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) or expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> (data not shown) is higher than for rS100A8. However, a negative effect of rExoS129-S100A9 proteins on the conformation of rExoS-S100A8 could not be excluded.</p>

        <p>In order to keep a 1/1 S100A9/S100A8 ratio, we decided to generate fusion S100A8 and S100A9 chimera proteins in frame with the ExoS54 or ExoS129: one with the S100A9 on the N terminal side (rS100A9-A8) and one on the C terminal side (rS100A8-A9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A significant activation of NADPH oxidase was obtained with rExoS129-S100A9-A8 chimera delivery contrary to rExoS129-S100A8-A9 showing a preferential orientation of the chimera with S100A8 at the C terminal side in order to have a correct functional conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Those results were confirmed with ExoS54-S100 fusion proteins: both rExoS54-S100A8 and rExoS54-S100A9-A8 chimera but not the rExoS54-S100A8-A9 increased NADPH oxidase activity of EBV-B lymphocytes after delivery of fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

The addition of calcium loaded rExoS129-S100A8 or rExoS54-S100A8 to cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> led to a specific enhancement of NADPH oxidase activity up to 58Â±7 s<sup>â1</sup> and 43Â±6 s<sup>â1</sup> respectively, versus control 26<bold>Â±</bold>5 s<sup>â1</sup>, contrary to what was observed with rS100A8 alone or with rExoS54-S100A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The enhancement of oxidase turnover is dependent on rExoS54-S100A8 and rExoS54-S100A9-A8 chimera concentrations with an optimum at 2 Âµg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and at 1.1 Âµg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) respectively.

Similar results were obtained with rExoS129-S100A8 and rExoS-129 S100A9 (not shown).</p>
        <p>All these results highlight a specific interface between S100A8 and the cytochrome <italic>b</italic>

They also suggest that the activation of NADPH oxidase is mediated by S100A8 <italic>in vivo,</italic> either by association with S100A9 in the presence of calcium, or <italic>in vitro</italic> by using a fusion protein with the first 54 or 129 N-terminal amino-acid residues of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ExoS toxin; leading to the idea that the portion of ExoS fused with S100A8 may provide a proper conformation for S100A8 protein required for oxidase activation through cytochrome b558 interface. In order to determine the sequence of ExoS responsible for this effect, we therefore evaluated the NADPH oxidase activity in the presence of S100A9 or S100A8 fused with different length of ExoS (129, 54, 30 and 17 N-terminal amino-acid residues). Recently, the first 54 N terminal amino acids of ExoS was reported to correspond to the minimal domain required for a secretion by the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040277-Derouazi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Quenee1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Therefore, since <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CHA strain is unable to secrete the S100 recombinant proteins fused with the ExoS30 or ExoS17, we produced those proteins (rExoS30- or 17-S100A8) in IPTG induced <italic>E. coli,</italic> as described in Material and Methods. A cell-free assay was performed by incubating purified cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558</sub> with the various recombinant proteins expressed either from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic>. NADPH oxidase activity was measured after arachidonic acid stimulation. An optimum oxidase turnover of 58Â±7 s<sup>â1</sup> was obtained with rExoS129-S100A8 versus control 28Â±5 s<sup>â1</sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; the stimulation effect disappeared when the length of the N-terminal domain of ExoS is shorter than 54 or is absent. Those results suggest that rExoS129 or rExoS54 may serve as a scaffold for the conformational required by S100A8 to stimulate the NADPH oxidase.</p>

        <title>The C-terminal Domain of S100A8 Proteins is Implicated in the NADPH Oxidase Activation</title>
        <p>We have demonstrated that S100A8 is a positive effector of NADPH oxidase (Nox2) activation (1) <italic>in vivo</italic>, after transfection of the genes encoding the S100A8 and S100A9 proteins <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, (2) <italic>ex vivo</italic> after injection of ExoS129 or rExoS54-S100A8 by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to EBV B-lymphocytes, and (3) <italic>in vitro</italic> (cell-free assay) by using recombinant ExoS129 or rExoS54-S100A8 or a 1â¶1 mixture of rS100A8 and rS100A9 proteins. We further wanted to analyze the role of different S100A8 domains on NADPH oxidase activity. Since S100A8 protein possesses EF-hand binding sites for the calcium and one motif of S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer zinc binding site, we first evaluated the implication of these two compounds in the S100A8-mediated NADPH oxidase activity. The effect of preloading with calcium versus zinc of S100 proteins was carried out to evaluate a putative role of zinc in mediating NADPH oxidase activation. First incubation with Zn<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, lane 2, 3 and 4) did not modify the NADPH oxidase turnover. Recombinant rS100A9-A8 chimera protein, preloaded with 20 ÂµM CaCl<sub>2</sub> or only 500 nM, displays a significant enhanced oxidase activity, as shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, lane 5 and 6. However, there was no activation when 20 ÂµM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> was added instead of calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, lane 7). The addition of first calcium and then zinc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, lane 8 and 9) or vice/versa (not shown), inhibits the oxidase activation by the rS100A9-A8 chimera protein. As reported previously <xref rid="pone.0040277-Kerkhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Vogl1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, it is likely that in the presence of both cations, Zn<sup>2+</sup> replaced Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the EF-hand binding sites and therefore annihilated the activation of NADPH oxidase by the rS100A9-A8 chimera protein.</p>

        <p>In order to determine the domain of S100A8 involved in the stimulation of NADPH oxidase activity, several truncated forms of the rS100A9-A8 chimera proteins were designed to remove sequentially important domains of S100A8 necessary for their function. Therefore, the chimera rS100A9-A8 was truncated from the C terminal side to excise progressively the putative zinc motif and calcium binding domains of S100A8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Those proteins correspond to rS100A9-A8 full length or truncated at 57 (rS100A9-A8Î57), 86 (rS100A9-A8Î86), or 90 (rS100A9-A8Î90) amino acid residues of S100A8 sequence. They were produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and purified proteins were identified by slot blot and Western blot as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040277-g001">Figure 1D and E</xref>). These chimeras were incubated (1 Âµg each) after calcium loading (500 nM), with purified cytochrome <italic>b</italic>

NADPH oxidase activity, expressed as turnover (s<sup>â1</sup>), was measured after adding (150 ÂµM) NADPH upon arachidonic acid stimulation as described in Materials and Methods.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We previously demonstrated, through <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> approaches, that two proteins of the S100 family, S100A8 and S100A9, highly expressed in myeloid cells and mainly in neutrophils, are able to promote NADPH oxidase activation <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Paclet1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Our results strongly suggest a specific interaction of S100A8 with cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558,</sub> the redox component of phagocyte NADPH oxidase, and introduce S100A8 as a privileged partner for NADPH oxidase activation. In this respect, a consensus site of the S100A8 C-terminal sequence is critical and should be directly involved in the interface with cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an opportunistic bacterium; one of its major toxins, ExoS, is translocated into EBV-B lymphocytes through a type III secretion pathway <xref rid="pone.0040277-Polack1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This original procedure of injection into a deficient target cell allowed determining which of S100A8 or S100A9 is the main effector of NADPH oxidase activation. The <italic>ex vivo</italic> delivery of ExoS129-S100A8 fusion proteins activated NADPH oxidase of EBV-B lymphocytes as after transfection of the genes encoding for both S100A8 and S100A9 suggesting that S100A8 is the privileged partner of cytochrome <italic>b</italic>
<sub>558</sub>. Interestingly, although it served primary as molecular âmessengerâ for protein delivery, ExoS also permitted a specific interaction of the injected protein with its partner suggesting that ExoS may facilitate a proper functional conformation for S100A8 <xref rid="pone.0040277-Polack1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, this property disappears when the length of ExoS is shorter than 54 N terminal amino-acid residues. Rucks and Olson <xref rid="pone.0040277-Rucks1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> reported that the N-terminal region of ExoS included a GTPase activating GAP domain <xref rid="pone.0040277-Rucks1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The smallest GAP ExoS domain described is composed of the N-terminal 130 amino acid residues <xref rid="pone.0040277-Wurtele1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We confirmed that, <italic>in vitro,</italic> ExoS129-S100A8 and ExoS54-S100A8 had a similar enhancing effect on NADPH oxidase activity, while the helix involved in GAP activity was only present in the ExoS129 domain, and not in ExoS54. The data exclude any involvement of GAP activity in ExoS-S100A8 oxidase activation. The high affinity of S100A9 to S100A8 could stabilize S100A8 <italic>in vivo</italic> and facilitate the translocation to plasma membrane. The flexible ExoS of ExoS-S100A8 fusion protein could have a similar stabilizing conformation effect. Therefore, the 3D tertiary structure of the critical S100A8 domain involved in oxidase activation is probably similar in the calcium-loaded ExoS-S100A8 and in the calcium-loaded S100A8/S100A9 heterocomplex.</p>
      <p>S100A8 and S100A9 are EF-hand molecules that need calcium to modulate target proteins. Cell calcium concentration is an important determinant for the biologic relevance of S100 proteins oligomerisation. The oligomeric status of S100A8 and S100A9 is rather complex in human: S100A8 and S100A9 are able to heterodimerize <xref rid="pone.0040277-Korndorfer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In the presence of calcium, they associate to form oligomers <xref rid="pone.0040277-Vogl2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. As a consequence, two different putative zinc-binding sites emerge at the S100A8/S100A9 subunit interface that may explain the well-known Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding activity of hetero-complex. We observed that, not only S100A8/S100A9 heterocomplex (not shown) but also rS100A9-A8 protein chimera (this paper) do not activate NADPH oxidase after loading with zinc, as opposed to what is observed with calcium. These data confirm that only calcium is necessary for the S100A9/S100A8 heterocomplex to modulate the activity of the target cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>. Although, zinc and calcium bind to different consensus sites, our results suggest that in the presence of zinc, calcium is removed from its binding sites as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0040277-Kerkhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Vogl1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The transitory elevation of calcium in neutrophils after inflammatory stimuli, initiates reaction cascades beginning in cytosol with phosphorylation of the cytosolic activating factors of oxidase, mainly p47<sup>phox</sup> and p67<sup>phox</sup>, and also with phosphorylation of S100A9 <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Phosphorylation could enhance S100A9 affinity for calcium as described recently for Nox5 <xref rid="pone.0040277-Jagnandan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Tirone1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and improve the Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading of S100A8/S100A9 and translocation to plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0040277-Schenten1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the calcium source leading to its mobilization has not been formally identified.</p>
      <p>S100A8/S100A9 is an intracellular reservoir for arachidonic acid in neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0040277-Sopalla1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Contrary to what was observed in the presence of calcium, arachidonic acid binding capacity to the S100 complex is not induced in the presence of zinc but may moreover reverse the effect of calcium <xref rid="pone.0040277-Kerkhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However the concentration of Zn<sup>2+</sup> used was within the range of 10 to 20 ÂµM while, in cells and tissues, it is assumed to be below 1 ÂµM; in consequence, this inhibition effect is negligeable and S100A8 and S100A9 may bind arachidonic acid <italic>in vivo,</italic> as both S100 proteins are calcium saturated <xref rid="pone.0040277-Kerkhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. When bound to arachidonic acid, S100A8/S100A9 changed tertiary structure conformation. Arachidonic acid is an anionic amphiphile which elicits oxidase activation in a cell-free system and which was reported to be a physiological activator of the NADPH oxidase in stimulated neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0040277-Vignais1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A siRNA strategy supported the hypothesis that inducible phospholipase A2 controlled S100A8/S100A9 translocation and Nox2 activity, suggesting a close association between S100 proteins and the oxidase complex <xref rid="pone.0040277-Schenten1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore<bold>,</bold> the plasma membrane concentration of arachidonic acid was locally enhanced upon assembly of NADPH oxidase complex. Thus, the long hydrophobic chain of arachidonic acid may facilitate the access of S100A8/S100A9 to cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> and favors activation of NADPH oxidase <xref rid="pone.0040277-Doussiere2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Foubert1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>S100A8/S100A9 complex potentiates activation of the phagocyte oxidase. It enhances the affinity of p67<sup>phox</sup> to cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> in the presence of arachidonic acid and the change of cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> conformation, as highlighted by Atomic Force Microscopy, suggesting a specific molecular interface with the hemoprotein <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Paclet1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The S100A8/S100A9 complex and p67<sup>phox</sup> play a similar role in the oxidase activation process as being the signal that initiates, upon assembly of the oxidase complex, the change of both cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> conformation and electron transfer. We observed that co-localisation of S100 proteins and cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> differs at resting versus PMA stimulation and confirmed that assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex may proceed in microdomains as reported <xref rid="pone.0040277-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In fact, Jesaitis and coworkers reported that the change of cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> conformation may result from a 10Ã movement of p22<sup>phox</sup> away from the hemoprotein center. We have shown that the S100A8/S100A9 complex or the rS100A9-A8 chimera protein promotes activation of inducible (with arachidonic acid) or of constitutive (without arachidonic acid) NADPH oxidase. The data specifically highlight that S100A8 is directly involved in the activation process and that arachidonic acid is not enough to act by itself.</p>
      <p>Finally, despite specificity of S100A8/cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>, interface, this interaction could be transitory with a rapid protein/protein dissociation process from an already active NADPH oxidase. Our cross-linking and co-localisation results suggest a molecular interaction between S100A8 protein and cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>. Four amino acid residues of the C-terminal sequence of S100A8, <sup>87</sup>HEES<sup>90</sup> are required and directly involved in this interface and are critical for oxidase activation. This portion has been shown to be involved in the dimerisation process that allows a correct conformation to the heterodimer S100A9/S100A8 <xref rid="pone.0040277-Korndorfer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Therefore, in its absence, the conformation of S100 protein could be disrupted and may explain the inefficiency of the truncated chimera rS100A9-A8Î86 to stimulate NADPH oxidase activity.</p>
      <p>These findings have implications for the mechanisms of NADPH oxidase activation. Arachidonic acid was proposed to mediate a transition between different coordinated forms of heme b that may induce the electron transfer to oxygen <xref rid="pone.0040277-Doussiere1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040277-Doussiere2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. A structural rearrangement of p22<sup>phox</sup> mediated by anionic lipids was also suggested to increase the NADPH oxidase activity <xref rid="pone.0040277-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Kerkhoffâs group proposed a model in which S100A8/S100A9 was involved in the enhanced phagocyte NADPH oxidase activation by transferring the arachidonic acid to gp91<sup>phox</sup> via an interaction with p67<sup>phox</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0040277-Kerkhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We hypothesize that, additionally to the arachidonic acid effect on cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>, it is most likely that the S100A9-A8 chimera reported here or otherwise functional S100 oligomers interact specifically with the hemoprotein. The change of cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> conformation, mediated by this interaction, could expedite the electron transfer and enhance the affinity of p67<sup>phox</sup> to cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>. Our data suggest further that the C-terminal sequence <sup>87</sup>HEES<sup>90</sup> of S100A8 plays an essential role in the interface, serving as a specific binding domain with a corresponding consensus site on cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>, the nature of which remains to be determined. However, the possibility that this sequence may be necessary for the formation of a correct and functional refolding of S100A8 itself, required to activate cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>, cannot be excluded.</p>

Briefly, 10 pmol of purified and relipidated cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> were incubated with 1.5 nmol of S100 proteins: the four rS100A9-A8 chimeras, or a 1/1 mixture of rS100A8 and rS100A9. rS100 proteins were preincubated in a 500 nM CaCl<sub>2</sub> medium for 20 min before adding: first 10 pmol of cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic>, then 10 ÂµM FAD, 40 ÂµM GTPÎ³S, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and finally 1 mM arachidonic acid. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, 2 mM of Disuccinimidyl Suberate (DSS) was added (or not). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the cross linking was stopped by adding 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 for 10 min. Protein samples were incubated in a denaturating sample buffer <xref rid="pone.0040277-Laemmli1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> containing 2% SDS and 2.5% Î²-mercapto-ethanol. Fractionation of complexed proteins was performed by SDS-PAGE (7%), followed by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminal peptide of gp91<sup>phox</sup>

        <p>Mice immunization, monoclonal antibody production, and isotype identification were performed by Hybrisere (Grenoble, France). Briefly 4 mice were immunized by 4 peritoneal injections of S100 proteins (10 Âµg) purified from neutrophils cytosol <xref rid="pone.0040277-Berthier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and pre-incubated with 500 nM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The mice sera were tested by ELISA. Hybridization was performed after a supplementary injection. Monoclonal antibodies from hybridoma were evaluated by ELISA and produced in ascetic fluid. Two clones were selected: 5A10 (IgG1) and 2H9 (IgG2a).</p>
        <p>IgGs were produced from ascetic fluid. After centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min, at 4Â°C, IgGs were precipitated from supernatant by 50% (w/v) saturation ammonium sulfate for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 mM borate buffer pH 8.9 containing 3 M NaCl for IgG1, or in 50 mM borate buffer, pH 8.9, 3 M NaCl for IgG2a and dialyzed overnight. IgG2a was purified on Protein G Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer, and after an extensive washing of the matrix, it was eluted with 0.1 M Glycine pH 3; then the pH was readjusted with 1 M Tris to pH 8.5. IgG1 bound to Protein G Sepharose in 100 mM borate, 3 M NaCl pH8.9, and was washed first with 50 mM borate buffer, 3 M NaCl pH 8.9 and second with 10 mM borate buffer, 3 M NaCl pH 8.9 before the elution in 0.1 M Glycin pH 3. The pH was then equilibrated to pH 8.5 with 1 M Tris. The presence of IgG in the fractions was measured at 280 nm and purity was controlled by 11% SDS PAGE.</p>
