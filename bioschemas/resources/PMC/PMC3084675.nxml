      <abstract>
        <p>Tumor cell migration is supported in part by the cyclic formation and disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs); however, the mechanisms that regulate this process are not fully defined. The large guanosine 5â²-triphosphatase dynamin (Dyn) plays an important role in FA dynamics and is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Using a novel antibody specific to phospho-dynamin (pDynâTyr-231), we found that Dyn2 is phosphorylated at FAs by Src kinase and is recruited to FAs by a direct interaction with the 4.1/ezrin/radizin/moesin domain of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which functions as an adaptor between Src and Dyn2 to facilitate Dyn2 phosphorylation. This SrcâFAKâDyn2 trimeric complex is essential for FA turnover, as mutants disrupting the formation of this complex inhibit FA disassembly. Importantly, phosphoactivated Dyn2 promotes FA turnover by mediating the endocytosis of integrins in a clathrin-dependent manner. This study defines a novel mechanism of how Dyn2 functions as a downstream effector of FAKâSrc signaling in turning over FAs.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Focal adhesions (FAs) are complex structures situated at the cell base that mediate adhesion and motility by connecting the extracellular matrix (ECM) with the actin cytoskeleton (Webb <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2002</xref>; Wehrle-Haller and Imhof, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2002</xref>; Mitra <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2005</xref>). During migration, FAs form at the leading edge of the cell to anchor cytoplasmic stress fibers and contribute to the generation of a contractile force (Geiger and Bershadsky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2001</xref>; Wehrle-Haller and Imhof, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2002</xref>). Concomitant with this localized assembly, FAs at the trailing edge of translocating cells are disassembled to facilitate ECM detachment (Webb <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2002</xref>). Cells that do not exhibit appropriate FA disassembly are known to leave long cytoplasmic tails that impede migration (Palecek <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1998</xref>; Ezratty <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>). While the regulated assembly of FAs is generally well understood (Sastry and Burridge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2000</xref>; Webb <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2002</xref>), the mechanisms that support the regulated turnover of these important structures are less defined.</p><p>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src are both nonreceptor tyrosine kinases viewed as central regulators of FA turnover (Frame <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2002</xref>; McLean <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2005</xref>; Mitra <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2005</xref>; Shattil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2005</xref>). In addition to tyrosine kinase activity, FAK is also known to act as a FA scaffold, where it binds a variety of cytoskeletal and adaptor proteins as well as kinases such as Src (Mitra <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2005</xref>). A specific tyrosine residue in the SH2 domain of FAK (pTyr-397) is known to both bind and activate Src by disrupting its autoinhibitory conformation (Yeatman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2004</xref>). Subsequently, Src phosphorylates FAK on multiple tyrosine residues, resulting in the recruitment of additional FA proteins (Mitra <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2005</xref>). In addition to providing a regulated scaffold for FA assembly, both Src and FAK have been implicated in FA turnover, as Src<sup>â/â</sup> and FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells exhibit more stable FAs (Ilic <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">1995</xref>; Yeo <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2006</xref>). Interestingly, while the phosphorylation of the associated proteins p130Cas and paxillin by a SrcâFAK complex is known to promote FA disassembly, FAK kinase activity appears to be dispensable, suggesting that FAK instead functions as a structural scaffold (Ruest <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2001</xref>). Moreover, the SrcâFAK complex is known to promote the expression and activation of matrix metalloproteinases and the calcium-dependent calpain proteases (Palecek <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1998</xref>; Bhatt <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2002</xref>) that contribute to FA turnover. While many other FA proteins are substrates for the SrcâFAK complex, the effects on FA dynamics are less clear.</p><p>The large guanosine 5â²-triphosphatase (GTPase) dynamin (Dyn) is well established to participate in a variety of endocytic and membrane trafficking processes (Urrutia <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1997</xref>; McNiven, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1998</xref>; Hinshaw, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2000</xref>). The enzymatic activity, polymerization rate, and cellular functions of dynamins have been shown to be modulated by phosphorylation at two specific tyrosine residues, Tyr-231 and Tyr-597, by Src (Ahn <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1999</xref>; Ahn <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2002</xref>; Cao <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>; Weller <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2010</xref>). Recently, Dyn2 has been observed to localize to FAs, where it mediates the clathrin-based internalization of integrins (Chao and Kunz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>; Ezratty <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>). Importantly, FAK has been shown by several groups to associate with Dyn2 at FAs (Kharbanda <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1995</xref>; Ezratty <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2005</xref>), although it is unclear how this association is regulated and whether it is direct or supported by adaptor proteins such as Grb2 (Kharbanda <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1995</xref>). In this study we provide new insights into how SrcâFAK signaling functions together with Dyn2 to regulate disassembly of FAs. We find that FAK binds to Dyn2 directly through its 4.1/ezrin/radizin/moesin (FERM) domain and recruits Dyn2 into a SrcâFAKâDyn2 trimeric complex that further facilitates Dyn2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. We also demonstrate that phospho-Dyn2 (pDyn2) is essential for regulated endocytic internalization of integrins and subsequent FA disassembly. These data define a novel pathway describing how SrcâFAK signaling can alter cell adhesion and cell migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>A population of phosphorylated Dyn2 resides at FAs</title><p>Src-based tyrosine phosphorylation of both Dyn1 and Dyn2 has been shown to enhance receptor-mediated endocytosis (Ahn <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1999</xref>; Cao <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>) and vesicle trafficking from the Golgi apparatus (Weller <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2010</xref>). To better define the distribution and function of pDyn in these processes, we generated two polyclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine residues, Tyr-231 and Tyr-597, conserved in all conventional dynamins (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). While the Dyn pTyr-597 antibody failed to recognize Dyn by Western blot or immunofluorescence (IF) staining, the Dyn pTyr-231 antibody appeared to be very sensitive to phosphorylated Dyn in a variety of cultured cells. IF staining of human pancreatic tumor cells (PANC-1) under resting status showed modest, punctate FA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, A and Aâ²</xref>); however, there was a marked increase in FA staining either when stimulated with 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 20 min or with expression of active SrcY530F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, BâCâ²</xref>, arrows). To confirm that active Src is required for the phosphorylation of Dyn2 at FAs, a triple-knockout SYF cell line (fibroblasts from Src, Yes, and Fyn knockout mice) was transfected with active Src (Y530F) before staining with the pDyn antibody. The SYF cells showed no FA staining for either Src or pDyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, D and Dâ²</xref>), while the adjacent cells expressing SrcY530F displayed substantial pDyn staining at FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, D and Dâ²</xref>, asterisk). Taken together these observations suggest that either physiological stimulation of cells with EGF to activate Src kinase or exogenous expression of active Src is responsible for Dyn phosphorylation at FAs. It should be noted that while the pDyn antibody we made and utilized for this study recognizes all three Dyn forms, epithelial cells express Dyn2 as the most prominent form by far, so we have referred to pDyn as pDyn2.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Src mediates the phosphorylation of Dyn2 at FAs. (AâCâ²) IF images of PANC-1 cells that were either untreated (A, Aâ²), stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for 20 min (B, Bâ²), or transfected with SrcY530F (C, Câ²) and then fixed and costained with pDyn and vinculin antibodies. While resting cells show modest pDyn staining of FAs, this is markedly increased (arrows) by activation of Src. (D, Dâ²) Fibroblasts from Src, Yes, and Fyn knockout mice (SYF cells) were stained with the pDyn antibody and show virtually no staining of FAs.

WT Dyn2 exhibits a significantly higher affinity for FAK than the Dyn2 YF mutant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1529fig1"/></fig><p>To ensure that the pDyn antibody used in these experiments is specific for pDyn, a variety of control experiments were performed. As shown in Supplemental Figure S1A, Western blot analysis of cells expressing the exogenous wild-type (WT) or phosphomutant forms of Dyn2 indicates that the pDyn antibody recognizes both Dyn2 WT and Dyn2 Y597F, but not Y231F. Thus a specific alteration of the phosphoepitope prevents binding of the pDyn antibody. Moreover, expression of a constitutively active Src (SrcY530F) in cells resulted in the marked enhancement in the detection of endogenous Dyn2 by the pDyn antibody (Supplemental Figure S1A). Further, the pDyn2 band was significantly reduced in cells treated with Dyn2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) to reduce the endogenous level of this protein (Supplemental Figure S1C). To test the specificity of this reagent using morphological methods, rat fibroblast (RF) cells were transfected to express Dyn2 WTâgreen fluorescent protein (GFP) or Dyn2Y231F-GFP and then fixed and stained with the pDyn antibody. Notably, cells expressing Dyn2 WT (*) were brightly stained in comparison to the adjacent nontransfected cells (Supplemental Figure S1, D and Dâ²), while cells expressing the phosphomutant Dyn2Y231F (*) showed no increased staining (Supplemental Figure S1, E and Eâ²). As a final test, Dyn conditional knockout cells (generously provided by Shawn Ferguson and Pietro De Camilli, Yale University, New Haven, CT) were stained with the pDyn antibody and a pan-Dyn antibody (Hudy1). Both antibodies show compromised staining in Dyn-depleted cells (Supplemental Figure S1, F and Fâ²). Taken together, we conclude that the pDynY231 antibody is specific for pDyn. In addition, with this newly characterized antibody we determined that Src is required for Dyn2 phosphorylation at FAs.</p></sec><sec><title>FAK recruits Dyn2 to FAs via the FERM domain</title><p>FAK is an important kinase and scaffold at FAs and has been implicated to interact with and recruit Dyn2 to FAs (Ezratty <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2005</xref>). Consistent with this report, we compared the IF staining of pDyn2 in normal and FAK<sup>â/â</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and observed a substantial reduction of FA staining in FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, AâBâ²</xref>), indicating an essential role for FAK in recruiting Dyn2 to FAs. On the basis of our observation that pDyn2 localizes to FAs, we reasoned that FAK-associated Dyn2 is tyrosine phosphorylated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, pDyn2 was coimmunoprecipitated (coIP) with FAK. More interestingly, we found that FAK preferentially binds to pDyn2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, WT Dyn2 or a double phosphomutant Dyn2Y231, 597F (Dyn2 YF) were cotransfected with SFB-FAK (S protein, Flag, and streptavidin binding peptide triple tagged). FAK was immunoprecipitated with S-Sepharose beads and coprecipitated significantly more WT Dyn2 than Dyn2 YF (3.2 Â± 0.6-fold). These data provide biochemical evidence supporting the premise that pDyn2 localizes at FAs.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Recruitment of Dyn2 to FAs by the FERM domain of FAK.

Purified GST, GST-FERM, and GST-FRNK were resolved by SDSâPAGE, overlaid with purified His-Dyn2, and then blotted with Dyn2 antibody.

The expression of WT FAK, but not ÎFERM or FRNK, rescued FA staining by the pDyn antibody.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1529fig2"/></fig><p>To define the mechanism behind the FAK-Dyn2 association, a series of FAK truncation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) were generated and coexpressed along with SFB-Dyn2 in 293T cells. Subsequently, Dyn2 was immunoprecipitated with S beads and blotted with antibodies against GFP (FAK) and Flag (Dyn2). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, removal of the N-terminal FERM domain of FAK abolished the association with Dyn2, while truncation of the C-terminal region (ÎFRNK) did not, suggesting that FAK binds to Dyn2 through the FERM domain. To test whether this binding is direct, purified glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST), GST-FERM, and GST-FRNK were expressed, and Far Western blot analysis was performed by probing these protein fragments with purified His-Dyn2. Consistent with the coIP data described above, His-Dyn2 bound directly to GST-FERM, but not GST or GST-FRNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that the FERM domain of FAK is both necessary and sufficient for Dyn2 binding. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref> indicates that FAK binds more strongly to pDyn2 in cells, we next tested whether it is true in vitro. To this end we purified WT or YF His-Dyn2 from TKB1 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which contains a tyrosine kinase capable of generating phosphoproteins (Gomez <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2006</xref>). We confirmed that His-Dyn2 WT but not YF was phosphorylated with both 4G10 and pDyn2 antibodies (Supplemental Figure S2). By incubating GST-FERM with these Dyn2 proteins, we observed a threefold increase in the level of association between FAK and pDyn2 compared with Dyn2 YF (Supplemental Figure S2). These data suggest that FAK has an increased affinity to pDyn2 through the FERM domain.</p><p>On the basis of the role of FAK in recruiting Dyn2 to FAs, we predicted that reexpression of WT FAK in FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells, but not Dyn2 binding mutants, should rescue pDynâs FA staining. This was indeed the case as only modest pDyn2 staining was observed at FAs in FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, B and Bâ²</xref>) while the staining was robust in cells rescued with GFP-FAK WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, F and Fâ²</xref>) but not GFP-FAKÎFERM or GFP-FRNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, GâHâ²</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, WT MEF cells possessed significantly more pDyn2 compared with FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells, suggesting that FAK does play an important role in Dyn2 phosphorylation. To extend these findings we next tested whether reexpression of WT or mutant FAK in these null cells would rescue pDyn2 level. Interestingly, expression of WT FAK increased Dyn2 phosphorylation levels at least twofold higher than expression of either the vector control or the mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, D and E</xref>). Importantly, among the FAK mutants, the ÎFERM protein activated Src at a level equivalent to WT FAK, as this truncation retains the pTyr-397 region that binds to and activates Src. However, expression of the ÎFERM protein failed to rescue pDyn2 levels, suggesting that the FAK-based activation of Src alone, without forming the SrcâFAKâDyn2 complex, is not sufficient for Dyn2 phosphorylation. Last, we tested whether a FAKâSrc complex phosphorylates Dyn2 in vivo. Because FAKâSrc signaling is activated when integrins bind ECM, pDyn2 levels were compared by Western blot in WT and FAK<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells either in suspension or plated on 50 Î¼g/ml fibronectin-coated dishes for 1 h.

For this assay cells were treated with 10 Î¼M nocodazole for 3.5 h to completely disrupt microtubules (MTs) and then rinsed with serum-free medium to allow the rapid reassembly of tubulin dimers into MTs. On regrowth it is known that the tips of extending MTs reach FAs and subsequently promote FA turnover. In MEF cells, the majority of FAs disassemble within 1 h after nocodazole washout; however, as previously reported, FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells are defective in this process (Ezratty <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2005</xref>). To test whether an intact SrcâFAKâDyn2 complex is essential for FA turnover, we transfected FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells with either FAK WT or FAK mutants including FRNK (cannot bind either Dyn2 or Src), Y397F (Src binding defective), and ÎFERM (Dyn2 binding defective).

We reasoned that Dyn2 WT would be more efficacious in turning over FAs upon MT regrowth than the phosphomutant. For these studies RFs were treated with Dyn2 siRNA for 48 h to deplete endogenous Dyn2, followed by reexpression of siRNA-resistant Dyn2 WT or the Dyn2 YF mutant for 24 h. In control siRNAâtreated cells, more than 80% disassembled FAs within 1 h after nocodazole washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, D and Dâ²</xref>); in contrast, only 35% of Dyn2 siRNAâtreated cells exhibited FA loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, E and F</xref>, unlabeled cells).

Taken together, the experimentation using both the ts-v-Src MDCK model and FA disassembly assay suggests that Dyn2 phosphorylation promotes FA disassembly.</p><p>Because the internalization of integrins is known to induce FA turnover (Chao and Kunz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>; Ezratty <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>), we speculated that Dyn2 may mediate the endocytosis of integrins to promote FA disassembly. To test this hypothesis, we combined the MT-based FA disassembly assay with a cell surface biotinylation approach to monitor the change in Î²1-integrin surface expression before and after FA disassembly. RF cells were subjected to the FA disassembly assay; then total surface proteins were labeled with biotin at 4Â°C before cell lysis and pull-down of biotin-labeled proteins with streptavidin beads. The pellet was analyzed by SDSâPAGE and blotted for Î²1-integrin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, a significant amount of Î²1-integrin resided on the surface in resting cells and was not affected by nocodazole treatment alone. However, 1 h after nocodazole washout and subsequent FA disassembly, the surface Î²1-integrin level dropped by 90% while the total Î²1-integrin remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), reflecting an internalization concomitant with FA turnover. This experiment was then performed in the context of altering Dyn2 level and function. RF cells were transfected with control or Dyn2 siRNA for 72 h and then subjected to the FA disassembly and biotinylation assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, there was about a threefold increase of surface Î²1-integrin levels in the Dyn2 knockdown cells. Importantly, reexpression of WT Dyn2 in the siRNA-treated cells resulted in a near complete restoration of Î²1-integrin clearance from the cell surface compared with control cells, while expression of the Dyn2 YF mutant failed to rescue integrin clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). All of these observations are consistent with the premise that integrin internalization is dependent upon a tyrosine-based phosphoregulation of Dyn2 at FAs.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6:</label><caption><p>pDyn2 promotes clathrin-based integrin endocytosis.

First, we found that Src, FAK, and Dyn2 exist as a complex at FAs, in which FAK functions as an adaptor to recruit both Src and Dyn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). Second, the formation of a SrcâFAKâDyn2 complex facilitates Dyn2âs tyrosine phosphorylation and, as a result, enhances Dyn2âs GTPase activity and promotes the endocytic turnover of FAs. This study establishes Dyn2 as a novel effector downstream of the well-established SrcâFAK signaling pathway in mediating FA disassembly.</p><p>An essential component of this study was a pDyn antibody made to a conserved phosphotyrosine residue (Tyr-231) present in all three of the conventional dynamin forms. Past studies by others (Ahn <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2002</xref>) have convincingly shown that phosphorylation of Tyr-231/597 of Dyn1 by Src kinase markedly enhances the polymerization, GTPase activity, and endocytic potential of this protein. Subsequently we demonstrated that both of these tyrosines are phosphorylated on the more ubiquitously expressed Dyn2 and act to regulate transferrin endocytosis in epithelial cells (Cao <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>). Interestingly, with this pDyn antibody, we observed a basal level of FA staining in a variety of epithelial cells and fibroblasts. This observation confirmed the previous studyâs finding that Dyn is localized at FAs, and, importantly, it showed that Dyn is phosphorylated at this spot. The phosphorylation is apparently mediated by Src because expression of constitutively active Src kinase or EGF stimulation that is known to activate Src increases the pDynâs FA staining; reversely, Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 abolishes the staining. This observation suggests that phosphorylation of this mechanoenzyme may play an important role in regulating FA dynamics and cell migration. To ensure that this localization represented active pDyn2, we conducted a series of biochemical and morphological control experiments (Supplemental Figure S1). All observations were consistent with the premise that the pDyn antibody used here is specific. It is important to note that the peptide used as an antigen for this antibody represents a sequence found in all three conventional forms of dynamin (Dyn1, 2, and 3). As the predominant form of dynamin in most epithelial cells and fibroblasts is Dyn2, we have assumed that this form predominates at FAs and have referred to pDyn as pDyn2 throughout this study.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that FAK binds to and recruits Dyn2 to FAs (Ezratty <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2005</xref>). However, the specific domains involved in this process had not been defined, and it was not clear whether the binding is direct. The most appealing model has been that Grb2 functions as an adaptor between FAK and Dyn2 because Grb2 is known to bind both proteins. However, we have not observed any requirement for Grb2 in mediating the Dyn2-FAK association (unpublished data). Instead, we found that Dyn2 directly binds to the FERM domain of FAK, and IF data confirmed the importance of the FERM domain in recruiting Dyn2 to FAs. The FERM domain has been reported to associate with a wide range of proteins, including EGF receptors, Arp2/3 complex, p53, and MDM2 (Lim <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2008</xref>), and no conserved FERM-interacting motif has been characterized. While the FERM binding region of Dyn2 is still under investigation, we found that the association between the Dyn2 phosphomutant (Y231F, Y597F) and FAK is reduced compared with WT Dyn2, as assessed by both coIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>) and GST pull-down (Supplemental Figure S2), suggesting that phosphorylation of Dyn2 may enhance its binding to FAK, probably due to a conformational change of Dyn2. This may in part explain why SrcY530F expression or EGF stimulation enhances pDyn2âs FA staining.</p><p>Further study has revealed that FAK-Dyn2 is actually part of a SrcâFAKâDyn2 trimeric complex, in which FAK functions as a scaffold between Src and Dyn2. This premise is supported by the fact that FAK and Src are brought down in a Dyn2 IP from MEF cells, and a similar IP from FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells showed substantially less prevalent Src-Dyn2 association, which could be restored upon FAK reexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that Src, FAK, and Dyn2 exist as a complex at FAs. This result is further confirmed by âcontinuous IP,â using exogenously expressed SFB-FAK, Src, and Dyn2-GFP (unpublished data). It is well documented that SrcâFAK form a complex with paxillin and p130Cas and phosphorylate these proteins, so we hypothesize that the formation of this trimeric complex also facilitates Dyn2 phosphorylation. Consistent with this hypothesis is the fact that Dyn2 phosphorylation was â¼twofold higher in MEF cells than in the FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells, in which the complex formation is compromised. Our caution toward this result stems from the fact that overall Src activity is reduced in the absence of FAK. However, the reduced pDyn level is not simply due to compromised Src activity because FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells reexpressing WT FAK or the Dyn2 binding mutant (ÎFERM) showed no difference in active Src levels, while there was a significant decrease of pDyn2 levels in mutant-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, D and E</xref>), suggesting that FAK plays an essential scaffolding function at the FA to bring both Src and Dyn2 in close proximity to mediate Dyn2 activation.</p><p>It is well established that FAKâSrc signaling promotes FA turnover by phosphorylating downstream effectors. Dyn2 appears to be such an effector, as others have demonstrated that Dyn2 is involved in FA disassembly, and phosphorylation of dynamin at Tyr-231/597 leads to an amplification in its GTPase activity. By plating WT or FAK<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells on fibronectin, a process that activates the integrin-based FAKâSrc signaling, we demonstrate that Dyn2 is indeed downstream of this signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). To disrupt the SrcâFAKâDyn2 signaling cascade, we utilized a variety of FAK mutants that disrupt the complex formation or Dyn2 tyrosine to phenylÂ­alanine mutations on Tyr-231/597 that cannot be phosphorylated by SrcâFAK. Both approaches show significant inhibition of FA turnover during the nocodazole-induced FA disassembly assay. Our data strongly suggest the SrcâFAKâDyn cascade as a novel mechanism in regulating FA turnover, which appears to be FA specific as turnover of other receptorâligand complexes including transferrin and EGF are not affected in FAK<sup>â/â</sup> cells compared with WT MEF cells (unpublished data).</p><p>Finally, we addressed how the phosphorylation of Dyn2 regulates FA disassembly. It is well established that pDyn2 regulates the internalization of the TfR1 and some receptor tyrosine kinases, so we hypothesize that it also regulates integrin endocytosis. Indeed, Dyn2 YFâexpressing cells showed a significant block of Î²1-integrin internalization compared with WT Dyn2âexpressing cells during FA disassembly. Endocytic uptake of integrins has been shown to be mediated by either clathrin- or caveolin-based mechanisms (del Pozo <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2005</xref>; Ezratty <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>). Our findings here using a pancreatic cancer cell model support clathrin-based integrin internalization as the major pathway. A better structural and temporal understanding of how the Dyn2 polymer assembles in conjunction with FAK and the clathrinâadaptor complex in response to receptor activation will prove enlightening.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>In the generation of pDyn antibody, peptides against the deduced amino acid sequence of rat Dyn2 were synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by the Mayo Protein Core Facility at the Mayo Clinic, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and Freundâs adjuvant, and injected into New Zealand white rabbits, and the antisera were collected after subsequent boost injections.

The FAK Y397F mutant was generated by the PCR-based mutagenesis method. Constructs were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturerâs instructions. siRNAs targeting Dyn2 (GACATGATCCTGCAGTTTA), Cav1 (AACCAGAAGGGACACACAGUUUU), and CHC (GCAAUGAGCUGUUUGAAGAUU) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) following the standard protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>IP, Far Western blotting, and Western blotting</title><p>Cells were lysed with NETN buffer (0.5% NP40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, and 1 mM EDTA) at 4Â°C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with 5 Î¼g of the appropriate antibody and protein A beads at 4Â°C for 4 h. For the S protein IP, cell lysate was incubated with S protein agarose (Novagen, Madison, WI) at 4Â°C for 2 h. The pellet was washed with NETN buffer three times, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot with appropriate antibodies. Far Western blotting was performed as described previously (Horgan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2010</xref>). GST alone, GST-FRNK, GST-FERM, or His-Dyn2 proteins were purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21. GST-tagged proteins were analyzed by SDSâPAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was blocked by basic buffer (BB: 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Igepal CA-630) plus 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4Â°C. The membrane was incubated in interaction buffer (immunoblot: BB plus 1% nonfat milk) containing 30 Î¼g His-Dyn2 for 2.5 h at 4Â°C, washed with TBST (Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween-20) three times, and subjected to Western blotting with Dyn2 antibody. pDyn2 protein was purified from TKB1 <italic>E. coli</italic> (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as previously described (Gomez <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2006</xref>).

Briefly, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimideâbiotin in cold PBS for 30 min on ice. Unbound biotin was removed by rinsing with 50 Î¼M NH<sub>4</sub>CL in cold PBS three times.
