        <p id="P1">A predisposition for thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections can be inherited in families in an autosomal dominant manner. Genome-wide linkage analysis of two large unrelated families with thoracic aortic disease, followed by whole exome sequencing of affected relatives, identified causative mutations in <italic>TGFB2</italic>. These mutations, a frameshift mutation in exon 6 and a nonsense mutation in exon 4, segregated with disease with a combined LOD score of 7.7. Sanger sequencing of 276 probands from families with inherited thoracic aortic disease identified two additional <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutations. <italic>TGFB2</italic> encodes the transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF-Î²2) and the mutations are predicted to cause haploinsufficiency for <italic>TGFB2</italic>, but aortic tissue from cases paradoxically shows increased TGF-Î²2 expression and immunostaining. Thus, haploinsufficiency of <italic>TGFB2</italic> predisposes to thoracic aortic disease, suggesting the initial pathway driving disease is decreased cellular TGF-Î²2 levels leading to a secondary increase in TGF-Î²2 production in the diseased aorta.</p>

    <p id="P2">Thoracic aortic aneurysms can lead to acute aortic dissections or ruptures, and death due to these complications is common<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. A number of genetic syndromes predispose to thoracic aortic disease, including Marfan syndrome (MFS, MIM 154700), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS, MIM 609192, 608967, 610168, 610380) and Aneurysms-Osteoarthritis Syndrome (AOS, MIM 613795)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Systemic complications are shared among these syndromes, including skeletal, craniofacial and skin manifestations. LDS is caused by mutations in the genes encoding the TGF-Î² receptors type I and II (<italic>TGFBR1</italic> and <italic>TGFBR2</italic>, respectively), which bind TGF-Î² and initiate cellular signaling. AOS results from mutations in <italic>SMAD3</italic> (SMAD family members 3), which encodes a protein critical for cellular signaling downstream of the TGF-Î² receptors after ligand binding. Despite the fact that the majority of mutations in these genes are predicted to disrupt proper function of these signaling proteins, diseased aortic tissue from these patients show increased nuclear phosphorylated SMAD2 (pSMAD2) in aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs), suggesting increased TGF-Î² cellular signaling<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Although MFS is caused by mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic>, encoding an extracellular matrix protein called fibillin-1, excessive TGF-Î² signaling is also evident in aortic tissue from MFS patients and mouse models<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">We sought to identify the defective gene in two unrelated large American (TAA288) and French (MS239) families with autosomal dominant thoracic aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections with decreased penetrance, along with intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) and subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAHs), after sequencing of the known genes failed to identify causative mutations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Genome wide linkage analysis followed by exome sequencing was pursued to identify the defective gene in these families. In TAA288, linkage analysis using 50K GeneChips Hind array from Affymetrix was done using samples from 9 family members and multipoint log10 of odds (LOD) scores greater than 2.0 were obtained for a locus on chromosome 1 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Similar analysis of the MS239 family using 1056 microsatellites was done using samples from 18 family members and LOD scores greater than 1.4 were obtained on chromosomes 1, 4, 12, and 20 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). A locus at chromosome 1q41 was shared between the two families. Exome sequencing was pursued in both families using DNA from two distantly related affected individuals (1/16 coefficient of relatedness) from TAA288 and 3 affected and 1 unaffected family members from MS239 (circled individuals in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The sequencing results were filtered based on novel, heterozygous rare variants shared between affected relatives within a family that were non-synonymous, nonsense, and insertion/deletion variants. This filtering strategy identified 16 rare variants in TAA288 and 5 rare variants in MS239 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Rare variants in <italic>TGFB2</italic> were present in both families and <italic>TGFB2</italic> fell within the 1q41 locus identified for the causative gene in both families (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b and 1c</xref>). The <italic>TGFB2</italic> rare variant in TAA288 was a 5 base pair deletion (c.1021_1025delTACAA) in exon 6 of the gene, leading to a frameshift in the translation of the transcript and a premature stop codon (p.Tyr341Cysfs*25; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). This variant had a two point linkage LOD score of 3.3 (theta = 0.0) and was not present in 3795 control exomes based on bioinformatic analysis and visual inspection of the sequencing data. The <italic>TGFB2</italic> variant in MS239 was a nonsense variant in exon 4 (p.Cys229*). Complete segregation with thoracic aortic disease was found in the family with a LOD score of 4.4 (theta = 0.0). This nonsense rare variant was not present in over 10,000 chromosomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>). In fact, there are no <italic>TGFB2</italic> rare variants predicted to disrupt translation of the protein in the database (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Thus, these data provide strong evidence that the identified <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutations are responsible for the inherited vascular disease in both families.</p>
    <p id="P4">To determine the frequency and spectrum of <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutations in individuals with thoracic aortic disease, the 7 exons and flanking intronic regions were sequenced using DNA from French probands (62 familial cases and 74 sporadic cases from a Marfan referral clinic) and American probands (214 affected probands in families with two or more members with thoracic aortic disease, including 30 families who also had members with intracranial aneurysms, and 57 sporadic thoracic aortic disease cases)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>(<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Two further mutations were identified in the French familial cases: a nonsense p.Glu102* in MS1756 and frameshift duplication (c.873_888dup) leading to p.Asn297* in MS211; additional family members were not available for analysis (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutations were identified in 2 out of 276 probands with familial thoracic aortic disease. Genome SNP array data on 898 patients with thoracic aortic disease, including 88 patients with inherited thoracic aortic disease, were analyzed for genomic rearrangements using CNVPartition and PennCNV and the B allele frequencies and logR ratio files visually inspected. No deletions or duplications involving <italic>TGFB2</italic> were identified<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P5">The <italic>TGFB2</italic> nonsense mutations and the frameshift duplication in exon 5 are predicted to lead to degradation of the message and thus cause haploinsufficiency for <italic>TGFB2</italic>. The mutation identified in TAA288, p.Tyr341Cysfs*25, is a deletion of 5 base pairs in exon 6, causing a frameshift in protein translation and addition of 25 aberrant amino acids. Since the nonsense codon that terminates protein translation occurs in exon 7, it is not expected to cause nonsense mediated decay<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Analysis of the <italic>TGFB2</italic> transcript confirmed that similar levels of both mutant and wildtype transcript were present in RNA harvested from aortic tissue and fibroblasts from affected family members (III:11 and IV:1; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The TGF-Î² family members are synthesized as peptides that form disulfide cross-linked homodimers (proprotein), which are cleaved by furin immediately prior to secretion. <italic>TGFB2</italic> expression levels were similar in SMCs and dermal fibroblasts explanted from affected family members in TAA288 and control cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), but immunoblot analysis of the TGF-Î²2 proprotein in cellular lysates from these cells showed reduced TGF-Î²2 proprotein levels in the mutant cells compared with the wildtype cells and no evidence of the truncated protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). These data suggest that although the deleted transcript is expressed, the mutant protein is rapidly degraded by an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway, resulting in decreased cellular levels of wildtype TGF-Î²2.</p>
    <p id="P6">The aortic pathology associated with <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutations was assessed using aortic tissue from patients MS239 III:16 and MS1756 II:8. The aortic pathology typical for thoracic aortic disease was found, which is characterized by fragmentation and loss of elastin fibers and accumulation of proteoglycans in the tunica media (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Assessment of nuclear pSMAD2 in medial SMCs from the <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutant aortas showed increased staining when compared with control aortas (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). <italic>TGFB1, TGFB2</italic> and <italic>TGFB3</italic> expression levels were assessed by Q-PCR using aortic tissue RNA from III:11 in family TAA288 and two matched controls (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Surprisingly, only <italic>TGFB2</italic> expression was increased in the aortic tissue (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of protein lysates from these same aortas demonstrated a corresponding increase in TGF-Î²2 proprotein levels in the mutant aorta (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Immunostaining of TGF-Î²2 in aortic tissue from patients MS239 III:16 and MS1756 II:8 also showed increased intensity of the signal in patientsâ aortas compared with control aorta (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus, the aortas from patients with <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutations show enhanced TGF-Î² signaling associated with a paradoxical increase in <italic>TGFB2</italic> expression and TGF-Î²2 protein levels.</p>
    <p id="P7">The clinical features in <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutation carriers were assessed and found to be similar to other syndromes causing thoracic aortic disease. The median age at aortic disease presentation was 35 years, with the majority of affected family members presenting with aneurysms at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). A 60 year old male underwent surgical repair after his aneurysm enlarged from 47 to 50 mm over six years, and a 35 year old male underwent repair with an aortic root diameter of 54 mm. Aortic dissection was documented in an obligate mutation carrier in MS239 (III:12, female 56 years), and in the probands of MS1756 (II:8, male, 47 years) and MS211 (III:14, male, 31 years). Three women who were obligate carriers presented with cerebrovascular disease; TAA288-II:1 had a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm at age 54 years, and TAAII:3 and MS239-III:2 died of SAH presumably due to ruptured ICAs. Fusiform dilatation and tortuosity of cerebrovascular arteries were present in mutation carriers (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Additional cardiovascular features included interventricular septal defect present in an obligate carrier from MS239 (III:12), mitral regurgitation requiring surgical repair at the age of 43 years in IV:2 from MS239, and dilated cardiomyopathy prior to aortic root aneurysm formation in III:3 from TAA288. Inguinal hernias, typically bilateral and requiring surgical repair, were common in mutation carriers, including women. Skeletal features, joint laxity, and skin striae similar to those observed in MFS patients were found in some individuals with <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutations but were insufficient in any individual to meet the diagnostic criteria of MFS (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e,f</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Ectopia lentis was absent in these families. The affected family members examined by clinical geneticists (13 out of 19 mutation carriers) did not have a particular facial appearance or the craniofacial or skin findings observed in LDS patients. Prominent degenerative joint disease described in AOS patients was not present, although age- and trauma-related osteoarthritis was present.</p>
    <p id="P8">We report a new etiology for familial thoracic aortic disease due to loss of function mutations in the <italic>TGFB2</italic> gene. Aortic dilatation occurs at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva, similar to what is observed with mutations in <italic>FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2</italic>, and <italic>SMAD3</italic>. The occurrence of ICAs and SAHs in three obligate carriers is most likely a manifestation of the <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutation since similar cerebrovascular disease occurs in individuals with <italic>TGFBR1, TGFBR2</italic>, or <italic>SMAD3</italic> mutations. Lastly, some systemic features overlapping with Marfan syndrome are also observed, as is the case with other syndromic forms of thoracic aortic disease (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. It should be underscored that no aortic dissections occurred younger than 31 years of age or with minimal aortic enlargement.</p>
    <p id="P9">Mice with specific genetic disruption of each of the genes for the three isoforms of TGF-Î² (<italic>Tgfb1, Tgfb2</italic> and <italic>Tgfb3</italic>) have discrete phenotypes, indicating a distinct role for each of the TGF-Î² isoforms. <italic>Tgfb2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice die shortly after birth and have ascending aortas that are comparatively small and thin walled and other development defects involving the heart, lung, craniofacial, limb, spinal column, eye, inner ear, and urogenital systems<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The developmental processes disrupted by loss of TGF-Î²2 include epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and differentiation of neural crest-derived components. These mice also show dysmorphic calvaria, extensive cleft palate, defective mandibles, and retrognathia; only retrognathia was observed in one <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutation carrier. Based on our findings, haploinsufficiency of TGF-Î²2 does not disrupt cardiovascular development, suggesting that reduction of TGF-Î²2 level does not disrupt proper migration or homing of cells during development. Rather, decreased levels of TGF-Î²2 predispose to adult-onset vascular diseases involving the sinuses of Valsalva and the cerebrovascular arteries. SMCs in these two vascular beds are derived from two different origins, the secondary heart field and neural crest cells, respectively<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Thus, the clinical features suggest that decreased TGF-Î²2 levels lead to a defect in differentiation, proliferation or viability of cells in these arteries. The differentiation of neural crest cells into vascular smooth muscle cells is dependent on TGF-Î² signaling and secondary heart field EMT is specifically TGF-Î²2 dependent<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and decreased levels of TGF-Î²2 may disrupt proper differentiation of SMCs in these arteries. Relevant to this speculation, it is notable that SMCs explanted from patients with <italic>TGFBR2</italic> mutations are relatively de-differentiated in culture when compared to control SMCs, and fail to differentiate to the same extent as control SMCs when exposed to TGF-Î²1<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P10">Our results provide evidence that haploinsufficiency of <italic>TGFB2</italic> is an initiating step in the pathogenic events leading to thoracic aortic disease. A subset of the <italic>SMAD3</italic> mutations are frameshift mutations that are predicted to cause <italic>SMAD3</italic> haploinsufficiency<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The missense mutations in <italic>TGFBR1</italic> and <italic>TGFBR2</italic> have either been shown or are predicted to disrupt kinase function, which is critical for propagating TGF-Î² signaling<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Despite the fact that these mutations are predicted to decrease TGF-Î² signaling, these defective genes trigger poorly understood signaling events that lead to increased nuclear pSMAD2 immunostaining in diseased tissue. Immunostaining for pSMAD2 is also increased in aortas of thoracic aortic disease patients without mutations in these genes<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. One event contributing to increased pSMAD2 staining may be epigenetic modifications of the promoter of <italic>SMAD2</italic>, resulting in constitutive activation of this signaling protein<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Another possible contributing event is that the relative resistance of the SMCs to TGF-Î² signaling due to the gene mutations may paradoxically increase signaling through other TGF-Î² signaling proteins. It is notable that deletion of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> in mouse cranial neural crest cells leads to elevated expression of TGF-Î²2 and TGF-Î² type III receptor and activation of SMAD-independent cellular pathways<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Our study identified a similar increase in TGF-Î²2 levels in the diseased tissue in response to <italic>TGFB2</italic> haploinsufficiency that is not present in explanted SMCs and fibroblasts. Although our data support the conclusion that the initiating event leading to vascular diseases due to mutations in <italic>TGFB2</italic> is decreased TGF-Î²2 levels, further work is warranted to unravel the pathways that are secondarily altered to cause a paradoxical increase in <italic>TGFB2</italic> expression and increased pSmad2 signaling in diseased aortic tissue.</p>

        <p>Identification of <italic>TGFB2</italic> as the causative gene responsible for thoracic aortic disease in families TAA288 and MS239. (<bold>a</bold>) Pedigrees of family TAA288 and MS239 with the legend indicating the disease and mutation status of the family members. The age at diagnosis of aortic root enlargement and/or dissection (âdxâ) is shown in years and âdâ indicates age at death. A single asterisk indicates individuals whose DNA was used in genome-wide mapping. DNA from the circled individuals was used for exome sequencing. (<bold>b</bold>) Parametric two-point and multi-point LOD score profile for thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD) across the human genome in family TAA288 based on the Affymetrix 50K GeneChips Hind array data. The parametric two-point (grey) and multi-point (red) LOD scores are on the y-axis and are correlated to physical location of human chromosome on the x-axis. (<bold>c</bold>) Parametric two-point LOD score profile for TAAD across the human genome in family MS239. (<bold>d</bold>) Schematic representation of the <italic>TGFB2</italic> gene and the protein domains and preproprotein proteolytic processing sites for mature TGF-Î²2. Boxes represent exons 1-7 with the untranslated regions (UTRs) and the open reading frame designated. The domains of the protein are designated using orange, blue and pink. The proteolytic sites of TGF-Î²2 preproprotein are marked with scissors symbol. Proteolytic cleavage sites remove the signal peptides from the amino-terminus and release the mature TGF-Î²2 from the latent associated peptide. The <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutations identified in this study are indicated in pink type. Below the gene diagram are the rare variants found in the NHLBI exome sequencing variant server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>); blue type designates variants predicted to be possibly or probably damaging by PolyPhen-2 analysis and black type designates variants predicted to be benign.</p>

(<bold>a</bold>) RT-PCR of RNA extracted from normal ascending aortic specimens (n=2) or fibroblast cell cultures (n=2) showed only one PCR product at 160 bp. RT-PCR of RNA extracted from ascending aortic specimen of a patient (III:11) or fibroblast cell culture (IV:1) from family TAA288 demonstrated that the transcript from both normal and 5 bp deleted allele were present. (<bold>b</bold>) Expression of <italic>TGFB2</italic> was quantified in aortic SMCs and dermal fibroblasts explanted from <italic>TGFB2</italic> mutation carriers and matched controls using quantitative-PCR. <italic>TGFB2</italic> expression levels between patients and controls were similar in both SMCs and fibroblasts. <italic>TGFB2</italic> levels are standardized to <italic>GAPDH</italic> messages. The relative expression values were determined via the ÎÎCt method, and assays were performed in triplicate. Data are expressed as mean Â± standard error of the mean for pooled experimental results. (<bold>c</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of TGF-Î²2 proprotein in cellular lysates of aortic SMCs and fibroblasts from patients (III:11 and IV:1, TAA288 family) and two normal controls. A protein band at 47kD, the molecular weight of the proprotein of TGF-Î²2, was identified with immunoblot analysis in both the patient and control lysates using a polyclonal antibody specific for TGF-Î²2. Decreased intensity of this band was found in patientsâ cells, both SMCs and fibroblasts, when compared with control cells.</p>

(<bold>b</bold>) Immunohistofluorescent staining for the same patients and control samples. Elastin fibers appear in green (autofluorescence), while nuclei are counterstained blue. Nuclear pSMAD2 staining (pink, upper panel) is present in the disease tissues and is absent in the control aorta. The lower panel shows the intense immunostaining for TGF-Î²2 using a polyclonal antibody specific for TGF-Î²2. Staining for pSMAD2 and TGF-Î²2 is located in the most disorganized areas of the aortic wall. The white scale bar in the upper left picture is 20Î¼m. (<bold>c</bold>) The expression of <italic>TGFB1, TGFB2</italic> and <italic>TGFB3</italic> was assayed by Q-PCR using RNA isolated from the aorta of III:11 from TAA288. The expression of <italic>TGFB2</italic> was increased over 10-fold when compared to aortic tissue isolated from controls aortas. Gene expression levels are standardized to <italic>GAPDH</italic>. The relative expression values were determined via the ÎÎCt method, and assays were performed in triplicate. Data are expressed as mean Â± standard error of the mean for pooled experimental results. (<bold>d</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of the mutant and control aortas showed increased levels of the 47 kD TGF-Î²2 protein band in the patientâs aorta compared with two control aortas using a TGF-Î²2 specific antibody. Data are expressed as mean Â± standard error of the mean for experimental results.</p>
