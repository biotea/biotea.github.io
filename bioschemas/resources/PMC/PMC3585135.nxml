      <abstract>
        <p>RSUME (<underline>R</underline>WD-containing <underline>SU</underline>MO <underline>E</underline>nhancer) is a small protein that increases SUMO conjugation to proteins. To date, four splice variants that codify three RSUME isoforms have been described, which differ in their C-terminal end. Comparing the structure of the RSUME isoforms we found that, in addition to the previously described RWD domain in the N-terminal, all these RSUME variants also contain an intermediate domain. Only the longest RSUME isoform presents a C-terminal domain that is absent in the others. Given these differences, we used the shortest and longest RSUME variants for comparative studies. We found that the C-terminal domain is dispensable for the SUMO-conjugation enhancer properties of RSUME. We also demonstrate that these two RSUME variants are equally induced by hypoxia. The NF-ÎºB signaling pathway is inhibited and the HIF-1 pathway is increased more efficiently by the longest RSUME, by means of a greater physical interaction of RSUME267 with the target proteins. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of these isoforms differ in human glioma samples; while the shortest RSUME isoform is expressed in all the tumors analyzed, the longest variant is expressed in most but not all of them. The results presented here show a degree of redundancy of the RSUME variants on the SUMO pathway. However, the increased inhibition conferred by RSUME267 over the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, the increased activation over the HIF-1 pathway and the different expression of the RSUME isoforms suggest specific roles for each RSUME isoform which may be relevant in certain types of brain tumors that express RSUME, like human pituitary adenomas and gliomas.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>RSUME is a small protein whose gene was isolated by differential expression screening using a tumor cell line with an increased tumorigenic and angiogenic potential <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Castro1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To date, four human RSUME mRNA splice variants have been described. Three of them mainly differ in their 3â² coding region and 3â² UTR, and codify for three different RSUME isoforms; while the shortest RSUME isoform is composed of 195 aminoacids, the longest RSUME variant has 267 residues, and the third isoform is 200 residues long. We termed this isoforms RSUME267, RSUME195 and RSUME200. The fourth splice variant is a non-coding RNA that suffers nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) <xref rid="pone.0057795-Frischmeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, a mechanism of degradation of mRNA with premature termination codons.</p>
      <p>We have previously shown that RSUME195 increases protein SUMOylation, a dynamic post-translational modification of proteins <xref rid="pone.0057795-Hay1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-GeissFriedlander1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, by interacting physically with the SUMO E2 conjugase Ubc9 <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Moreover, RSUME195 increases noncovalent binding of SUMO1 to Ubc9 and consequently enhances Ubc9-SUMO thioester formation <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Importantly, the SUMO enhancer properties of RSUME195 depend on the integrity of its RWD domain <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This domain was originally identified in three major RWD-containing proteins: RING finger-containing proteins, WD-repeat-containing proteins, and yeast DEAD (DEXD)-like helicases <xref rid="pone.0057795-Doerks1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Several RWD-domain containing proteins have been described to date, and the solution structure of most of them has been determined, suggesting it is a protein-protein interaction domain <xref rid="pone.0057795-Doerks1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Importantly, despite the apparent absence of sequence similarity, the RWD structure significantly resembles that of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) <xref rid="pone.0057795-Nameki1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the RWD domain is structurally homologous to the E2-SUMO conjugase Ubc9 <xref rid="pone.0057795-Nameki1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thereby, a structural homology between RSUME and Ubc9 has been proposed <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The RWD domain encompasses aminoacids 1 to 128 of RSUME, and considering that all RSUME variants share their first 176 residues, the RWD domain is contained in all of them.</p>
      <p>In previous works it has been shown that RSUME195 is induced by low oxygen levels via a mechanism involving Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Shan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, the main transcription factor of the adaptive response to hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0057795-Semenza1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-BrahimiHorn1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. HIF-1 induces RSUME195 via the functional HRE (Hypoxia Responsive Element) in the RSUME promoter <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, we showed that RSUME195 increases the protein levels of HIF-1alpha, the oxygen-regulated subunit of HIF-1 <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. By increasing HIF-1alpha protein levels, RSUME increases HIF-1 transcriptional activity and induces HIF-1 target genes, like VEGF <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Shan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Fowkes1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. RSUME also acts on the proinflamatory transcription factor NF-ÎºB. In contrast to its action on HIF-1, RSUME inhibits NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and consequently reduces the expression of its target genes, like interleukin-8 (IL-8) <xref rid="pone.0057795-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Improving our knowledge on the structure and molecular biology of RSUME isoforms may be relevant for the treatment of pathologies in which SUMO, HIF-1 and NF-ÎºB play essential roles, as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of certain kind of human brain tumors, in which RSUME is expressed, like pituitary adenomas and gliomas <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Shan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Fowkes1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>

        <title>The Human RSUME Splice Variants</title>
        <p>Four coding human RSUME mRNA transcripts have been described to date (based on RefSeq database), named RWDD3 (from RWD-domain containing 3) transcript variant 1, 2 and 3, and non-coding RNA. While the variant 1 (NM_015485) has 4 out of 5 exons and encodes the longest RSUME isoform, the transcript variant 2 (NM_001128142) has the longest exon 3, lacks exons 2 and 4, and encodes the shortest isoform. The variant 3 (NM_001199682) does not include exon 2 and has the shortest exon 3. The RSUME mRNA transcripts variants 1, 2 and 3 codify for RSUME isoforms of 267, 195 and 200 aminoacids, named RSUME267, RSUME195 and RSUME200, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

        <p>The best characterized domain of RSUME is the RWD domain, which is required for its SUMOylation enhancement activity, as previously demonstrated by a RSUME mutant carrying two RWD-disrupting point mutations in the RSUME195 RWD domain (Y61A/Y62A) <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This domain encompasses aminoacids 1 to 128 and its structure has been solved and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) by the structural genomics consortium (PDBid: 2EBK) <xref rid="pone.0057795-Berman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). As depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057795.s001">Figure S1</xref>, the RWD domain consists of three anti parallel beta-sheets and four alpha-helices, and according to the NMR results, the whole domain is flexible, the two central beta-sheets that include residues 39â48 and 56â64 are well defined, the regions spanning residues 31 to 35 and 64 to 83 have a characteristic beta-sheet conformation, and the last region of the domain is a long helix with a kink at residue 116 leading to the formation of two helices. The RWD domain is contained in the N-terminal end of all the RSUME variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>
        <p>The structure and function of the RSUME267 C-terminal half, which spans from residues 128 to 267, have not been characterized to date. In order to study the structural properties of the RSUME C-terminal, we performed secondary structure prediction with the PSIPRED server and disorder prediction with the DISPRO server <xref rid="pone.0057795-McGuffin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We found that there is one region with high probability of being unstructured or disordered, aminoacids 123 to 133. In agreement with this, the secondary structure prediction proposed a loop for this region, suggesting that this loop may be a linker between two domains. Importantly, we also found that the region spanning aminoacids 135 to 267 shows a good secondary structure prediction, suggesting the presence of at least another structural domain in this part of RSUME267 (intermediate domain and C-terminal domain). Taking this information into account we used the PHYRE server <xref rid="pone.0057795-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> for the prediction of the full length RSUME267 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The PHYRE server allows identifying remotely homologous structures when low sequence identity is found against known structures by using profiles generated by PSI-Blast for both the query sequence and the sequences of known structures. A good secondary structure prediction and a compact domain is predicted for residues 138 to 195, confirming the presence of a second domain in this part of RSUME267 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g003">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). This domain is completely included in the RSUME195 and 267 isoforms. Given that the last 24 aminoacids differ in the RSUME200 isoform, we used the same tools to predict its secondary structure. The intermediate domain in RSUME200 is 62 aminoacids long, spans from residues 138 to 200 (the first 38 aminoacids identical in the three isoforms and the last 24 different in the RSUME200 isoform), and has the same folding that in RSUME 267 (a beta sheet followed by a helix, then two beta sheets and then a helix). This result may indicate that the three isoforms have the same fold in their intermediate domains.</p>

        <p>Although the confident prediction for the last 67 amino acids of RSUME267 is low to consider it a good prediction, a low disorder prediction together with a predicted tendency to form alpha-helices in the C-terminal last 27 aminoacids suggest that this region is not unstructured. Therefore, we hypothesized that RSUME267 contains an additional domain in its C-terminal end, which is composed by at least two consecutive alpha-helices. Importantly, this domain is present in the longest RSUME isoform, RSUME267, but is absent in RSUME195 or 200, and constitutes the most pronounced structural difference among the C-terminal half of the three human RSUME isoforms. In a BLASTp search <xref rid="pone.0057795-Mount1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> in the PDB database with the C-terminal half, we found low identity with all the proteins crystallized so far, including others members of the RWD domain protein superfamily (RWDD1, RWDD2 and RWDD4), which implies that the C-terminal domain is exclusive of the RSUME267 isoform of the RWDD3 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). The three RSUME267 structural domains predicted by the PHYRE server are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g003">Figure 3C and D</xref>, and the proposed C-terminal domain is colored in brown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g003">Figure 3C</xref>. Taking into account the difference in the C-terminal RSUME267 and the predicted similarities in the intermediate domain between the three isoforms, we decided to compare RSUME267 with the previous described functions of RSUME195.</p>

        <title>Effect of RSUME195 and RSUME267 on NF-ÎºB Pathway</title>
        <p>In order to study the functional contribution of the C-terminal domain of RSUME267 to NF-ÎºB signaling pathways, we first compared the interaction of the RSUME isoforms with IÎºBÎ±, a subunit of the NF-ÎºB inhibitor, by inmunoprecipitation experiments. Previously, we have demonstrated a direct interaction of RSUME195 with IÎºBÎ±. Now, we probe that RSUME267 shows a greater interaction with IÎºBÎ± than RSUME195 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Based on this result, we expect that RSUME267 has a greater impact on the inhibition of the NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with NF-ÎºB-LUC reporter plasmid and different concentrations of RSUME195 or RSUME267 expression vectors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, although both RSUME isoforms inhibit NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity, low doses of RSUME267 are sufficient for a strong inhibition (65%); 5-folds higher amounts of RSUME195 expression vectors are needed to reach a similar effect (100 ng of RSUME267 vs. 500 ng of RSUME195). Additionally, RSUME267 also has a stronger inhibitory effect on IL-8 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, upper panel). This action of RSUME is absent when the NF-ÎºB binding site of the promoter of IL-8 was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, lower panel). In addition, we show by quantitative real time RT-PCR that RSUME195 decreases the endogenous mRNA expression of IL-8, and this effect is significantly higher for the RSUME267 isoform, although this effect is very small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Effect of RSUME195 and RSUME267 on HIF-1 Pathway</title>
        <p>Since we have shown that RSUME195 modulates HIF-1 transcriptional activity, we tested if RSUME195 and 267 differ in their stimulatory ability on this signaling pathway. We observed the same result that on the NF-ÎºB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). RSUME195 and 267 increase HIF-1 transcriptional activity, but lower doses of RSUME267 are necessary to produce the highest effect of the RSUME195 (100 ng vs. 300 ng). To confirm this result, we tested the ability of RSUME267 to increase HIF-1alpha expression. We found that RSUME267 increases HIF-1alpha protein at greater levels than RSUME195 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have previously reported that RSUME is a small RWD-domain containing protein with SUMO enhancer properties. In that work, we characterized functionally RSUME195, the shortest RSUME isoform, and showed that this isoform increases protein SUMOylation by interacting physically with Ubc9 and SUMO-1 <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Importantly, we demonstrated that RSUME195 action over the SUMO enzymatic cascade depends on the RWD domain, a protein-protein interaction domain <xref rid="pone.0057795-Doerks1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Several RWD-domain containing proteins have been described to date, and the solution structure of most of them has been determined (PDBid: 2EBM,2DAY, 2DAX, 2DAW, 2XZ0) <xref rid="pone.0057795-Berman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, the RWD domain structure significantly resembles that of E2s ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes <xref rid="pone.0057795-Nameki1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-VanDemark1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the RWD domain is structurally homologous to the E2-SUMO conjugase Ubc9 <xref rid="pone.0057795-Nameki1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and based on these data, a structural homology between RSUME and Ubc9 has been proposed <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Considering that the RWD domain is contained into all the human RSUME isoforms, an involvement of all these variants on the SUMOylation pathway would be expected. In fact, in this work we show that the shortest and longest RSUME isoforms, which differ in a C-terminal extension of 76 residues exclusive of the longest isoform, increase protein SUMOylation to similar extents. The fact that RSUME195 and 267 actions on overall protein SUMOylation are identical indicates that the C-terminal end of RSUME267 is dispensable for the SUMO-conjugation enhancer properties of RSUME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057795-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The essential role of the RWD domain, as was revealed by RWD-disrupting mutations in RSUME195 <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, supports this idea.</p>
      <p>A biological role of the C-terminal end of RSUME267 is suggested by the presence of a defined domain into this region, the C-terminal domain. This domain is contained into the last 67 amino acids of RSUME267, and is composed by at least two consecutive alpha helices spanning on the last 27 residues of this protein. Since this domain is only present in the longest RSUME isoform, we hypothesized that this C-terminal domain could be directly involved in physical and/or functional interactions with a defined subset of RSUME-interacting proteins. We have shown that RSUME195 interacts physically not only with proteins implicated in enzymatic pathways, like Ubc9, but also with substrates of SUMOylation, like IÎºB and HIF-1alpha <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The intrinsic ability of Ubc9 to form homodimers <xref rid="pone.0057795-Kovalenko1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and the structural homology between RSUME195 and Ubc9 support the notion that the nature of these interactions is quite different; while the RSUME-Ubc9 physical interaction would occurs in a RWD-domain dependent manner, SUMO substrates would bind through the C-terminal region of RSUME. Thus, it would be expected that RSUME267 binds preferentially a subset of SUMO targets through its C-terminal domain to favor their SUMOylation. Indeed, we show that RSUME267 has a differential interaction with IÎºBÎ± and HIF-1alpha.</p>
      <p>The proposed structure of the full length RSUME267 protein shows that the RWD domain is separated by a long flexible loop, aminoacids 123 to 133, from its intermediate domain, and the C-terminal domain is located between these two domains with a large interaction surface with both of them. We hypothesize that in the albescence of the C-terminal domain, in isoforms RSUME195 and 200, these two domains may not interact and behave as independent entities. On the other hand, in RSUME267, the C-terminal domain may act as a scaffold producing a more compact 3D structure therefore regulating RWD domain functions, in particular its protein-protein interactions. This is in agreement with our experiments showing differences in the interactions of RSUME267 and RSUME195 with IÎºBÎ± and HIF1-alpha.</p>
      <p>In order to test RSUME functional activity, we first evaluated RSUME267 action over the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Desterro and colleagues demonstrated that IÎºB SUMOylation by SUMO1 leads to its stabilization and consequently inhibits NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity <xref rid="pone.0057795-Desterro1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In agreement with this, RSUME195 interacts physically with IÎºB, increases its SUMOylation and inhibits NF-ÎºB activity <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In this work we found a 5-fold higher inhibition of NF-ÎºB activity by RSUME267 compared to RSUME195. The stronger inhibition on the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway by the longest RSUME isoform suggest that the exclusive C-terminal domain of RSUME267 could belong to the RSUME surface that binds to IÎºB. RSUME267 binds IÎºB to increase its SUMOylation, leading to an increased IÎºB stability and, consequently, to a stronger inhibition of NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity.</p>
      <p>Also, we found a more pronounced effect of RSUME267 not only over HIF-1 transcriptional activity but also on HIF-1alpha protein levels and VEGF expression. HIF-1alpha protein levels positively correlate with HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Therefore, it is expected that the higher effect of RSUME 267 on HIF-1alpha protein levels leads to an increase on HIF-1 transcriptional activity and expression of its target genes. In previous works we demonstrated that RSUME195 interacts physically with and increases HIF-1alpha SUMOylation. Thus, as for the case of IÎºB, the different abilities of RSUME isoforms to modulate the HIF signaling pathway could be explained by the stronger capacity of RSUME267 to interact with HIF-1alpha.</p>
      <p>An alternative explanation for the functional differences seen on the RSUME isoforms could be a differential action over E3 SUMO ligases <xref rid="pone.0057795-Melchior1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Although Ubc9 is sufficient for <italic>in </italic>vitro SUMOylation, the action of E3 SUMO ligases significantly increases substrate specificity as well as SUMOylation efficiency <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0057795-Pichler1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Kotaja1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057795-Kagey1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have previously shown a synergistic effect between RSUME195 and the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS1 on overall SUMOylation, revealing a functional interaction between these two types of proteins <xref rid="pone.0057795-CarbiaNagashima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Thus, the C-terminal domain of RSUME267 could interact preferentially with certain E3s SUMO ligases to promote the SUMOylation of their respective substrate.</p>
      <p>Despite the differential action of the different RSUME isoforms on HIF, RSUME195 and 267 are co-expressed in normoxia and are both induced by hypoxia. However, their mRNA and protein levels differ in human glioma cells; while RSUME195 is expressed in all the tumors assayed, RSUME267 is differentially expressed in most but not all.</p>
      <p>This work addresses the first open question of RSUME isoforms biology; sharing a degree of functional redundancy among the RSUME isoforms on certain signaling and enzymatic pathways. However, the increased inhibition conferred by RSUME267 over the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, the increased activation over the HIF-1 pathway and the different expression of the RSUME isoforms suggest specific roles of each RSUME isoform. Improving our current knowledge on the molecular biology of each RSUME isoform will allow us to understand the contribution of each of them to the development and maintenance of certain types of brain tumors, in which RSUME are expressed.</p>
