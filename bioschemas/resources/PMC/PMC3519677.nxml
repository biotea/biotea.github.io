      <abstract>
        <p>We recently reported that <italic>TCRP1</italic>, a novel multidrug-resistance associated human gene, can mediate cisplatin resistance in OSCC cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this role of <italic>TCRP1</italic> remained to be elucidated. In this study, by using Human Toxicology and Drug Resistance Microarray, we identified 30 genes with significantly different expression levels between Tca/PYM and TCRP1 knockdown cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and GST-pull down assays showed that metallothionein1X (MT1X) and Akt interact with TCRP1. siRNA-mediated knockdown of TCRP1 and MT1X was found to sensitize cells to cisplatin, leading to increased apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. These functions of TCRP1 may be caused at least in part via activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that TCRP1 may be an important drug target for improvement of the treatment and survival of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Platinum-based drugs are currently the largest class of drugs used in treating various types of cancer, such as ovarian, testicular, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) <xref rid="pone.0051413-Pignon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Haddad1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, many tumors are completely resistant to these drugs and exhibit no clinical response. Several lines of research have shown that such differences in clinical responses are caused partially by multidrug resistance to these drugs <xref rid="pone.0051413-Marsh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although drug efflux mechanisms have been shown to play an important role in the multidrug-resistant phenotype, evidence for additional contributing factors led us to use cDNA microarray to search for differentially expressed genes in the Tca8113 cell line and its pingyangmycin resistant variant (Tca/PYM). Our results revealed a subset of differentially expressed genes in the multidrug resistance model, including a novel gene named <italic>tongue cancer resistance-associated protein 1</italic> (<italic>TCRP1</italic>, Genebank number: EF363480) <xref rid="pone.0051413-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our previous work, we reported that <italic>TCRP1</italic> may be a candidate chemotherapeutic-resistance gene responsible for mediating multidrug resistance in OSCC cells <xref rid="pone.0051413-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It is expressed ubiquitously in many cancer cell lines, but has higher expression in cisplatin (DDP)-resistant cell lines <xref rid="pone.0051413-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that <italic>TCRP1</italic> is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, and can promote radio-resistance in OSSC cells <xref rid="pone.0051413-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Gu2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Over-expression of TCRP1 is associated with a poor clinical outcome in cancer patients and is often attributed to resistance to DDP <xref rid="pone.0051413-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Meanwhile, transfection of TCRP1 into Tca8113 cells results in a 3.4-fold increase in DDP resistance and enables anchorage-independent growth and colony formation in soft agar <xref rid="pone.0051413-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These data suggest that TCRP1 may be a DDP-resistance associated protein. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying <italic>TCRP1</italic>-mediated resistance, such as the target protein for <italic>TCRP1</italic> and the pathways involved in <italic>TCRP1</italic> function in drug resistance remain to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Recently developed techniques for genome-wide expression analysis seek to provide additional information on novel candidate genes associated with <italic>TCRP1</italic>-associated drug resistance and new therapeutic targets <xref rid="pone.0051413-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Microarray technology has become a widely used tool to address complex biological questions by simultaneously analyzing changes in the expression of thousands of genes and identifying significant patterns. Identifying patterns of gene expression and grouping genes into expression classes can provide important insights into their biological function and relevance. For example, recent studies have established several DDP-resistant cell models. Microarray technology has led to the discovery of several genes related to DDP resistance, such as <italic>LUM</italic>, <italic>PDE3B</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, and <italic>RECQL</italic>, in OSCC cells <xref rid="pone.0051413-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Yamano1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Based on these facts, we reasoned that small interfering RNA (siRNA) can be used to knock down the expression of <italic>TCRP1</italic>, and quantitative characterization of gene expression in <italic>TCRP1</italic> knock-down cells should provide new insights on regulatory pathways involved in the pharmacological action of <italic>TCRP1</italic>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we examined genes that were differentially expressed in Tca/PYM and Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 cell lines by Human Toxicology and Drug Resistance Microarray (OHS-401) to obtain a global profile of drug-resistance genes regulated by <italic>TCRP1</italic>. Seven selected genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) to verify the gene microarray results. We were intrigued by the finding that the most downregulated protein, metallothionein1X (MT1X), could bind with <italic>TCRP1</italic> in co-immunoprecpitation (co-IP) and GST-pull down assays. We next determined MT1X protein expression levels in primary oral squamous cell carcinoma and knocked down its expression in Tca/PYM cell by siRNA. Drug sensitivity studies were conducted to determine the influence of MT1X and <italic>TCRP1</italic> on the multidrug-resistant phenotype and apoptosis of OSCC cells. Finally, we sought to identify the pathway contributing to the anti-apoptosis effects of TCRP1.</p>

        <title>1. <italic>In vitro</italic> Effects of TCRP1 Interfering RNA on Human OSCC</title>
        <p>We first assessed the effects of knocking down the endogenous level of TCRP1 protein by pAU-siTCRP1 interfering plasmid transfected using Lipofectamine2000. Positive colonies were selected using G418 and the cell lines named Tca/PYM-Con and Tca/PYM-siTCRP1. Then, we examined TCRP1 expression using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Compared with no treatment or treatment with control plasmid, transfection with the pAU-siTCRP1 plasmid caused a marked decrease in <italic>TCRP1</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, TCRP1 protein levels decreased post-transfection, whereas no reduction was observed in untreated or control plasmid-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These data indicated that our TCRP1-interfering plasmid could successfully diminish TCRP1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels.</p>

        <p>To examine the role of TCRP1 in multidrug resistance, the cells were treated with different concentrations of PYM and DDP, and dose-response curves were plotted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>, dose-dependent anti-proliferative activities were observed in Tca/PYM and Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 cell lines. However, the sensitivity of Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 to DDP was 3.29-fold higher than that of the parental Tca/PYM cells, as measured by the IC<sub>50</sub> values for DDP over 72 h treatments. By contrast, the IC<sub>50</sub> value of Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 to PYM was 2.57-fold higher. These data show that treatment with the TCRP1 interfering plasmid complex inhibits the proliferation of OSCC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

        <title>2. Differentially Expressed Genes in TCRP1 Knockdown Tca/PYM Cells</title>
        <p>To characterize genes that contribute to TCRP1-associated multidrug-resistance, we used Human Toxicology and Drug Resistance Microarray to compare gene expression profiles between Tca/PYM and TCRP1 knockdown cell lines (Tca/PYM-siTCRP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We chose genes that showed more than 1.5-fold change in expression in TCRP1 knockdown cells compared with the parent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that expression of 30 genes was changed in the TCRP1 interfering cells compared with the original population. Among them, nine genes were upregulated with changes ranging from 1.519- to 2.076-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051413-t001">Table 1</xref>), whereas 21 genes were downregulated with changes ranging from -1.513- to -3.889-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051413-t002">Table 2</xref>). The <italic>CCT4</italic> gene, which showed strongest upregulation, increased by 2.076-fold, whereas the <italic>MT1X</italic> gene, which showed the strongest downregulation, decreased by 3.889-fold. These genes were grouped into the following eight categories according to their functions as described by GO analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g002">Figure 2C</xref>): 1) apoptosis, 2) cell cycle, 3) cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, 4) transporters, 5) response to stress, 6) chaperones/heat shock proteins, 7) transcription factors and regulators, and 8) drug metabolizing enzymes. This diversity is consistent with the existence of numerous regulatory mechanisms associated with <italic>TCRP1</italic> in response to drug resistance. Many of the upregulated genes are associated with chaperones/heat shock proteins (<italic>CCT3</italic>, <italic>CCT4</italic>, <italic>DNAJA2</italic>, and <italic>DNAJC4</italic>) and drug metabolizing enzymes (<italic>CYP1A1</italic>, <italic>CHST4</italic>, and <italic>CYP3A5</italic>). Among the downregulated genes, many are associated with apoptosis (Akt1, <italic>NFÎºB1</italic>, <italic>NFÎºB2</italic>, GADD45B, <italic>NFÎºBIA</italic>, <italic>NFÎºBIB</italic>, and TRADD).

<bold>A.</bold> Differentially expressed genes in the Tca/PYM-Con (left) and Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 (right) cells were analyzed by Human Toxicology and Drug Resistance Microarray (OHS-401). This microarray included 263 key genes critical in drug metabolism and resistance. <bold>B.</bold> A heat map generated from the microarray shows gene expression as Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 over Tca/PYM-Con cells for the genes whose expressions had increased or decreased by more than 1.5-fold in TCRP1 knockdown cells. <bold>C.</bold> GO analysis of functional gene grouping of the differentially expressed genes involved in TCRP1-associated multidrug-resistance phenotype.</p>

        <title>3. Confirmation of Microarray Results by Real-time PCR and Western Blot</title>
        <p>To confirm the data generated from the microarray studies, we chose a subset of seven genes that were either highly upregulated (<italic>CYP3A5</italic>, <italic>HIF1A</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic>) or downregulated (<italic>MT1X</italic>, <italic>NFÎºB1</italic>, <italic>EGFR</italic>, and <italic>Akt1</italic>) for validation by real-time PCR and Western blot. Our results confirmed our microarray analysis data: all seven differentially expressed genes were either upregulated (<italic>CYP3A5</italic>, <italic>HIF1A</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic>) or downregulated (<italic>MT1X</italic>, <italic>NFÎºB1</italic>, <italic>EGFR</italic>, and <italic>Akt1</italic>). For example, the mean fold changes in upregulation as determined by microarray analysis and by real-time PCR were 3.889 and 5.253 for <italic>MT1X</italic>, and 1.878 and 2.137 for <italic>CYP3A5</italic>, respectively. Expression of MT1X, NFÎºB1, EGFR, Akt1, CYP3A5, HIF1A, and TP53 proteins was further tested by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). As shown in the results of three independent experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g003">Figure 3</xref>, our Western blot analyses also confirmed the microarray results.</p>

        <title>4. Akt and MT1X could Combine with TCRP1</title>
        <p>Once differentially expressed genes were identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot, the significance of the changes in gene expression was further investigated. First, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine whether any identified protein could bind with TCRP1. We chose 15 genes, including MT1X, NFÎºB, and Akt, as the target protein for co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Our results showed that MT1X and Akt could bind with TCRP1. We also carried out a pull-down assay using the recombinant protein to confirm this finding. TCRP1 was purified from bacteria as a GST fusion protein <xref rid="pone.0051413-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. GST-tagged TCRP1 or GST alone was incubated with cell lysates. Pull-down analysis revealed that both MT1X and Akt formed a complex with GST-TCRP1 <italic>in vitro</italic> but not with GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These results show that MT1X and Akt can physically bind to TCRP1, suggesting that they might play important roles in TCRP1-associated drug resistance. It is noteworthy that MT1X was the most downregulated protein in Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 cells. Although many studies have evaluated the role of metallothionein (MT) as a heavy-metal detoxifier in the resistance of tumors to anti-cancer drugs, and high levels as well as induction of MT have been found to coincide with protection against damage by heavy metals, data on the involvement of MT1X in acquired resistance to DDP is far from consistent. Therefore, we chose to further study the role of MT1X in TCRP1-associated drug resistance.</p>

        <title>5. Expression of TCRP1 and MT1X in Primary Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma</title>
        <p>In our previous work, we had classified 60 clinical samples into cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant groups on the basis of growth inhibition, and had found up-regulation of TCRP1 in the resistant group and opposite changes in the sensitive group <xref rid="pone.0051413-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the current study, immunostaining results were ranked according to the extent of TCRP1 immunoreactivity: âââ (0â5%), â+â(5%â20%), â++â (20%â50%), and â+++â (&gt;50%). The MannâWhitney U test was carried out to identify whether there is any correlation between MT1X expression levels with drug resistance patterns. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051413-t003">table 3</xref>, MT1X expression level in the 30 cisplatin-sensitive cases were as follows: 36.67% were graded as âââ, 40.00% as â+â, 13.33% as â++â, and 10.00% as â+++â. Of the 30 cisplatin-resistant cases, 13.33% were graded as âââ, 10.00% as â+â, 43.33% as â++â, and 33.33% as â+++â. In other words, the expression level of MT1X in cisplatin-sensitive and resistant groups have significant difference with MannâWhitney U test P value less than 0.001. These results were consistent with our previously research about TCRP1 (<italic>P</italic>â=â0.005) <xref rid="pone.0051413-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Meanwhile, Spearmanâs correlation coefficient was used to analyze whether the relationships between the expression patterns of TCRP1 and MT1X in primary tumors correlate with their drug resistance patterns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051413-t003">Tab 3</xref>). The results shown the expression of TCRP1 and MT1X in cisplatin-sensitive groups were not statistically significant (râ=â0.886, <italic>P</italic>â=â0.114), but cisplatin-resistant groups were statistically significant (râ=â0.990, <italic>P</italic>â=â0.01). These results indicated that it has a positive correlation between TCRP1 and MT1X expression in the cisplatin-resistant clinical samples.</p>

        <title>6. Reduction in MT1X Activity Sensitizes Cells to DDP</title>
        <p>We next determined whether MT1X is required for TCRP1-mediated DDP resistance. Tca/PYM cell lines were transfected with MT1X siRNA or scrambled siRNA (100 nmol/L) for 48 h. After treatment, we examined MT1X expression using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Compared with untreated or scrambled siRNA-treated cells, all three MT1X siRNAs caused marked decrease in MT1X mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g005">Fig. 5A and 5B</xref>). MT1X ASO3# exhibited the strongest knockdown effects among the three siRNAs so it was used in all subsequent experiments.</p>

        <p>We also evaluated MT1X expression level in genetically engineered Tca8113 cells. MT1X expression was found to correlate with TCRP1 expression, for example, the Tca8113/TCRP1 and the Tca/PYM cell lines, which have high expression of TCRP1, showed high expression of MT1X as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, we examined whether MT1X could inhibit DDP activities in the different cell lines to characterize the role of MT1X in DDP resistance. MTS results showed that knockdown of MT1X expression in Tca/PYM cells increased their sensitivity to DDP, but had no obvious effects on their response to PYM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). These findings suggest a correlation between expression of TCRP1 and MT1X with DDP resistance in OSCC cells.</p>

        <p>A major mechanism of DDP-induced tumor killing is the induction of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0051413-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Our gene function category analysis also identified Tca/PYM cell line to have enrichment of apoptosis-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). In order to examine whether MT1X is involved in apoptosis, we examined the extent of apoptosis in Tca/PYM cells treated with 20 ÂµM DDP for 24 h by Annexin-V FITC and PI double staining. Significant increases in the percentage of apoptotic cells from 8.04% to 15.47% and 20.20% were observed when the cells were treated with siMT1X and siTCRP1 RNA, respectively. When we treated the Tca/PYM cell combination with siMT1X and siTCRP1, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased to 37.48% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g006">Fig. 6A,B</xref>).

        <title>8. Activation of NFÎºB Contributes to the Anti-apoptotic Effect of TCRP1</title>
        <p>Our microarray results showed that many NFÎºB family proteins (NFÎºB1, NFÎºB2, NFÎºBIA, and NFÎºBIB) were down-regulated when TCRP1 expression was knocked down. Notably, Akt and some types of MT are known to prevent activation of the NFÎºB signaling pathway which plays a significant role in preventing cells from undergoing apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0051413-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Morgensztern1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These observations led us to hypothesize that Akt/NFÎºB signaling pathway may contribute to the anti-apoptotic effect of TCRP1. To confirm this hypothesis, we treated TCRP1-over-expressing cells (Tca8113/TCRP1) with 30 ÂµM of cisplatin in the presence of specific inhibitors of PI3K (LY2294002 [50 ÂµM]) or NFÎºB (Bay11-7082 [20 ÂµM]), or of vehicle (DMSO) and cultured for 24 hours. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, treatment with both inhibitors elicited significant apoptotic response in Tca8113/TCRP1 cells compared with the vehicle control (2.3% versus 23.4% and 27.7% apoptotic cells in LY2294002 and Bay11-7082, respectively). These results indicated that activation of NFÎºB may play a significant role in protecting Tca8113/TCRP1 cells from apoptosis.</p>

        <p>To provide further proof that activation of Akt/NFÎºB mediates the anti-apoptotic effects of TCRP1, we investigated the expression of Akt/NFÎºB pathway proteins by Western blot. Since NFÎºB translocates to the nucleus upon activation, we studied the levels of the most abundant subunit of NFÎºB, p65, in nuclear extracts and whole lysates of TCRP1-over-expressing cells. Our Western blot results showed that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NFÎºB signaling pathway using specific inhibitors led to increased expression of apoptotic markers, such as cleaved caspase-3 and PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Additionally, when Tca8113/TCRP1 cells were treated with DDP, regardless of whether the PI3K/Akt or the NFÎºB part of the PI3K/Akt/NFÎºB pathway was inhibited, increased apoptosis was observed. Meanwhile, treatment with inhibitors of PI3K (LY2294002) or NFÎºB (Bay11-7082) did not affect TCRP1 and MT1X expression, suggesting that TCRP1 and MT1X act upstream of Akt/NFÎºB. Taken together, these results illustrate that TCRP1 functions as an upstream regulator of the NFÎºB signaling pathway, and the PI3K/Akt/NFÎºB pathway plays an important role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effect of TCRP1.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The aim of the present work was to characterize in more detail the role of the TCRP1 pathway in the development of DDP resistance. We applied high-throughput functional gene microarray analysis to assess the role of TCRP1 associated signaling pathways in OSCC cell lines. Gene expression profiles of human PYM-resistant cell lines were compared with those in which TCRP1 was knocked down by siRNA. We found that the TCRP1 knockdown cell line, Tca/PYM-siTCRP1, had a genome-wide expression profile that differed from that of the Tca/PYM cell line. Using the function gene microarray (OHS-401), we identified 30 genes that had significantly different expression levels between Tca/PYM and Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 cells. Considering that Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 and Tca/PYM cells have identical genetic backgrounds, we presume that differences in expression of these genes are related to TCRP1 expression, and that these differences might shed light on the mechanism of Tca/PYM resistance to DDP.</p>
      <p>Of the 30 candidate genes, 9 showed higher expression and 21 showed lower expression in TCRP1 knockout cells compared with Tca/PYM. Gene function category analysis revealed that the Tca/PYM cell line, which has high TCRP1 expression, has an enrichment of apoptosis-associated genes. Induction of apoptosis has been reported as an important factor in determining response to chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0051413-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Kartalou1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Notably, some of the genes with altered expression in TCRP1 knockdown cell lines were apoptosis-related genes such as <italic>AKT</italic>, <italic>NFÎºB</italic>, <italic>BCR</italic>, <italic>TRADD</italic>, and <italic>CCT4.</italic> All of them had significantly lower expression in Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 cells than in Tca/PYM cells. <italic>MT1X</italic> was downregulated the most after TCRP1 interference. Mammalian metallothionein (MT) is a small protein of 61â62 amino acids that contains 20 cysteine residues. It has been suggested to have a role in the detoxification of heavy metal ions. Several lines of evidence suggest that MT is chemotherapy-inducible, and its expression constitutes a protective mechanism that prevents cells apoptosis induced by DDP and doxorubicin <xref rid="pone.0051413-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Both cis-DDP and trans-DDP have been shown to chelate with MT <xref rid="pone.0051413-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Aydemir1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Winge1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although high levels of MT have been found to coincide with protection against damage by heavy metals, the involvement of MT in acquired resistance to DDP is less clear <xref rid="pone.0051413-Chun1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In our previous study, we established a human MT2A recombinant with soluble high-yield expression and demonstrated its hydroxyl radical-scavenging ability and significant protective role against DNA damage caused by UVC radiation <xref rid="pone.0051413-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In the present study, we found that downregulating the expression of <italic>MT1X</italic>, which is one isoform of MT, by siRNA can sensitize cells to DDP, in part via promotion of cell apoptosis and inhibition of clone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Another important apoptosis-related gene associated with TCRP1 is the NF-ÎºB family protein. <italic>NF-ÎºB</italic> includes various dimeric complexes of members of the Rel protein family, which comprises of Rel (c- Rel), Rel A (p65), Rel B, NF-ÎºB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-ÎºB2 (p52 and its precursor p100). <italic>NF-ÎºB</italic> regulates the expression of a variety of proteins that inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival/proliferation <xref rid="pone.0051413-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Moynagh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. <italic>Akt</italic> is another major contributor to chemoresistance in human cancer <xref rid="pone.0051413-Fraser1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Several studies have demonstrated that the <italic>NF-ÎºB</italic> and <italic>Akt</italic> signaling pathways can converge <xref rid="pone.0051413-Chock1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, given that IÎºBÎ± kinase, involved in NF-ÎºB activation, is a substrate of <italic>Akt.</italic> Therefore, activation of Akt can stimulate NF-ÎºB activity. Our previous studies showed that TCRP1 plays a significant role in mediating OSCC radio-resistance by upregulating the activity and levels of <italic>Akt</italic> in addition to elevating the level of NF-ÎºB <xref rid="pone.0051413-Gu2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In the current study, we found that expression of Akt and several NF-ÎºB members (NFÎºB1, NFÎºB2, NFÎºBIA, NFÎºBIB) was lower in Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 cells than in Tca/PYM cells. Further investigation indicated that TCRP1 induces activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, and this may be one of the mechanisms responsible for protecting Tca8113/TCRP1 cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Future studies should address how TCRP1 activates the PI3K/Akt/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, and how AKT, NF-ÎºB family, MT1X and TCRP1 are related functionally.</p>
      <p>Our microarray results also indicated that increased drug detoxification is an important way for <italic>TCRP1</italic> associated with DDP resistance in OSCC. For example, many studies have evaluated the role of MT as a heavy-metal detoxifier in the resistance of tumors to anti-cancer drugs <xref rid="pone.0051413-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Human cytosolic sulfotransferase (SULT) enzymes catalyze the sulfate conjugation of many drugs <xref rid="pone.0051413-Hebbring1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Our results indicate that <italic>TCRP1</italic> could increase DDP detoxification by upregulating MT1X and SULT1A1. Cytochrome P450 3A subfamily are the most abundantly expressed CYP enzymes in the human liver. In adults, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are predominant among the four known isoforms (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP3A43) <xref rid="pone.0051413-Lepper1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The metabolism of 37% of all currently approved cytostatic and/or cytotoxic anticancer agents is known to be mediated, at least partially, by the CYP3A isoforms <xref rid="pone.0051413-Lepper1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Vernhet1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, it has been shown that <italic>TCRP1</italic> can promote CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 expression. The mechanism underlying these observations remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>Several membrane transporters are known to confer multidrug resistance <xref rid="pone.0051413-Konkimalla1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. They do so by mediating energy-dependent reduced influx or increased efflux of drugs <xref rid="pone.0051413-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In our work, two membrane proteins were found to be downregulated in Tca/PYM-siTCRP1 cells. One is AP1S1, and the other is ABCC3, which encodes multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 and shows significant positive correlation with TCRP1-associated DDP resistance. This finding is consistent with a previous study that had indicated that overexpression of ABCC3 results in increased resistance to DDP <xref rid="pone.0051413-Konkimalla1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Zelcer1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051413-Montpetit1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Since we had confirmed in our previous report that TCRP1 is not a membrane protein <xref rid="pone.0051413-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, we speculate that TCRP1 is involved in DDP transport from the cytoplasm to the outside of cells via other membrane proteins such as AP1S1 and ABCC3.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results indicate that <italic>TCRP1</italic> may participate in DDP resistance in OSCC by several mechanisms, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051413-g008">Figure 8</xref>) including 1) reduction in cellular accumulation, 2) inhibition of apoptosis, 3) reduction in the number of DNA intraqstrand crosslinks, and 4) enhancement of DNA repair, among others. Knocking down TCRP1 and MT1X by siRNA could sensitize cells to cisplatin through increased cancer cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. This may be caused at least in part by TCRP1 induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Our data suggest that inhibitors of both MT1X and TCRP1 may have potential therapeutic application in inducing apoptosis in OSCC. Although further <italic>in vivo</italic> validations for the identified genes are required, our findings may help in the development of better cancer chemotherapy strategies. Future work to examine the effectiveness of <italic>TCRP1</italic> knockdown on OSCC in preclinical animal models will help determine whether this approach represents a potential avenue for clinical trials.</p>
