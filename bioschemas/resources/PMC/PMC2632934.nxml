      <abstract>
        <p>Human DNA polymerase Î´ (Pol Î´4), a key enzyme in chromosomal replication, is a heterotetramer composed of the p125, p50, p68 and p12 subunits. Genotoxic agents such as UV and alkylating chemicals trigger a DNA damage response in which Pol Î´4 is converted to a trimer (Pol Î´3) by degradation of p12. We show that Pol Î´3 has altered enzymatic properties: it is less able to perform translesion synthesis on templates containing base lesions (O<sup>6</sup>-MeG, 8-oxoG, an abasic site or a thymine-thymine dimer); a greater proofreading activity; an increased exonuclease/polymerase activity ratio; a decreased tendency for the insertion of wrong nucleotides, and for the extension of mismatched primers. Overall, our findings indicate that Pol Î´3 exhibits an enhanced ability for the detection of errors in both primers and templates over its parent enzyme. These alterations in Pol Î´3 show that p12 plays a major role in Pol Î´4 catalytic functions, and provides significant insights into the rationale for the conversion of Pol Î´4 to Pol Î´3 in the cellular response to DNA damage.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Faithful replication of chromosomal DNA and DNA damage repair are essential for preserving genomic integrity. Replicative DNA polymerases exhibit high fidelity and are able to proofread errors with an intrinsic 3â² to 5â² exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Structural, kinetic and mechanistic studies have led to models for how replicative DNA polymerases achieve extremely low error rates. This is achieved by the selectivity of the polymerase (pol) activity for nucleotide insertion, and also by proofreading and excision of mismatched nucleotides by the 3â² to 5â² exonuclease (exo) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3â5</xref>). Shuttling of DNA from the exo to pol catalytic sites is also a key factor in their co-operative actions that lead to efficient proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The balance between exo and pol reaction rates (exo/pol ratio) also plays a key role in proofreading, as alterations in the exo/pol ratio by mutations can either decrease or increase the fidelity of polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>There are two proofreading DNA polymerases in eukaryotic cells, Pol Î´ and Pol Îµ, which are responsible for the replication of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Human Pol Î´ possesses four subunits: p125, which harbors the pol and exo active sites; p50, which is tightly associated with the p125 subunit; p68, which associates with p50; and p12, which binds to both p125 and p50. p12 interacts with both the p50 and p125 subunits, may stabilize Pol Î´ subunit assembly, and play a role in the interaction of Pol Î´ with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The latter is a DNA sliding clamp that promotes processive DNA synthesis by Pol Î´ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The maintenance of genomic integrity requires that cells repair DNA damage and mutations. Pol Î´ also participates in DNA repair as a gap-filling polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The functions of Pol Î´ are thus important not only in replication, but also in understanding how it responds to encounters with DNA damage that can lead to the introduction of mutations.</p>
      <p>DNA base damage arises during the course of normal cellular processes or by environmental exposure to genotoxic agents such as UV light, alkylating and oxidizing agents. Two of the most common and extensively studied base lesions are O<sup>6</sup>-MeG (<italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-methylguanine), which is produced by alkylating agents, and 8-oxoG (7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine), which is produced by reactive oxygen species. These lesions are highly mutagenic as they are readily bypassed by eukaryotic polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12â14</xref>). Bases modified by bulky adducts, cross-linked bases such as thymine-thymine dimers, and abasic sites represent severe blocks to many replicative polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p>
      <p>Mammalian cells respond to DNA damage by a host of defense mechanisms that include activation of cell-cycle checkpoints and DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Cells are particularly vulnerable during S-phase, because of the encounter of replisomes with damaged DNA. This can lead to mutations if the replicative polymerases perform translesion (TLS) synthesis and introduce errors, or replication fork stalling if the polymerases are unable to bypass the lesions. Events that lead to prolonged stalling of replication forks result in replication fork collapse, formation of aberrant fork structures, chromosome damage or loss and ultimately cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). To avoid stalling, these lesions can be bypassed by the DNA damage tolerance pathway that requires the ubiquitination of PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This pathway allows the bypass of lesions by specialized TLS polymerases that are error-prone, so that bypass carries the risk of introduction of errors, depending on the lesion and the TLS polymerase involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). TLS synthesis requires a polymerase switch, in which the TLS polymerase exchanges places with Pol Î´ (or Pol Îµ), and after limited synthesis past the lesion, again switches with Pol Î´ to allow resumption of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recently, we discovered a novel cellular response to DNA damage, in which exposure of mammalian cells to UV light or alkylating agents such as methyl methane sulfonate leads to the rapid degradation of the p12 subunit of Pol Î´. Pol Î´ is consequently converted from a heterotetramer (Pol Î´4) to a trimer lacking the p12 subunit (Pol Î´3). This response is dependent on the ATR/Chk1 checkpoint kinases and a functional ubiquitination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). These observations lead to the hypothesis that the conversion of Pol Î´4 to Pol Î´3 may contribute to the cellular response to DNA damage, and that this is exerted through alterations in Pol Î´ activity or behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Given the number of DNA transactions in which Pol Î´ may be involved, there are a number of possible outcomes of the alteration in its quaternary structure. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that Pol Î´3 exhibits altered properties when it encounters DNA base lesions. Our studies show that Pol Î´3 exhibits a decreased ability for TLS synthesis. Pol Î´3 exhibits reduced proclivities for the insertion of mismatched nucleotides, and for the extension of mismatched primer termini. Overall, the behavior of Pol Î´3 leads to the conclusions that it is more discriminatory than Pol Î´4 in assays that test their abilities to recognize aberrant primer/templates, to insert correctly based-paired nucleotides, and to recognize mismatched primer termini. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that Pol Î´3 has altered properties that may be beneficial to the cell when it is subjected to DNA damage.</p>

        <p>Hela cells (3 Ã 10<sup>8</sup>) were divided into two equal portions. One half was treated with UV (20 J/m<sup>2</sup>) and harvested 4 h later. Pol Î´3 and Pol Î´4 were isolated from the UV-treated and untreated cells, respectively, by immunoaffinity chromatography on anti-p125 agarose, essentially as described for their isolation from HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Pol Î´3 activity in the peak fraction was 45% that of the peak fraction of Pol Î´4. The fractions were western blotted for the p125, p50, p68 and p12 subunits to confirm that p12 was absent from the Pol Î´3 from the UV-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The amounts of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 protein in the preparations were estimated based on the specific activities determined for the purified recombinant enzymes.</p>

        <title>Expression and purification of human DNA Pol Î´</title>
        <p>Recombinant human Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on immobilized anti-p125, followed by FPLC on Mono Q ion exchange columns essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The preparations of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 used in these studies had specific activities of 21 000 U/mg protein and 9400 U/mg protein, respectively. Pol Î´ activity was assayed on poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The Pol Î´ trimer lacking the p68 subunit (Pol Î´3-p68) was also prepared. Exonuclease-deficient forms of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 were produced by mutation of D402 of p125 to alanine, and purified as described for the wt enzymes. In mice, the mutation of the cognate residue, D400, to alanine, leads to loss of exonuclease function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Protein concentrations of p125 were determined by in-gel analysis with catalase as a protein standard. A baculovirus expressing his-tagged human pol Î· was a generous gift from Dr. P. Guengerich (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). Pol Î· was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified on NiâNTA columns.</p>

          <title>DNA substrates</title>
          <p>Unmodified DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized and PAGE-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA); modified oligonucleotides were synthesized and RP-HPLC purified by Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, MP Biochemicals) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, MA). The 5â²-<sup>32</sup>P labeled primers were annealed with templates in a ratio of 1:1.2. A 25-mer primer (5â²-GCCACTACAGCACCTTGACAGCCAG-3â²) was annealed to 40-mer oligonucleotides (5-TCATCGGTCGCATCXCTGGCTGTCAAGGTGCTGTAGTGGC-3â²) where X = G, O<sup>6</sup>-MeG, 8-oxoG, or modified tetrahydrofuran (AP site). The 26-mer primer used for mismatch extension assays was the 25-mer with an additional T at the 3â² end. A 5â²-end labeled 24-mer (5â²-GCCTCGAGCCAGCCGCAGACGCAG-3â²) was used as a ssDNA substrate, and annealed to a 36-mer template (5â²-TCGGCGTCCTCGCTGCGTCTGCGGCTGGCTCGAGGC-3â²) for use as a dsDNA substrate for assays of 3â² to 5â² exonuclease activity.

        <p>The 5â²-end labeled 25-mer primer annealed to unmodified or modified templates were preincubated for 3 min at room temperature with Pol Î´ and PCNA. Reactions (20 Î¼l) were initiated by addition of a mixture containing all four dNTPs and MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Final concentrations of reactants were 500 Î¼M dNTP, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM BisâTrisâHCl pH 6.5, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 200 Î¼g/ml BSA, 30 mM NaCl, 150 nM primer/template, 400 nM PCNA and the indicated amounts of Pol Î´. Reactions were performed at 37Â°C for 5.5 min or the indicated times. Aliquots (8 Î¼l) were quenched with 16 Î¼l of 95% formamide/25 mM EDTA, and heated at 90Â°C for 3 min. Products were separated by electrophoresis on 16% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea. Radioactive products were visualized by phosphorimaging and analyzed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences, NJ).</p>

Other reaction components were the same as for the extension reactions described above.

        <p>Exonuclease assays were performed in the same reaction buffer as described above for the extension assays. Each reaction contained 4 nM polymerases, 100 nM 24-mer ssDNA or 24-/36-mer dsDNA (partially single stranded); MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added to initiate reactions. Reactions were carried out at 22Â°C. Products were separated by 16% urea denaturing gels and visualized by phosphorimaging. The concentration of dNMP that was generated in order to attain the product distribution found was calculated. To this end, the radioactivity of each band was determined as a fraction of the total radioactivity in its lane, and used to calculate its concentration based on the starting primer concentration. This concentration was multiplied by the number of exonucleolytic cleavages needed to generate such a product length, and the sum of all calculations represents the concentration of dNMP that is generated in order to attain the product distribution found.</p>

        <title>Native Pol Î´3 produced by UV damage exhibits an increased discrimination against bypass synthesis on templates containing base lesions</title>
        <p>Native forms of Pol Î´ holoenzyme (Pol Î´4) and Pol Î´3 were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from control and UV-treated HeLa cells, respectively (see âMaterials and methodsâ section). Their abilities to perform TLS synthesis were compared on oligonucleotide primer/templates consisting of a 25-mer end-labeled primer annealed to a 40-mer template that carried O<sup>6</sup>-MeG or an AP (abasic) site at nt 26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, âMaterials and methodsâ section). We chose O<sup>6</sup>-MeG as an example of a lesion that is readily bypassed by replicative polymerases <italic>in vitro</italic>, including Pol Î´ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). O<sup>6</sup>-MeG is highly mutagenic because T is often inserted opposite to it by DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The AP site was selected as one that represents a severe block to replicative polymerases. Replicative DNA polymerases stall at AP sites after the insertion of a single base, usually A, a phenomenon known as the âAâ rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).

        <p>Pol Î´4 readily bypassed the O<sup>6</sup>-MeG lesion as has been previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and C). Pol Î´4 was stalled at the AP site after insertion of a single nt, forming the 26-mer or P+1 (primer+1) product. This behavior is typical of replicative DNA polymerases, including Pol Î´, which usually insert an A across the AP site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Nevertheless, at the highest Pol Î´4 concentration (2 nM), <italic>ca</italic>. 30% of the primer was extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). In contrast to the unmodified template, Pol Î´4 produced a small but detectable increase in exonucleolytic products (smaller than the 25-mer primer) on the O<sup>6</sup>-MeG and the AP substrates, a result of the stalling of the polymerase and an increased idling reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p>
        <p>Pol Î´3 behaved in a strikingly different manner from Pol Î´4, as can be seen from the distribution and amounts of products on the gels. Pol Î´3 produced fewer full-length products, and more products of intermediate size than Pol Î´4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). This indicates a less processive behavior or a greater tendency for dissociation from the primer/template. When Pol Î´3 encountered the O<sup>6</sup>-MeG lesion, product formation was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C). Thus, Pol Î´3 exhibits a reduced ability for TLS synthesis past the O<sup>6</sup>-MeG lesion. Pol Î´3 was unable to bypass the AP site at the enzyme concentrations tested. Coupled with this was a very marked increase in exonucleolytic products (&lt;25mer) on all templates by comparison with Pol Î´4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and D). This increase in formation of exonucleolytic products on these model templates is indicative of increased proofreading or idling reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p>
        <p>These findings are highly significant, as they indicate that Pol Î´ activity is profoundly altered by the loss of the p12 subunit. Pol Î´3 exhibited a markedly increased production of exonucleolytic products, a marked increase in intermediate products that indicated a tendency for stalling, and was less effective in the bypass of template lesions.</p>

        <title>TLS synthesis by recombinant Pol Î´ enzymes</title>
        <p>In order to obtain rigorous confirmation of the findings made with the HeLa Pol Î´ enzymes and to further investigate the alterations in Pol Î´3 activity, we turned to the use of recombinant human Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 purified to near-homogeneity (âMaterials and methodsâ section). Their activities on lesion-containing templates were examined under the same conditions as for the HeLa enzymes, except that higher enzyme concentrations were used (4, 20 and 100 nM). We also included a template with the 8-oxoG lesion, which is highly mutagenic as it leads to insertion of both C and A to generate G:A mispairs that result in G:T transversion mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). 8-oxoG has also been shown to be bypassed by calf thymus Pol Î´ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p>
        <p>Recombinant Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 behaved in the same way as the HeLa enzymes. Pol Î´3 produced more exonucleolytic products than Pol Î´4 on all the templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B). Pol Î´3 produced fewer extension products than Pol Î´4 on the unmodified and the O<sup>6</sup>-MeG and 8-oxoG templates, as can be seen from the examination of the products formed at the two lower enzyme concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B) and also in the graphical plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D and E). With the higher enzyme concentrations, most of the primer was extended, so that changes were less obvious. The amounts of full-length extension products produced by 4 nM Pol Î´4 on the unmodified, O<sup>6</sup>-Me-G, and 8-oxoG templates were 27, 17 and 8.3%, respectively, and those produced by Pol Î´3 were 5.9, 2.5 and 2.4%, respectively. The results obtained for the 8-oxoG template were very similar to those obtained for the O<sup>6</sup>-MeG template. Pol Î´3 did not bypass the AP lesion, and the amounts of P+1 or full-length product were negligible even at 100 nM enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and E). In contrast, Pol Î´4 was able to extend most of the primer past the AP lesion to the full-length product at 100 nM enzyme concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and D).

        <title>Analysis of the bypass of the AP lesion by exonuclease-deficient mutants of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3</title>
        <p>Exonuclease-deficient forms of Pol Î´ were obtained by mutation of the p125 subunit (see âMaterials and methodsâ section). Examination of the bypass of the AP template by wt and exonuclease-deficient Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 revealed that the exonuclease activity plays a key role in the differences in product formation on the AP template that were observed. There was an increased accumulation of the P+1 product, and a increased formation of the full-length 40-mer by Pol Î´4<sup>exoâ</sup> when compared to wt Pol Î´4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Quantitation of the amounts of P+1 and 40-mer products formed by Pol Î´4<sup>exoâ</sup> showed that the amounts of P+1 initially increased, then decreased with increasing enzyme concentration as the accumulating P+1 products were extended to the full-length 40-mer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). At 100 nM enzyme, most of the P+1 product was extended to the full length 40-mer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, and C).
<fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Bypass synthesis on AP containing templates by wt and exonuclease-deficient forms of Pol Î´. The recombinant Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 enzymes containing the D402A mutants in the p125 subunit were used (see âMaterials and methodsâ section). These exonuclease-deficient forms of Pol Î´ were assayed for their abilities to bypass the AP lesion as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; enzyme concentrations were 0, 4, 20 and 100 nM. (<bold>A, B</bold>) Phosphorimages of the reaction products produced by Pol Î´4<sup>exoâ</sup> and Pol Î´3<sup>exoâ</sup>, respectively.

        <p>In the case of Pol Î´3, very little P+1 product was seen with the wt enzyme. Loss of the exonuclease activity now allowed the accumulation of the P+1 product, and a small amount of full-length product was now observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Quantitation of the P+1 and 40-mer products formed by Pol Î´3<sup>exoâ</sup> showed that P+1 levels continued to rise with increasing enzyme concentration, to a level of <italic>ca</italic>. 60% of the starting primer at 100 nM enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Thus, apparent absence of the P+1 product with the wild-type Pol Î´3 can be attributed to its more rapid removal by the exonuclease activity. In addition, since Pol Î´3 <sup>exoâ</sup> was much less able to extend the P+1 product than Pol Î´4 <sup>exoâ</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D) so it can be concluded that there is an altered behavior of the polymerase activity <italic>per se</italic>. Thus, the analyses of the exonuclease-deficient mutants provide evidence that the altered behavior of Pol Î´3 when it encounters base lesions are due to alterations in the polymerase activity, in addition to the observed increase in proofreading.</p>
        <p>The experiments described above provide an analysis of the accumulation of products generated by the combined actions of the polymerase and exonuclease activities as a function of enzyme concentration. In order to examine the rates of formation of extended primers we carried out time-course experiments and determined the rates of formation of extended primers for Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 as well for their exonuclease-deficient forms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The data were normalized to the activity of each enzyme on the unmodified template. This analysis allowed for a comparison of the activities of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 on the O<sup>6</sup>-MeG and 8-oxoG templates. Pol Î´4 exhibited lower rates of activity on these templates by comparison with the unmodified template, both in terms of total product formation and formation of the full-length 40-mer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, first column). Pol Î´3 also exhibited lower rates with the O<sup>6</sup>-MeG and 8-oxoG templates when compared to the unmodified template, but in both instances the rates were significantly slower by comparison with the data for Pol Î´4. These results indicate that Pol Î´3 bypasses these two template lesions more slowly than does Pol Î´4.

        <p>Loss of the exonuclease activity did not greatly affect the relative rates for bypass of the O<sup>6</sup>-MeG and 8-oxoG templates by Pol Î´4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, first and third columns). A similar observation was made when Pol Î´3 was compared to Pol Î´3<sup>exoâ</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, second and fourth columns), except for the O<sup>6</sup>-MeG template where the rate was almost doubled for Pol Î´3<sup>exoâ</sup>. These findings were surprising, given the evidence for increased levels of exonucleolytic products by Pol Î´3, so that one might have expected greater increases. However, in this type of assay, these rates do not directly measure total nucleotide incorporation but conversion of the primer to extended products. Also, these experiments may point to alterations in the polymerase activities that in turn could also alter proofreading rates. A more detailed kinetic analysis of the activities on these templates will be required to determine the true rates of nucleotide incorporation.</p>
        <p>For the AP template, we examined the rates of formation of the P+1 product as well as for the total and full-length products. The formation of the full-length product by Pol Î´3 was 16-fold slower than by Pol Î´4, and the formation of the P+1 product was 5-fold slower (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This is consistent with the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, which shows that Pol Î´3 does not readily bypass the AP lesion or accumulate the P+1 product. The rates of formation of products by Pol Î´4<sup>exoâ</sup> were faster than those of Pol Î´4, by <italic>ca</italic>. 2-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, columns 1 and 3). In the case of Pol Î´3<sup>exo,â</sup> similar increases in rates were observed by comparison to Pol Î´3, except for formation of the P+1 product which was increased by &gt;5-fold. These data support the view that faster removal of the P+1 product by the exonuclease is an important factor in the low accumulation of the P+1 product by Pol Î´3 when compared to Pol Î´4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Pol Î´3 has a higher exonuclease activity than Pol Î´4</title>
        <p>As already noted, a striking difference in Pol Î´3 is the evidence for increased proofreading activity, as evidenced by the increased levels of exonucleolytic products. We compared the exonuclease activities of Pol Î´3 and Pol Î´4 by determining their activities under steady-state conditions on ssDNA and dsDNA oligonucleotide substrates. Product formation time courses with ssDNA and dsDNA substrates revealed that Pol Î´3 has a 1.9-fold higher exonuclease specific activity compared to Pol Î´4 on a ssDNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) and a 1.8-fold higher specific activity on a dsDNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). These findings show for the first time that loss of the p12 subunit affects the exonuclease activity of the Pol Î´. In addition, assays of polymerase activity in the standard assay on poly(dA)/oligo(dT) template/primer shows that Pol Î´4 has approximately twice the specific activity of Pol Î´3 (see âMaterials and methodsâ section). Thus, Pol Î´3 exhibits an increase in the ratio of exonuclease to polymerase ratio of <italic>ca</italic>. 4-fold compared to Pol Î´4.

        <title>Pol Î´3 is less likely than Pol Î´4 to insert an incorrectly base-paired nucleotide</title>
        <p>The behavior of Pol Î´3 when it attempts to synthesize DNA past template lesions suggested that Pol Î´3 might also be less likely to insert wrong nucleotides than Pol Î´4. The tendencies of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 to incorporate the wrong nucleotides (misincorporation) were compared in the single nucleotide incorporation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The unmodified 25-mer/40-mer primer/template was used, and the correct (dCTP) and incorrect nucleotides (dATP, dTTP and dGTP) were supplied individually at a high concentration of 500 Î¼M (see âMaterials and methodsâ section).

        <p>The observed behaviors of Pol Î´3 on templates containing lesions and in the single nucleotide assay could be due to a more active proofreading activity. The latter does not necessarily imply an increased intrinsic 3â² to 5â²exonuclease activity, since decreases in insertion rates at the pol site can form a kinetic barrier that favors translocation of the primer from the pol to the exo site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). We therefore compared the Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 exonuclease-deficient mutants in the single nucleotide incorporation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). Quantitation of the amounts of misincorporation products show that Pol Î´3<sup>exoâ</sup> has a reduced tendency to insert the wrong nucleotide when compared to Pol Î´4<sup>exoâ</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D).

        <title>Pol Î´3 is less likely to extend a mismatched primer than Pol Î´4</title>
        <p>We next compared the ability of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 to extend a primer in which the 3â²nucleotide is mismatched, i.e. does not form a WatsonâCrick base pair with the template. In this âmismatch extensionâ assay, the same template used above was annealed to a 26-mer primer with an additional 3â² T, such that a T:G mismatch was formed, and only dGTP, which could correctly base pair with the next template base, was provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Pol Î´3 had a decreased rate of extension of the mismatched primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D) and an increased rate of formation of excision products when compared to Pol Î´4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E). Analysis of the slopes of the linear portions of the time courses for incorporation showed that Pol Î´3 extended the mismatched primer 6.5-fold more slowly and degraded the mismatched primer 3.1-fold faster than Pol Î´4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D and E). Thus, the ratio of excision/extension rates by Pol Î´3 can be calculated to be 19-fold greater than that of Pol Î´4. These findings show that Pol Î´3 is less likely to extend a mismatched primer, and the altered balance of excision and extension product formation is in keeping with an interpretation that it is more active in proofreading.

        <p>The exo<sup>â</sup> forms of Pol Î´ were examined in the mismatch extension assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A and B). Pol Î´3<sup>exo<sup>â</sup></sup> extended the mismatched primer terminus at about half the rate of Pol Î´4<sup>exoâ</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). This result demonstrates that polymerase activity of Pol Î´3 is less likely than Pol Î´4 to extend a mismatched primer terminus. These findings show that alterations in polymerase activity <italic>per se</italic> are involved in the reduced tendency of Pol Î´3 for mismatch extension, and are consistent with the results obtained in the single nucleotide insertion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).

        <title>Activities of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 on a template containing a thymineâthymine dimer</title>
        <p>The activities of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 were compared on a 25-mer primer annealed to a 40-mer template containing a thymineâthymine CPD (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer), the major lesion produced by UV damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Pol Î· was also assayed for comparison, as it readily bypasses thymineâthymine dimers, with a preference for the insertion of two As opposite the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Pol Î· readily bypassed the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A, two left panels). Pol Î´4 was able to insert a single nucleotide to form the 26-mer, but only weakly extended the primer to the full-length product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A). Thus, the CPD forms a stronger barrier to Pol Î´4 than does the AP lesion (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Pol Î´3 did not produce significant amounts of product on the CPD template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A). Both Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 produced exonucleolytic products when blocked at the CPD lesion, with Pol Î´3 producing more products than Pol Î´4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A).

The abilities of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 to extend primers on a template containing a thymineâthymine dimer (CPD) were examined. The template used was a 40-mer containing a thymineâthymine dimer at nts 26 and 27. The primers used were a 25-mer primer, two 26-mer primers that had an added A (â26Aâ) or G (â26Gâ) at position 26, and two 27-mer primers that had two added As (27AAâ) or Gs (â27GGâ) (see âMaterials and methodsâ section). (<bold>A</bold>) Phosphorimage of the reaction products formed on a template containing a thymineâthymine dimer. DNA polymerases (4, 20 and 100 nM) were incubated with 500 Î¼M dNTPs, 400-nM PCNA, 100-nM 25-mer end-labeled primer annealed to the unmodified (âUnâ) template or with the CPD template as indicated.

Assays were performed for 5 min. (<bold>C</bold>). Pol Î·, Pol Î´4 or Pol Î´3 were assayed as in B using the 27GG or 27AA primers annealed to the 40-mer template containing the thymineâthymine dimer as shown above the phosphorimage. (<bold>D</bold>) The rate of exonucleolytic cleavage of the 26A and 26G primers by Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 were assayed as in (B).

The amounts of the 26-mers remaining at each time point was determined, were plotted against time and fitted into a single exponential decay equation to obtain the rate constant of 26-mer disappearance. The values were normalized to the rate for Pol Î´4 activity on the 26A primer. Values for Pol Î´4 are shown by the shaded bars and for Pol Î´3 by the solid bars. (<bold>E</bold>). The rate of exonucleolytic cleavage of the 27AA and 27GG primers annealed to the 40-mer template containing a CPD lesion by Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 were assayed and plotted as described in D. The values were normalized to the rate for Pol Î´4 activity on the 26A primer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn1000f9"/></fig></p>
        <p>Next, we used 26-mer primers with an added A or G, and 27-mer primers with two As or Gs added to the 25-mer. These primers would present paired or mispaired primer termini opposite the 5â² and 3â² thymidines of the CPD. Pol Î· poorly extends primers with bases other than A opposite the 3â² and the 5â² thymidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). These primers were used to assess the comparative rates at which Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3 degraded these primers, since it has been suggested that Pol Î´ may function to provide extrinsic exonucleolytic proofreading for Pol Î· (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Pol Î´3 degraded most of the 26-mer to the 25-mer, while much less cleavage was evident with Pol Î´4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). Neither primer was significantly extended by either enzyme. Similar results were found with the 27-mer primers, where most of the 27-mer was degraded to the 25-mer by Pol Î´3, while only partial degradation was observed with Pol Î´4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C), and neither Pol Î´4 nor Pol Î´3 extended the primers. In order to compare the rates of exonucleolytic cleavage of the 26-mer and 27-mer primers, time course experiments were performed, and the relative rates of exonucleolytic cleavage of the primers were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>D and E). Pol Î´3 degraded the mismatched 5â² G more rapidly than A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>D), but did not discriminate between the 27-mer primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>E). In all cases, Pol Î´3 cleaved the primers between 2- and 4-fold faster than Pol Î´4. Thus, with these substrates, Pol Î´3 was more efficient than Pol Î´4 at removal of bases that were opposite the CPD lesion.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Our studies provide new information regarding the properties of human Pol Î´3. Pol Î´3 has a reduced ability for TLS bypass synthesis, and exhibits an increased proofreading activity, as indicated by the increased production of exonucleolytic products. Analyses using the single nucleotide incorporation assays showed that Pol Î´3 is less likely to insert an incorrect nucleotide and is less likely to extend a mismatched primer. Pol Î´3 exhibited a higher ratio of exonuclease to polymerase activity than Pol Î´4 that is consistent with an increased proofreading activity. The importance of the exonuclease activity is clearly observed in the products formed on the AP template, where significant levels of the P+1 product were only observed when the exonuclease activity of Pol Î´3 was inactivated. Analyses of the exo- mutants showed that alterations the polymerase activity of Pol Î´3 are also involved. These analyses indicate that Pol Î´3 is altered in such a way that it displays attributes of increased fidelity (in a biochemical context). These biochemical properties imply that Pol Î´3 may have the ability to synthesize DNA with a greater fidelity than Pol Î´4. This possibility needs to be confirmed by experimental approaches that will allow direct comparison of the error rates of Pol Î´4 and Pol Î´3, both by <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches. The loss of p12 <italic>in vivo</italic> can be regarded as an example of enzyme regulation by alteration of quaternary structure, and the increased ability of Pol Î´3 to detect DNA damage can be viewed as a gain of function over Pol Î´4. The present findings that Pol Î´3 exhibits properties consistent with a greater ability to recognize template lesions, and a reduced proclivity for misincorporation and mismatch extension, provides <italic>prima facie</italic> support for the hypothesis that the conversion of Pol Î´4 to Pol Î´3 represents an adaptation that could be beneficial to cells undergoing genotoxic insult.</p>
      <p>There are several possible explanations for the mechanistic basis for the changes that were observed in Pol Î´3. Our findings that Pol Î´3 exhibits altered steady-state ratios of exo/pol activity indicate that the loss of p12 must alter the catalytic site of the p125 subunit. We found that Pol Î´3 exhibited an increased steady exonuclease activity, and an increased exonuclease/polymerase ratio, which would be expected to favor proofreading activity. However, the increased exonucleolytic behavior of Pol Î´3 could be induced by changes in the functioning of the polymerase catalytic site alone. This possibility is supported by our analyses of the exonuclease-deficient mutants, which show that Pol Î´3<sup>exoâ</sup> exhibits lowered rates of misincorporation and mismatch extension. This would result in an increased kinetic barrier, i.e. an increased probability for translocation of DNA from the pol to the exo sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). There could also be alterations in the rates of translocation between the pol and exo sites, or changes in the kinetic properties of the exonuclease itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Further studies using detailed kinetic analyses will be required to determine the mechanistic basis for these alterations. Taken together, our findings suggest that Pol Î´3 exhibits an increased ability to discriminate against aberrant primer/template structures. Crystallographic studies of replicative polymerase interactions with a variety of primer/template lesions, in particular those of the RB69 polymerase, have provided a greater understanding of how aberrant primer/template structures interact with polymerase catalytic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). From a structural perspective, we can infer that loss of p12 may alter the geometry of the Pol Î´ active site, or alter its ability to undergo the large conformational changes that take place during catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3â5</xref>). It is noted that p12 interacts with both the p125 and p50 subunits that form the core enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p>
      <p>There are a number of potential implications of the alterations that we observed in Pol Î´3 besides the obvious possibility that the potential for error introduction may be reduced. Pol Î´ participates in a number of DNA transactions that include both DNA replication and repair processes which may also be impacted when its properties are altered. Reduction in activity and or processivity of Pol Î´ may be relevant to recent evidence for an elongation checkpoint that involves slowing of replication fork progression following DNA damage by UV or alkylating agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The mechanism for this is unknown, but it is relevant that Pol Î´3 exhibits an impaired activity when assayed on a singly primed ssM13 DNA in an assay which also requires PCNA, its clamp-loader RFC, and RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p>
      <p>The increased tendency for stalling by Pol Î´3 may be relevant to two processes that are involved in the DNA damage response. Polymerase stalling on encounter with DNA lesions results in formation of ssDNA that triggers ATR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), and activation of the DNA damage tolerance response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). An increased tendency to stall at template lesions may promote the activation of checkpoint responses. Current models for TLS bypass involve a polymerase switch between a TLS polymerase and Pol Î´ that takes place on mono-ubiquitinated PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), and this may involve Pol Î´3 rather than Pol Î´4. The polymerase switch between yeast Pol Î´ and Pol Î· has been shown to require the stalling of Pol Î´ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p>
      <p>The increase in the exonucleolytic behavior of Pol Î´3 may be relevant to its proposed functions as an extrinsic proofreading exonuclease for the error prone TLS polymerases, e.g. in the bypass of thymineâthymine dimers by yeast Pol Î´ and Pol Î· (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The increased exonuclease activity of Pol Î´, its increased idling behavior on encounter with base lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), and its greater tendency for excision of bases opposite AP and CPD lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) would represent positive adaptations for the purpose of extrinsic proofreading.</p>
      <p>In summary, our studies provide evidence that the p12 subunit plays a significant role in the catalytic functions of Pol Î´. Pol Î´3 possesses altered properties that provide support for the hypothesis that the conversion of Pol Î´4 to Pol Î´3 may represent an adaptive response that contributes to the DNA damage response. Our findings also raise issues whose further investigation may add to our understanding of the DNA damage response.</p>
