      <abstract>
        <p>Leucine zippers are oligomerization domains used in a wide range of proteins. Their structure is based on a highly conserved heptad repeat sequence in which two key positions are occupied by leucines. The leucine zipper of the cell cycle-regulated Nek2 kinase is important for its dimerization and activation. However, the sequence of this leucine zipper is most unusual in that leucines occupy only one of the two hydrophobic positions. The other position, depending on the register of the heptad repeat, is occupied by either acidic or basic residues. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that this leucine zipper exists in two conformations of almost equal population that exchange with a rate of 17 s<sup>â1</sup>. We propose that the two conformations correspond to the two possible registers of the heptad repeat. This hypothesis is supported by a cysteine mutant that locks the protein in one of the two conformations. NMR spectra of this mutant showed the predicted 2-fold reduction of peaks in the <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum and the complete removal of cross peaks in exchange spectra. It is possible that interconversion of these two conformations may be triggered by external signals in a manner similar to that proposed recently for the microtubule binding domain of dynein and the HAMP domain. As a result, the leucine zipper of Nek2 kinase is the first example where the frameshift of coiled-coil heptad repeats has been directly observed experimentally.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracellular signaling pathways that regulate processes such as cell cycle control rely on formation of specific protein complexes at the right time and place. As a result, a wide range of conserved interaction motifs have evolved among which the leucine zipper is one of the most common and versatile. Leucine zippers were first identified as dimerization domains in bZIP transcription factors with a sequence motif consisting of leucines repeated every 7 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The relevance of the repeating heptad sequence was clarified when it was shown that leucine zippers assume a coiled-coil fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In this structure, the first and fourth residues (<italic>i.e.</italic> positions A and D in the heptad sequence, ABCDEFG) of each helix point toward each other and thus form a hydrophobic core. Residues in positions E and G flank the hydrophobic core residues and are often occupied by charged residues that can form salt bridges. The latter are of particular significance in heterodimeric leucine zippers as they help to determine specificity. Residues in positions B, C, and F are usually not of importance as their side-chains point away from the coiled-coil interface. Leucine zippers show great versatility as they can exist as dimers, trimers, or tetramers, can be homo- or hetero-oligomers and can form parallel or anti-parallel complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Although leucine zippers have been best characterized in transcription factors, they also exist in many other signaling proteins including protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Protein kinase activation often involves a trans-autophosphorylation step that is facilitated by the physical proximity of two kinase molecules. In the case of receptor tyrosine kinases, this may be brought about by crosslinking of two receptors as a result of extracellular ligand binding. Some cytoplasmic kinases on the other hand contain their own oligomerization domain. One example is the cell cycle-regulated kinase, Nek2, which consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal region that contains multiple regulatory motifs, including a leucine zipper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). For this kinase, oligomerization via the leucine zipper is essential for full activation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, most likely as a result of it promoting trans-autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study on the role of the Nek2 leucine zipper, we noted that the sequence, in terms of the distribution of hydrophobic and charged residues, is somewhat unusual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, no structural studies were undertaken at the time. Here, we now show that the Nek2 leucine zipper does indeed display highly atypical biophysical properties with NMR spectroscopy clearly showing that the leucine zipper exists in two conformations, which exchange on a relatively slow timescale. This raises the intriguing possibility that the dimerization and, as a result, activation of the Nek2 kinase may be subject to specific regulation. It is also the first time that the exchange of a coiled-coil domain, indirectly inferred for several completely unrelated proteins, has been directly observed experimentally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Sequence Analysis</title><p>Domain definitions for Nek2 kinase were taken from annotations of entry P51955 from the Uniprot database with small modifications for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>.

The helical wheel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic> was initially generated using the EMBOSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) application pepwheel and then adapted to incorporate the two heptad repeats.</p></sec><sec><title>Limited Proteolysis</title><p>SDS-PAGE analysis was performed following a 1:500 trypsin:target (w/w) incubation at 25 Â°C. Aliquots were withdrawn at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min. The reaction for each time point was immediately halted by the addition of Pefabloc SC (2 m<sc>m</sc> final) and PSC protector solution (5% v/v final) from Roche. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was obtained from Promega. To identify the protected fragments, a 60-min limited digest was performed, as above, and the products separated by reverse-phase chromatography using a JASCO HPLC and a 4.5 ml Zorbex stable bond 300 C3 column at 1 ml/min heated to 55 Â°C. The column was developed with 5â50% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) pH 1.8 at 1% acetonitrile/min. Peaks were collected in 0.5-ml fractions and monitored at 280, 220, and 210 nm wavelengths. The fractions were analyzed by standard electrospray MS procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Mass Spectrometry</title><p>Protein molecular weight was determined using a stand-alone syringe pump (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA) coupled to a Platform electrospray mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK).

Proteins were injected onto the column in 10% acetonitrile, 0.10% formic acid, washed with the same solvent and then step-eluted into the mass spectrometer in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 10 Î¼l/min. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using myoglobin. Standard samples comprised of 100 pmol of protein at a minimum concentration of 1 Î¼<sc>m</sc>.</p></sec><sec><title>Construct Generation</title><p>All protein expression constructs were cloned into pETM-11 vectors obtained from the Protein Expression Laboratory at EMBL Heidelberg.

Primers for constructs LZ0 and LZ5 were LZ05â²: GGAGCGCCCATGGCGCGACAATTAGGAGAG; LZ03â²: GGATCCTTATAGCAAGCTGTAGTTCTTCACAGATTTTCTGC; LZ55â²: GCGCCCATGGCGGTATTGAGTGAGCTGAAACTG; LZ53â²: GGATCCTTAGTCCTCTGCTAGTCTCTCACG, respectively. PCR products were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified PCR products and pETM-11 target vector DNA were double digested with NcoI and BamHI. The product of the vector digestion was purified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel (analytical quality, Melford Labs). DNA was extracted from excised bands using the QIAquick gel extraction kit. 50 ng of gel purified digestion product from the vector and 150 ng of digested PCR product were mixed and ligated using the rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche). 1/10 of the ligation reaction was transformed into 100 Î¼l DH5a-T1R chemical competent cells (Invitrogen).

Accuracy of vector and insert was checked by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein Expression and Purification</title><p>For protein expression, miniprep DNA was transformed into BL21* cells (Invitrogen). Transformed cells were grown up in LB medium to OD â¼0.8 when they were induced with 0.75 m<sc>m</sc> IPTG for 4 h. For <sup>15</sup>N isotope labeling the protocol was modified as suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Cells were opened using a French Press cell at 1000 psi. The proteins were purified on fast flow 6 (GE Healthcare) columns of 2 ml resin, equilibrated as per the manufacturer's instructions. After loading the samples, the columns were washed with 30 ml of wash buffer (20 m<sc>m</sc> phosphate pH 7.5, 500 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 10 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, 1 m<sc>m</sc> Î²-ME, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>) before elution with 10 ml of elution buffer (as wash buffer, but with 500 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole). The eluted protein was incubated with AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature followed by dialysis 3Ã against 1 liter of fast flow 6 wash buffer. The protein solution was applied a second time to the affinity column to remove nonspecific binding proteins. Where required, a final polishing step using a Sephadex 16/70 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) was performed using an AKTA purification system. Fractions containing the pure protein were pooled and concentrated in Vivaspin concentrators (Sartorius) with 3 kDa molecular mass cut-off. Protein concentrations were determined using the Qbit fluorescence assay (Invitrogen). Protein samples were exchanged into NMR buffer (20 m<sc>m</sc> sodium phosphate, 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, pH 7.0, 2 m<sc>m</sc> DTT, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>) using PD10 or Nap5 columns (GE Healthcare), which were also used for all other experiments. The only exceptions were samples of disulfide locked LZ5 K309C/C335A, LZ5 E310C/C335A, and LZ0 K309C/C335A for which DTT was omitted from the buffer.</p><p>CD spectroscopy. All CD experiments were recorded on a JASCO700 instrument fitted with a Peltier temperature control system. Square cuvettes with 0.1 or 1 mm path length were used with protein concentrations ranging from 20â200 Î¼<sc>m</sc>. Spectra were calibrated using software provided by the manufacturer. Secondary structure content was estimated using home written Mathematica (Wolfram Research) macros by comparison to standard curves for Î±-helix, Î²-sheet, and random coil. To measure thermal unfolding curves, samples were heated at 1 Â°C/min while the CD signal at a constant wavelength of 222 nm was measured.

The leucine zipper is defined by the presence of leucine residues every 7 amino acids. However, in the conventional heptad repeat of a leucine zipper, a second position is also occupied by another leucine or equally compatible hydrophobic residue such that, in the repeating heptad ABCDEFG, positions A and D would normally both be occupied by hydrophobic residues. In Nek2, though, one of these hydrophobic positions is missing, such that the heptad pattern can be positioned in two ways: the leucines can be in the A-position (heptad I) or in the <sc>d</sc>-position (heptad II). It is traditionally thought that leucine prefers the <sc>d</sc>-position, but the energetic contribution to coiled-coil stability and the frequency by which leucine is found in either position in leucine zipper sequences are very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Regardless of the positions of the heptad repeats in Nek2, charged residues would occupy the second conserved position. In heptad I, it would be lysine or arginine in the D position, while in heptad II, it would be glutamate in the A position. Curiously, lysine and arginine in general prefer the A position while glutamate prefers the D position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Even though charged residues have been found in the hydrophobic core of other coiled-coils, <italic>e.g.</italic> myosin, they compromise the stability and make the Nek2 leucine zipper a non-ideal coiled-coil. It is interesting to note the consistent occupation of the normally hydrophobic A and D positions by charged residues in the leucine zipper of Nek2. Of the 6 A positions in heptad II, 5 are occupied by glutamate (the first is occupied by a leucine), while in the case of heptad I, lysine and arginine each take 3 of the 6 D positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).

Thus, the exchange is not a result of unfolding events.</p></sec><sec><title>Probing the Leucine Zipper Conformational Exchange by Site-directed Mutagenesis</title><p>The existence of two conformations in all recombinant versions of the leucine zipper made interpretation of NMR spectra very difficult. This was due, firstly, to extensive overlap of peaks: the chemical shift dispersion of coiled-coils is notoriously poor and so was made worse by having two highly similar versions of the same protein in the sample. Furthermore, although the chemical exchange is slow on the chemical shift time scale, it is very close to the transition region toward intermediate exchange. As a result, both longitudinal and transversal relaxation rates of protons and nitrogens are significantly accelerated, making the recording of complex three-dimensional experiments required for sequence specific assignment and structure calculation virtually impossible.</p><p>It was therefore decided to employ site-directed mutagenesis to probe the LZ structure and dynamics. For this, we hypothesized that the conformational dynamics might result from exchange between the two alternative heptad repeats described earlier (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). To test this hypothesis, individual arginine/lysine or glutamate positions in the 2nd or 3rd heptad repeats were mutated to cysteine. The intrinsic cysteine of the leucine zipper, Cys-335, was replaced by alanine to avoid interference. Assuming that the Nek2 leucine zipper folds as a parallel coiled-coil, a disulfide bridge can form between cysteines in either the A-position (mutation from glutamate) or the D-position (mutation from lysine/arginine) once the sample is in non-reducing buffer. Disulfide bonds in coiled-coils have been observed to occur naturally, <italic>e.g.</italic> in myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and were shown to contribute to the stability of the coiled-coil in synthetic leucine zippers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>Based on this hypothesis, one would predict that a glutamate to cysteine or lysine/arginine to cysteine mutant under non-reducing conditions should exist in only one conformation and should not exchange. Should it be possible to obtain NMR spectra of conformationally âlockedâ mutants then, at least in general, it should be possible to reconstruct the spectrum of the wild-type protein from the spectra of one pair of cysteine mutants, representing the heptad I or heptad II conformation. Initially, experiments were attempted with an LZ5-E310C/C335A mutant that should lock the protein in the heptad II conformation with the acidic residues in the A position. However, CD spectra showed only a modest amount of Î±-helix at lower temperatures, regardless of the oxidation state of the buffer, while AUC data of this mutant could not be interpreted and <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra were even more complex than those obtained with the wild-type protein (data not shown). All of these data suggest that the mutant is unfolded or at best only partially folded.</p><p>We therefore prepared an LZ5-K309C/C335A mutant to lock the heptad I conformation with the basic residues in the D position. A preliminary analysis of this mutant by CD showed that oxidation of the cysteines to form the expected disulfide bond led to a substantial increase in the Î±-helix content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). This reflects the fact that a reduced cysteine in position D destabilizes the leucine zipper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The reduced form also had a much lower stability compared with the oxidized form as illustrated by the thermal unfolding characteristics. The melting temperature of the reduced form was around 27 Â°C, while the oxidized form melted at 55 Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>). While the CD experiments did not provide information on the protein dynamics, they did suggest that the mutated protein folds into a parallel coiled-coil. This was supported by AUC sedimentation velocity data indicating the existence of a dimer in non-reducing buffer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic> shows the c(s) distributions for LZ5 and the double mutant K309C/C335A in reducing and non-reducing conditions.

It was apparent that the total number of peaks was significantly less than in a spectrum of wild-type LZ5. Automatic peak picking produced a total of just over 40 peaks, very close to the predicted number of 45. This suggests that this sample contained only a single conformation of the leucine zipper. A direct comparison of the C335A and K309C/C335A mutants of LZ5 revealed the similarity of the spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.196972/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>). In the resolved region on the left, it was particularly apparent that, as predicted, one peak of an exchanging pair (indicated by brackets) vanished leaving only its partner behind. It was apparent that the peaks were much sharper than in the HSQC of the wild-type protein, also hinting at a significant change in the dynamics of the protein. This observation was confirmed by a NOESY-type exchange experiment which had no exchange cross peaks at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). The good quality of the spectra allowed us to obtain an almost complete backbone and partial side chain assignment (deposited with the BMRB, accession code <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="17417">17417</ext-link>). This was used to collect an extensive set of secondary structure specific proton-proton distances which support the well defined helical structure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.196972/DC1">supplemental Fig. S6</ext-link>). In addition, <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N residual dipolar couplings were recorded and compared with RDC values calculated for models created for both conformers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>.

Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that the LZ5 K309C/C335A mutant represents one of the conformers observed for the wild type leucine zipper.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>NMR spectra of the LZ5 K309C/C335A mutant.</bold> <italic>A</italic>, <sup>15</sup>N HSQC of LZ5-K309C/C335A, oxidized, <italic>T</italic> = 298K. <italic>B</italic>, same as in <italic>A</italic> superimposed on the spectrum of wild-type LZ5.

This exchange was observed regardless of construct, sample or any other experimental conditions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.196972/DC1">supplemental Fig. S4â6</ext-link>) so that it cannot be dismissed as an artifact but has to be seen as a genuine property of the isolated domain that may well hold true for the full-length kinase <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Examples of dynamics in leucine zippers based on experimental data are few and far between. A modest level of dynamics, albeit fast on the chemical shift timescale, was inferred from a comparison of the NMR data with the crystal structure of the first well characterized leucine zipper, GCN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and similar observations were made in the leucine zipper of c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). These were based on the presence of an asymmetric conformation of a central asparagine in the crystal structure while only a single signal was seen in the NMR spectra suggesting fast averaging in solution.</p><p>Slow chemical exchange between folded conformations for a protein involving a leucine zipper was only ever observed once, in the case of the tetramerization domain of the Mnt repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The tetrameric leucine zipper exists in two different conformations which are generated by a staggered assembly of two coiled-coil dimers that are packed into a distorted four helical coiled-coil. Such a complex assembly is well beyond the capabilities of the small dimeric Nek2 leucine zipper.</p><p>The best explanation for the unusual dynamics of the Nek2 leucine zipper would therefore seem to be the existence of two coiled-coils based on a shift in the heptad register (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>) where the charged side chains in the A/D positions minimize adverse interactions by extending outside the hydrophobic core with their charged groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>). Determination of the structure by experimental methods is very challenging and efforts to crystallize the protein may well fail as a result of these inherent dynamics. Also standard NMR methods cannot be used to obtain structural information because of the detrimental effects caused by the exchange rate of 17 s<sup>â1</sup>. Even though it is slow on the chemical shift timescale, it is still sufficiently fast to have detrimental effects in NMR experiments. As a consequence it is impossible to record triple resonance three-dimensional experiments required for complete assignments.</p><p>We were therefore forced to use an indirect approach based on its unusual sequence to investigate the dynamics of the Nek2 leucine zipper. As this sequence contained only one leucine every seven amino acids, there were two ways of positioning the heptad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref><italic>A</italic>). In essence, both heptads satisfied the definition of a leucine zipper albeit with charged residues in places normally occupied by hydrophobic amino acids. A similar arrangement has been previously described in the myosin coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), where polar residues in these positions have long side chains so that the charged group is at least partly solvent accessible, while the long aliphatic portion can make some contribution to the hydrophobic core as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>. The downside of such an arrangement is unfavorable side chain torsion angles that compromise the stability of such leucine zippers.</p><p>To provide experimental proof for the two heptad hypothesis we decided to lock the protein in one of the two conformations using a disulfide bond. Two mutants were generated in LZ5, K309C to lock heptad I and E310C to lock heptad II, both as double mutants with C335A to avoid interference. Mutant K309C/C335A in non-reducing buffer performed very much as expected: it stopped the exchange and reduced the number of peaks in the HSQC to that expected for a simple leucine zipper. Moreover, the line widths of the peaks were now more consistent with proteins of this molecular weight. The fact that these peaks did not exactly match the peaks in the wild type spectrum can be explained by the presence of a double mutant and the significant changes in environment introduced by the disulfide bond. A similar, though less apparent, effect of the formation of the disulfide bond in the K309C/C335A double mutant was also seen in LZ0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.196972/DC1">supplemental Fig. S6</ext-link>). In addition to supporting our assumption that the K309C/A335C mutant represents the HepI conformation this result provides indirect evidence for the distinct charge distribution on the surface of the two conformers. Their overall shape is virtually identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>) so that not much of a difference could be expected if their alignment was purely steric. Using pf1 phage as alignment medium, however, means that the alignment is strongly driven by electrostatic interactions, which allows to differentiate the two different conformers as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, mutant E310C/C335A did not give a clear cut result in agreement with previous results. The disulfide bond for residue Cys-310 would be in the A position which was shown to be destabilizing rather than stabilizing unless located right at the N or C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). As the Nek2 leucine zipper is already less than ideal, the modest destabilization by a disulfide bond in the A position could compromise the entire structure.</p><p>While it would be preferable to have at least one mutant to lock each conformation, we believe that these data are sufficient to provide support for the hypothesis that the slow exchange seen in the NMR spectra of the Nek2 leucine zipper results from the interconversion of the two possible heptad arrangements. The actual conformational change would be a simple rotation of each helix by â¼20Â° about its long axis. The relationship between degree of structural change required and time scale of exchange matches well the two examples in the literature: the rearrangement in the Mnt tetramerization domain is substantial which is reflected in the slow exchange rate (1 s<sup>â1</sup>) when compared with the Nek2 leucine zipper (17 s<sup>â1</sup>), which in turn is much slower than the simple rotation of the asparagine side chain in GCN4 and c-Jun, which happens on a fast timescale (&gt;1000 s<sup>â1</sup>).</p><p>The populations of the two conformations as judged by the peak intensities in the HSQC spectra is not far from 50:50, suggesting that the exchange, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, does not serve to shift the equilibrium toward one or other of the conformations. Nevertheless, the surfaces, in particular the charge distribution, of both conformations are very different: heptad I has a highly positive charge density in the center and negative charges on the edges, while heptad II has negative charges on the inside and positive charges on the ridges, indirectly supported by the RDC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>). As a result the conformational exchange could be modulated by the interaction of Nek2 with partner proteins or via phosphorylation, which has been shown to occur on serines 299 and 300 in a cell cycle-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>An externally triggered shift in the register of a heptad repeat has been suggested recently for two completely different proteins, the microtubule binding domain (MTBD) of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and the HAMP domain that is found in a range of transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In the case of MTBD it is hypothesized that binding to microtubules is the initial trigger and that the heptad repeat shift is used to transmit this signal to the distant AAA+ domain ring structure to activate the ATPase activity. For both these proteins indirect data based mainly on site directed mutagenesis was used to support this hypothesis even though only one form of each protein was observed. The latter is possibly due to the fact that the heptad repeat sequence conforms much more to the standard than is the case with Nek2. As a result, it is therefore not surprising to see a heptad repeat shift as a tool for signal transmission within a protein. The leucine zipper of Nek2 kinase is simply a more extreme case than MTBD and HAMP, which makes it the first protein where this shift could be observed experimentally. In eukaryotic cells coiled-coil proteins are often part of highly dynamic structures and we expect that our findings will stimulate new approaches to understanding cellular regulation. This will make the Nek2 leucine zipper a powerful model system for the experimental study of this novel mechanism for the regulation of protein function.</p></sec>
