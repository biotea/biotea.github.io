      <abstract>
        <p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors, the NINAC-encoded myosin III is found in a complex with a small, MORN-repeat containing, protein Retinophilin (RTP). Expression of these two proteins in other cell types showed NINAC myosin III behavior is altered by RTP. NINAC deletion constructs were used to map the RTP binding site within the proximal tail domain of NINAC. In vertebrates, the RTP ortholog is MORN4. Co-precipitation experiments demonstrated that human MORN4 binds to human myosin IIIA (MYO3A). In COS7 cells, MORN4 and MYO3A, but not MORN4 and MYO3B, co-localize to actin rich filopodia extensions. Deletion analysis mapped the MORN4 binding to the proximal region of the MYO3A tail domain. MYO3A dependent MORN4 tip localization suggests that MYO3A functions as a motor that transports MORN4 to the filopodia tips and MORN4 may enhance MYO3A tip localization by tethering it to the plasma membrane at the protrusion tips. These results establish conserved features of the RTP/MORN4 family: they bind within the tail domain of myosin IIIs to control their behavior.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Myosins are a diverse family of actin binding proteins that function as molecular motors. Myosins have an amino-terminal motor domain, a short neck with one or more IQ repeats that serve as calmodulin or light chain binding regions, and a C-terminal tail containing protein-protein interacting motifs [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While much is known about the mechanism by which motors transduce chemical energy into movement, the mechanisms controlling cellular localization and regulation of cargo attachment are not well understood [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>Class III myosins (MYO3) are novel in that they contain an amino-terminal kinase domain connected to the canonical myosin motor domain [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The founding MYO3 family member is NINAC, first identified as a <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant showing an altered photoreceptor electrophysiological response to light [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A differentially spliced transcript leads to two NINAC proteins expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor cells [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The short form, NINACp132, is found predominantly in the cell body. The longer form NINACp174 localizes primarily to the rhabdomere, an actin rich microvillar structure that contains the molecular machinery for phototransduction [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mutations that remove NINACp174 alter rhabdomere structure and the waveform of the light response.</p>
      <p>Recently, two reports showed that a small 23 kD protein named retinophilin (RTP) interacts with NINACp174. RTP exhibits reversible light dependent phosphorylation suggesting it plays a regulatory role within the photoreceptor [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The stability of RTP is dependent on NINACp174 [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, RTP and NINAC co-localize to the rhabdomere and are identified as binding partners in co-immunoprecipitation studies [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. RTP contains a motif known as a Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus (MORN). In other proteins, MORN repeats are responsible for membrane association and stabilization of protein complexes [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p>
      <p>Vertebrates possess orthologs of both NINAC and RTP. While <italic>Drosophila</italic> retains the single MYO3 gene <italic>ninaC</italic>, expressed in photoreceptors, vertebrates possess two MYO3 genes MYO3A and MYO3B, expressed in multiple tissues with highest expression levels in the inner ear and the retina [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In vertebrate photoreceptors, MYO3A localizes to the calycal process, a protracted microvillar structure that cups the base of the light-sensitive outer segment [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both MYO3A and MYO3B are found in stereocilia, the mechanosensing organelles responsible for hearing and balance [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Mutations in MYO3A lead to congenital deafness, while the photoreceptors are functional. MYO3B may compensate for defective MYO3A in photoreceptors and has been proposed to explain why only hearing is affected [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A single RTP ortholog, MORN4, has not been studied.</p>
      <p>Here, we characterize the interactions of NINACp174 with RTP, and interactions of MYO3A with MORN4. The results show that both the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins and vertebrate proteins are found in protein complexes. The NINAC binding site for RTP was mapped to the putative control region within the carboxy tail. We found that the binding of RTP alters the <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior of NINACp174. In vertebrate MYO3A, but not MYO3B, a MORN4 binding site is also located within the carboxy tail. Our results demonstrate that RTP binds and regulates NINACp174 and MORN4 binds and enhances MYO3A tip localization, thus establishing conservation of RTP/MORN4 regulation of MYO3 motors in vertebrate and invertebrate systems.</p>

        <p>RTP-RFP was constructed as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The NINAC and MORN4 sequences were generated by PCR (<xref rid="pone.0122502.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The NINAC sequences were cloned into pEntr/D-TOPO, and then recombined into pTGW using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). All constructs were sequence verified. Transgenic strains were generated following embryo injections (Bestgene) and genetic elements were combined by standard genetic methodology to create all genotypes described in this report. Human MORN4 was cut with EcoR1/BamH1 and ligated into a pmCherry expression vector [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For generating GST-MORN4 recombinant protein, MORN4 was inserted into the BamHI and NotI restriction sites of pGEX-1 vector (gifted by Bechara Kachar, NIH). The GFP-tagged expression constructs MYO3AÎK and 3A Tail FL constructs were developed previously [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] for cell biological analysis. GFP-MYO3AÎK construct lacks the kinase domain (aa340-1616 of NM_017433.4), whereas, the GFP-MYO3A Tail construct lacks the kinase and motor domains (aa1133-1616 of NM_017433.4). GFP-MYO3A Tail deletion constructs were generated by performing site-directed mutagenesis on the GFP-MYO3AÎK construct and the primers listed in <xref rid="pone.0122502.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, thus they also lack the kinase domain. The GFP-MYO3AÎK, 34 tail deletion construct was described previously [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Full-length human MYO3B (NM_138995) construct was developed in our laboratory from the template DNA gifted by Bechara Kachar, NIH. MYO3B full length was inserted into the BamHI and NotI restriction sites of pEGFP vector. The GFP-MYO3BÎK.3THDII chimeric construct encoding for human MYO3B with its N-terminal kinase domain deleted (aa 345â1314 of NM_138995.4) and fused to 63 C-terminal amino acids (aa 1554â1616 of NM_017433.4) human MYO3A sequence corresponding to its 3THDII domain was generated by two step megaprimer PCR method. The 3THDII domain sequence containing megaprimer was PCR cloned using GFP-MYO3AÎK construct as the template in the first step. The megaprimer was then used for the second step PCR using GFP-MYO3BÎK construct as the template to insert 3THDII at the C-terminal end of the MYO3BÎK sequence.</p>

        <title>The RTP/NINAC interaction motif maps to the NINAC proximal tail</title>
        <p>Previous results showed that the longer NINACp174 isoform supports RTP stability, but the shorter NINACp132 does not, suggesting that this property is conferred by a NINAC region unique to NINACp174. The domain structure of the two NINAC isoforms is shown in the top two entries of <xref rid="pone.0122502.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>. To confirm and map the RTP binding site, we created <italic>Drosophila</italic> transformants carrying four different GFP-NINACp174 tail regions as diagrammed in <xref rid="pone.0122502.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>. The first three are an overlapping set of constructs with 50% of the p174 tail sequences and named NINACTD (Tail Domain) TD1, TD2, and TD3, the fourth is a transgene with the entire p174 tail (NINACTAIL). Each of these constructs were placed under UAS promoter control, and expression in the R1-6 photoreceptor cells driven by the Rh1-GAL4 driver element [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Expression of all transgenes was confirmed by the presence of GFP within the adult eye.</p>

The GFP-NINAC fusion proteins used in this study are diagrammed below P132 and P174 NINAC. These constructs contain GFP fused at the N-terminus of NINACTD1 (= Tail Domain 1, etc.), NINACTD2, NINACTD3 and NINACTAIL proteins. Numbers indicate the first and last NINACp174 amino acid present in these fusion proteins.

        <p>To determine if the NINAC tail constructs were capable of supporting RTP stability, we expressed each in <italic>ninaC</italic>
<sup><italic>P235</italic></sup> null mutants and examined RTP expression. <xref rid="pone.0122502.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> shows a protein blot assessing RTP levels in controls and experimental genotypes.

<sup><italic>P235</italic></sup> null mutants. The results show animals with full length NINACTAIL and NINACTD1 retain RTP, but NINACTD2 and NINACTD3 do not. Thus the NINACTD1 region of NINACp174 is necessary and sufficient for RTP stability.</p>
        <p>If RTP is stabilized by binding to NINAC, we reasoned that RTP would co-localize with each of the NINAC constructs that support RTP expression. To assess this, we constructed genotypes with each GFP-tagged NINAC construct and RTP-RFP. The full length GFP-NINACp174, containing both the kinase and myosin domains, and RTP-RFP are found at the expected rhabdomeric location (labeled R, <xref rid="pone.0122502.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2Aâ2C</xref>). In contrast, the NINACTAIL construct is predominantly localized to spherical structures located distally near the photoreceptor nuclei (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2Dâ2E</xref>, nuclei labeled in blue, arrow identifies one spherical structure). RTP presence and location was monitored by detection of RTP-RFP. RTP is found in the rhabdomeres, as expected from association with native NINAC, but also in the spherical structures due to association with NINACTAIL (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2Dâ2F</xref>). Similar experiments with NINACTD1, NINACTD2 and NINACTD3 are shown in <xref rid="pone.0122502.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2Gâ2I</xref>, left panels.

        <p>This analysis was extended by expression of RTP-RFP with NINACTD1, NINACTD2 orNINACTD3 in a NINAC null mutant. This eliminated RTP association with native NINAC in the rhabdomere. These results, (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2Gâ2I</xref>, middle and right panels) showed that the NINACTD2 and NINACTD3 domains fail to express detectable RTP-RFP (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H and 2I</xref>). In contrast, photoreceptors possessing NINACTD1 show RTP-RFP localizing within the NINAC GFP-labeled structures in the distal photoreceptor (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). Thus, these results show a protein motif located within the NINACTD1 region is responsible for RTP stability and NINAC co-localization.</p>

        <title>Ectopic expression shows the RTP/ NINAC complex forms outside the photoreceptor environment</title>
        <p>Because endogenous NINAC localizes to the rhabdomere and is thus influenced by the photoreceptor cell environment, we sought to characterize the behavior of NINAC and RTP in the absence of photoreceptor morphological structures and photoreceptor-specific proteins. We first used the P{GawB}OK107 GAL4 driver [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to express GFP-NINAC and RTP-RFP proteins in the larval mushroom body neurons. <xref rid="pone.0122502.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> shows the larval brain consisting of two dorsal spheres connected by the ventral region. Within the dorsal spheres, the mushroom bodies are identified by the expression of GFP-NINAC and RTP-RFP. These two co-expressed proteins are located within the Kenyon cell bodies (C) and within the axonal peduncle projections (arrows). GFP-NINAC expressed alone was readily detected in the mushroom body neurons; however, RTP-RFP expressed alone was not detected (data not shown). We then examined the behavior of RTP with NINAC tail domains. As in photoreceptors, NINACTD1 and NINACTAIL expression stabilizes RTP-RFP in the mushroom body cortex (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>) while NINACTD2 and NINACTD3 do not (data not shown). Thus the behavior of RTP with different NINAC tail domains in the mushroom body neurons confirms that RTP stabilization is dependent on the NINACTD1 region of the NINACp174 tail. Further, it shows that RTP stabilization is not dependent on other photoreceptor specific components.</p>

        <title>RTP expression prevents the formation of RTP/NINAC puncta</title>
        <p>The ability to express NINAC/RTP in the mushroom bodies allowed us to examine details of their interactions. A magnified view of the mushroom body Kenyon cell region shows that NINAC expressed without RTP is found in discrete puncta (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Co-expression of NINAC with RTP broadened this distribution and prevented NINAC puncta formation (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). We also examined NINAC/RTP interactions in large, non-neuronal cells by driving transgene expression in the larval salivary glands with P{GawB}AB1 GAL4. When GFP-NINAC was expressed in the absence of RTP, GFP-NINAC localized to puncta within the cell nuclei (arrow, <xref rid="pone.0122502.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>) and cytoplasm. As the case for photoreceptors and mushroom body neurons, RTP was not present in the absence of NINAC (data not shown). GFP-NINAC, in the presence of RTP-RFP, did not accumulate within the cell nucleus but instead distributed uniformly on internal and plasma membranes (arrow, <xref rid="pone.0122502.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). Thus, ectopic expression of NINAC in two different cell types confirmed that RTP is stabilized in the presence of NINAC, and that RTP prevents formation of RTP/NINAC puncta.</p>

        <title>Vertebrate NINAC and RTP orthologs, MYO3A and MORN4, are binding partners</title>
        <p>Mammals possess two NINAC homologs, MYO3A and MYO3B, and the RTP-like protein MORN4. To determine if the MYO3A and MORN4 proteins recapitulate the NINACp174/RTP interaction, we examined if they were binding partners, and if they colocalized when expressed in COS-7 cells. To purify MORN4 protein for binding studies we created a GST-MORN4 plasmid, and to express the putative MORN4 binding partner, we used a GFP-MYO3A Tail FL construct [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These proteins are diagrammed in <xref rid="pone.0122502.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>. The GST-MORN4 protein, and the control GST only protein were purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, lanes 1, 2). MYO3A full-length tail protein was expressed in COS-7 cells (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, lane 3). This MYO3A full length tail protein bound to the GST-MORN4 loaded agarose beads (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, lane 4) but not the GST only loaded agarose beads (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, lane 5).

We and others have successfully used COS7 cells in previous studies to perform cell biological and biochemical assays for investigating MYO3A function, regulation and its interaction with its known cargo protein ESPN1 [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. COS7 cells are an adherent cell-line that are easy to culture and transfect which makes them an ideal choice for live cell imaging of fluorescently tagged proteins. COS7 cells have the property to form actin based filopodial structures similar to vertebrate actin rich stereocilia and calycal processes, where MYO3A is found to be expressed endogenously. We used the GFP-MYO3AÎK construct lacking the kinase domain because the kinase domain of MYO3 down-regulates myosin motor activity.

        <title>MORN4 specifically binds MYO3A and enhances its tip localization in COS7 cells</title>
        <p>To further define the binding specificity of MORN4 with MYO3A, we examined if the closely related MYO3B could also serve as a binding template. MYO3A and MYO3B contain distinct tail regions, though retain sequence identity within tail homology domain I (THDI) [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Since MYO3B lacks the actin binding motif in tail homology domain II (THDII), MYO3B does not localize to the filopodia tips of COS-7 cells. However a chimera of MYO3BÎK containing THDII at the C-terminus (GFP-MYO3BÎK.THDII) will localize to the filopodia tips (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). We find that the GFP-MYO3BÎK.THDII construct does not direct MORN4 to the filopodia tips when these two proteins are co-transfected (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H and 5I</xref>).</p>
        <p>We quantified the distribution of mChr-MORN4, GFP-MYO3AÎK and GFP-MYO3BÎK.THDII in COS7 cells by examining the filopodia tip/cell body ratio as done previously [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We observed a statistically significant 3-fold increase in the tip/cell body ratio of mChr-MORN4 in the presence, compared to the absence, of GFP-MYO3AÎK (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5J</xref>), (mChr-MORN4 expressed with MYO3AÎK- 0.905 <underline>Â±</underline> 0.071, mChr-MORN4 expressed with MYO3BÎK.3THDII- 0.369 <underline>Â±</underline> 0.044, mChr-MORN4 only- 0.267 <underline>Â±</underline> 0.011). These results show that mchr-MORN4 is more concentrated at filopodia tips relative to the cytoplasm in cells expressing GFP-MYO3AÎK. In contrast, MYO3BÎK.3THDII expression did not appreciably alter MORN4 distribution.</p>
        <p>Our analysis (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5J</xref>) also revealed an increased GFP-MYO3AÎK tip localization when GFP-MYO3AÎK was co-expressed with mChr-MORN4 as compared to that in the absence of mChr-MORN4 (GFP-MYO3AÎK expressed with mChr-MORN4- 3.59 <underline>Â±</underline> 0.302, GFP-MYO3AÎK only- 1.78 <underline>Â±</underline> 0.113). We speculate that when MYO3A is co-expressed with MORN4, the MYO3A-MORN4 complex gets tethered at the filopodia tips in a MORN4 dependent manner.</p>
        <p>To map the MORN4 binding site within the MYO3A tail, we used derivatives of GFP-MYO3AÎK, in which one of the 6 exons (exons 30â35) encoding its tail domain were deleted. Exon 35 contains THDII, which is required for filopodia tip localization, and thus could not be examined. Each of the other MYO3A exon deletion constructs were capable of localizing to the filopodia tips when transfected into COS-7 cells. We found that the deletion of exons 30 and 31 prevented colocalization of MYO3A and MORN4 at the protrusion tips (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Deletion of exons 32, 33, and 34 did not prevent colocalization (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6Câ6E</xref>). We quantified the distribution of mChr-MORN4 in these cells by examining the filopodia tip/cell body ratio as done earlier [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The results (<xref rid="pone.0122502.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>) indicate that deletion of MYO3A exons 30 or 31 result in a statistically significant reduction of MORN4 localization to filopodia tips relative to other MYO3A tail exons. This level of MORN4 localization is similar to that observed in cells lacking MYO3A, indicating that the sequence coded by MYO3A tail exons 30 and 31 are essential for MORN4 binding.</p>

        <p>We conclude that MORN4 interacts to MYO3A but not MYO3B and that MORN4 may form a link between the plasma membrane and MYO3A leading to an increased MYO3A tip localization. On the basis of the GST pulldown assay and MORN4-MYO3A tail deletion constructs coexpression results it is likely that the direct MORN4 binding site is within carboxy tail sequences found in MYO3A but absent in MYO3B.</p>

        <title>Sequence Conservation within the RTP and MORN4 binding regions</title>
        <p>Functional MYO3 tail domains were originally identified on the basis of sequence similarities in divergent species and subsequently shown to promote binding of specific proteins [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, because RTP is widely expressed in invertebrates, we asked whether the RTP binding site in NINAC was a conserved motif. <xref rid="pone.0122502.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> shows the location of the RTP binding region and the IQ domains found within the NINACp174 tail. The sequence similarities of the insect NINACp174 tails we examined are indicated in the top bar graph of <xref rid="pone.0122502.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>. The amino acid sequence within this region is shown in the second bar graph. Additional regions showing high conservation include the calmodulin binding sites (IQ1, IQ2) and two regions that correspond spatially to the 3THDI and 3THDII regions identified from comparative studies of vertebrate MYO3 sequences [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We refer to these homology domains as Invertebrate Homology Domain 1 and 2 (IHD1, and 2). We carried out a similar comparative analysis seeking a MORN4 binding site within the MYO3A tail. <xref rid="pone.0122502.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref> shows the exon deletions used to establish that both exons 30 and 31 were required for MORN4 binding. The bar graphs below these constructs identify a highly conserved sequence spanning the exon 30/31 boundary. Thus, this comparative approach identified a putative invertebrate RTP binding domain and a putative vertebrate MORN4 binding domain. However, we find little sequence identity between the invertebrate and vertebrate domains, and functional tests will be necessary to establish their role in both systems.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Prior studies showed that a photoreceptor specific myosin, NINAC, interacts with and stabilizes the small phosphoprotein RTP [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Here we extend this analysis to show that RTP, and the vertebrate ortholog MORN4, are novel myosin-binding proteins. We mapped the binding sites of RTP and MORN4 to the tail domains of NINAC and MYO3A, respectively. The carboxy tail domains of myosin family members possess the greatest sequence divergence and play key roles in their cellular control [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consistent with the notion that these proteins act to regulate the behavior of these myosins, we show that the binding of RTP alters NINAC behavior, specifically by preventing formation of NINAC puncta.</p>
      <sec id="sec019">
        <title>The proximal region of the NINACp174 tail contains the RTP binding site</title>
        <p>RTP stability is dependent on NINACp174, and not NINACp132, suggesting that the RTP binding domain was contained in the carboxy tail region unique to the longer NINACp174 isoform. We constructed and expressed four NINACp174 tail regions in photoreceptor cells to delimit this RTP interaction domain. One construct represented the entire NINACp174 tail sequence, and three smaller constructs subdivided the tail into four regions. These NINAC fragments could be expressed in photoreceptor cells but did not traffic to the rhabdomeres.</p>
        <p>The smallest NINAC fragment that stabilized and co-localized with RTP was NINACTD1. This fragment contains two IQ calmodulin binding motifs. The region unique to NINACTD1, that is not included in the NINACp132 tail or in NINACTD2, is a sequence that also contains IQ2. It is notable that this region is conserved in other invertebrate NINAC orthologs. A comparison of 5 arthropods shows a conserved segment on the carboxyl side of the IQ2 motif. The proximity of the RTP binding site to the unique IQ2 domain of NINACp174 suggests that the interplay between RTP and calmodulin may create an important control module for NINACp174 function. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> model provides excellent experimental approaches to further investigate these processes.</p>

        <title>Properties of the RTP/NINAC complex</title>
        <p>A distinctive property of RTP is that its stability in photoreceptors is dependent on the presence of NINACP174. Ectopic expression of the RTP/NINAC complex in the neurons of the mushroom bodies and salivary glands allowed us to further characterize the requirements for RTP stabilization. NINAC-dependent RTP stability was maintained in both the neuronal cell types of the mushroom bodies, and the secretory cells of the salivary glands.</p>
        <p>In both mushroom body neurons and salivary gland cells, we observed that RTP modifies NINAC behavior. In the absence of RTP, NINAC formed punctate structures near or within the cell nuclei. Co-expression of RTP with NINAC prevents the formation of punctate structures, with NINAC and RTP being co-localized and broadly distributed in the cells.</p>

      <sec id="sec021">
        <title>The vertebrate orthologs MYO3A and MORN4 are also protein partners</title>
        <p>The characterization of RTP/NINAC interactions led us to ask if a similar situation exists for the vertebrate orthologs. We used an <italic>in vitro</italic> protein affinity pull down assay to show that MORN4 directly binds to the tail domain of MYO3A. Further, <italic>in vivo</italic>, MORN4 is a cytoplasmic protein in the absence of MYO3A, but is colocalized with MYO3A at filopodial tips in the presence of MYO3A. The closely related protein MYO3B does not bring MORN4 to the filopodia tips, showing the importance of MYO3A specific motifs in promoting this interaction. Deletion constructs of the MYO3A tail show that both exons 30 and 31 are necessary for MORN4 tip localization, suggesting that MYO3A binds MORN4 and transports it to the filopodia tips. The amino acid sequence spanning the boundary of these two exons is highly conserved in vertebrate MYO3 orthologs, which may be a consequence of its role as a MORN4 binding domain.</p>
        <p>The analysis revealed some key differences between the MYO3A/MORN4 interaction in vertebrate systems and the NINAC/RTP interaction in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For example, RTP stability is dependent on NINAC, but MORN4 stability in COS-7 cells is not dependent on MYO3A. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors, degradation of excess RTP may provide a regulatory mechanism that is not in play in the vertebrate system. Another difference between systems involves the behavior of NINACp174 and MYO3A in the absence of their RTP/MORN4 binding partners. NINAC forms discrete puncta when expressed on its own in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons or salivary gland cells, but MYO3A localization in COS-7 cells is not dependent on MORN4. Interestingly, we observed an enhanced MYO3A filopodia tip localization in the presence of MORN4. Based on the previous reports suggesting that MORN repeat containing proteins act by linking proteins to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we propose that MORN4 stabilizes MYO3A at the filopodia tips by tethering it to the membrane. The MYO3A anchoring affect in the presence of MORN4 may be a crucial aspect of MYO3A dependent actin bundle stabilization in vertebrate photoreceptor calycal processes where MYO3A is expressed [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, NINAC is only found in photoreceptors, and the localization is not dependent on RTP. In contrast, vertebrates express MYO3A in many tissues [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus multiple control elements are likely, and all may not be shared, in the invertebrate and vertebrate systems.</p>
        <p>Here we have identified RTP and MORN4 as binding partners and a potential control element of NINACp174 and MYO3A. In both cases, binding occurs within the tail domain, the region associated with control of myosin motor cellular localization. RTP and MORN4 possess a tandem set of 4 MORN repeats, a motif found in other proteins and implicated in protein-protein interactions and protein binding to membranes [<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122502.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These considerations show that RTP/MORN4 serve as adaptor proteins, binding to NINACp174/MYO3A. Their binding may enhance the association of the complex with membranes, or facilitate association with scaffolding and actin-based structures.</p>
