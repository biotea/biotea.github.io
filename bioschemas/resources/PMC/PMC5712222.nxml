        <p id="P1">The specificity of membrane traffic involves tethers at destination organelles that selectively capture incoming transport vesicles to allow SNAREs on opposing membranes to then assemble and drive fusion<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Tethers include both protein complexes and long coiled-coil proteins, although how they contribute to specificity remains unclear<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. The golgin coiled-coil proteins at the Golgi apparatus capture vesicles from different origins, but the vesicle-specific molecular cues that they recognise are unknown<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Vesicle tethering is typically a transient process and so challenging to interrogate in vivo. We have thus used a system where an ectopic golgin causes vesicles to accumulate in a tethered state. By applying proximity biotinylation to the golgin-captured vesicles we identify TBC1D23, an apparently catalytically inactive member of a family of Rab GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), as a vesicle-golgin adaptor that is required for endosome-to-Golgi traffic. The Rab-GAP domain of TBC1D23 binds to a conserved motif at the tip of golgin-245 and golgin-97 at the trans-Golgi, while the C-terminus binds to the WASH complex on endosome-derived vesicles. Thus TBC1D23 is a specificity determinant that links vesicle to target membrane during endosome-to-Golgi trafficking.</p>

    <p id="P2">The Golgi apparatus receives transport vesicles originating from diverse compartments including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), endosomes and from within the Golgi itself<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Studies on vesicle tethering at the Golgi have had a particular focus on the golgins, a set of long coiled-coil proteins that are anchored to the Golgi via C-terminal domains that either bind small GTPases or span the lipid bilayer<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Seven of the golgins are able to capture specific classes of Golgi-directed carriers when ectopically installed at mitochondria<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Of these seven, the trans-Golgi golgins golgin-97, golgin-245, and GCC88 have all been implicated in endosome-to-Golgi traffic, a pathway critical for recycling to the Golgi of the machinery that delivers lysosomal hydrolases and also part of the route used by bacterial toxins to move from endosomes to the ER to gain access to the cytoplasm<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. For all three of golgin-97, golgin-245 and GCC88 a conserved N-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for vesicle capture, with the motifs found in golgin-97 and golgin-245 being closely related but distinct from that in GCC88<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. To identify candidate vesicle-associated specificity factors for these golgins, we combined ectopic golgin-mediated vesicle capture with BioID proximity biotinylation<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P3">The vesicle-binding motifs from the N-termini of golgin-97, golgin-245 and GCC88 were fused to the promiscuous biotin ligase BirA*, which was appended to the N-terminus of a mitochondrial form of GCC185, a golgin that has no detectable vesicle capture activity when relocalised to mitochondria in the HeLa or 293T cell lines used in this study<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These chimeras retain both biotinylation activity and the ability to capture endosome-to-Golgi vesicles, permitting the identification of golgin-proximal proteins by mass spectrometry of affinity-purified biotinylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a-e</xref>). Inspecting the proteins efficiently biotinylated by the golgin-97 construct but not by the negative control revealed, as expected, cargo known to travel along the endosome-to-Golgi route, such as the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) and carboxypeptidase D (CPD)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Comparison of the strongest specific hits that were common to both golgin-97 and golgin-245 revealed in addition two poorly characterised cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These are TBC1D23, a member of the TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) family of Rab GAPs but otherwise of unknown function<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, and FAM91A1. FAM91A1 has no known function or clear similarity to any other protein, but has been suggested to form a trimeric complex with two other proteins of unknown function, WDR11 and C17orf75, based on cofractionation and coprecipitation<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Immunoblotting of streptavidin-purified biotinylated proteins from cells expressing the different BirA*-golgin chimeras validated the mass spectrometry results: CI-MPR was biotinylated by all three golgin constructs as expected for their endosomal vesicle capture activity, while TBC1D23 and FAM91A1 were biotinylated by golgin-97 and golgin-245 but not by GCC88, consistent with the latter having a N-terminal vesicle-capturing sequence which is distinct from that of the other two golgins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">TBC1D23 and FAM91A1 colocalised with golgin-97 and golgin-245 at the trans-Golgi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). Relocation to mitochondria of golgin-97 and golgin-245, but not GCC88, resulted in the relocation of TBC1D23 and FAM91A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). The double deletion of golgin-97 and golgin-245 by CRISPR/Cas9, but not the single deletions, resulted in the loss of targeting of both TBC1D23 and FAM91A1 to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1g,h</xref>). Thus, golgin-97 and golgin-245 are necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of TBC1D23 and FAM91A1 to membranes.</p>
    <p id="P5">To determine if either TBC1D23 or FAM91A1 depends on the other for Golgi recruitment we used CRISPR/Cas9-generated null mutants of TBC1D23 or FAM91A1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2a-d</xref>). Loss of TBC1D23 resulted in the delocalisation of FAM91A1 from the Golgi, whereas deletion of FAM91A1 did not affect the Golgi localisation of TBC1D23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>). In neither case was the location of the golgins to the Golgi perturbed. Taken together these results suggest that golgin-97 and golgin-245 recruit TBC1D23, and that this is then required for recruitment of FAM91A1.</p>
    <p id="P6">We next asked whether TBC1D23 binds directly to golgin-97 and golgin-245. The conserved N-terminal regions that were used for the BioID experiments were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> as fusions to the N-terminus of GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Recombinant TBC1D23 expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> bound directly in vitro to golgin-97(1-21)-GST and golgin-245(1-21)-GST but not to GCC88(1-59)-GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These regions of golgin-97 and golgin-245 share several highly conserved residues, of which Phe2 and Leu5 were identified by alanine scanning mutagenesis to be particularly critical for binding TBC1D23 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). The F2A and L5A mutations in full-length golgin-97 also abolished ectopic capture of TBC1D23 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Taken together these results show that TBC1D23 binds directly to the N-termini of golgin-97 and golgin-245.</p>
    <p id="P7">We next investigated whether TBC1D23 is required for the capture of endosomal vesicles by the mitochondrial forms of golgin-97 or golgin-245. In the <italic>âtbc1d23</italic> mutant, mitochondrial capture of endosomal vesicles, visualised by the endosome-to-Golgi cargo TGN46<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, was markedly reduced, but rescued by reintroduction of TBC1D23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). In contrast to these findings for TBC1D23, deletion of FAM91A1 had no detectable effect on the ability of mitochondrial golgin-97 to capture vesicles or recruit TBC1D23 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). Thus TBC1D23 is required for vesicle capture by the golgins, whereas FAM91A1 is recruited by TBC1D23 but is not essential for vesicle capture by TBC1D23.</p>
    <p id="P8">To test the hypothesis that TBC1D23 is an adaptor that links endosome-derived carriers to golgin-97 and golgin-245, we relocated TBC1D23 to mitochondria (TBC1D23-mito, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). As expected, TBC1D23-mito could recruit cytosolic forms of golgin-97 and golgin-245, while GCC88 remained at the trans-Golgi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Strikingly, TBC1D23-mito relocated four different endosome-to-Golgi cargo proteins to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Electron microscopy revealed an accumulation of circular and oval membranes tethered between the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), similar to that seen with the golgins<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Interestingly, the distance between the tethered carriers and the mitochondrial membrane was less for TBC1D23-mito, consistent with the absence of the long coiled-coil region of the golgin to act as a spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). While TBC1D23-mito also recruited FAM91A1, deletion of FAM91A1 had no effect on carrier relocation by TBC1D23-mito (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). BirA* fused to the N- or C-terminus of TBC1D23-mito specifically biotinylated golgin-97, golgin-245, FAM91A1 and the cargo of endosome-derived carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), validating biochemically the results of the visual relocation assay.</p>
    <p id="P9">The above results suggest the existence of factors on the vesicles that can bind TBC1D23. To seek such factors we used mass-spectrometry to identify the proteins that could be co-precipitated with TBC1D23 tagged with GFP at either the N or C terminus. Both of the tagged forms of TBC1D23 co-precipitated golgin-97 and golgin-245 along with FAM91A1 and its putative binding partners WDR11 and C17orf75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The only other strong hits in the precipitates that were not chaperones or abundant cytosolic enzymes were FAM21, the largest subunit of the pentameric WASH complex (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and Scar Homologue), and FKBP15, a known interaction partner of FAM21<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. The WASH complex is recruited to carriers forming on endosomes, including those that return to the Golgi, and coordinates the recruitment of membrane traffic components and actin filaments<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P10">To understand the contribution that the golgins, FAM91A1, and the WASH complex make to the mechanism by which TBC1D23 links golgin-97 and golgin-245 to vesicles, we mapped the domains of TBC1D23 that are responsible for its different interactions. Truncated forms of TBC1D23 were fused to BirA*, ectopically localised to mitochondria, and interacting proteins identified by proximity biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). The first 331 residues of TBC1D23, including the TBC domain, were sufficient to biotinylate golgin-97 and golgin-245 but not the subunits of the putative FAM91A1 complex or the vesicle resident protein CI-MPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). In contrast, residues 514-559 were specific for FAM91A1 and its associated proteins, with FAM91A1 itself binding directly to this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Finally, residues 559-684 were specific for the cargo of endosome-derived carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Thus distinct parts of TBC1D23 bind to the golgins, to FAM91A1, and to endosome-derived carriers.</p>
    <p id="P11">Strikingly, the WASH subunit FAM21 and its known binding partner FKBP15 were biotinylated by the part of TBC1D23 that binds carriers but not by the parts that bind the golgins or FAM91A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Moreover, affinity chromatography of cytosol with recombinant fragments of TBC1D23 revealed that the C-terminal carrier-binding region bound to WASH subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>), and this region was sufficient to recruit to mitochondria both exogenous FAM21A-GFP and the endogenous WASH subunit WASH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). In humans FAM21 is encoded by two genes that express proteins that are 99% identical (FAM21A/WASHC2A and FAM21C/WASHC2C), and for this study we have used FAM21A as it has been used in previous work and is the predominant form in HeLa cells<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. FAM21 is responsible for linking the WASH complex to a range of different proteins by interactions it makes through a long unstructured tail that contains repeats of a conserved motif<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. The entire unstructured tail of FAM21A (residues 357-1341) can be expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, and we found that this recombinant form of the tail bound directly to residues 559-684 of TBC1D23, but not to the regions of TBC1D23 that bind to the golgins or to the FAM91A1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). A similar pattern of binding was observed for the entire WASH complex, confirming that the interaction with FAM21 can occur in the context of the WASH complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Finally, by using recombinant proteins expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> we could show that the presence of TBC1D23 allowed the FAM21A tail to bind to residues 1-21 of golgin-97, indicating that TBC1D23 acts as a bridging protein by binding simultaneously to the golgins and to FAM21A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">The in vivo assays of TBC1D23 function described above use a direct assay of vesicle tethering, but one that occurs at mitochondria. We thus investigated whether TBC1D23 is required for endosome-to-Golgi traffic itself. TGN46 provides an ideal cargo for such analysis as it is well established to cycle between endosomes and Golgi, and when retrieval from endosomes is perturbed it is diverted to lysosomes and degraded, thus allowing efficacy of retrieval to be quantified by both immunofluorescence and blotting<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Examination of cells lacking TBC1D23 showed that the accumulation of TGN46 in the Golgi and its overall level were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 4c,d</xref>). A similar effect on TGN46 was observed when both golgin-97 and golgin-245 were deleted, consistent with TBC1D23 and the golgins acting in the same process, and indeed rescue of the golgin double deletion by golgin-245 required the presence of the N-terminal 21 residues that bind TBC1D23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 4c-e</xref>). The endosome-to-Golgi traffic of another well established cargo, CI-MPR, can be assayed using antibody uptake, and again deletion of the golgins or of TBC1D23 perturbed this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). The WASH complex has been reported to be required for normal endosome-to-Golgi traffic of CI-MPR and TGN46<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, and we could confirm that depletion of FAM21A also caused a reduction in the levels of TGN46 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>). The defect in endosome-to-Golgi traffic in the <italic>âtbc1d23</italic> cells could be restored by expression of full-length TBC1D23 but not by a truncated form lacking residues 559-684 that bind to FAM21A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). In contrast, deletion of FAM91A1 did not affect TGN46 levels, suggesting that it is not essential for tethering but might instead have a regulatory or cell type-specific role (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P13">Our findings are consistent with a model in which TBC1D23 is a modular bridging factor whose separate domains link the tips of golgins at the trans-Golgi to in-coming endosome-derived carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). Furthermore, the carrier-binding domain of TBC1D23 interacts with the FAM21 subunit of the WASH complex and hence is directly contacting these carriers. TBC1D23 is conserved outside of metazoans indicating that it was present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). It has been lost in non-basal fungi, and interestingly the components of the WASH complex show a closely related pattern of evolutionary conservation. However, the WASH complex is recruited to more than one of the types of carrier leaving endosomes as it interacts with retromer which is involved in transport to both the plasma membrane and to the Golgi<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. Thus it seems likely that TBC1D23 makes additional interactions with the carrier in order to select only those carriers destined for the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). Although the TBC domain in TBC1D23 lacks the arginine and glutamine residues that are conserved in most TBC proteins and are essential for Rab GAP activity<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, it could conceivably bind to a Rab, although in our assays this domain was neither necessary nor sufficient for vesicle capture. In addition, the role of the rhodanese-like domain in TBC1D23 is unclear - it is found in combination with other domains in a range of proteins with diverse roles including phosphatases, heat shock proteins and ubiquitin hydrolases<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. What is clear is that there is no shortage of other proteins on endosome-to-Golgi carriers that TBC1D23 could potentially bind in conjunction with the WASH complex. Indeed the question of how endosome-derived carriers are generated is currently debated as some components such as retromer and WASH apparently act in multiple routes, whereas other components have been proposed to act independently in the same route. For example both the AP-1 clathrin adaptor and the sorting nexins SNX1/2 have been reported to direct retrieval of proteins from endosomes to the Golgi<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Thus it seems possible that multiple partially redundant mechanisms operate in parallel, confounding experimental dissection. Indeed, the observation that GCC88 captures CI-MPR-containing vesicles independently of TBC1D23 strongly suggests that either there are at least two types of endosome-to-Golgi carrier with overlapping cargos, or there are two mechanisms for capture of the same vesicles. Interestingly, two recent studies report that truncating mutations in human TBC1D23 are not cell lethal but lead to impaired brain development, consistent with there being additional mechanisms to sustain endosome-to-Golgi traffic<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P14">Our work has also revealed that TBC1D23 interacts with FAM91A1, a protein of unknown function, but the FAM91A1 interacting domain of TBC1D23 is neither necessary nor sufficient for capture of endosome-derived carriers, at least in the context of the mitochondrial relocation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). FAM91A1 has been proposed to form a trimer with WDR11 and C17orf75, two proteins identified in a genome-wide siRNA screen for modifiers of sensitivity to the toxin ricin as enhancing toxin transport from cell surface to ER<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. It is possible that the FAM91A1 interaction acts to regulate or augment vesicle capture by TBC1D23, or to aid capture of a specific sub-population of vesicles that our assays do not detect. Our data also do not preclude it acting at other locations in the endocytic pathway in addition to the Golgi, such that its removal results in increased surface exposure of some recycling membrane proteins including receptors for toxins.</p>
    <p id="P15">In conclusion TBC1D23 defines a bridge that mediates the recognition of an incoming vesicle by its destination compartment. The surprisingly extensive nature of this bridge is perhaps necessitated by the extremely crowded cytosolic environment. Indeed, large tethering complexes appear to be a common theme in most, if not all, intracellular trafficking pathways. Defining the requisite interactions that impart both specificity and efficiency to vesicle capture, as done here for two golgins, will be crucial to understand the molecular basis of membrane organisation. The strategy of ectopic tether localisation for both the functional analysis of capture and the identification of candidate specificity factors should prove widely useful in this area.</p>

        <p id="P32">To monitor retrograde CI-MPR traffic, cells were incubated at 37Â°C with 10 Î¼g/ml anti-CI-MPR antibody in serum-free DMEM for 10 minutes, rinsed with ice cold PBS, then low-pH solution (300 mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 M acetic acid, pH 2.5), then PBS, then chased with antibody-free medium for 45 min at 37 Â°C, and then fixed and immunostained for the internalised antibodies. DAPI, giantin were used to define individual cells and the Golgi respectively using NIS-Elements. The Golgi mask had a minimum threshold of 30% of the mean giantin Golgi labeling to exclude out of focus Golgi. The ratio of the mean intensity of CI-MPR within the Golgi over total CI-MPR inside the cell was quantified to obtain the final CI-MPR internalisation ratio.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematics of the BirA*-golgin-mito chimeras and of BioID where BirA* biotinylates the golgin-receptor and other vesicle proteins. The chimeras contain the transmembrane domain of monoamine oxidase (MAO) to anchor them to the outer membrane of mitochondria, and an HA-epitope tag.</p>
        <p>(<bold>b</bold>) Immunoblot of biotinylated proteins purified by streptavidin-beads from 293T cells stably expressing either no construct (control) or the indicated doxycycline-inducible BirA*-golgin-mito chimeras. Expression was induced with 1 Î¼g/ml doxycycline for 24 hours, and the blot labeled with streptavidin-HRP or the indicated antibodies.</p>
        <p>(<bold>c</bold>) Mass-spectrometric analysis of biotinylated proteins purified from 293T cells expressing BirA*-golgin-mito chimeras as in (b). Plot compares golgin-97(1-21)-BirA*-GCC185-mito to the negative control BirA*-GCC185-mito that does not capture vesicles. The two golgin-97-specific proteins with more spectra than CPD are SFPQ and NONO, pre-mRNA binding proteins that are probably irrelevant as they are abundant and present in a different negative control.</p>
        <p>(<bold>d</bold>) Comparison of the proteins biotinylated specifically by the golgin-97 chimera from (c) and by the equivalent golgin-245 chimera. Specific defined as having ten-fold more spectral counts than with GCC185 alone, or no chimera.</p>
        <p>(<bold>e</bold>) Confocal micrographs of cells expressing the indicated golgin-mito chimeras and labeled for the HA tag in the chimera and endogenous TBC1D23 and GM130 (Golgi marker). The TBC1D23 antisera also labels centrosomes, but this is apparently nonspecific as it is unaffected by either CRISPR gene disruption or siRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p>

        <p>(<bold>e</bold>) Mass-spectrometric analysis of proteins co-precipitated with TBC1D23 tagged with GFP at either the N- or C-terminus. Identified are the golgins, the three subunits of the putative FAM91A1 complex, and the WASH complex subunit FAM21 and its interactor FKBP15. Other proteins found at comparable levels were abundant cytosolic proteins or nuclear proteins that are most likely nonspecific interactions (i, ZBTB33, ii fatty acid synthase, iii Grp78, iv mitoHsp70, v Hsc71, with Hsp70 being beyond the axes).</p>

        <p>(<bold>c</bold>) Confocal immunofluorescence of HeLa cells showing the effects on TGN46 of deleting both golgin-97 and golgin-245 (ZFPL1, Golgi marker).</p>
        <p>(<bold>d</bold>) Immunoblot of whole cell extracts showing effect on TGN46 levels of deleting golgin-97 and golgin-245.</p>
        <p>(<bold>e</bold>) Confocal micrographs of the indicated HeLa cells to which anti-CI-MPR had been bound for 10 minutes at 37Â°C, acid washed at 4Â°C to remove surface material, and then chased at 37Â°C for 45 minutes prior to fixation and staining for IgG and the Golgi marker giantin.</p>
        <p>(<bold>f</bold>) Quantitation of traffic of anti-CI-MPR to the Golgi in cells treated as in (e). Means +/- s.e.m.: n=100 cells. Both mutants showed a statistically significant reduction in traffic (both P values &lt;0.0001 using unpaired, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Source data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p>
        <p>(<bold>g</bold>) Confocal micrographs of HeLa cells lacking TBC1D23 and transiently transfected with the indicated forms of TBC1D23-GFP. Immunofluorescent imaging of TGN46 levels in the Golgi (marked with ZFPL1) in &gt;20 cells per construct showed that 1-558 (lacking the domain that binds FAM21A) gave no rescue, even in cells expressing ten times the level that consistently gave rescue by the full-length form. Scale bars 10 Î¼m.</p>
        <p>(<bold>h</bold>) A model for the role of TBC1D23 as a link between the TGN golgins and endosome-derived vesicles. To ensure specificity TBC1D23 may well bind further factors on the vesicle (X) in addition to FAM21, as the latter is also involved in generating vesicles on endosomes that are destined for the plasma membrane. The FAM91A1 complex is not required for tethering in our assays and so may augment or regulate tethering or downstream events, or act only under particular circumstances. Unprocessed original scans of blots are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>. Experiments were repeated 3 times except (e) which was performed twice.</p>
