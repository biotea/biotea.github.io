      <abstract>
        <p>Obesity is a well-known risk factor for the development of secondary complications such as type 2 diabetes. However, only a part of the obese population develops secondary metabolic disorders. Here, we identify the transcription factor retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma (RORÎ³) as a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation through expression of its newly identified target gene matrix metalloproteinase 3. <italic>In vivo</italic> differentiation of adipocyte progenitor cells from <italic>Ror</italic>Î³-deficient mice is enhanced and obese <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice show decreased adipocyte sizes. These small adipocytes are highly insulin sensitive, leading to an improved control of circulating free fatty acids. Ultimately, <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice are protected from hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in the state of obesity. In adipose stromal-vascular fraction from obese human subjects, RorÎ³ expression is correlated with adipocyte size and negatively correlated with adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. Taken together, our findings identify RORÎ³ as a factor, which controls adipogenesis as well as adipocyte size and modulates insulin sensitivity in obesity. RORÎ³ might therefore serve as a novel pharmaceutical target to treat obesity-associated insulin resistance.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Even though there is a clear link between obesity and insulin sensitivity, the degree of insulin resistance in obese subjects can vary enormously (Desai et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2006</xref>), one possible reason being the variability of adipose tissue plasticity (Sethi &amp; Vidal-Puig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2007</xref>). Adipose tissue mass increases during obesity via two distinct mechanisms, increasing cell number (hyperplasia) and/or increasing adipocyte size (hypertrophy) (Jo et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2009</xref>; Spalding et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>). Hyperplasia occurs via <italic>de novo</italic> differentiation of preadipocytes, which reside in the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue (Gesta et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2007</xref>; Rodeheffer et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2008</xref>). The balance between hyperplasia and hypertrophy strongly influences the metabolic outcome of obesity. While smaller cells retain insulin sensitivity and normal function, large hypertrophic cells are insulin resistant and change their secretory profile towards pro-inflammatory adipocytokines (Roberts et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2009</xref>; Tilg &amp; Moschen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">2006</xref>). As a result, lipolytic release of free fatty acids is enhanced in large adipocytes, leading to cytotoxic fatty acid accumulation in extra-adipose tissue (Unger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">2003</xref>). Shifting the balance towards hyperplasia replenishes the pool of small, functional adipocytes, thus ameliorating the metabolic consequences of obesity. A pharmacological example for this mechanism is the clinical use of glitazones activating PPARÎ³ (Crossno et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2006</xref>; Johnson et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2007</xref>), which leads to an increase in adipose tissue mass with a shift towards smaller, insulin sensitive adipocytes.</p>
      <p>An important regulator of the adipogenic process is the proteolytic remodelling of the extracellular matrix, as preadipocytes have to undergo cell shape transition during differentiation (Kubo et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2000</xref>). Several classes of metalloproteinases (MMPs) affect the adipogenic process (Lilla et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2002</xref>). For example, global inhibition of MMP activity inhibits differentiation of preadipocytes and adipose tissue development (Bouloumie et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">2001</xref>; Lijnen et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2002</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Mmp3</italic>-deficient mice show accelerated adipogenesis during mammary gland involution, suggesting a negative regulatory role for MMP3 in adipocyte differentiation (Alexander et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma (RORÎ³) is a nuclear receptor with an N-terminal (A/B) domain followed by the DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain. RORs bind as monomers to the consensus half-site PuGGTCA (Jetten, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2009</xref>). Recently, several ligands have been proposed to regulate RORÎ³ transcriptional activity (Solt et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2011</xref>; Wang et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">2009</xref>). RORÎ³ has two isoforms: the main isoform is expressed in adipose tissue, liver, muscle and kidney, whereas expression of RORÎ³t is restricted to immune cells. RORÎ³t has been studied in the context of interleukin (IL)-17 producing T-helper cells (Zhang et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">2008</xref>; Zhou et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">2008</xref>); the role of RORÎ³ in other tissues, however, is less clear (Meissburger &amp; Wolfrum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2008</xref>). With regard to adipose tissue, single nucleotide polymorphisms of RORÎ³ have been linked to fat accumulation in cattle (Barendse et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2007</xref>). During <italic>in vitro</italic> adipogenesis, RorÎ³ expression is upregulated in late stages of differentiation (Austin et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">1998</xref>). However, a functional role for RORÎ³ in adipose tissue plasticity has yet to be identified.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigated the mechanistic role of RORÎ³ in adipocyte differentiation and show that RORÎ³ is an important negative regulator of adipogenesis. By controlling fat cell development RORÎ³ influences the progression of obesity-associated insulin resistance in mice and humans.</p>

        <title>RORÎ³ regulates adipogenesis</title>
        <p>In order to identify candidate genes that regulate adipose tissue plasticity, we analysed transcription profiles of visceral adipose SVF from lean and obese patients. The highest upregulated gene in the state of obesity was the transcription factor RorÎ³ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> of Supporting information). Increased expression of RorÎ³ was confirmed by quantitative mRNA analysis in visceral adipose tissue of obese patients <italic>versus</italic> lean patients (mean values lean 7.9 Â± 1.1 <italic>vs</italic>. obese 17.6 Â± 2.9, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref> of Supporting information). As this factor is highly expressed in the preadipocyte-containing SVF, we analysed whether RORÎ³ plays a role in regulating adipose tissue plasticity.</p>
        <p>During differentiation, mRNA and protein expression of RorÎ³ is high in confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, whereas the isoform RORÎ³t could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>, data not shown). Upon induction of differentiation, RorÎ³ mRNA and protein levels exhibit a sharp decline suggesting that RORÎ³ might influence the process of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>). To follow up on this finding, we transiently expressed RORÎ³ in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and analysed the effect on adipogenesis. RORÎ³ overexpression in 3T3-L1 cells decreases the amount of differentiated adipocytes as well as expression of the mature adipocyte marker adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B</xref> of Supporting information). This diminished adipogenesis is retained, albeit to a lesser extent, when rosiglitazone is added, suggesting that RORÎ³ acts upstream of PPARÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">C</xref>). Conversely, siRNA mediated knockdown of RORÎ³ increases the adipogenic potential of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B</xref> of Supporting information). No changes were found in the mRNA expression of closely related family members RorÎ± and RorÎ² suggesting that the effect of RORÎ³ is not due to compensatory regulation of other family members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1C</xref> of Supporting information).</p>

        <p>To further pinpoint at which stage RORÎ³ interferes with the differentiation process, we analysed expression of key regulatory adipogenic genes in a time course of differentiation. Transient overexpression of RORÎ³ increased endogenous protein levels approximately 3â4-fold and resulted in a decreased expression of key adipogenic proteins such as C/ebpÎ±, C/ebpÎ², C/ebpÎ´ and PparÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2A</xref>). In contrast, protein expression of Pref1, a marker for undifferentiated preadipocytes, was not downregulated upon induction of differentiation in cells overexpressing RORÎ³. These findings were corroborated by the fact that induction of adipogenic genes such as c-Jun, c-Fos and A-Fabp was repressed by RORÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2BâD</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that RORÎ³ exerts its inhibitory effect during the initial steps of adipogenesis repressing early adipogenic genes.</p>
        <p>To confirm that RORÎ³ acts upstream of PPARÎ³, we measured PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity in differentiating cells transiently overexpressing RORÎ³ or control vector. PPARÎ³ activity in RORÎ³ transfected cells was suppressed in the first 2 days after induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2E</xref>), which is in line with our observation that overexpression of RORÎ³ led to a reduction in PparÎ³ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2A</xref>). On the other hand, activity of the RORÎ³ promoter was not affected by the PPARÎ³ agonist rosiglitazone suggesting that PPARÎ³ does not regulate RorÎ³ expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1D</xref> of Supporting information). As REV-ERBÎ± is known to modulate transcription of PPARÎ³ (Wang &amp; Lazar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">2008</xref>), we tested whether RORÎ³ could directly influence PparÎ³ expression or whether the effect was due to reduced C/EBP activity, as would be expected from the lowered expression levels of these transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2A</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2F</xref>, RORÎ³ did not influence PPARÎ³ promoter activity at early time points. However, induction of PPARÎ³ during differentiation was inhibited in cells transfected with RORÎ³. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that RORÎ³ tightly regulates adipocyte differentiation by regulating early phase genes, which in turn leads to a reduction in PPARÎ³ expression and activity.</p>

        <title>The effect of RORÎ³ on adipogenesis is mediated by MMP3</title>
        <p>To identify new target genes of RORÎ³ that are involved in the repression of adipogenesis, we analysed transcription profiles of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transiently overexpressing RORÎ³ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref> of Supporting information). Genes upregulated by RORÎ³ and highly expressed in murine SVF were chosen for a functional siRNA screen to test their impact on adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3A</xref>). Furthermore, we analysed whether transcription of these genes is regulated by RORÎ³ using a nuclear run-on assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1E</xref> of Supporting information). Whereas transcription of several identified genes was upregulated by RORÎ³, only knockdown of MMP3 led to an increase in adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3A</xref>). We confirmed Mmp3 mRNA expression to be upregulated by transient or viral overexpression of RORÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3C</xref>). Interestingly, expression of Mmp3 mRNA and protein during early 3T3-L1 adipogenesis closely follows the expression profile of RorÎ³ with high expression in preadipocytes that is downregulated upon induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>). To elucidate whether MMP3 is a direct target gene of RORÎ³, we screened the MMP3 promoter for potential RREs. The promoter sequence contains two potential RREs: the first RRE (AGGTCA) matches the consensus half-site, whereas the second RRE has the half-core motif AGGTAA. Using different luciferase constructs, we could show that RORÎ³-induced transcriptional activation of the MMP3 promoter depends on the first, but not on the second RRE and reaches levels similar to the known RORÎ³ target gene IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3D</xref>). These findings were corroborated by ChIP assays demonstrating binding of RORÎ³ to the first but not to the second RRE in the MMP3 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>

        <p>To assess whether the effect of RORÎ³ on adipogenesis is mediated by MMP3, we added a MMP3 inhibitor during adipocyte differentiation. Similar to siRNA-mediated knockdown of MMP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3A</xref>), pharmacological inhibition of MMP3 enhances 3T3-L1 adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref> of Supporting information). Moreover, inhibition of differentiation by RORÎ³ can be partially rescued with the MMP3 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3F</xref>). Additionally, we could show that overexpression of MMP3 prevents the increased differentiation capacity caused by siRNA-mediated knockdown of RORÎ³ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2B</xref> of Supporting information). Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of MMP3 rescues the inhibition of differentiation caused by RORÎ³, whereas combined knockdown of MMP3 and RORÎ³ does not enhance differentiation compared to knockdown of RORÎ³ alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2C</xref> of Supporting information). To analyse whether the effect of RORÎ³ on adipogenesis and Mmp3 expression is specific, we measured the effect of RORÎ± and a DNA binding-deficient mutant of RORÎ³ (RORÎ³m) on Mmp3 expression and adipogenesis. We could show that RORÎ± inhibited differentiation as described previously (Ohoka et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2009</xref>) but did not modulate Mmp3 expression. A DNA binding-deficient RORÎ³m, which does not bind to DNA because of the mutations C31A and C49A in the DNA binding domain (data not shown), influenced neither adipogenesis nor Mmp3 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2D and E</xref> of Supporting information). Taken together, these results show that MMP3 is a direct target of RORÎ³ and that inhibition of adipogenesis by RORÎ³ is at least partly mediated through induction of MMP3.</p>

        <p>To assess whether the effect of RORÎ³ on adipogenesis could be recapitulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, we implanted murine adipose SVF containing adipocyte precursor cells into mice (Kawaguchi et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">1999</xref>). SVF from GFP-expressing mice resuspended in Matrigel and injected into the subcutaneous layer of the neck could be retrieved as a distinct pad 4â6 weeks after transplantation. Cells in these pads stained positive for GFP as well as for the adipocyte marker A-FABP and had a distinct adipocyte structure when acceptor mice were fed a high-fed diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4A</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that preadipocytes derived from a donor mouse can undergo adipogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> without major host cell infiltration. To determine the effect of RORÎ³ on the process of adipogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we injected GFP positive SVF of <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>Ror</italic>Î³ knockout animals into C57Bl/6 acceptor mice.

        <title>Loss of RORÎ³ leads to increased formation of adipocytes in mouse models of obesity</title>
        <p>We next examined whether the altered differentiation capacity of <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> preadipocytes affects fat cell size within the adipose tissue. Fat cell sizes from adipose tissue sections were determined in obese <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>wild-type</italic> animals by automated image analysis. Whereas <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> animals on a chow diet showed mildly decreased mean adipocyte sizes compared to their <italic>wild-type</italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3B</xref> of Supporting information), this effect was potentiated in obese <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> animals fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks (DIO) or crossed into the leptin-deficient <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4C</xref>). Analysis of the adipocyte size distribution revealed that in <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> animals especially the number of small adipocytes (4000â8000 Âµm<sup>2</sup> in size) is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">E</xref>). To estimate the number of adipocytes, we also quantified whole fat volume using CT scanning and fat pad excision. Fat pad weights did not differ in mice fed a chow diet and were mildly decreased in obese <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice (data not shown, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3C and D</xref> of Supporting information). Based on the average adipocyte volume and the size of the fat pad, we quantified the increase in adipocyte number in the different models. Such calculations will only yield estimations since the cells are not perfectly round and sections are not cut in the middle of each cell. Nevertheless, we observed a slight increase in adipocyte numbers in male DIO subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> animals compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> littermates (6 and 11%). In female DIO and in male <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, the calculated increase in adipocyte numbers was much more pronounced (average of 40%). To confirm that the observed changes in adipocyte size were caused by altered differentiation capacity rather than altered adipocyte function, functional assays were performed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with siRNA-mediated knockdown or overexpression of RORÎ³. Neither glucose uptake nor lipolysis were altered by RORÎ³ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3EâG</xref> of Supporting information, data not shown). Differences in adipocyte size were not due to altered energy balance as <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice did not exhibit altered food intake or oxygen consumption in metabolic cage experiments after 7 weeks of high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3H and I</xref> of Supporting information). As MMP3 is a direct target gene of RORÎ³ and at least partially responsible for the alteration of adipogenesis, we compared mRNA expression of Mmp3 in visceral SVF of 12-week-old <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>wild-type</italic> animals on a normal chow diet. Mmp3 expression was reduced 2.4-fold in the knockout animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4F</xref>) suggesting that MMP3 is regulated by RORÎ³ <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <p>As <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice show alterations in adipocyte size distribution, we examined the metabolic consequences of altered fat cell size in obese mouse models. Mean body weight was slightly reduced for male and female knockout animals on a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4A</xref> of Supporting information), whereas chow fed animals did not show any changes in body weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4B</xref> of Supporting information). In all models, <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice were protected from obesity-induced hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5B</xref>), whereas no effect on glucose levels was observed in chow diet fed animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4C</xref> of Supporting information). Decreased blood glucose levels in obese <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice were accompanied by lower insulin levels in the fasted and in the fed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4D</xref> of Supporting information). In an insulin tolerance test, male <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> animals showed improved insulin sensitivity compared to control mice after 8 weeks of high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5D</xref>). Besides whole body insulin sensitivity, we also tested insulin sensitivity of isolated primary adipocytes from obese <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice and control littermates. As expected from the observed differences in adipocyte size, insulin-mediated repression of lipolysis in obese <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> animals was similar to <italic>wild-type</italic> chow fed animals. In contrast, adipocytes from obese <italic>wild-type</italic> mice were completely insulin-resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5E</xref>). In line with this, concentrations of circulating free fatty acids were significantly decreased in obese <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice both in fasted and fed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4E</xref> of Supporting information).

        <p>To analyse how RorÎ³ and Mmp3 expression is regulated in the course of obesity development and how this regulation is linked to fat cell size, we monitored body weight, adipocyte size and mRNA expression in visceral adipose tissue of mice in a time course of high-fat diet feeding for 24 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5G</xref>). Interestingly, RorÎ³ expression initially dropped within the first weeks of high-fat diet feeding before expression increased during later stages of diet-induced obesity. Expression of the RORÎ³ target gene Mmp3 also increased at later stages of obesity. When looking at mean adipocyte size during the course of high-fat diet feeding, increased RorÎ³ expression at later stages paralleled accelerated adipocyte hypertrophy.</p>
        <p>As RORÎ³ is expressed in muscle tissue as well as in fat, we analysed the ability of RORÎ³ to modulate glucose uptake in muscle cells. Neither overexpression by viral infection with Ad-RORÎ³, nor siRNA-mediated knockdown of RORÎ³ in differentiated C2C12 cells influenced basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas knockdown of insulin receptor (IR) completely abolished insulin-induced glucose uptake. These results suggest that the metabolic changes observed in <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice are not due to altered muscle function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4GâJ</xref> of Supporting information).</p>
        <p>As RORÎ³ is implicated in immunological processes, we quantified different markers of inflammation associated with insulin resistance including TNFÎ±, INFÎ³, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-12 and IL-6 in serum of <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice. To further address the inflammatory state of adipose tissue in obese <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice, we also measured fat-specific expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TnfÎ± and Il-6 as well as Cd68 and Emr1 as markers of macrophage infiltration. None of the inflammation markers linked to adipose tissue inflammation and macrophage infiltration was significantly altered in these mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5A and B</xref> of Supporting information). Furthermore, we analysed expression of RORÎ³ in different subfractions of adipose SVF. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5C</xref> of Supporting information, RORÎ³ is expressed both in CD4<sup>+</sup> immune cells as well as in preadipocytes (Rodeheffer et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2008</xref>), albeit with a approximately fourfold higher expression in the latter population.</p>
        <p>Taken together, our results show that adipose tissue of obese <italic>Ror</italic>Î³<sup>â/â</sup> mice is composed of small, insulin-sensitive adipocytes with intact lipolytic control, which prevents systemic free fatty acid overload and diet-induced insulin resistance.</p>

        <p>As we have shown that ablation of RORÎ³ serves as a protective mechanism against the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance in mice, we next analysed the link between RorÎ³ expression and insulin resistance in human obesity. To this end, we obtained subcutaneous fat biopsies from 21 obese patients (11 female and 10 male) with body mass indices (BMI) of 32â56 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. As shown in previous studies, we observed a significant link between mean fat cell size and whole body insulin resistance determined by HOMA-index (Roberts et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6A</xref> of Supporting information). To quantify the hyperplastic response of adipose tissue, we measured the differentiation potential of human SVF from subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies using <italic>ex vivo</italic> differentiation assays, in which adipogenesis was quantified by high-throughput image analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6B</xref> of Supporting information). Interestingly, we found an inverse correlation between mean fat cell size and the differentiation potential of the corresponding SVF, which suggests that fat cell size is also partly determined by the ability to produce new fat cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6C</xref> of Supporting information). RorÎ³ mRNA expression in SVF showed a positive correlation with adipocyte size and an inverse correlation with adipocyte differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">B</xref>), demonstrating that RorÎ³ expression predicts adipocyte cell number in fat of obese patients similar to mice. Furthermore, expression of the RORÎ³ target gene Mmp3 in the SVF is correlated both with RORÎ³ expression and with adipocyte size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6D</xref> of Supporting information). RorÎ³ mRNA expression in the SVF of obese subjects correlates with insulin sensitivity as measured by HOMA index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig 6D</xref>); however, RorÎ³ mRNA expression does not show a significant correlation with BMI suggesting that RORÎ³ is a predictor of insulin resistance independent of body weight in obese patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6E</xref> of Supporting information).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Our results identify RORÎ³ as a negative regulator of adipogenesis through expression of its target gene MMP3. The adipocyte size profile in obese <italic>Ror</italic>Î³ knockout mice is shifted towards smaller cells and these mice remain insulin sensitive in adipose tissue as well as in the whole body. Since adipocyte precursor cells from <italic>Ror</italic>Î³ knockout mice show a higher differentiation capacity in a physiological environment, it is intriguing to speculate that <italic>Ror</italic>Î³ knockout mice respond to nutrient overload with an increased hyperpastic response in adipose tissue, generating small, insulin-sensitive adipocytes by <italic>de novo</italic> differentiation. Indeed, it has been proposed that stimulation of adipogenesis improves whole body insulin sensitivity through reduced systemic free fatty acid overload and that this is one reason for the differences between metabolically healthy and metabolically unhealthy obese subjects (Lonn et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2010</xref>; O'Connell et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>During high-fat diet feeding of mice, adipocyte size is only mildly affected in the early phase of weight gain, whereas adipocyte hypertrophy mainly occurs in late adiposity. This mirrors fat cell development in humans proposed by Spalding et al who suggested that adipocyte hyperplasia decreases with age (Spalding et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>). Interestingly, RorÎ³ expression in adipose tissue drops at the onset of high-fat diet feeding and increases later on concomitant with pronounced adipocyte hypertrophy. These results further hint at a role for RorÎ³ in adipogenesis in response to nutritional overload.</p>
      <p>To establish a direct link between RORÎ³, adipocyte hyperplasia and insulin sensitivity, a conditional knockout of RORÎ³ in adipocyte precursor cells would be necessary. Unfortunately, no specific preadipocyte marker has been described to date that would allow recombination of RORÎ³ solely in adipocyte precursor cells. Furthermore, it is possible that other tissues and cell types also contribute to the observed phenotype. To this end, we tested the role of RORÎ³ in mature adipocytes and metabolic muscle function, as RORÎ³ is expressed in these cell types (Austin et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">1998</xref>; Raichur et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2007</xref>). Neither adipocytes nor muscle cells showed altered glucose metabolism dependent on RORÎ³. Moreover, improved insulin sensitivity in <italic>Ror</italic>Î³ knockout mice apparently does not depend on decreased expression of classical inflammatory cytokines. However, it is possible that secretion of the RORÎ³ target gene MMP3 from adipocytes and other cell types influences adipogenesis in a paracrine manner and/or exerts additional functions. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore whether expression of MMP3 is regulated by RORÎ³ in other cell types apart from adipocytes and preadipocytes and whether lack of MMP3 mirrors the metabolic phenotype of <italic>Ror</italic>Î³ knockout animals.</p>
      <p>In obese, nondiabetic patients, Mmp3 expression is decreased in subcutaneous adipose tissue compared to lean subjects (Traurig et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">2006</xref>), whereas we observe an increase of RorÎ³ and Mmp3 in the SVF of visceral adipose tissue from obese, diabetic patients. These discrepancies could be due to a fat depot-specific effect, as visceral adipose tissue is an independent determinant for the development of obesity-associated metabolic complications (Heilbronn et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2004</xref>; Ravussin &amp; Smith, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2002</xref>), or due to differences in the degree of insulin resistance and further studies are needed to address this point. Within a cohort of obese patients, however, our data suggests that RorÎ³ expression is mainly associated with changes in insulin sensitivity.</p>
      <p>The link between RORÎ³ and MMP3 regulating adipogenesis is intriguing as extracellular matrix remodelling by MMPs is an important aspect of adipocyte differentiation (Lilla et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2002</xref>). Whereas global inhibition of MMPs reduces differentiation (Chavey et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2003</xref>), <italic>Mmp3</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice show an approximately 35% accelerated adipocyte differentiation during mammary gland involution (Alexander et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2001</xref>). Given the low specificity of MMPs for distinct extracellular matrix proteins, it will be a challenge to explore the exact nature of matrix reorganization by MMP3 leading to altered adipocyte differentiation in future studies.</p>
      <p>In a time course of adipocyte differentiation, RORÎ³ and MMP3 are immediately repressed upon induction paralleled by downregulation of other inhibitory markers such as Pref1 (Smas &amp; Sul, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">1993</xref>), which suggests an inhibitory role for RORÎ³ in early differentiation events. This is corroborated by the fact that RORÎ³ inhibits expression of early transcription factors such as C/ebpÎ² and C/ebpÎ´ leading to decreased expression of C/ebpÎ± and PparÎ³ and thus to reduced transcriptional activity of PPARÎ³. In contrast to REV-ERBÎ±, which directly modulates activity of the PPARÎ³ promoter (Wang &amp; Lazar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">2008</xref>), RORÎ³ did not alter PPARÎ³ promoter activity in undifferentiated cells. As RORÎ³-mediated repression of adipogenesis cannot be reversed by the PPARÎ³ activator rosiglitazone, it can be presumed that RORÎ³ inhibits adipogenesis at an early stage through a PPARÎ³-independent mechanism, which ultimately leads to a less pronounced induction of PPARÎ³. RORÎ± has been previously described to inhibit adipogenesis by blocking the transcriptional activity of C/EBPÎ², thus reducing the induction of PparÎ³ and C/ebpÎ± expression (Ohoka et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2009</xref>). As RORÎ³ regulates genes preceding induction of C/EBPÎ² and RORÎ± does not regulate Mmp3 expression it is likely that RORÎ³ and RORÎ± regulate adipogenesis through different pathways.</p>
      <p>Mice with decreased RORÎ± (<italic>sg</italic>/<italic>sg</italic>) expression are resistant towards the development of diet-induced obesity (Lau et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2008</xref>). The mechanism for this phenotype is tightly linked to lipid mobilization as well as increased energy expenditure and also involves central regulation of food intake. These findings are quite different from <italic>ROR</italic>Î³-deficient mice, which do not show major changes in triglyceride or cholesterol serum levels nor altered energy expenditure suggesting that RORÎ± and RORÎ³ control different metabolic aspects under high-fat diet feeding.</p>
      <p>Loss of RORÎ³ leads to an increase in total adipocyte numbers in female DIO mice and in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice, whereas this effect is less pronounced in male DIO mice. One possibility could be a sexual dimorphism phenotype, as regulation of adipogenesis includes gender specific aspects (Dieudonne et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2000</xref>). Further studies will be needed to address this point.</p>
      <p>Given the fact that RORÎ³ in adipose tissue is linked to insulin sensitivity and that activity can be regulated by ligands, that is by hydroxylated cholesterols or the sulfonamide T0901317 (Kumar et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2009</xref>; Solt et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2011</xref>; Wang et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">2009</xref>) RORÎ³ might be a novel target for the treatment of obesity-associated insulin resistance. Inhibition of RORÎ³ would mirror the effect of glitazones in clinical use, where activation of PPARÎ³ leads to improved insulin sensitivity partly through <italic>de novo</italic> adipocyte differentiation (Czoski-Murray et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2004</xref>; Zanchi et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Taken together, our studies reveal RORÎ³ as a novel factor in adipocyte differentiation through regulation of its target gene MMP3. RORÎ³ expression in adipose tissue is linked to adipocyte size, thereby influencing lipolytic control and insulin resistance in obesity.</p>

              <title>PROBLEM</title>
              <p>Obesity is a prevalent disease in western societies and poses a well-known risk for patients to develop secondary malignancies such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular complications. Interestingly, only a part of obese subjects develops these problems, which is still largely unexplained, but could be due to differences in the development of adipose tissue. One hypothesis in this regard is that patients with small adipocytes are better at controlling the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue, thereby, protecting other tissues from toxic or harmful lipids.</p>

              <title>RESULTS</title>
              <p>In a screen of obese and lean patients we identified the transcription factor RORÎ³ to be highly expressed in obesity. In addition, we could show that this factor controls adipose tissue development through a gene, which is responsible for reshaping the extracellular environment, namely matrix metalloproteinase 3. If RORÎ³ is depleted from adipocyte precursor cells, these cells differentiate much more readily into adipocytes, both <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>. This enhanced potential to develop fat cells can lead to the buildup of small adipocytes that are highly insulin sensitive, and, thereby, much better at controlling lipid release. In mice, loss of RORÎ³ protects from the development of hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and ultimately type 2 diabetes. In obese human subjects, expression of this factor is inversely correlated with the ability to develop adipocytes and also with general insulin sensitivity, suggesting that RORÎ³ might indeed be an important factor for adipose tissue development in humans.</p>
