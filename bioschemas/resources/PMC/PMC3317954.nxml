      <abstract>
        <p>Erythrocyte cytosolic protein expression profiles of children with unexplained hemolytic anemia were compared with profiles of close relatives and controls by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). The severity of anemia in the patients varied from compensated (i.e., no medical intervention required) to chronic transfusion dependence. Common characteristics of all patients included chronic elevation of reticulocyte count and a negative workup for anemia focusing on hemoglobinopathies, morphologic abnormalities that would suggest a membrane defect, immune-mediated red cell destruction, and evaluation of the most common red cell enzyme defects, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase deficiency. Based upon this initial workup and presentation during infancy or early childhood, four patients classified as hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) of unknown etiology were selected for proteomic analysis. DIGE analysis of red cell cytosolic proteins clearly discriminated each anemic patient from both familial and unrelated controls, revealing both patient-specific and shared patterns of differential protein expression. Changes in expression pattern shared among the four patients were identified in several protein classes including chaperons, cytoskeletal and proteasome proteins. Elevated expression in patient samples of some proteins correlated with high reticulocyte count, likely identifying a subset of proteins that are normally lost during erythroid maturation, including proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism and protein synthesis. Proteins identified with patient-specific decreased expression included components of the glutathione synthetic pathway, antioxidant pathways, and proteins involved in signal transduction and nucleotide metabolism. Among the more than 200 proteins identified in this study are 21 proteins not previously described as part of the erythrocyte proteome. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying a global proteomic approach to aid characterization of red cells from patients with hereditary anemia of unknown cause, including the identification of differentially expressed proteins as potential candidates with a role in disease pathogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Red blood cells (RBC), the most abundant cell type in the human body, are highly specialized structurally and functionally to supply oxygen to tissues via the circulatory system. Erythrocyte development begins with marrow progenitors under the influence of lineage specific hematopoietic growth factors, with erythropoietin being the critical growth factor governing RBC production. Marrow RBC development progresses until immature RBC extrude their nuclei and exit the bone marrow as newly formed reticulocytes <xref rid="pone.0034237-Hoffbrand1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Reticulocytes circulate for a few days during which organelles including mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum are lost <xref rid="pone.0034237-Koury1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, allowing mature RBC maximal flexibility to squeeze though narrow capillaries and providing room to pack the cell with hemoglobin, ultimately making up 90% of the dry weight of the cell <xref rid="pone.0034237-Sivilotti1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Because of their extreme specialization, mature RBC have little capacity to repair and no ability to replace damaged proteins. RBC are routinely exposed to high oxygen concentrations and are vulnerable to the accumulation of damage caused by oxidative stress - with much of their metabolic activity devoted to reducing oxidative damage. Therefore a highly reducing milieu and a stable redox balance are paramount for proper function and cell survival. Major components of RBC defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) include reduced glutathione (GSH) and enzymatic antioxidants such as catalase, peroxiredoxins and superoxide dismutase. Glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway are the only sources for NADH and NADPH (respectively) needed to protect RBC from oxidative damage. NADH is required for reduction of methemoglobin; NADPH is utilized primarily for the reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSGÂ âÂ 2GSH). Disruptions in redox balance and increased oxidative damage are characteristic of many RBC pathologies including hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell anemia <xref rid="pone.0034237-Banerjee1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and thalassemia <xref rid="pone.0034237-Origa1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, as well as enzyme defects such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency <xref rid="pone.0034237-Fibach1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency <xref rid="pone.0034237-David1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemias (HNSHA) are a heterogeneous group of RBC enzymatic disorders with PK and G6PD deficiencies being the most common lesions <xref rid="pone.0034237-Baronciani1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. While G6PD deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency in humans, clinical phenotypes are quite variable depending upon the severity of the underlying mutation, and are related to residual enzymatic activity <xref rid="pone.0034237-Prchal1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Specific diagnosis of HNSHA is approached through testing activity of enzymes involved in glycolysis and other RBC metabolic pathways. Unfortunately, no enzymatic abnormality is found in up to 70% of cases, highlighting the need for new approaches to understanding the etiology of this disorder <xref rid="pone.0034237-Beutler1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Miwa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In order to better characterize HNSHA of unknown etiology we have focused upon proteomic analysis of RBC. We have employed a 2D-DIGE (2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis) approach to identify changes in expression patterns of RBC cytosolic proteins from anemic patients when compared with those of healthy relatives (parents and siblings) and unaffected controls. The application of a comprehensive, unbiased method to asses relative protein abundance broadens the spectrum of knowledge of the RBC proteome and identifies candidate genes, proteins and pathways that may play a role in abnormal RBC turnover.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the experimental scheme for the 2D-DIGE approach used to identify proteins differentially expressed in RBC cytosols. Routine evaluation of samples began with non-proteomic approaches including testing for unstable hemoglobin and evaluation of enzymatic activity for the most common causes of HNSHA (G6PD, PK, and Hexokinase deficiency), if not previously reported in the patientâs record. RBC preparation included passage of cells over microcrystalline cellulose to remove leukocytes followed by hypotonic lysis of RBC, removal of membranes and hemoglobin depletion from the resulting hemolysate. The resulting cytosolic protein fraction was then prepared for DIGE. Gel images were evaluated, and differentially expressed âspotsâ were excised and processed for protein identification by LC/MS.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034237-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes relevant laboratory evaluation of the 4 HNSHA patients included in this study: HA09, HA19, HA21 and HA24 (HA for hemolytic anemia). HA09 is a 10-year old male who presented with severe chronic hemolytic anemia at birth, and who remains transfusion dependent. Bone marrow aspirate revealed erythroid hyperplasia with prominent basophilic stippling. Prior workup was negative for hemoglobinopathy, common enzyme defects or RBC membrane abnormalities. Lab values concurrent with sampling for this study included hematocrit (27%), hemoglobin 8.9 g/dl, RBC count 3.09x1012/l, reticulocyte count of 3.5%, bilirubin (11.0 mg/dl) and ferritin (639 ng/ml) levels. Because of the patientâs transfusion dependence, the sample was obtained at the nadir just prior to transfusion (in this case 6 weeks following the most recent transfusion) to maximize the fraction of patient derived RBC for analysis. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), pyruvate kinase (PK), hexokinase (HK), gluthathione peroxidase (GPx), glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) activity as well as a screening test for pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase (P5'N-1) were evaluated to rule out known enzyme defects. Reduced Glutathione (GSH) level was normal. Lacking a clear diagnosis, this sample was selected for proteomic analysis comparing HA09 (patient), his mother, one unrelated control, and a common pooled control sample. The same, pooled control sample (designated âstandardâ) was used in each subsequent HA DIGE experiment as a common control for comparison between experiments.</p>

      <p>HA19 is a 2-year old female who presented with chronic, hemolytic anemia accompanied by splenomegaly, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Initial work up was negative for common enzyme deficiencies (G6PD and PK), hemoglobinopathy or membrane defects, and there was no family history of chronic anemia. Lab values concurrent with sampling for this study include hematocrit of 23%, hemoglobin of 7.3, RBC count of 3.1x10<sup>12</sup>/l and reticulocytes of 11.6%. Evaluation in our lab revealed no abnormalities in G6PD, HK, PK, GOT, GPI, GPx, triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), with GSH in the normal range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s005">TableÂ S1</xref>). Because no diagnosis for the etiology of anemia was made, this sample was selected for proteomic analysis comparing HA19 (patient), both parents and one unrelated control sample.</p>
      <p>HA21 is a 15-year-old female with mild chronic anemia of unknown cause and a history of a previous acute hemolytic event. Prior evaluation showed no evidence of common enzyme deficiency (G6PD, PK, HK, GPI, TPI and GPx reported as normal), hemoglobinopathy or membrane defect, with normal osmotic fragility. Lab values concurrent with sampling for this study include hematocrit of 34%, hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dl, RBC count of 3.57x10<sup>12</sup>/l and reticulocytes of 18%. Enzyme analyses in our laboratory were negative for deficiencies, but showed elevated GPx in both the patient and her mother. In the absence of an identified defect, proteomic analysis was performed comparing HA21 (patient), her mother and two unrelated control samples.</p>
      <p>HA24 is a 6-month old female with severe, chronic anemia requiring transfusion approximately every 5 weeks. As with HA09, a sample for analysis was obtained at the nadir, just prior to transfusion for analysis. At the time of sampling, hematocrit was 22.3%, hemoglobin 7.4 g/dl, RBC count 2.49x10<sup>12</sup>/l and reticulocytes 6.21%. Prior workup for common enzyme deficiencies, hemoglobinopathy and membrane defects were negative. HK activity and GSH levels, were in the normal range. Despite a report of normal PK activity as part of the patientâs original evaluation, enzyme analysis in our laboratory was suggestive of PK deficiency, particularly considering the patientâs reticulocyte count and history of transfusion, with patient, mother and father all showing decreased activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s005">TableÂ S1</xref>). Despite this ambiguity, proteomic analysis was begun in this case comparing HA24 (patient), mother, father, sister and one unrelated control. Subsequent sequence analysis of the PKLR gene revealed that HA24 is homozygous for the R479H mutation <xref rid="pone.0034237-Kanno1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; the parents are heterozygous carriers, while the sister is unaffected. A subsequent western blot analysis utilizing a PK specific antibody demonstrated low, but detectable PK expression in the patient, and intermediate expression in both parents compared to unaffected controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Proteomic analysis of these samples was completed, providing a comparison of differential protein expression in the context of a defined molecular cause of HNSHA.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034237-t002">Table 2</xref> provides an overview of DIGE experiments, including a summary of the number of spots detected on gels from each sample set after spot filtering, and the number of filtered spots differentially expressed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). We excluded spots from further evaluation when they were not matched correctly between the gels, when spot intensity appeared too low to allow identification by mass spec, and when a spot contours drawn by software corresponded to a smear rather than a spot with defined boundaries. A total of 243 spots were picked and a total of 213 proteins were identified (several proteins being repeatedly identified) when pooling data from all four experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s006">TableÂ S2</xref>). 21 of these proteins have not been previously identified in RBC proteome databases <xref rid="pone.0034237-Bouyssie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Pasini1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s007">TableÂ S3</xref>). Despite good resolution on 2-D gels, proteins with similar molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) comigrate, resulting in identification of more than one protein in some spots analyzed.</p>

        <p>As an overall data quality metric, Principal Component Analysis (PCA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g002">Figure 2</xref>) of all spots included (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034237-t002">Table 2</xref>) shows that replicate samples (run with dye reversal) are highly similar in all cases, and that protein expression patterns in HA patient samples are easily distinguished from control samples run in the same experiment. Replicate samples remained tightly grouped when PCA was performed on all detected spots or on all differentially expressed spots (ANOVA). Plotting of the spots showed that in all cases the patient was an âoutlierâ, separated from more closely grouped family members and controls.</p>

For HA19 and HA21 we found a comparable number of differentially expressed protein spots with elevated or reduced expression in the patient versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g003">Figure 3</xref>, B-C). 25 spots showed reduced expression in HA24 compared to control samples in this set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g003">Figure 3</xref>, D, lower panel). We found 9 spots with increased expression in the patient accompanied by intermediate expression levels in the mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g003">Figure 3</xref>, D, upper panel). In each DIGE comparison, we observed several protein spots with expression intensities for one or both parents intermediate between patient and control samples (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g003">Figure 3</xref>, D above), a pattern that might be expected if parents are heterozygous for a polymorphism affecting expression of the respective protein. Spots with this pattern are considered in more detail below (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034237-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>By superimposing images of Coomassie stained gels from all four experiments including the positions of the picked spots, it was possible to identify differentially expressed spots that were picked in more than one experiment. Across all gels, protein identification was overlapping with the same major protein species present in all cases, and additional peptides from minor species being variably present. As an initial method of protein ID verification the location of the excised spot was compared with the molecular weight (kD) and presumed pI of the identified protein(s). When the discrepancy was &gt; 20% of theoretical molecular mass or &gt; 1 pI unit, it was often found that peptides were derived from the previously picked spot (representing contamination at the level of the spot picking head) and could thus be excluded from further analysis. In some instances we found multiple peptides mapping to a protein larger than the spot location could only be aligned to one part of that protein, suggesting that the protein fragmented prior to gel separation, either as an artifact of processing or a physiologic cleavage prior to sample processing. A representative Coomassie stained 2-D gel is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s002">FigureÂ S2</xref>.</p>

        <p>The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzyme fumarate hydratase, which normally localizes to mitochondria, was unexpectedly found to be present in RBC cytosol. A possible explanation for the presence of this enzyme would be as a component of residual mitochondria in circulating reticulocytes. In patients HA19 and HA21, this explanation appears incorrect, as fumarate hydratase protein was reduced more than 2 fold in these patients compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g005">Figure 5</xref>, B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s004">Figure S4</xref>) despite these patients having the highest reticulocyte counts among samples examined.</p>
        <p>Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) was identified in several spots in all experiments. PNP deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by autoimmunity that may include hemolytic anemia <xref rid="pone.0034237-Markert1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Markert2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Patients HA19 and HA21 both show lower PNP abundance in several spots when compared to control samples. Interestingly, the extent of decreased expression varies among the spots: in HA19 from 3.1 fold to 7.7 fold and in HA21 from 2.23, to 9.1 fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s008">TableÂ S4, B</xref>), while the overall expression pattern remains similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g005">Figure 5</xref>, C, D).</p>
        <p>Abundance of specific cytoskeletal proteins differed in all four patients (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s009">TableÂ S5</xref>âand <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g004">Figure 4</xref>) compared to controls. Actin was increased in patients HA09 and HA24, while tubulin was increased in HA21, and a subunit of the dynactin/dynein complex (ACTR1A) <xref rid="pone.0034237-Clarkson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> showed higher levels of expression HA09. Expression of an actin filament capping protein (CAPZB), a regulator of actin filament growth <xref rid="pone.0034237-Teumer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> was found to be lower in HA19. A small GTPase, RhoA, a regulator of actin dynamics <xref rid="pone.0034237-Kaibuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> showed lower expression in HA19 and HA21. We also found diminished expression levels in these patients for two GDP dissociation inhibitors that influence the GDP-GTP exchange of rab GTPases, known to be involved in vesicle trafficking <xref rid="pone.0034237-Stenmark1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Two proteins thought to be involved in ribosome assembly and/or stability were differentially expressed in all four patients. Proliferation-associated protein 2G4 (P2G4) is part of a pre-ribosomal ribonucloeprotein complex and has been implicated in growth regulation in human fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0034237-Squatrito1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0034237-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Hamburger1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In HA09 PA2G4 expression is reduced 1.5 to 1.61 fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s008">Table S4, B</xref>). Ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), also called Laminin-receptor 1, was more highly expressed in HA19, HA21 and HA24 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s008">Table S4, A</xref>). In addition to being a receptor for laminin, RPSA is required for assembly and stability of the 40S ribosomal subunit.</p>
        <p>Chaperones were also differentially expressed in all patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s010">TableÂ S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Known causes of hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) include lesions affecting enzymes involved in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, gluthathione metabolism, and nucleotide homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0034237-Miwa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Hirono1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, arriving at a molecular diagnosis in patients with HNSHA remains a challenge, with the majority of clinical evaluations failing to identify a causal lesionâindicating that novel approaches to diagnosis are required. In this study, we tested whether a quantitative proteomic approach utilizing 2-D gels could be used to discriminate between anemic and control RBC proteomes in four patients with HNSHA, and provide identification of specific proteins and pathways that may be involved in pathogenesis in individual patients. We found several proteins that might serve as biomarkers for HNSHA, however, our findings are preliminary and further validation is needed in order to establish a clear link between those proteins and the etiology of anemia.</p>
      <p>Each sample was evaluated on 2 separate gels using a dye reversal approach <xref rid="pone.0034237-Karp1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Karp2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> to avoid systematic bias in labeling or detection of protein spots, and to allow each patient sample to be compared against parental samples (when available) within the same gel. Principal component analysis showed a close grouping of all replicate samples with patient samples clearly distinct from controls and healthy family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

        <title>Reticulocytosis</title>
        <p>An obvious difference between control and HNSHA RBC samples is the increased reticulocyte count in patient samples. HA09 and HA24 differ from HA19 and HA21 in that they are both transfusion dependentâindicating their ability to produce RBC is more significantly impaired. Because reticulocytosis by itself will increase the abundance of protein species that are normally lost during erythroid maturation, differential expression of mitochondrial proteins, components of protein synthetic machinery and heme biosynthetic pathway, as elucidated in a recent analysis of a mouse hemolytic anemia model <xref rid="pone.0034237-Gilligan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, may simply be a reflection of reticulocytosis and not be directly related to the underlying pathology causing hemolysis. While reticulocytes were elevated in all HA patients examined relative to controls, HA19 and HA21 had the highest reticulocyte counts at 11.6% and 18.4%, respectivelyâand these two samples had the highest number of spots showing increased expression relative to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s008">TableÂ S4,Â A</xref>). Included in the list of proteins with increased expression in both patients were several involved in protein synthesis, the heme biosynthetic enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), autophagy related 3 (ATG3) protein that is an important regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0034237-Radoshevich1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and several subunits of the TCP1 chaperone complex that aids in folding actin and tubulin among other targets <xref rid="pone.0034237-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Yaffe1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Exportin 7 (XPO7), a protein involved in shuttling macromolecules across the nuclear envelope <xref rid="pone.0034237-Mingot1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, was also increased in both patient samples. Interestingly, XPO7 was recently identified as a protein essential for proper erythroid maturation in mammals <xref rid="pone.0034237-Hattangadi1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Deficiency of XPO7 could thus presumably lead to inferior RBC integrity caused by a defective maturation process, and low expression of this protein could play a role in the etiology of hemolytic anemia.</p>
        <p>RPSA, a protein important for ribosome assembly and stability of the 40S ribosome, was increased in patients HA19, HA21 and HA24. RPSA, also named laminin receptor 1 <xref rid="pone.0034237-Malygin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, shows increased expression in cancer cells where expression correlates with invasiveness and metastasis <xref rid="pone.0034237-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a protein that mediates mRNA translation at ribosomes, was increased in patients HA21 and HA24 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s016">TablesÂ S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s017">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s018">S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s019">S15</xref>). In contrast, HA09, the patient with the lowest reticulocyte count, showed decreased expression of many of the same proteins when compared with control samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s008">TableÂ S4,Â B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Patient HA09 is also transfusion dependent, and the combination of low endogenous RBC production in a background of normal, transfused RBC likely explains why this sample had fewer proteins with significantly increased expression. This supports the conjecture that the observed increase in abundance of many proteins in HA patient samples is a marker of the relative increase in reticulocyte count.</p>

        <title>Protein Quality Control</title>
        <p>Endogenous protein quality control is a critical process, especially for a cell such as the erythrocyte with limited capacity to replace or repair damaged proteins. The degradation of damaged or defective proteins is an important homeostatic mechanism to avoid protein aggregation, membrane damage and cell death <xref rid="pone.0034237-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The observation of differential expression of proteins involved in endogenous protein quality control and degradation pathways in HA patient samples may be related to increased reticulocytosis (as discussed above), or may be a response to an increased load of misfolded or damaged proteins that accumulate in developing RBC of HA patients. Chaperones, like heatshock proteins (HSP), can refold polypeptides and salvage them; when proteins are irreparably damaged they ensure their degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway <xref rid="pone.0034237-Khalil1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. HSP play a key role in the triage of proteins with oxidative damage <xref rid="pone.0034237-Pratt1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Ghosh1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, are normally downregulated during erythroid maturation <xref rid="pone.0034237-Patterson1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, but show increased expression in the context of RBC defects such as thalassemia <xref rid="pone.0034237-Bhattacharya1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Interestingly, we identified multiple differentially expressed protein species in all HA patient samples that are components of both endogenous protein quality control and protein degradation systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s010">Tables S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s011">S7</xref>).</p>

Among the 4 HA samples analyzed, there was a divergence in the pattern of differential expression of HSP and chaperone proteinsâmost notably HA19 and HA21 showed increased expression of T-complex chaperone proteins while HA24 and in particular HA09 showed decreased expression of T-complex proteins and increased expression of several HSP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s010">TableÂ S6</xref>). The cytosolic TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC; also called CCT, for chaperonin containing TCP-1) consists of 8 subunits <xref rid="pone.0034237-Kubota1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, assists in the folding of numerous proteins, and is often found associated with nascent polypeptides at ribosomes <xref rid="pone.0034237-McCallum1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In addition, we found increased expression of an additional protein associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome- system that also exhibits chaperone activity, valosin containing protein (VCP) <xref rid="pone.0034237-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, in HA21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g007">Figure 7</xref>,Â C). Increased expression of VCP has been shown to counteract the toxicity of both bortezomib on proteasome activity and geldanomycin on HSP function <xref rid="pone.0034237-Mimnaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Higher expression of HSPs and VCP may be a compensatory response to decreased activity of the proteasome machinery; HSPs and VCP may function together to enhance chaperone activity and avoid accumulation of misfolded proteins. Compounds that increase chaperone activity have potential as therapeutic agents by increasing the fraction of properly folded target proteins during RBC development.</p>

        <title>Furamate Hydratase</title>
        <p>Fumarate hydratase (FH) is a tricarboxylic cycle (TCA) enzyme with reduced expression in patients HA19 and HA21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g005">Figure 5</xref>, B, Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s004">Figure S4</xref>) even though both patients had a high reticulocyte count (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034237-t001">Table 1</xref>). Because of its mitochondrial function and localization, FH is not expected to be part of the mature erythrocyteâs proteome, yet it was previously identified in RBC proteome studies <xref rid="pone.0034237-Bouyssie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Pasini1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, suggesting an unknown function outside of the TCA cycle. A relationship between heme synthesis, heme catabolism and FH activity has been identified in tumor cells where loss of FH activity is synthetically lethal with defects in heme catabolism <xref rid="pone.0034237-Frezza1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In this context, heme synthesis utilizes TCA substrates proximal to FH, overcoming a TCA cycle defect allowing production of required NADP and maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential. Heme catabolism provides a sink allowing this bypass to continue. The function of FH in the cytosol of mature RBC, and the functional impact of the decline in FH expression found in HA19 and HA21 is unclear. One possibility is that during RBC development, reduced FH activity slows distal metabolite flow in the TCA cycle, thus making succinyl-CoA available for heme biosynthesis. The observed reduction in FH protein in peripheral RBC of two patients in this study may thus be a downstream consequence of altered development. This would indicate an even more pronounced reduction in FH expression in marrow progenitors of these patients.</p>

        <title>Limitations of the DIGE approach</title>
        <p>Although outside screening had been negative, we suspected patient HA24 could be PK deficient based upon borderline low PK activity and below control values in both parents when assayed in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s005">TableÂ S1</xref>). Sequencing confirmed that HA24 was homozygous and both parents heterozygous for the R479H mutation, previously identified as a cause of severe HNSHA <xref rid="pone.0034237-Kanno1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034237-Kanno2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The mutation, located at the end of exon 10, appears to interfere with mRNA splicing, decreasing protein production, resulting in PK deficiency <xref rid="pone.0034237-Valentini1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Low PK activity in HA24 was corroborated by low protein on Western-blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s001">FigureÂ S1</xref>). However, we did not independently identify PK as a differentially expressed protein using the DIGE approach, providing a clear example of the limitations of this methodology.</p>
        <p>Lack of sensitivity of the DIGE approach reflects a number of technical choices/challenges in carrying out this study. First, we limited analysis to cytosolic proteins, excluding the membrane fraction because of poor resolution of membrane proteins on 2D gels. Second, we ran the cytosolic fractions over DEAE in order to remove hemoglobin and thus increase sensitivity for lower abundance cytosolic proteins. It is likely that some cytosolic proteins were removed in this step along with hemoglobin. Finally, proteins with extreme isoelectric points (below 4.0 and above 8.5) were outside the range of resolution of our 2D gels. While the above comments relate to technical limitations of 2-D DIGE, there are additional limitations inherent in experimental design when comparing single clinical samples against related and unrelated controls. Here, in order to allow meaningful statistical comparisons, each sample was run twice using a dye-reversal strategy that also corrects for biases in the protein labeling or fluorescence detection steps. While this approach controls for experimental variations, when differential protein expression between patients and controls is observed, we cannot discriminate between anemia-related differential protein expression and differences in expression that represent a polymorphism between the patient and controls that is not disease associated.</p>
        <p>In addition to gel separation problems, we encountered single proteins that ran in several spots next to each other, raising problems for relative quantification. Examples include G6PD, BPGM, eEF2, XPO 7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s003">Figure S3</xref>), FH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g005">Figure 5</xref>, D). While changes in molecular mass were minor, the isoelectric points were different enough to create distinct spots. Modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, oxidation and proteolytic cleavage are presumed to underlie the observed differences in isoelectric point <xref rid="pone.0034237-ZhuK1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Shifting between different isoforms creates a situation where overall expression of a protein might not be changed, but volume measured could shift between spots. Finally, altered protein expression does not necessarily translate to changes in measured enzymatic activity. Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) is an example for this disconnect between measured expression levels and enzyme activity. BPGM catalyses the synthesis of 2,3-disphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), that binds to and regulates hemoglobin oxygen affinity. We found BPGM protein levels were increased in samples from patient HA24 and her mother (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034237-t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034237-g008">Figure 8</xref>). However, when assaying hemolysates derived from these samples, we found no corresponding changes in BPGM enzymatic activity (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Outlook</title>
        <p>Evaluation and treatment of patients with hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia continues to be a challenge. By using a proteomic approach to evaluate four patients with this condition we found a common pattern of altered expression of proteins involved in protein quality control and degradation, raising the possibility that interventions to increase chaperone activity may benefit some patients by diminishing accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins. We also identified several patient-specific alterations in protein expression that require further investigation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034237.s008">Table S4,Â A, B</xref>). While DIGE is a powerful tool to identify differential protein expression, drawbacks of this approach include labor and resource intensity, as well as non-comprehensive nature of the data obtainedâin this case failure to identify PK as a differentially expressed protein in patient HA 24. As such, this approach is better suited to identifying qualitative differences between samples, such as altered expression of proteins involved in protein homeostatic systems, rather than as a specific diagnostic tool for individual patients.</p>
