        <p>The kinesin-5 motor Eg5 has a novel non-mitotic role in the transport of a specific class of transport carriers (CARTS) from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Here we report that the kinesin-5 motor Klp61F, which is known for its role in bipolar spindle formation in mitosis, is required for protein transport from the Golgi complex to the cell surface in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Disrupting the function of its mammalian orthologue, Eg5, in HeLa cells inhibited secretion of a protein called pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor (PAUF) but, surprisingly, not the trafficking of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) to the cell surface. We have previously reported that PAUF is transported from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the cell surface in specific carriers called CARTS that exclude VSV-G. Inhibition of Eg5 function did not affect the biogenesis of CARTS; however, their migration was delayed and they accumulated near the Golgi complex. Altogether, our findings reveal a surprising new role of Eg5 in nonmitotic cells in the facilitation of the transport of specific carriers, CARTS, from the TGN to the cell surface.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The newly synthesized secretory proteins are first transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zanetti et al., 2012</xref>). At the Golgi complex, the cargo is sorted, based on specific signals, and then packed into respective carriers for delivery to their target compartments or for secretion from the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mellman and Nelson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anitei and Hoflack, 2011</xref>). The microtubule-associated motor protein kinesin family members play an important role in the efficient trafficking of the transport carriers from the TGN to the plasma membrane. The examples include kinesin-1 family members (KIF5A and KIF5B) and kinesin-3 (KIF13A) for the migration of carriers to the cell surface; KIF5B, KIF5C, and kinesin-14 (KIFC3) to the apical surface in polarized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakagawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Noda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jaulin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirokawa and Noda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astanina and Jacob, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We have identified a specific class of transport carriers called CARTS (carriers of the TGN to the cell surface) that are produced at the TGN and contain proteins such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor (PAUF), TGN46, and lysozyme C, but exclude vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) and collagen I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wakana et al., 2012</xref>). We present our findings that the kinesin Eg5 is required for the migration of CARTS toward the cell surface in nonmitotic cells during protein secretion. Eg5, a kinesin-5 family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>), is well known for its role in bipolar spindle assembly during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Le Guellec et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hagan and Yanagida, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saunders and Hoyt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sawin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heck et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blangy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cottingham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Valentine et al., 2006</xref>). Eg5 is known to cross-link and slide anti-parallel microtubules and is thus crucial for the assembly of a bipolar spindle during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sharp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kapoor and Mitchison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwok et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miyamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brust-Mascher et al., 2009</xref>). The requirement of Eg5 in the migration of CARTS is therefore quite surprising and suggests a new mechanism for its function in nonmitotic cells. The description of our data follows.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Klp61F is required for the post-Golgi trafficking of secretory cargo</title><p>A genome-wide screen revealed that a kinesin-5 motor called Klp61F was required for protein secretion by <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2006</xref>). Given the established role of Klp61F and its orthologues in bipolar spindle assembly during mitosis, we reinvestigated this potentially new function of Klp61F in nonmitotic cells.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells transformed to stably express signal sequence and V5-tagged horseradish peroxidase (ssHRP-V5) on an inducible promoter were transfected with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific for Klp61F, TANGO1, twinstar, or LacZ (control). The knockdown efficiency was determined by RT-PCR, which revealed a strong reduction of the respective mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). After 5 d of incubation with dsRNA, the cells were incubated with Cu<sup>2+</sup> to initiate the synthesis of ssHRP-V5. 12 h later, the medium and the cell lysates were tested for HRP activity by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). We found that the activity of HRP in the medium of Klp61F knockdown cells was reduced, which is comparable to the effects of the knockdown of TANGO1 and twinstar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We also Western blotted the medium with anti-V5 antibody to rule out the possibility that reduced HRP signal in the medium was due to effects on the activity, measured by ECL, and not the actual levels of HRP. The results revealed a decrease in the level of HRP secreted by Klp61F knockdown cells compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Western blotting the cell lysate of Klp61F knockdown cells revealed HRP as two distinct polypeptides of 50 and 65 kD, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). HRP requires TANGO1 for its export from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). In TANGO1 knockdown cells, HRP was found as a 65-kD polypeptide. Twinstar knockdown arrests HRP in the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">von Blume et al., 2009</xref>) and upon knockdown of twinstar HRP is present as a polypeptide of 50 kD. The 65- and 50-kD polypeptides are therefore likely the ER and Golgi form of HRP, respectively. The presence of HRP in Klp61F knockdown cells as a polypeptide of 50 kD therefore suggests a defect in its trafficking from the Golgi complex to cell surface step of the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Klp61F knockdown inhibits post-Golgi transport in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells.</bold>

HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA oligos specific for Eg5 or a control oligo. Two siRNA oligos targeting a different sequence of Eg5, siRNA (207) and siRNA (608), reduced the expression of Eg5 by â¼70% compared with the control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). The siRNA-based knockdown of Eg5 was repeated, and 20 h after siRNA transfection HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding MycHis-tagged PAUF and incubated in the presence of 2 mM thymidine to prevent cells from entering mitosis. 20 h later, the cells were incubated at 20Â°C for 2 h to arrest secretory cargo at the TGN, washed with fresh medium, and then shifted to 32Â°C for 1 h to restart cargo export. In the absence of thymidine a monopolar spindle was observed in greater than 90% of mitotic cells, indicating that the function of Eg5 was significantly impaired upon Eg5 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In thymidine-treated cells, knockdown of Eg5 had no obvious effect on the organization of cytoplasmic microtubules and the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201303163/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). There was also no effect on their reassembly after treatment with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole (Fig. S1 B). The medium from Eg5 knockdown and control cells was Western blotted with anti-His antibody to determine secreted PAUF-MycHis. Interestingly, in the presence of thymidine (in nonmitotic cells), knockdown of Eg5 inhibited PAUF-MycHis secretion by â¼50% compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Eg5 knockdown inhibits PAUF secretion in HeLa cells.</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with control (cont) siRNA or siRNA oligos specific for Eg5.

Next, HeLa cells were cotransfected with plasmids for PAUF-MycHis and GFP-Eg5, fixed, and visualized by fluorescence microscopy with anti-Myc antibody.

However, by live-cell imaging, i.e., without fixation, GFP-Eg5 was found both on fibrous structures and in the cytoplasm (Fig. S3 C). In cells that had been permeabilized with digitonin, washed to remove the cytoplasmic proteins, and fixed, we could clearly detect GFP-Eg5 attached to cytoplasmic microtubules and PAUF-containing CARTS were located on the Eg5-positive microtubules (Fig. S3 B, bottom and middle rows, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Eg5 is required for the migration of CARTS</title><p>These findings prompted us to test the role of Eg5 in the migration of CARTS on cytoplasmic microtubules.

To formally test this proposal, we used an assay that reconstitutes the biogenesis of CARTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wakana et al., 2012</xref>). Permeabilized HeLa cells were pretreated with monastrol to inhibit Eg5 at 32Â°C for 10 min and then incubated in the presence of rat liver cytosol and an ATP regenerating system at 32Â°C for 45 min. CARTS were then collected by high-speed centrifugation and Western blotted with anti-TGN46 antibody as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wakana et al., 2012</xref>). Monastrol treatment did not inhibit the production of CARTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>). Treatment of the reaction mixture with nocodazole, to depolymerize microtubules, also did not affect the production of CARTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our findings reveal that Eg5 is required for the migration of CARTS in nonmitotic cells. Eg5 is a plus endâdirected bipolar kinesin, which cross-links and slides anti-parallel microtubules during bipolar spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sharp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kapoor and Mitchison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwok et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miyamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Valentine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brust-Mascher et al., 2009</xref>). It is plausible that CARTS are loaded onto anti-parallel microtubules emanating from the TGN, which slide against each other through the action of Eg5, thus propelling CARTS from the TGN toward the cell periphery. This process might also involve another kinesin but CARTS also contain myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wakana et al., 2012</xref>), which likely promotes their migration through the cortical actin for fusion with the plasma membrane.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies against Î±-tubulin and Î²-actin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
