      <abstract>
        <p>Receptor expression enhancing proteins (REEPs) were identified by their ability to enhance cell surface expression of a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically GPCRs that have proven difficult to express in heterologous cell systems. Further analysis revealed that they belong to the Yip (Ypt-interacting protein) family and that some REEP subtypes affect ER structure. Yip family comparisons have established other potential roles for REEPs, including regulation of ER-Golgi transport and processing/neuronal localization of cargo proteins. However, these other potential REEP functions and the mechanism by which they selectively enhance GPCR cell surface expression have not been clarified. By utilizing several REEP family members (REEP1, REEP2, and REEP6) and model GPCRs (Î±2A and Î±2C adrenergic receptors), we examined REEP regulation of GPCR plasma membrane expression, intracellular processing, and trafficking. Using a combination of immunolocalization and biochemical methods, we demonstrated that this REEP subset is localized primarily to ER, but not plasma membranes. Single cell analysis demonstrated that these REEPs do not specifically enhance surface expression of all GPCRs, but affect ER cargo capacity of specific GPCRs and thus their surface expression. REEP co-expression with Î±2 adrenergic receptors (ARs) revealed that this REEP subset interacts with and alter glycosidic processing of Î±2C, but not Î±2A ARs, demonstrating selective interaction with cargo proteins. Specifically, these REEPs enhanced expression of and interacted with minimally/non-glycosylated forms of Î±2C ARs. Most importantly, expression of a mutant REEP1 allele (hereditary spastic paraplegia SPG31) lacking the carboxyl terminus led to loss of this interaction. Thus specific REEP isoforms have additional intracellular functions besides altering ER structure, such as enhancing ER cargo capacity, regulating ER-Golgi processing, and interacting with select cargo proteins. Therefore, some REEPs can be further described as ER membrane shaping adapter proteins.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In an attempt to find proteins that would enhance heterologous (e.g. HEK293) cell surface expression of olfactory receptors (OR), Matsunami and colleagues identified a new family of six proteins that they termed âreceptor expression-enhancing proteinsâ or REEPs [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They demonstrated that co-expression of REEP1 led to enhanced functional surface expression for some, but not all ORs or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Similarly, REEPs have been shown to enhance heterologous expression of taste receptors (TR) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], leading to the hypothesis that REEPs enhanced expression of a variety of poorly expressed GPCRs, possibly as chaperones or co-receptors. The mechanism by which REEPs selectively enhance expression of only a subset of GPCRs has not been determined. In addition, REEP1 mutations were found to be a genetic cause for the neurodegenerative disorder hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Over fifty percent of North American HSP cases are due to mutations in M1-spastin, atlastin-1, or REEP1, proteins that are important determinants of curved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubule formation, elongation, and microtubule network interactions (reviewed in reference [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]).</p>
      <p>A sequence comparison revealed that REEPs are homologous to yeast (Yop1) and barley (HVA22) proteins, thus reclassifying them as Yip (Ypt interacting protein) family members. They have been alternatively named the Yip2 family [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Yip family members, including Yop1 and HVA22, have been shown to interact directly with Rab GTPases, SNAREs, and ER/Golgi vesicle proteins to regulate intracellular trafficking and targeting of cargo proteins within yeast and neurons [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. REEP1, REEP2, REEP5 (DP1), and Yop1 have been shown to affect ER structure [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but despite their characterization as ER shaping proteins, less is known about how they regulate GPCR or other cargo transport and membrane expression [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>To further investigate and clarify the roles and mechanisms of REEP modulation of cargo protein trafficking, we utilized Î±2A and Î±2C adrenergic receptors (ARs) as model GPCRs. Despite being highly homologous, Î±2A and Î±2C ARs have different neuronal localization and expression patterns [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For example, heterologous expression of Î±2C ARs in non-neuronal cells is more difficult to achieve than with Î±2A ARs. To further elucidate REEP effects, we applied a variety of immunofluorescent, biochemical, and quantitative FACS methods, previously developed for analysis of GPCR trafficking motifs, to our analysis of REEP function [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. By utilizing these methods, we have been able to gain insight into REEP/GPCR interactions and build upon previous observations by others [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>By examining co-expression of wild-type and HSP mutant REEPs with Î±2A and Î±2C ARs, we demonstrated that co-expression of a subset of REEPs enhances ER cargo capacity, in order to selectively modulate membrane expression of some GPCRs. Second, these REEP isoforms are ER resident proteins that can interact selectively with specific GPCRs; they can differentiate between cargo proteins. Third, specific REEP co-expression can affect ER to Golgi trafficking of Î±2C ARs, enhancing the expression of a minimally glycosylated form. Lastly, this Î±2C AR form interacts with these REEPs and a HSP REEP1 mutation lacking the carboxyl terminus shows no interaction. This study lends support to the hypothesis that some REEP isoforms, like other Yip family members, regulate intracellular trafficking by affecting ER membrane structure, cargo capacity, and by acting as adapter proteins. Thus, they meet the criteria for being reclassified as ER membrane shaping adapter proteins [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>REEP family members were originally discovered and further described in terms of their ability to enhance plasma membrane or functional expression of GPCRs, namely ORs and bitter or sweet TRs [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, contrasting discoveries were made about REEPs, such as their intracellular localization (e.g. mitochondria vs. ER) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and their mechanisms of actions were not completely elucidated. Also, two subfamilies of REEP proteins (REEP1-4 and REEP5-6/Yop1) have been described based upon structural and sequence homology [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and detailed analyses of REEP5-6/Yop1 effects on GPCR expression have not been described.</p>
      <p>To further clarify these issues and also investigate possible Yip-like affects on cargo protein trafficking, we examined the interactions between a subset of REEPs and model GPCRs, Î±2A and Î±2C ARs. These GPCRs are highly homologous, however Î±2C ARs show some similarity to ORs in that they display ER retention when expressed in HEK293 cells; Î±2A ARs are efficiently expressed on the cell surface [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Also, Î±2A and Î±2C ARs traffic to different locations within cultured sympathetic ganglion neurons (SGN), pre-synaptic and extra-synaptic respectively, suggesting differences in intracellular trafficking characteristics [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We chose a subset of REEP proteins for study (REEP1, REEP2, and REEP6) because prior research demonstrated that members of this subset can alter ER structure [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Also, this subset was chosen because REEP1 has been studied most extensively and is linked to HSP [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], REEP2 has shown differential effects on functional expression of various GPCRs [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and REEP6 is a member of the least studied subfamily REEP5-6/Yop1. To enable direct comparisons to prior research and to allow for FACS-based analyses, we utilized a carboxyl terminus epitope-tagged REEP (Flag) and amino terminus epitope-tagged Î±2 AR (HA) constructs for all of our studies.</p>
      <sec id="s2.1">
        <title>REEPs are ER resident proteins</title>
        <p>By studying Flag and HA-tagged REEP constructs, it was initially suggested that REEP1 and REEP2 could traffic to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], though later immunocytochemical and immunoblotting methods using specific REEP1 antisera suggested that REEP1 was localized to mitochondrial membranes [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, an examination of REEP1 expression in COS7 cells and cortical neurons demonstrated co-localization with ER resident proteins and microtubules [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], thus leading to confusion. To validate our antibody-based methodologies, we first examined subcellular expression of Î±2 ARs and REEP1, REEP2, and REEP6 (REEP1/2/6) in transfected HEK293A cells. HEK293A cells were chosen because they are flatter and have a smaller nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio than wild-type HEK293 cells, thus improving immunofluorescent analysis.</p>
        <p>To more clearly delineate plasma membranes, we performed live cell biotinylation of transfected cells followed by confocal microscopy with fluorescent-conjugated avidin and anti-Flag and anti-HA antibodies in non-permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We examined non-permeabilized cells to enhance membrane delineation of Î±2 ARs and allow for clearer co-localization with avidin. Both Î±2A and Î±2C ARs can be seen at the plasma membrane, co-localized with avidin. Immunofluorescent analysis of transfected Î±2A and Î±2C ARs in non-permeabilized HEK293A cells revealed plasma membrane expression, similar to that seen previously. The intensity of Î±2C AR fluorescence at the plasma membrane was less than seen with Î±2A ARs, consistent with lower plasma membrane expression seen after heterologous expression in HEK293A cells [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Note the absence of intracellular staining of Î±2 ARs in non-permeabilized cells (as compared to intracellular Î±2 AR staining seen in permeabilized cells below). However, plasma membrane localization was not seen with REEP1/2/6. With the confocal images focused on the plasma membrane, all three REEPs studied appeared to be limited to the cytoplasmic compartment, contained within the borders of the plasma membrane. Intracellular staining of REEP1/2/6 was visible despite the lack of permeabilization, since antibodies can gain limited intracellular entry into PFA fixed, but non-permeabilized cells and thus label cytoplasmic epitopes (e.g. carboxyl terminus Flag epitope-tagged REEPs) (discussed further below) [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

            <p>HEK293A cells were transfected individually with either HA-Î±2A AR, HA-Î±2C AR, Flag-REEP1, Flag-REEP2, or FlagâREEP6 cDNA. Forty-eight hrs post-transfections, cells were biotinylated <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vivo</italic> to label plasma membrane proteins. Subsequently, cells were fixed with 4% PFA, but not permeabilized, labeled with various immunofluorescent conjugates, and examined by confocal microscopy. HA- Î±2 ARs were labeled with 16B12-Alexa 488 (anti-HA) and Flag-REEPs were identified by M2-FITC (anti-Flag) antisera respectively (Left). Plasma membranes were identified by Alexa 594-conjugated avidin (Middle). Merged images are shown (Right). <bold>A</bold>. Î±2 AR immunolabeling of non-permeabilized cells demonstrated plasma membrane co-localization of Î±2A and Î±2C ARs, as evidenced by co-localization with Alexa 594-conjugated avidin. <bold>B</bold>. No REEP co-localization was seen with Alexa 594-conjugated avidin, suggesting that REEPs were not localized to the plasma membrane. REEPs were localized intracellularly, within the avidin delineated plasma membrane. REEP immunolabeling of non-permeabilized cells did reveal intracellular staining, despite the absence of permeabilization, due to the ability of antibodies to gain intracellular entry following PFA fixation [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Note the absence of immunolabeling of intracellularly localized Î±2A or Î±2C ARs, due to the lack of cell permeabilization (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

        <p>Next, we used confocal microscopy to examine the subcellular localization of REEP1/2/6 in permeabilized HEK293A cells, compared with ER and Golgi marker proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Confocal images were focused on either the ER or Golgi planes, to enhance co-localization. As had been seen previously for REEP1, all three REEPs localized primarily to an intracellular compartment, co-localizing with calreticulin (ER) but not giantin (Golgi), suggesting that REEP1/2/6 are ER resident proteins. However, there was not extensive overlap between these REEPs and calreticulin, and the regions of highest REEP expression did not co-localize with calreticulin. The ER is a complex structure with multiple subdomains and functions [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and it has been demonstrated that known ER resident proteins do not always completely co-localize within various ER subdomains, possibly accounting for the lack of co-localization between REEPs and calreticulin in some ER domains [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

        <p>Since REEPs are known to alter ER structure and possibly ER subdomains [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we next used an ER-specific dye to localize the ER structure and look for REEP co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g003">Figure 3</xref>). ER Trackerâ¢ Blue/White DPX is a dye that is specifically retained within the ER lumen, thus it is not dependent upon any ER membrane resident proteins for localization [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Examination of REEP1/2/6 in transfected cells stained with ER Trackerâ¢ revealed extensive co-localization throughout the ER tubular network, further supporting an ER localization for REEP1/2/6. Since the ER tubular network is a cage-like structure [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], punctate regions of REEP expression can be seen, representing a confocal slice through an ER tubule. Inspection of REEP1 expression demonstrated focal accumulation near the nucleus, whereas REEP2 was not co-localized to all regions labeled by ER Trackerâ¢, consistent with possible differential REEP expression within ER subdomains.</p>

            <p>HEK293A cells were transfected with Flag-REEP1, -REEP2, or -REEP6. Forty-eight hrs post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized, and examined by confocal microscopy. The ER was identified by staining with the ER-specific dye ER Trackerâ¢ Blue/White DPX, which is retained within the ER lumen, thus labeling the ER tubular network (29). REEPs were stained with M2-Alexa 488 antibody (anti-Flag). REEP1/2/6 staining (Left) delineated an intracellular reticular pattern that showed extensive overlap with the ER luminal network (Middle), as seen in merged images (Right). Areas of punctate REEP expression likely represent areas of focal accumulation within the ER and confocal cross-sections of ER tubules. REEP1 demonstrated focal accumulation near the nucleus (arrow), whereas REEP2 was not found in all ER Trackerâ¢-labeled ER regions (arrow), suggesting the existence of possible REEP/ER subdomains.

        <p>To quantify the relationship between REEP expression within the ER, Pearson correlation coefficients for REEP1/2/6 and ER Trackerâ¢ confocal immunofluorescent images were calculated (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The Global Pearsonâs Correlation values were &gt; 0.60, which suggested a significant correlation between REEP1/2/6 and ER Trackerâ¢ co-localization [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Subsequently co-localization coefficients m<sub>1</sub> (extent of ER Trackerâ¢ co-localized with REEPs) and m<sub>2</sub> (extent of REEP co-localized with ER Trackerâ¢) were calculated. Calculated m<sub>1</sub> values demonstrated that not all ER Trackerâ¢ co-localized with REEP1/2/6 (90.4, 73.2, and 91.9% respectively), demonstrating that REEPs did localize to the majority of the ER structure with some subdomains of the ER lacking REEP expression, as suggested by the confocal images. Conversely, calculated m<sub>2</sub> values demonstrated that REEP1/2/6 almost completely co-localized to the ER (98.3, 98.8, and 94.3% respectively), verifying that REEP1/2/6 were ER resident proteins. Since REEP1/2/6 displayed limited co-localization with calreticulin, but were well co-localized to the ER tubular network (as delineated by ER Trackerâ¢ Blue/White DPX), we investigated whether REEP1, REEP2, and REEP6 localized to similar ER subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A carboxyl terminus HA-epitope tagged REEP1 construct was transfected into HEK293A cells, along with Flag-tagged-REEP1, -REEP2, and âREEP6, and examined by confocal microscopy. HA-REEP1 and Flag-REEP1 revealed co-localization within the ER, as would be expected, suggesting that the different epitopes did not affect intracellular localization of REEP1. Additionally, Flag-REEP2 and âREEP6 also co-localized extensively with HA-REEP1, suggesting that REEP1/2/6 do not localize to different ER subdomains.</p>

        <p>Previously, it had been suggested that REEPs may act as co-receptors for ORs, leading to REEP expression at the cell membrane [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To investigate if either Î±2 AR subtype possibly interacted with REEPs, we examined co-localization of Î±2A and Î±2C ARs with REEP1/2/6 by confocal microscopy of transfected HEK293A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g005">Figure 5</xref>). To enhance our ability to detect co-localization and possible interactions, we focused on the cell plane that allowed for simultaneous detection of both REEPs and Î±2 ARs (ER membrane). All REEPs examined did not demonstrate apparent co-localization with Î±2A AR within the ER membrane. However, Î±2C ARs and REEP1/2/6 did show some small areas of co-localization and thus possible sites of interaction within the ER, which is the predominant site of Î±2C AR localization [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Since Î±2A ARs are predominantly expressed at the plasma membrane [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], whereas REEP1/2/6 are ER resident proteins, more clear confocal analysis of the plasma membrane was performed for Î±2A ARs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076366.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Again, no co-localization of Î±2A ARs and REEP1/2/6 was observed. Minimal amounts of REEP1/2/6 were visualized within the borders of the plasma membrane, as defined by Î±2A ARs (described previously in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

The selective biotinylation of the mature glycosylated Î±2 AR at the plasma membrane served as a positive control for our biotinylation conditions.

        <p>To further demonstrate ER localization of REEP proteins, we performed sucrose gradient membrane fractionation (SGMF) analysis. SGMF allows for separation of plasma and ER membranes, thus biochemical differentiation of protein localization. Following transfection of HEK293A cells with Î±2C ARs and REEP1/2/6, crude membranes were fractionated and aliquots were analyzed by specific antisera to either Na/K ATPase or calnexin, to identify plasma and ER membrane fractions respectively. All REEPs tested showed similar ER membrane fractionation with no expression seen in plasma membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The presence of Î±2C ARs did not alter REEP membrane localization, since expression of REEP1/2/6 alone did not demonstrate plasma membrane localization (data not shown). Therefore, members of both REEP subfamilies reside in the ER and do not appear to traffic to or reside at the plasma membrane at detectable levels in our cell biological and biochemical assays. These results are consistent with our prior confocal microscopy results, further confirming that REEP1/2/6 are not localized to the plasma membrane.</p>

        <title>REEPs do not specifically enhance plasma membrane GPCR expression</title>
        <p>Initial analysis of REEP effects on GPCR trafficking utilized immunocytochemical methods, which demonstrated that co-expression of ORs or TRs with REEPs led to enhanced immunofluorescent staining (expression) of GPCRs at the plasma membrane or increased functional expression [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the enhancement of expression observed might represent a true increase in GPCR plasma membrane insertion relative to intracellular GPCR levels (increased plasma membrane/intracellular GPCR ratio = enhanced trafficking) or merely a generalized increase in both plasma membrane and intracellular GPCR levels (unchanged plasma membrane/intracellular GPCR ratio = unchanged trafficking). Previously it had been demonstrated that when Î±2C ARs are expressed in HEK293A cells, they have a predominant ER localization with minimal plasma membrane expression, whereas Î±2A ARs efficiently traffic to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Given the limitations of immunofluorescent staining for determining the amount of GPCR expressed, we next utilized more quantitative methods to assess the effects of REEP1/2/6 on Î±2A and Î±2C AR plasma membrane and intracellular expression.</p>
        <p>Previous analysis of REEP effects on GPCR plasma membrane expression or functional expression relied on indirect assays of GPCR activation by ligand (e.g. calcium imaging or luciferase reporter genes) as surrogates for surface expression [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Though enhancement of cell surface functional activity was noted, it was hypothesized that REEPs enhanced GPCR function by increasing plasma membrane expression specifically. Ligand binding is commonly used to quantify GPCR expression and has not been utilized for the analysis of REEP effects on GPCR expression. Therefore, to further analyze REEP1/2/6 affects on Î±2 AR expression, [<sup>3</sup>H]RX821002 ligand binding was performed on crude membranes, representing all intracellular and plasma membranes, prepared from cells expressing Î±2 ARs with and without REEPs (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, co-expression of REEP1/2/6 decreased total membrane binding of Î±2A ARs. However, Î±2C AR ligand binding showed a small increase of approximately 20-25% upon co-expression of REEP1 and REEP2. Of note, REEP6 demonstrated a decrease in total membrane binding of Î±2C ARs, as also seen with Î±2A ARs. Therefore, REEP1 and REEP2 demonstrated enhancement of Î±2 AR expression by ligand binding, but the result was Î±2 AR subtype specific. However, ligand binding of crude membrane preparations cannot delineate intracellular from plasma membrane expression and thus cannot be used to determine the ratio of plasma membrane to intracellular expression of GPCRs (i.e. trafficking) and any possible REEP effects on this ratio.</p>

        <p>Ligand binding analysis of co-transfected cDNAs (i.e. GPCRs and REEPs) represents an average of the cell population and presumes that all transfected cells express both cDNAs and that expression of one cDNA does not adversely affect the other, with either possibility skewing the population data. If co-transfection of REEPs and Î±2 AR cDNAs led to expression in different cell populations, then ligand binding would not accurately reflect REEP effects on Î±2 AR expression. For example, if Î±2 ARs were expressed in a higher percentage of cells than REEPs, then analysis of Î±2 AR expression by ligand binding would include Î±2 AR-expressing cells that did not express REEPs, thus diluting any possible REEP affects on GPCR expression. To quantify possible differences between REEP and Î±2 AR expression efficiencies, we performed single cell FACS analysis of transfected cells. By FACS analysis, only 20-35% of cells expressed detectable levels of Î±2A or Î±2C ARs, whereas co-expressed REEP1/2/6 proteins were only detectable in 10-30% of cells expressing Î±2A or Î±2C ARs (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3A</xref>). Therefore, transfection of HEK293A cells with REEPs and Î±2 ARs led to a mixture of cDNA expressing cells, potentially including populations expressing only REEPs, only Î±2 ARs, both, or neither. Since there exists a mixture of cells expressing various combinations of transfected cDNAs, analysis of the total population of cells by ligand binding or any other population-based cellular assay would possibly lead to inaccurate interpretation of data. Even though there was an effect of REEPs on Î±2 AR expression, ligand binding did not allow for an analysis of trafficking or determination of a mechanism of action.</p>

        <title>Quantitative FACS analysis of REEPs and GPCRs</title>
        <p>FACS analysis is unique in that it can assay individual cells based upon immunofluorescent labeling and then quantify the intensity of the labeling to allow for relative measurements of protein expression. Additionally, expression of multiple proteins can be performed at the same time, on the same cell, by use of different fluorescent-conjugated antibodies, making FACS a powerful cell biological assay. For example, FACS has been utilized to calculate the ratio of GPCR plasma membrane to intracellular expression, in order to examine GPCR trafficking motifs [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, FACS would be a more accurate measure of plasma membrane expression and would more clearly determine if REEPs specifically enhance GPCR plasma membrane expression. Given the above findings concerning differential REEP/Î±2 AR expression following transfection, a single cell analysis method would allow for a separation of these various cell populations and for study of only cells that express both REEPs and Î±2 ARs, negating the need for complex transfection strategies (e.g. polycistronic cDNA constructs). Thus, we studied REEP modulation of GPCR expression at the single cell level, utilizing a FACS assay we developed to measure surface vs. total GPCR expression for analysis of GPCR trafficking motifs [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>In order to properly quantify the ratio of Î±2 AR surface and intracellular receptor expression with FACS analysis and then examine the effect of co-expressed REEP proteins, immunofluorescent labeling of transfected cells must be performed under permeabilized and non-permeabilized conditions. Given that REEPs are not found on the plasma membrane, a method for identifying REEP-expressing cells under non-permeabilized conditions was needed. It has been shown previously [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], that antibodies can gain intracellular entry into PFA-fixed cells under a variety of conditions and thus label cytoplasmic protein epitopes, such as carboxyl terminus Flag epitope-tagged REEPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further clarify this method, we transfected HEK293A cells with HA-Î±2 ARs or Flag-REEP1/2/6 and examined their expression in PFA fixed, but non-permeabilized, cells using primary conjugated antibodies to mimic the FACS methodology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Wide-field microscopy was used in order to allow for a larger field of cells for study. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g006">6</xref>, apparent intracellular staining of Flag-REEP1/2/6 was seen despite the lack of permeabilization, as evidenced by the immunofluorescent identification of a fine trabecular network originating from a perinuclear shadow. Intracellular staining without permeabilization was possible because the Flag epitope is localized to the cytoplasmic space and thus is accessible after PFA fixation [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, no intracellular labeling was seen for Î±2 ARs since the HA epitope is located on the extracellular amino terminus of the receptor, which would be localized to the ER intraluminal space inside of cells. Without permeabilization, antibodies cannot efficiently gain access across this second membrane compartment, thus preventing intracellular labeling of Î±2 ARs under non-permeabilized conditions. The differential ability to immunofluorescently label and identify REEP-expressing cells in the absence of permeabilization, while maintaining the ability to localize only plasma membrane expression of Î±2 ARs in these same non-permeabilized cells, allowed for quantitative FACS analysis of REEP-effects on GPCR trafficking.</p>

Note predominant plasma membrane staining, compared to intracellular staining, consistent with efficient plasma membrane trafficking of Î±2A ARs. Î±2C AR staining revealed predominant intracellular staining with a perinuclear shadow, due their predominant localization within the ER when expressed in HEK293A cells (25). REEP staining of permeabilized cells showed strong intracellular localization, due to their ER localization. <bold>Non-permeabilized</bold>: Î±2A ARs demonstrated extensive staining of the plasma membrane, however, Î±2C ARs showed staining only of the plasma membrane, demonstrating that the extracellular HA epitope was not accessible by anti-HA antibody under non-permeabilized conditions. Intracellular REEP staining was similar when performed under permeabilized and non-permeabilized conditions, demonstrating that the carboxyl terminal Flag epitope was accessible by anti-Flag antibody under either condition, due to its cytoplasmic localization. REEP staining of non-permeabilized cells revealed intracellular staining, due to the ability of antibodies to gain intracellular entry following PFA fixation [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

        <p>To quantify REEP effects on Î±2 AR trafficking by FACS, HEK293A cells were co-transfected with various combinations of REEP1/2/6 and Î±2A or Î±2C ARs. For further analysis of REEP effects on Î±2 AR expression, selective gating of cells expressing both REEPs and Î±2 ARs were analyzed to determine the percentage of surface and intracellular GPCR expression. First, the cell population was divided, and subsequently examined for Î±2 AR expression under non-permeabilized (surface) and permeabilized (total) conditions. As can be seen in representative FACS histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g010">Figure 10A/B</xref>), Î±2A AR-expressing cells exhibit a higher median fluorescent intensity in non-permeabilized cells (surface expression), compared to Î±2C ARs. This finding is consistent with our prior data demonstrating a higher level of Î±2A AR plasma membrane expression in HEK293A cells [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, following permeabilization (total expression), all Î±2A and Î±2C AR expressing cells demonstrate a shift towards higher median fluorescent intensities. This affect is more pronounced for Î±2C AR expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g010">Figure 10B</xref>), since they have a larger intracellular pool of receptor due to ER retention [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Co-expression of REEP1/2/6 demonstrated a similar shift in Î±2 AR median fluorescent intensity following permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g010">Figure 10A/B</xref>). Note that the histograms demonstrate a heterogeneous population of Î±2 AR expressing cells as measured by median fluorescent intensity, as described previously [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

Detection of Flag-tagged REEPs under both conditions was similar (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3B</xref>), demonstrating that this strategy identified similar population of REEP-expressing cells for subsequent Î±2 AR analysis. To determine the effect of REEP1/2/6 co-expression on Î±2A and Î±2C ARs, single cells were gated by FACS for the expression of REEPs, and subsequently assayed for Î±2 AR expression, as measured by median fluorescent intensity of the selected cell population. A representative gating strategy is provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g010">Figure 10C</xref>). Fluorescent intensity (arbitrary units) for REEP (Cy3, x-axis) and Î±2 AR (FITC, y-axis) is shown on a FACS dot plot. The top panel represents untransfected cells, which were utilized to detect background FITC/Cy3 immunofluorescence and thus set FITC/Cy3 gating conditions. The bottom panel shows a representative dot plot of HEK293A cells expressing Î±2A ARs and REEP1. Note the shift in median fluorescent intensity of Î±2A ARs upon REEP1 co-expression, as demonstrated in quadrant Q2 compared to Q1. Also, note that there is a continuum of REEP fluorescent intensities above a threshold set by our gating strategy, and thus all REEP-positive cells were analyzed, not only high REEP-expressing cells.</p>
        <p>A multi-step process was required to perform a complete FACS analysis of Î±2 AR expression. First, live/dead cell populations were identified using Live/Dead Fixable Violetâ¢ stain and only the live cell population was identified and studied by FACS for analysis of REEP and Î±2 AR expression. Following gating for REEP-expressing cells under permeabilized and non-permeabilized conditions; we next measured the median fluorescence of surface and total Î±2 ARs within this REEP-expressing population. Because Î±2A and Î±2C ARs express at different levels, analysis of median fluorescent intensities alone would not allow for a direct comparison of REEP effects on these two GPCRs. Therefore, we calculated the percentage of plasma membrane (surface) and intracellular expression of Î±2 ARs in order to normalize the two receptor populations and subsequent effects of REEP co-expression (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4A</xref>), as described previously [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

<bold>A</bold>. Following gating for REEP expressing cells only, median fluorescence values for Î±2A and Î±2C ARs were measured in permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells under each transfection condition and the percent surface and intracellular expression of Î±2 ARs were calculated (Â± SEM). Mock vector (no REEP) was used for control (these cells were not gated for REEP expression). <bold>B</bold>. Reanalysis of the same data set without gating for REEP expressing cells demonstrates no change in surface or intracellular expression of Î±2A and Î±2C ARs by REEP co-expression. Mock vector (no REEP) was used for control. <bold>C</bold>. The change in Î±2 AR expression when co-expressed with REEPs were determined by measuring median fluorescent intensity of surface (non-permeabilized) and total (permeabilized) Î±2 ARs and calculated as fold-induction (Â± SEM). Cells were gated for REEP expression prior to analysis. Mock vector (no REEP) was used for control. Note that REEP co-expression enhanced both surface and total Î±2 AR expression regardless of Î±2 AR subtype. A minimum of 1000 REEP expressing cells were used from each transfection and data represents the average of 4-8 experiments for each condition.</p>

        <p>FACS analysis revealed no enhancement for any combination of REEP or Î±2 AR tested. In fact, REEP co-expression decreased the percentage of Î±2A ARs expressed at the plasma membrane (81.8% to approximately 60%) and increased intracellular levels of Î±2A ARs. However, REEP co-expression did not drastically alter Î±2C AR plasma membrane expression (approximately 35-40% with or without REEP). Thus REEP co-expression did not enhance the plasma membrane/intracellular ratio of either Î±2 ARs, thus demonstrating no specific enhancement of GPCR trafficking to the cell surface.</p>
        <p>To determine the relative importance of gating for REEP prior to analysis of Î±2 AR expression, the same single cell data set was used to calculate plasma membrane and intracellular Î±2 AR membrane expression irrespective of REEP expression (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4B</xref>). As can be seen, this analysis demonstrated no effect of REEP1/2/6 on the relative ratios of plasma membrane and intracellular expression of either Î±2A or Î±2C ARs. By not selecting REEP expressing cells prior to Î±2 AR FACS analysis, the data was skewed and REEP effects were not observed, thus demonstrating the importance of multi-channel single cell FACS analysis.</p>
        <p>Prior research identified REEPs by their ability to enhance functional OR plasma membrane expression [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The median fluorescent intensities of Î±2 ARs increased upon co-expression with REEPs (data not shown), consistent with an increase in total Î±2 AR protein production. Thus, we calculated the relative increase in plasma membrane (non-permeabilized) and total (permeabilized) Î±2 AR expression in REEP-positive cells, revealing that REEP co-expression enhanced the amount of both plasma membrane and total Î±2A and Î±2C AR expression (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4C</xref>). Taken together, these data suggests that REEP1/2/6 co-expression enhanced cargo capacity of the ER (intracellular expression), but did not specifically enhance plasma membrane expression of Î±2A or Î±2C ARs. Therefore, the previously described REEP enhancement of plasma membrane GPCR expression seen by immunocytochemistry and inferred by functional receptor screening [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] may likely represent an increase in both total and plasma membrane receptor expression and not a specific REEP affect on GPCR trafficking.</p>

        <title>REEP co-expression alters Î±2C glycosylation</title>
        <p>Î±2 ARs undergo a variety of maturation steps (e.g. glycosylation) as they traffic from ER to plasma membranes, which can be monitored utilizing biochemical methods [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Though REEP1/2/6 did not demonstrate selective enhancement of GPCR plasma membrane expression, they did show an overall enhancement of total receptor levels and ER cargo capacity. Previous work with other Yip family members has demonstrated alterations in ER retention and glycosidic processing [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To further assess REEP effects on intracellular cargo protein processing, Î±2 ARs and REEP1/2/6 were co-expressed and membrane fractions were isolated and analyzed by use of specific endoglycosidases.</p>
        <p>In HEK293A cells, Î±2A ARs show primarily a mature glycosylation pattern consistent with plasma membrane expression; Î±2C ARs show predominantly immature glycosylation due to ER retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g011">Figure 11</xref>), as described previously [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Analysis of Î±2 ARs co-transfected with REEP1/2/6 demonstrated that REEP co-expression did not appear to alter the appearance of mature and immature Î±2A or Î±2C ARs. However, co-expression of either REEP1/2/6 led to an increase in a lower molecular weight form of Î±2C ARs that was not seen with Î±2A ARs. Interestingly, this lower molecular weight form is evident in the heavier ER membranes from the SGMF analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g008">Figure 8</xref>, fractions 9 and 10).</p>

        <p>To further assess for possible REEP effects on Î±2A and Î±2C AR maturation, membrane fractions from co-transfected cells were digested with Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and Peptide: N-Glycosidase F (PNGase). Endo H cleaves only immature N-linked glycans (ER resident), whereas PNGase cleaves both mature and immature N-linked glycans. Endoglycosidase analysis of Î±2 ARs co-transfected with REEP1/2/6 demonstrated that REEP co-expression did affect the overall maturation and trafficking of Î±2C ARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g012">Figure 12</xref>). However, the lower molecular weight form of Î±2C ARs seen when co-expressed with REEP1/2/6 was insensitive to Endo H deglycosylation. Given that Endo H can cleave only immature glycans, this new lower molecular weight form most likely represents a minimally or non-glycosylated form of the receptor and not a degradation product. If this lower molecular weight form was due to degradation of an immature glycosylated form, Endo H digestion would have caused a decrease in its molecular weight, which was not observed. Thus, REEP1/2/6 co-expression can lead to specific alterations in cargo glycosylation, possibly due to changes in ER/Golgi processing or retention. More importantly, this data suggests that REEP1/2/6 can differentially modulate intracellular processing of two highly homologous receptor proteins.</p>

Forty-eight hrs post-transfection, crude membranes were isolated and subjected to endoglycosidase digestion (<bold>C</bold> = No Enzyme, <bold>E</bold> = Endoglycosidase H (Endo H), <bold>P</bold> = PNGase F (PNGase)). Due to loss of signal during enzymatic digestion, 125 Âµg of protein was digested and loaded in each lane. Mature (<bold>M</bold>) and immature (<bold>I</bold>) glycosylated forms are indicated. Endo H cleaves only immature glycosylated forms, whereas PNGase cleaves all glycosylated forms. Molecular weight markers (kDa) are shown on the left. Note that Î±2A ARs exhibit mostly mature (Endo H insensitive), whereas Î±2C ARs show mostly immature (Endo H sensitive), glycosylation patterns, correlating with their predominant plasma membrane and intracellular localizations respectively. The presence of REEP1, REEP2, or REEP6 with either Î±2 AR did not alter the relative ratios of mature to immature glycosylation. However, co-expression of either REEP1, REEP2, or REEP6 with Î±2C ARs correlated with an increased expression of a lower molecular weight form that was minimally glycosylated (arrow), not seen following co-expression with Î±2A ARs. Apparent loss of the minimally glycosylated form after PNGase treatment was due to instability in PNGase enzymatic buffer conditions (data not shown). Representative of three experiments.</p>

        <title>REEPs can selectively interact with GPCR cargo</title>
        <p>REEP1/2/6 can all enhance the cargo capacity for both Î±2A and Î±2C ARs as assayed by FACS analysis (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), though they only appear to alter intracellular trafficking of Î±2C ARs, as assessed by deglycosylation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g011">Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g012">12</xref>). Therefore, co-immunoprecipitation assays were utilized to determine if a specific interaction occurred between REEP1/2/6 and Î±2 ARs. REEP1/2/6 and Î±2 ARs were co-transfected into HEK293A cells, and membrane extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies (REEP) and recovered proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g013">Figure 13</xref>). Analysis of co-expressed REEP1/2/6 and Î±2 ARs demonstrated that only Î±2C, but not Î±2A, ARs interacted with REEPs, and most interestingly, the interacting forms of Î±2C ARs were the previously identified REEP-enhanced, minimally or non-glycosylated forms. Note the absence of mature (plasma membrane) Î±2C ARs in the co-IP, further suggesting the absence of REEPs at the plasma membrane and thereby being able to interact with Î±2C ARs. The inability to detect a reverse immunoprecipitation of REEPs by Î±2C ARs may reflect the relative low-level expression of these Î±2C AR forms or may reflect steric hindrance from other unidentified proteins. This result suggests that REEPs can specifically identify cargo protein to alter intracellular transport and processing.</p>

        <title>HSP REEP1 mutation affects cargo interactions</title>
        <p>The ER membrane shaping properties of REEPs may represent only part of their cellular function, and their ability to interact with cargo and other proteins may represent another function relevant to HSP pathogenesis. Such an interaction between REEPs and potential cargo proteins could occur via the hydrophobic hairpins or the carboxyl terminus. Several HSP-inducing mutations of REEP1 involve premature truncation of the carboxyl terminus, such as REEP1Arg113X [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This mutant form involves a single nucleotide polymorphism causing a premature truncation at Arg113 and thus loss of the majority of the carboxyl terminus. Similar co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to investigate the role of the carboxyl terminus in REEP1 protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g014">Figure 14</xref>). Surprisingly, deletion of the carboxyl terminus led to a loss of the interaction between REEP1 and Î±2C ARs. Therefore, REEP1 can alter cargo protein trafficking, via an interaction with its carboxyl terminus.</p>

        <title>REEPs and GPCR Trafficking</title>
        <p>Prior work examining the effects of REEP co-expression on ORs and TRs suggested that REEPs âenhancedâ cell surface and functional expression, possibly by acting as chaperones or co-receptors [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, it has been suggested that REEP2 may aid recruitment of sweet TRs to lipid rafts, thus affecting localization [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, it was noted that REEPs had specificity to their effects and did not enhance expression of all GPCRs. For example, REEP1 enhanced expression of ORs, but not V2R pheromone receptor or Ã2 ARs [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. REEP2 was shown to enhance sweet TRs, T1R and T2R, but not 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> serotonin receptors nor 5-HT3 ion channels [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Lastly, multiple REEPs were shown to enhance ligand responsiveness of co-expressed bitter TRs [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
        <p>The lack of clarity with respect to REEP effects on GPCR expression may be due to the methods utilized, including functional assays of receptor activation by ligand or immunocytochemical staining. Overall, functional assays do not measure actual receptor levels and cannot differentiate between an affect due to increased plasma membrane receptor expression or co-receptor dependency. Immunocytochemical methods do not quantify levels of membrane expression, so we applied more quantitative methods. Ligand binding revealed that some combinations of REEPs had a paradoxical effect on GPCR expression, with REEP1/2 enhancing and REEP6 decreasing Î±2C AR binding (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Similar effects of REEP co-expression were observed with bitter TRs, where it was noted that REEP6 co-expression decreased responsiveness to ligand activation, compared to other REEPs [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
        <p>Ligand binding on transfected cells assumes that every transfected cell is expressing both REEPs and Î±2 ARs. Therefore, attempting to measure the effect of REEP co-expression on a GPCR is not optimal when the population of cells expressing the GPCR is not homogeneous with respect to GPCR and REEP expression, which we observed by FACS analysis (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Also, if REEPs enhanced GPCR expression by acting as trafficking chaperones, then the ratio of plasma membrane to intracellular expression should increase. In order to test this hypothesis and truly measure REEP effects on GPCR expression, FACS analysis was optimized to analyze only single cells expressing both REEP and Î±2 ARs (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This study is the first to our knowledge to assess GPCR plasma membrane expression and correlate it with REEP expression in single cells. Using multi-channel FACS, we were able to demonstrate the REEP1/2/6 do not preferentially enhance plasma membrane expression of either Î±2A or Î±2C ARs, instead they increase the overall ER cargo capacity for Î±2 ARs and thus total Î±2 AR protein levels. Prior immunocytochemical and functional analyses demonstrated an apparent increase in GPCR expression at the cell surface when co-transfected with REEPs [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], however potential simultaneous increases in intracellular GPCRs were not discerned, thus giving the plausible appearance of a selective trafficking affect of REEPs on GPCRs.</p>
        <p>When REEPs were originally identified, it was noted that REEP1 did not preferentially enhance plasma membrane expression of all GPCRs (e.g. ORs vs. Ã2 ARs) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We saw a similar affect with Î±2A and Î±2C ARs. At steady state, heterologous expression of Î±2A ARs leads to efficient delivery to the plasma membrane; Î±2C ARs are more predominantly localized to the ER [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is possible that transit time through the ER may explain the relative responsiveness of different GPCRs to REEP modulation or interactions. For example, the longer ER resident time for heterologously expressed Î±2C ARs could allow for more interaction time with REEPs, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation, possibly accounting for the increased presence of the minimally glycosylated form. Alternatively, trafficking of Î±2A and Ã2 ARs from the ER may be operating at maximal transport efficiency and thus increasing ER cargo capacity by REEP co-expression may not alter plasma membrane expression, thus leading to ER retention as noted by FACS analysis (<xref rid="pone-0076366-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, innate dissimilarities in intracellular trafficking efficiencies for various GPCRs may account for the differential enhancement of cell surface expression seen upon REEP co-expression, as seen by others and us. A third possibility is that REEPs interact with different ER-generated vesicles and their cargo prior to transport, and thus heterologous co-expression of REEPs may be necessary to ensure proper trafficking of GPCR cargo in native cells, as originally suggested by Saito [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>

        <title>REEPs Are Localized to ER Membranes</title>
        <p>Prior research has demonstrated conflicting localization of REEPs within cells. When REEP1 was first identified as a possible causative agent of HSP, it was suggested that REEP1 was localized to mitochondria [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Others found evidence that REEP1, REEP2, and REEP5 could alter ER structure [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and REEP1 and REEP2 were localized to ER and/or plasma membranes [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. More recent work has demonstrated localization of REEP3 and REEP4 within ER membranes and as regulators of nuclear envelope architecture [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To clarify these apparent discrepancies, we examined REEP membrane localization by combining immunofluorescent cell staining with biochemical analyses to reach our conclusion that REEP1/2/6 are ER resident proteins, not found at the plasma membrane.</p>
        <p>Though multiple cell types were utilized for heterologous expression, some common themes have emerged. REEP1 has been shown to co-localize with ER markers (calnexin and Sec61Ã and Ãtubulin, but not GM130, a Golgi marker [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We observed similar ER expression for REEP1/2/6, based upon co-localization studies with calreticulin, giantin (a Golgi marker) and the ER luminal dye ER Trackerâ¢ Blue/White DPX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g003">3</xref>). Additionally, we demonstrated that members of both REEP subclasses have similar subcellular localizations within the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g004">Figure 4</xref>). REEP1/2/6 did not completely co-localize with the ER resident protein calreticulin, suggesting that REEPs may partition to ER subdomains, as seen previously with other ER marker proteins [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> biotinylation and SGMF analyses clearly demonstrated that REEPs were not detected at the plasma membrane, only ER membranes, supporting a possible role for REEPs in intracellular trafficking. Given that ER and mitochondrial organelles form functional connections [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we cannot state that REEPs do not interact or associate with mitochondria, only that they definitely localize to ER membranes [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, we have concluded that REEP1, REEP2, and REEP6 are ER resident proteins, based upon biochemical and immunocytochemical analyses.</p>
        <p>When originally described by Saito [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], carboxyl terminus Flag-tagged REEP1 was localized to the plasma membrane (with an extracellular carboxyl terminus), based upon immunofluorescent staining with anti-Flag antibody M2. However, the plasma membrane was not delineated by either biotinylation or other plasma membrane marker proteins. Using similar Flag-tagged REEP constructs, we have shown that intracellular staining of REEP1, REEP2, and REEP6 can be seen following PFA fixation under non-permeabilized and permeabilized conditions. Similarly, others examined amino and carboxyl HA-epitope tagged REEP2 localization in non-permeabilized cells [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], leading to the conclusion that REEP2 was expressed at the plasma membrane as a single transmembrane domain protein with an extracellular amino terminus. However, the plasma membrane was not delineated with a surface marker, nor were permeabilized cells studied in parallel for co-localization with possible intracellular organelles. Additionally, they showed cell surface biotinylation of REEP2, though selective biotinylation of cell surface proteins (e.g. mature glycosylated receptors) was not demonstrated. However, prior work has demonstrated that REEP1 and REEP5 having a dual hairpin structure that is inserted into the ER, with cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini, contrary to the above model of REEP2 as single transmembrane domain protein [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Of note, there is a high degree of homology between REEP1 and REEP2 membrane spanning domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g015">Figure 15</xref>).</p>

        <p>Together, our immunofluorescent and biochemical studies reveal a consistent theme of ER localization of REEP1/2/6, as the site for Î±2C AR interactions. Co-expression of this subset of REEPs enhanced the expression of a minimally glycosylated form of the receptor, that interacted with the carboxyl tail of REEP1/2/6. The small amount of REEP1/2/6 co-localization with Î±2C ARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g005">Figure 5</xref>), most likely represents the site of interaction of the minimally glycosylated form, which is a minor contributor to the total pool of mature and immature glycosylated Î±2C ARs, possibly accounting for the low amount of co-localization seen. The lack of Î±2A AR co-localization with REEP1/2/6 is consistent with the lack of interaction between these two proteins, as observed by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g013">Figure 13</xref>).</p>

        <title>REEPs are ER membrane shaping adapter proteins</title>
        <p>ER structure is in part regulated by various integral ER membrane proteins, including REEPs, which has lead to their description as âER morphogensâ [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other integral membrane proteins that also utilize a similar hairpin topology to create high membrane curvature include the reticulon (Rtn) and caveolin families [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Caveolins are plasma membrane hairpin adapter proteins that can bind multiple protein partners and generate signaling complexes for GPCR recycling and trafficking [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus protein families that both shape membranes and act as adapters may represent a novel paradigm in membrane organization [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. If REEPs represent a new class of membrane shaping adapter proteins, then one would expect that they: 1) localize to a specific membrane type, 2) interact with other proteins via specific domains, and 3) show specificity in their interactions and effects on cargo proteins. By utilizing Î±2 ARs as a model, we have been able to demonstrate that REEP1, REEP2, and REEP6 can fulfill the requirements for membrane shaping adapter proteins, in that they 1) localize to ER membranes, 2) interact with Î±2C ARs via their carboxyl termini, and 3) show specificity for Î±2C over Î±2A ARs.</p>
        <p>As membrane shaping adapter proteins, REEPs would not only affect cargo trafficking but also alter ER structure. It has been well demonstrated that expression of various REEP/Yop1 homologs can lead to enlargement and tubulization of the ER [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which would lead to increased ER membrane surface area. Our FACS analysis clearly demonstrates that REEPs enhance ER cargo capacity, consistent with REEP-induced increase in ER tubulization [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Specific interactions with REEPs and cargo proteins (e.g. specific GPCRs) may modulate intracellular processing (e.g. glycosylation) and trafficking, thus further affecting cargo expression.</p>
        <p>In order to function as adapter proteins, REEPs would require protein interaction domains. All members of REEP1-4 have a MTB (microtubule binding) domain and a conserved 14-3-3 binding site in the carboxyl terminus (RSXpS or RXXXpS, where pS represents phosphoserine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076366-g015">Figure 15</xref>) [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Recently, a conserved, positively charged region between the two hairpin domains of REEP1-4 has been identified as an additional determinant of microtubule binding; REEP5-6/Yop1 have a negatively charged domain within this region [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. An analysis of the 14-3-3 phosphoproteome and interacting proteins identified REEP4 [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; phosphorylation of REEP4 at this site increased 14-3-3 binding. Interestingly, REEP5-6, which are most similar to Yop1, have neither a MTB nor 14-3-3 binding site. In general, the most divergent portions of REEPs are their carboxyl termini, thus specificity of interaction and function may be encoded in this region. Recent work has suggested that REEPs may have evolved by gene duplication to become 14-3-3 dimer binding lynchpins that integrate multiple cellular signaling systems [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, REEP1 mutations that alter this region may cause HSP due to a loss of specific protein interactions important for neuronal function, without changing REEP1 ER insertion.</p>

        <title>REEP Homologs and Orthologs as Regulators of Intracellular Trafficking</title>
        <p>Our understanding of REEP function is based in part on their similarity to other proteins, such as Yop1 and HVA22. Initially, yeast two hybrid methods were used to identify an essential yeast gene termed Ypt-interacting protein 1, or Yip1 [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Following the identification of Yip1, several other Ypt and Yip1-interacting proteins were identified, including Yop1 (mammalian REEP or Yip2), Yipf, and Yif [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. All members of the Yip family share a similar membrane topology with hairpin domains and extended amino and/or carboxyl termini, though they differ in their subcellular localizations (reviewed in Reference 7).</p>
        <p>As members of the Yip family, REEPs may have similar intracellular functions that have yet to be described. Yeast Yip1 was shown to be involved with early stage ER/COPII vesicle budding, the major ER-Golgi transport vesicle and multiple Yip1 family members have been identified in purified COPII vesicles [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Also, Yop1 can immunoprecipitate specific Ypt proteins, further suggesting a role for this family in intracellular membrane trafficking [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Though only recently cloned, the mammalian homologs of many Yip family members appear to have similar cellular functions as their yeast counterparts. For example, Yip1A is enriched at ER exit sites, the site of COPII vesicle biogenesis, and binds COPII proteins (Sec23 and Sec24) [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. If the function of Yips has been maintained through evolution, then REEPs could serve a similar role in neuronal vesicle trafficking.</p>
        <p>While screening for glutamate transporter (EAAT3) interacting proteins, Yip6a and Yip6b were identified [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Further analysis of this interaction revealed that expression of Yip6b led to accumulation of a lower molecular weight non-glycosylated form of EAAT3, which required cytoplasmic interactions of the Yip6b carboxyl terminus with EAAT3. Similar interactions between Yip6a/b were identified with other excitatory amino acid transporter family members. Our work with Î±2 ARs would suggest that REEPs may have similar functions in intracellular transport. We demonstrated that co-expression of various REEPs with Î±2C ARs can lead to enhancement of minimally or non-glycosylated forms of the receptor and that REEP1 can interact with these forms via its carboxyl terminus. These results would suggest a possible role for REEPs in ER-Golgi vesicular transport regulation, as has been seen with other Yip family members.</p>

        <title>REEP1 Mutations and HSP</title>
        <p>Neurons have developed a sophisticated system to transport and deliver membrane proteins from the ER to their dendritic and axonal sites of action. Membrane trafficking defects can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, such as HSP, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of corticospinal tract neurons [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. To date, over twenty mutations in REEP1 have been linked to HSP [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These mutations include point mutations and frame shifts which lead to premature truncations of the carboxyl terminus, possibly affecting MTB, 14-3-3 and potential phosphorylation sites or other binding domains. The hydrophobic hairpin domains of REEPs are necessary for membrane interactions with atlastin-1, M1-spastin, and reticulons. Missense mutations that alter specific amino acids in the hydrophobic hairpin domains have been identified, however the effect of these REEP1 mutations on function and ER interactions have not been fully elucidated. Recently, it has been demonstrated that mutations in dynamin2, which cause the neurodegenerative disorder Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, may lead to a delayed axonopathy because of a loss of specific cargo trafficking, not a generalized loss of motor protein function [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, some REEP1 forms of HSP may cause an improper loss of ER tubulization/structure (hairpin mutations); however a loss of specialized protein-protein interactions (carboxyl terminus) may also play a role in the disease.</p>
        <p>Careful examination of the literature combined with our work on Î±2 ARs strongly suggests that some REEPs are not merely ER shaping proteins or morphogens, but should be reclassified as ER membrane shaping adapter proteins, similar to reticulons and caveolins [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. REEP1/2/6 have been shown to affect ER membrane curvature and structure, and the work presented here demonstrates that they can enhance ER cargo capacity and specifically interact with cargo proteins to modify processing and trafficking. It remains to be determined how REEPs interact with cargo (i.e. the domains and/or proteins involved), if REEPs interact with Rabs or other transport/vesicle proteins, and what role REEP phosphorylation plays in its function. Finally, it is plausible that some REEP1 mutations may lead to HSP pathogenesis due to dysfunction of these other processes.</p>
