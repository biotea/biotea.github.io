      <abstract>
        <p>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a collagen-related bone dysplasia. We identified an X-linked recessive form of OI caused by defects in <italic>MBTPS2</italic>, which encodes site-2 metalloprotease (S2P). <italic>MBTPS2</italic> missense mutations in two independent kindreds with moderate/severe OI cause substitutions at highly conserved S2P residues. Mutant S2P has normal stability, but impaired functioning in regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of OASIS, ATF6 and SREBP transcription factors, consistent with decreased proband secretion of type I collagen. Further, hydroxylation of the collagen lysine residue (K87) critical for crosslinking is reduced in proband bone tissue, consistent with decreased lysyl hydroxylase 1 in proband osteoblasts. Reduced collagen crosslinks presumptively undermine bone strength. Also, proband osteoblasts have broadly defective differentiation. These mutations provide evidence that RIP plays a fundamental role in normal bone development.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), or âbrittle bone disease', is a well-known heritable skeletal dysplasia. Affected individuals have low bone mass and increased fracture susceptibility. OI is genetically heterogeneous. Most cases have autosomal-dominant mutations in the type I collagen genes, <italic>COL1A1</italic> or <italic>COL1A2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). More recently, multiple genes causing mostly autosomal recessive forms of OI were delineated, generating a new paradigm for OI as a collagen-related disorder. The products of these genes (<italic>CRTAP</italic>, <italic>LEPRE1</italic>, <italic>PPIB</italic>, <italic>FKBP10</italic>, <italic>PLOD2</italic>, <italic>SERPINH1</italic>, <italic>BMP1</italic>, <italic>SERPINF1</italic>, <italic>IFITM5</italic> and <italic>SPARC</italic>) interact with collagen post-translationally for prolyl 3-hydroxylation, folding, processing, fibrillogenesis, cross-linking and/or mineralization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. No cases of X-linked OI have been reported.</p>
    <p>Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) involves cleavage of membrane-spanning regulatory proteins by proteases within the plane of the membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The three intramembrane cleaving protease (iCLiP) families include serine proteases, site-2 metalloprotease (S2P) and aspartyl proteases. The best-described RIP-mediated signalling in humans involves sequential cleavage of diverse substrates by site-1 protease (S1P), a serine protease encoded by membrane-bound transcription factor peptidase, site 1 (<italic>MBTPS1</italic>), and S2P, encoded by membrane-bound transcription factor peptidase, site 2 (<italic>MBTPS2</italic>). S1P and S2P are located in the Golgi membrane. They cleave regulatory proteins transported from the ER membrane in times of ER stress or decreased sterol metabolites, releasing mature N-terminal fragments that shuttle to the nucleus and activate gene transcription. These substrates include old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS)/cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 1 (CREB3L1), a transcription factor expressed in astrocytes and osteoblasts, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a component of the unfolded protein response pathway and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), involved in cholesterol synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. <italic>MBTPS2</italic> missense mutations were previously identified in the related dermatological conditions IFAP/BRESHECK (ichthyosis follicularis, atrichia, and photophobia, OMIM #308205)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans (KFSD, X-linked, OMIM #308800)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
    <p>In this report, we present two independent OI pedigrees with an X-linked inheritance pattern, and without symptoms of IFAP/KFSD. Linkage analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified a novel <italic>MBTPS2</italic> missense mutation in each pedigree. The resulting substitutions are in or near the S2P NPDG motif crucial for metal ion coordination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Mutant S2P protein is stable but cleavage or activation of S2P substrates OASIS and ATF6, respectively, is impaired, consistent with reduced proband collagen secretion. Osteoblasts with mutant S2P have defective differentiation, and bone tissue collagen from one proband has decreased hydroxylation of the critical crosslinking lysine residue. These X-linked OI-causing mutations extend RIP functioning to normal bone formation.</p>

          <title>Family I</title>
          <p>From an extended Thai OI pedigree, 6 of 12 affected males were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The proband (P1/I; V7) had prenatal fractures of ribs and long bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). At 2 years, his physical exam was notable for moderate short stature, blue sclerae, <italic>pectus carinatum</italic> and bowing of lower extremity long bones. His L2âL4 bone mineral density <italic>z</italic>-score=â4.7 (0.315âgâcm<sup>â2</sup>). Affected adult males had fractures beginning during gestation, short stature, white sclerae, variable scoliosis and pectal deformity, striking tibial anterior angulation and generalized osteopenia (see Case Reports).</p>

          <title>Family II</title>
          <p>A non-consanguineous German pedigree has two affected males, the 26-year-old proband (P1/II) and his 68-year-old maternal uncle (P2/II) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

Each proband had a neutral <italic>COL1</italic> single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that was inherited from his healthy father (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, the urinary lysyl pyridinoline (LP) to hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP) ratio, which has been suggested as a diagnostic marker for OI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, was markedly elevated in an adult from Family I and two adults from Family II (0.305â0.450 patients versus controls 0.211Â±0.008) and in the index case from Family I (0.319 versus paediatric controls 0.208Â±0.030) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis did not reveal imbalances in the critical region, which was then sequenced by NGS in affected male IV17 and unaffected male IV10. After excluding known SNPs, and variants present in the unaffected relative, two candidates remained. A mutation in <italic>MBTPS2</italic> exon 11, c.1376A&gt;G (nucleotide: NM_015884.3, GRCh38) predicting a p.N459S substitution (protein: NP_056968.1), was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of proband DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), segregated with OI in the pedigree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and was absent in 644 X chromosomes of unrelated Thai controls (181 females, 282 males).

In view of the modest positive LOD score, the entire X-exome was sequenced by NGS, resulting in two variants with population frequencies below 0.5% within the 30-Mb critical region.

On western blot, mature intracellular OASIS cleavage fragment (50âkDa, S1P/S2P cleaved) was decreased, while the 55-kDa cleavage product (S1P cleaved) was increased, in fibroblasts with each mutation and in S2P p.L505F osteoblasts, indicating S2P cleavage impairment in OI probands comparable to IFAP and KFSD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

        <p>Tissue and osteoblast characteristics of OI were demonstrated in a bone sample from P1/II (p.L505F). Osteoblasts differentiated in culture revealed impaired expression of transcripts related to osteoblast maturation and RIP pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Alkaline phosphatase (<italic>ALPL</italic>) expression is about half of control in mid- to late differentiation.

Mature OASIS normally complexes with SMAD4 to upregulate expression of matrix genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. However, <italic>SMAD4</italic> transcripts were reduced throughout p.L505F osteoblast differentiation, underlying the reduced expression of the proteoglycan matrilin-1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).

        <p>Collagen extracted directly from P1/II bone tissue had less than half the normal level of hydroxylation of the lysine (K87) critical for collagen crosslinking in both collagen alpha chains (43% versus 90% control in Î±1(I), and 7% versus 43% control in Î±2(I)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We identified an X-linked form of osteogenesis imperfecta in two independent pedigrees. Phenotypic inheritance pattern, linkage analysis and NGS were used to localize the causative gene in each family to <italic>MBTPS2</italic> at Xp22. The gene defects co-segregate with the phenotype in each pedigree and all affected individuals are the sons of obligate carriers. This gene identification extends the inheritance pattern of OI to include X-linked recessive. Notably, the OI phenotype of these <italic>MBTPS2</italic> defects is distinct from that of <italic>PLS3</italic> mutations, which cause an X-linked form of osteoporosis that is mostly apparent in middle-aged adults, but does cause fractures in some children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Unlike <italic>MBTPS2</italic> defects reported here which cause moderate to severe OI, <italic>PLS3</italic> defects do not cause a generalized bone dysplasia, changes in bone shape or structure, or secondary features of OI.</p>
      <p><italic>MBTPS2</italic> encodes S2P, an integral membrane protein critical to RIP and essential for cholesterol metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Mutations previously reported to cause substitutions in S2P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>) underlie a spectrum of dermatological conditions: IFAP syndrome, characterized by a triad of ichthyosis follicularis, atrichia and photophobia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, KFSD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, BRESHECK syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and Olmsted syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The affected individuals in our OI pedigrees do not have any symptoms associated with these conditions, even into adulthood. Both OI-causing substitutions in S2P are located in highly conserved intramembrane residues near the carboxyl end of the protein, and likely contribute to a specialized function. In Family I, the <italic>MBTPS2</italic> missense mutation results in a p.N459S substitution at the first residue of the S2P NPDG motif, which coordinates the zinc metal ion critical to protease catalytic function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In addition, the serine substitution at this site introduces a potential O-GlcNAc glycosylation site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/YinOYang/</ext-link>), and addition of a bulky group might interfere with S2P interaction with its substrates. The Family II <italic>MBTPS2</italic> mutation results in S2P p.L505F. This substitution, in which leucine is replaced with the bulkier phenylalanine, is predicted to be pathogenic by multiple mutation analysis programs and may also interfere with S2P substrate interactions. Interestingly, the nearby p.N508S and p.N508T have a mild IFAP and KFSD phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and most IFAP mutations are located adjacent to this critical region (p.R429-N508)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p>
      <p>S2P and S1P span the Golgi membrane and function sequentially in RIP to process crucial regulatory substrates transported from the ER membrane in times of ER-stress or sterol restriction, including OASIS, ATF6 and SREBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The mature processed proteins then enter the nucleus where they activate pathways involved in cholesterol homoeostasis, unfolded protein response and bone formation. Our demonstration of S2P functioning in human bone development is supported by prior studies on defects of RIP components in animal models. Both S1P and S2P knockdown zebrafish showed abnormal cartilage development, independent of lipid defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Cartilage-specific S1P knockout mice (S1P<sup><italic>cko</italic></sup>) have a lethal chondrodystrophy, with loss of hypertrophic chondrocytes and absent endochondral bone formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. S1P<sup><italic>cko</italic></sup> chondrocytes also display differential downregulation of transcripts related to cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In addition, ablation of the RIP substrate OASIS, a bZIP transcription factor, causes spontaneous fractures and severe osteopenia in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and homozygous deletion of <italic>CREB3L1</italic> (OASIS) causes recessive OI in one family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>
      <p>The <italic>MBTPS2</italic> mutations causing X-linked OI do not impair <italic>MBTPS2</italic> expression or destabilize S2P protein, nor do <italic>MBTPS2</italic> mutations causing IFAP/KFSD. Instead, they disrupt S2P processing of RIP substrates, interfering with their downstream functions. First, both p.N459S and p.L505F fibroblasts and p.L505F osteoblasts display impaired OASIS cleavage. OASIS/<italic>CREB3L1</italic> expression is decreased in p.L505F osteoblasts, as is the expression of its nuclear binding target <italic>SMAD4</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), which, along with the reduced expression of osteoblast maturation marker alkaline phosphatase, indicates a broad defect in osteoblast differentiation. SMAD4 in turn co-activates transcription of matrix proteins such as matrilin-1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), consistent with decreased expression of <italic>MATN1</italic> in OI proband P1/II's osteoblasts. Second, type I collagen secretion is decreased in fibroblasts of all OI probands. The combination of normal collagen expression and reduced collagen secretion found in mutant <italic>MBTPS2</italic> fibroblasts differs from the expected decreased SMAD4 transcriptional activation of <italic>Col1a1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), as well as from the murine <italic>Oasis</italic> knockout, in which reduced <italic>Col1a1</italic> expression was detected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, reduced collagen secretion was not detected in fibroblasts of patients with mutant <italic>CREB3L1</italic> (OASIS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Furthermore, S1P<sup><italic>cko</italic></sup> chondrocytes retain type IIB procollagen due to a trafficking defect but do not exhibit decreased <italic>Col2a1</italic> expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Finally, the activation of RIP substrates ATF6 and SREBP during ER stress and sterol-free conditions, respectively, were significantly reduced in CHO-M19 cells transfected with reporter constructs containing mutant versus normal <italic>MBTPS2</italic>.</p>
      <p>Notably, bone tissue from one X-OI proband revealed an underlying collagen-related defect. Type I collagen extracted directly from P1/II bone had significantly reduced hydroxylation of helical lysine residue 87 (K87) in both alpha chains, consistent with the proband's increased urinary LP/HP ratio. Although bone was not available from P1/I, his elevated urinary LP/HP ratio suggests a similar effect on collagen crosslinking occurs in his bone, while the LP/HP ratio was normal in two X-OI carriers and IFAP/KFSD patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). K87 is critical for collagen crosslinking in bone, which is a major contributor to bone strength<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Similarly reduced hydroxylation of type I collagen K87 to about half of wild-type control values occurs in a <italic>Ppib</italic>/CyPB knockout mouse model of type IX OI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In the <italic>Ppib</italic> knockout mouse, the level of LH1/<italic>PLOD1</italic>, the enzyme which modifies K87, is normal, but its function is impaired by absence of its PPIase, CyPB. In contrast, LH1 protein is reduced in osteoblasts from X-linked OI proband P1/II by an unknown mechanism, although the level of CyPB is normal. Thus, the bone collagen defect in X-linked OI combines reduced collagen secretion into matrix and impaired collagen crosslinking. Disturbance of additional OASIS functions may contribute to the severe skeletal phenotype of X-linked OI, including apoptosis, downregulation of osteocalcin, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein, and ER stress, which overlaps ATF6 activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is apparent that mutations at different positions in <italic>MBTPS2</italic> cause distinct syndromes, with no evidence at this time to suggest a spectrum disorder. A variety of skeletal malformations have been reported in IFAP-family syndromes, specifically vertebral malformation and cleft hands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. For example, the p.R429H IFAP mutation studied in our reporter assays causes vertebral abnormalities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Short stature, inguinal hernia and microcephaly have also been noted in some IFAP patients. However, IFAP patients do not have the fracture susceptibility or generalized bone dysplasia that are the hallmarks of OI. However, the mechanism by which different mutations in <italic>MBTPS2</italic> cause totally different developmental disorders remains unclear. The biochemical studies comparing X-linked OI and IFAP fibroblasts show no clear distinction between phenotypes in cleavage of RIP substrates OASIS, ATF6 and SREBP. The major distinction between syndromes resides in the urinary crosslinks, with elevated LP/HP ratios in X-OI probands and not in X-OI carriers or an IFAP patient. This presents a reasonable hypothesis that impaired hydroxylation and crosslinking of bone collagen is the critical distinction for X-OI versus IFAP. Future studies elucidating the RIP pathways involved in bone development may reveal tissue-specific differences in collagen post-translational modification and crosslinking, or critical S2P bone-related substrates other than OASIS, ATF6 and SREBP. These studies of RIP pathways in bone development are of fundamental importance and will be facilitated by animal models and bone samples from additional patients with both X-OI and IFAP.</p>

        <title>Extended pedigree of Family I with linkage and segregation analyses.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Extended pedigree of Family I. The pedigree contains 12 affected members (blackened symbols), with seven living and five deceased (diagonally crossed). Clinical assessments and blood samples were obtained from 18 individuals (short horizontal bars above symbols), including six affected. Dotted circles denote obligate carriers. Arrow indicates Proband P1/I. (<bold>b</bold>) Linkage and segregation analysis. Thai pedigree shows linkage of mutation with X chromosome and cosegregation of the mutation with phenotype. X-chromosomal markers are shown from Xpter to Xcen (full list of markers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Linked markers in squares are shown in relation to the members' status. The <italic>MBTPS2</italic> c.1376A&gt;G (p.N459S) mutation segregated with phenotype in all affected members. The mutation introduces a <italic>Bsg</italic>I cleavage site, resulting in 375 and 305âbp bands. The normal allele generates the undigested 680âbp band. Marker =100âbp marker; âve, negative control with no DNA added; an arrowhead indicates the 680âbp band. (<bold>c</bold>) Pedigree of Family IIA. The segregation analysis was done on all family members still alive at the time of sampling, that is all but individuals I/1, I/2 and II/4. The index patient P1/II and his maternal uncle P2/II show very similar clinical findings compatible with the diagnosis osteogenesis imperfecta type III/IV. The mother of P1/II is of normal height, whereas the maternal grandmother is only 155âcm (&lt;3rd centile), but does not show any signs of osteogenesis imperfecta.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Mass spectrometric analysis of bacterial collagenase-digested peptides of control and P1/II bone type I collagen. Hydroxylation and consequent glycosylation of Î±1(I)K87 residues, involved in crosslink formation, is decreased in the proband sample by more than one-half, while hydroxylation of Î±1(I)K930 residues is normal, compared with normal control bone.

Despite normal levels of CyPB/PPIB, proband cells have significantly decreased LH1/PLOD1 protein, consistent with decreased hydroxylation of collagen lysyl residues (K87) involved in crosslink formation in extracellular matrix. (<bold>c</bold>) Schematic of RIP-mediated signalling. OASIS, SREBP and ATF6 translocate to the Golgi in response to ER stress or cholesterol depletion, where they are sequentially cleaved by S1P and S2P.
