  <body>
    <p>A molecular diagnosis of monogenic diabetes is clinically important because there are implications for prognosis, treatment, and family members. Consequently, the correct interpretation of a molecular genetic test is paramount, but novel variants continue to be poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). As the cost of DNA sequencing falls, one of the major barriers to genetic testing will be removed and the correct assignment of pathogenicity to novel variants will become more challenging.</p>
    <p>Heterozygous inactivating mutations in glucokinase (<italic>GCK</italic>) cause a subtype of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), which is characterized by stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia, whereas homozygous or compound heterozygous inactivating mutations result in the more severe clinical phenotype of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The opposite clinical phenotype of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (GCK-HH) ensues from heterozygous activating mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In the current study, we explored the pathogenicity of six missense <italic>GCK</italic> mutations that were identified in combination in three probands referred for GCK-MODY molecular genetic testing. Our aim was to use both molecular genetics and functional studies to ensure correct interpretation of the genetic tests.</p>

      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p><italic>GCK</italic> sequencing identified two nonsynonymous mutations in each of the three probands: R43H and G68D (c.128G&gt;A, p.Arg43His and c.203G&gt;A, p.Gly68Asp), E248 K and I225M (c.742G&gt;A, p.Glu248Lys and c.675C&gt;G, p.Ile225Met), and G261R and D217N (c.781G&gt;A, p.Gly261Arg and c.649G&gt;A, p.Asp217Asn). Of these six mutations, five had been previously reported in GCK-MODY subjects (R43H, G68D, E248K, I225M, and G261R) but only the latter functionally characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). All six mutations were absent from 400 normal chromosomes and the October 2011 consensus calls of the 1000 Genomes Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Bioinformatic (SIFT and PolyPhen) analysis only provided clear support for pathogenicity for G68D, I225M, and G261R.</p>
      <p>Molecular haplotyping demonstrated that for two probands, the mutations were in <italic>cis</italic> ([E248K;I225M] and [G261R;D217N]). In contrast, family studies showed that the R43H and G68D mutations were on separate <italic>GCK</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Since both mutations had previously been reported as causal for MODY, the proband would be expected to present with the more severe phenotype of PNDM. However, both the proband and her affected sister (who also inherited both mutations) only exhibited mild fasting hyperglycemia. Moreover, R43H was inherited from the affected father, whereas G68D came from the unaffected mother, thus suggesting that R43H was responsible for the GCK-MODY phenotype. In silico predictions (SIFT and PolyPhen) disagreed with these clinical observations and suggested that G68D was clearly pathogenic, while providing inconclusive results for R43H.</p>
      <p>All six mutations were kinetically analyzed as single mutant proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-2420/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>): three were inactivating, one (R43H-GCK) exhibited near normal kinetics, and two (G68D-GCK and D217N-GCK) were paradoxically mildly activating.</p>
      <p>As basic kinetic analysis of R43H-GCK and G68D-GCK did not demonstrate a molecular mechanism consistent with the clinical data, we explored additional previously established modes of GCK inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These studies provided evidence that R43H-GCK is unstable at the protein level versus wild-type GCK because R43H-GCK showed significantly lower levels of activity compared with wild type over a range of temperatures in a thermolability assay (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-2420/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>), providing a clear mechanism of enzyme inactivation. In contrast, our studies of G68D-GCK showed normal protein stability (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-2420/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>Both double mutants ([E248K;I225M] and [D217N;G261R]) displayed dramatic inactivation and were effectively nonfunctional with drastically reduced turnover numbers and affinity for glucose (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-2420/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <p>Despite heterozygous inactivating <italic>GCK</italic> mutations being a well-established cause of MODY, the three probands in this study were unusual because mutational screening revealed that they each carried two mutations within this gene, thus raising questions about the pathogenicity of these variants and the correct interpretation of the molecular genetic tests. For two of the three probands, both mutations were present in <italic>cis.</italic> We demonstrated that three (E248K, I225M, and G261R) of these four variants were kinetically inactivating and individually sufficient to cause GCK-MODY, whereas the novel D217N variant showed no evidence of inactivation but instead was paradoxically activating due to increased glucose affinity. However, when studied in combination with G261R, the joint effect of both mutations resulted in a severe impact on enzyme function. Despite the deleterious effect on GCK activity caused by carrying these mutations in <italic>cis</italic>, the mild clinical phenotype observed can be explained by compensation from GCK transcribed from the unaffected allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p>
      <p>In contrast, the two previously reported GCK-MODY mutations R43H and G68D were present in <italic>trans</italic>, meaning the mild hyperglycemia observed could not easily be explained because two inactivating mutations in<italic> trans</italic> should cause PNDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Our family studies showed that R43H was inherited from the affected father and G68D from the unaffected mother, thus suggesting a pathogenic mutation and rare neutral variant, respectively. Consistent with these observations, our functional studies demonstrated that although R43H-GCK appeared to have similar basic kinetic characteristics to WT-GCK, there was in vitro evidence of protein instability, indicating that this variant is pathogenic. For G68D-GCK, there was no evidence of protein instability, and the very mild degree of kinetic activation was not predicted to cause hypoglycemia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-2420/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>), supporting this as a rare neutral variant.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study indicates that in silico evaluation is insufficient when assigning pathogenicity to rare nonsynonymous variants and demonstrates the need for both family and multi-tiered functional studies, even when dealing with previously reported âpathogenicâ mutations.</p>
