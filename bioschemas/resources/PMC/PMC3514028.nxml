        <p>Rab10 activation promotes GLUT4 storage vesicle recruitment to the plasma
membrane in response to insulin and coordinates with myosin-Va to mediate
vesicle fusion.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Rab proteins are important regulators of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation
to the plasma membrane (PM), but the precise steps in GLUT4 trafficking
modulated by particular Rab proteins remain unclear. Here, we systematically
investigate the involvement of Rab proteins in GLUT4 trafficking, focusing on
Rab proteins directly mediating GLUT4 storage vesicle (GSV) delivery to the PM.
Using dual-color total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and an
insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP)-pHluorin fusion assay, we demonstrated
that Rab10 directly facilitated GSV translocation to and docking at the PM.
Rab14 mediated GLUT4 delivery to the PM via endosomal compartments containing
transferrin receptor (TfR), whereas Rab4A, Rab4B, and Rab8A recycled GLUT4
through the endosomal system. Myosin-Va associated with GSVs by interacting with
Rab10, positioning peripherally recruited GSVs for ultimate fusion. Thus,
multiple Rab proteins regulate the trafficking of GLUT4, with Rab10 coordinating
with myosin-Va to mediate the final steps of insulin-stimulated GSV
translocation to the PM.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Insulin stimulates glucose uptake into adipocytes and muscle tissues by recruiting
GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (PM). The exocytosis of GLUT4 in response to insulin is
achieved through physical trafficking of storage vesicles enriched in GLUT4 called
GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs) from intracellular sites to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bryant et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Watson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foley
et al., 2011</xref>). A signaling cascade involving PI3K, AKT/PKB, AS160, and
Rab proteins regulates such trafficking. In this cascade, PI3K and AKT/PKB are
activated in response to insulin, causing phosphorylation of the RabGAP protein
AS160 by AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kane et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sano et al., 2011</xref>). When nonphosphorylated, AS160 retains
GLUT4 within the cell by inactivating cognate Rab proteins involved in GLUT4 vesicle
delivery to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sano et al., 2003</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eguez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larance et al., 2005</xref>). When phosphorylated in
response to insulin stimulation, AS160 loses its GAP activity. The cognate Rab
proteins now become active, causing GLUT4 translocation to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sakamoto and Holman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foley et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, PM levels
of GLUT4 increase when cognate Rabs are activated by AS160 knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eguez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larance et al., 2005</xref>), and decrease when cognate Rabs are
inactive with overexpression of AS160-4P, a constitutively active form of AS160
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sano et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>GLUT4 follows a complex intracellular trafficking pathway, passing through early and
recycling endosomes before being resorted into GSVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bryant et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foley et
al., 2011</xref>). This results in a variety of different Rab proteins being
associated with GLUT4-containing compartments. Indeed, membrane fractionation and
immunopurification studies have revealed that Rab2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MÃ®inea et al., 2005</xref>), Rab4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cormont et al., 1993</xref>), Rab8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MÃ®inea et al., 2005</xref>), Rab10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larance et al., 2005</xref>), Rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larance
et al., 2005</xref>), and Rab14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larance et
al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MÃ®inea et al.,
2005</xref>) all associate with GLUT4-containing compartments.</p><p>A major challenge in the GLUT4 trafficking field has been determining what Rab
proteins regulate which steps in GLUT4 delivery to the PM in response to insulin.
Researchers have used numerous strategies to address this question. One approach
measured the response by different Rab proteins to AS160 GAP activity. Although some
candidate Rab proteins were identified, because AS160 GAP activity is likely to be
promiscuous toward multiple Rab proteins, no decisive conclusion could be drawn
regarding the specific role of any of the Rab proteins in GLUT4 trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MÃ®inea et al., 2005</xref>). Another method
monitored insulin-stimulated GTP loading of Rab proteins, identifying Rab8A and
Rab13 as important factors for GLUT4 translocation in muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2010</xref>). Using similar techniques
in adipocytes, however, did not detect GTP loading of the candidate Rab protein
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sano et al., 2008</xref>). An additional
approach, pointing to Rab10, examined how inhibiting particular Rabs affected PM
delivery of GLUT4 in response to insulin stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sano et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2008</xref>). Conclusions from this approach are complicated by potential
mistargeting of GLUT4 before insulin stimulation because GLUT4 traffics through many
different endocytic compartments. It has thus remained unclear what Rab proteins are
involved in GLUT4 translocation to the PM and which are involved in other steps of
GLUT4 trafficking.</p><p>Given the existence of multiple routes for GLUT4 trafficking within the cell, with
different Rab proteins possibly associating with GLUT4 as it traffics through
different compartments, we reasoned that a direct imaging approach of Rab proteins
and their involvement in GLUT4 delivery to the PM would prove valuable. Here, we
used advanced imaging techniques to identify and characterize Rab proteins involved
in GSV delivery to the PM during insulin stimulation in adipocytes. Monitoring GSV
translocation in real time in live cells using the pH-sensitive fluorescence protein
pHluorin and dual-color total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we
screened a library of different Rab proteins for colocalization with GSVs or other
GLUT4 compartments, studying their prefusion and postfusion behaviors and the role
of myosin motors. Our data suggest that Rab10 activation on GSVs underlies
insulin-stimulated GSV recruitment to the PM, with Rab14, Rab4A, Rab4B, and Rab8A
involved in other steps in GLUT4 trafficking. Activated Rab10 on the peripherally
recruited GSV then coordinates with myosin-Va to prepare the vesicle for final
fusion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Diverse Rab proteins reside on GLUT4-containing compartments close to the

proteins known to traffic through endosomal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). Using TIRF microscopy to restrict the field of view
to only â¼90 nm from the PM, we tested whether any of these Rab proteins
overlapped with GLUT4 vesicles close to the PM. Several Rab proteins had
steady-state pools on GLUT4 vesicles close to the PM. Among these, Rab4A, Rab4B,
Rab14, and Rab8A showed the highest frequency of colocalization with GLUT4
vesicles, and Rab10 showed a lower colocalization frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Other Rab proteins either
showed no colocalization with GLUT4 vesicles or did not localize close to the PM
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201111091/DC1" id="supp1">Fig.

under insulin stimulation by TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Individual Rab proteins were tagged with the fluorescent
protein mKO to visualize the dynamics of the vesicles they labeled. Upon
entering the TIRF zone at a steep angle, insulin-responsive GLUT4 vesicles
usually dock at the PM for a short period before undocking or fusing with the PM
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lizunov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). In our image sequences,
insulin-responsive GLUT4-EGFP vesicles near the PM exhibited this behavior
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, GLUT4), as did vesicles
containing mKO-labeled Rab4A, Rab10, or Rab14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The docking behavior displayed by these vesicles under
insulin stimulation included a sudden appearance in the TIRF zone and then
docking at the PM. This was followed by the disappearance of the vesicle, likely
representing the vesicle undocking or fusing with the PM. Vesicles associated
with other Rab proteins either stayed predominantly immobile (exemplified by
Rab7-, Rab8A-, and Rab11-containing vesicles) or often moved laterally
(exemplified by Rab2- and Rab6A-containing vesicles) beneath the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These data suggest that although
many different Rab proteins associate with GLUT4 compartments close to the PM,
Rab4A, Rab10, and Rab14 most likely associate with GLUT4 vesicles undergoing
docking and fusion in response to insulin stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Selective visualization of insulin-responsive GLUT4 vesicles using
insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP)-pHluorin</title><p>To further identify the Rab proteins involved in PM delivery of GLUT4, we used
the GLUT4 vesicle fusion probe, IRAP tagged with pHluorin (IRAP-pHluorin). The
IRAP portion of this probe contains the cytoplasmic and transmembrane region of
full-length IRAP, ensuring that the membrane targeting of this probe is
identical to full-length IRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al.,
2008</xref>). The pHluorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">MiesenbÃ¶ck et al., 1998</xref>) portion of the probe produces a
fluorescence signal in response to a shift from low to high pH. These
characteristics enable the IRAP-pHluorin probe to target to GLUT4-containing
acidic vesicles, similar to full-length IRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kandror and Pilch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ross et
al., 1996</xref>), and to produce a fluorescence signal in response to pH
change when the acidic lumen of the vesicle mixes with the neutral external
environment upon opening of the fusion pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To demonstrate that IRAP-pHluorin can highlight fusion of GLUT4 vesicles at the
PM in this fashion, we transfected IRAP-pHluorin into adipocytes and then
monitored vesicle fusion events by TIRF microscopy. We found that insulin
treatment stimulated numerous vesicle fusions detectable by IRAP-pHluorin
fluorescence at the PM in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A
and B</xref>). IRAP-pHluorin was then coexpressed with GLUT4-mCherry in
adipocytes, and fusion events observed after insulin stimulation were examined
to confirm that the fusing vesicles contained both GLUT4 and IRAP. To monitor
fusion, we tracked the intensities of GLUT4-mCherry and IRAP-pHluorin at the
fusion site by dual-color TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.
2, CâF</xref>). Two types of fusion events were observed, including
full and partial releases. In the full release event shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 (C and E)</xref>, the fusing vesicle was
first apparent in the GLUT4-mCherry channel, followed by a transient rise in the
IRAP-pHluorin signal corresponding to fusion of the vesicle. After fusion, IRAP
and GLUT4 completely diffused away from the fusion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and E</xref>). In the partial release event shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 (D and F)</xref>, only a small
portion of GLUT4 and IRAP were released from the vesicle before the fusion pore
closed again. Afterward, the vesicle continued to stay at the fusion site, with
GLUT4-mCherry intensity persisting over time while IRAP-pHluorin intensity
already dropped back to the background level because of the vesicular lumen
reacidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and F</xref>).
Quantifying the frequency of full and partial release events after insulin

that insulin stimulation in adipocytes mobilized both GSVs and GLUT4-containing
endosomal compartments to deliver GLUT4 to the PM, the compartments labeled by
Rab10 and Rab14 could correspond, respectively, to GSVs and endosomal
compartments. We tested this possibility by examining whether Rab10 or Rab14

characterization of IRAP-pHluorin fusion events, in which â¼30% of the
fusing vesicles were found to contain TfR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.

likely through GLUT4 delivery to the PM. Knocking down Rab14 alone slightly

GLUT4 translocation was observed when Rab10 and Rab14 were knocked down together

Coudrier, 2004</xref>). Three myosin proteins, including myosin-1c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bose et al., 2002</xref>), myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fulcher et al., 2008</xref>), and myosin-Va
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yoshizaki et al., 2007</xref>), have been
implicated in GLUT4 translocation, although their specific roles in this process
remain elusive. To investigate whether any of these myosin proteins localizes on
GLUT4 vesicles, we examined their intracellular localization using dual-color
TIRF microscopy. Myosin-1c distributed on the PM evenly, showing no vesicular
labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). Myosin II localized
to intracellular compartments, but exhibited no overlap with GLUT4 vesicles
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 B</xref>). In contrast, the
short-tail (ST) form of melanocyte myosin-Va (myosin-Va ST), which targets to
membranes in an identical manner to the full-length melanocyte myosin-Va (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu et al., 2002</xref>), displayed substantial overlap with

vesicles, the IRAP-pHluorin fusion assay was performed. A large population of
IRAP-pHluorin fusing vesicles had myosin-Va ST associated with them, whereas
myosin-1c and myosin II were not seen on fusing vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, D, E, and F</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201111091/DC1" id="supp24">Video

adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, G and H</xref>) and could
also be coprecipitated with Rab10 and Rab14 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201111091/DC1" id="supp25">Fig.
S5</ext-link>). Therefore, myosin-Va directly associates with GSVs and
GLUT4-containing endosomal compartments, and this association is likely formed
through the interactions of myosin-Va with Rab10 and Rab14, respectively.</p><p>Myosin-Va ST lacks the actin-binding domain of the full-length myosin-Va.
Therefore, at high expression levels, it can compete with endogenous myosin-Va
to prevent the membrane structures it binds to from interacting with actin
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 1998</xref>). We looked at the
effect of overexpressing myosin-Va ST on IRAP-pHluorin translocation to the PM
to assess the role of myosin-Va in GLUT4 translocation. High expression of
myosin-Va ST in adipocytes substantially reduced insulin-stimulated
IRAP-pHluorin translocation to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, I
and J</xref>), which indicates that engagement of endogenous myosin-Va by
Rab10 on GSVs and Rab14 on GLUT4-containing endosomal compartments is essential
for optimal GLUT4 delivery to the PM. When examined with GLUT4-EGFP in
insulin-stimulated adipocytes, myosin-Va ST-associated GLUT4-EGFP vesicles were
found to stay immobile at the cell periphery for extended times, and were
incapable of fusing with the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9
L</xref>). In contrast, insulin-responsive GLUT4-EGFP vesicles underwent
efficient docking and fusion at the PM in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 K</xref>). Myosin-Va, therefore, appears to be needed for
ultimate fusion of insulin-responsive GLUT4 vesicles. Such a role is consistent
with a recent study showing that the actin network beneath the PM is essential
for GLUT4 vesicles fusion at the PM, but not for their recruitment to the cell
periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lopez et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>GLUT4 follows a complex intracellular recycling itinerary that involves many steps.
These include: GSV formation, release from intracellular retention, translocation to
the PM, docking and fusion at the PM, endocytosis from the PM, and recycling in the
endosomal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>). Rab proteins
are important regulators of many of these steps, but what particular Rab protein
controls which steps has been previously difficult to address. In this study, we
used TIRF microscopy to monitor GLUT4 trafficking under basal conditions and during
insulin signaling, seeking to identify Rab proteins associated with GSVs and their
mode of action on GLUT4 trafficking. Screening a large set of Rab proteins for
colocalization with GLUT4 for association with IRAP-pHluorin vesicles fusing at the
PM in response to insulin stimulation, and for PM recruitment under insulin
stimulation, we discovered that only Rab10 associates with GSVs and mediates GSV
peripheral translocation after becoming activated. The Rab GTPase activation
protein, AS160, negatively regulates Rab10 activity on GSVs, as constitutively
active AS160 prevented Rab10-containing GVSs from translocating to the PM in
response to insulin. Furthermore, we found that Rab10 interacts with the actin motor
protein myosin-Va. This facilitates the translocation of GSVs to sites at the PM
where they can fuse. Consistent with this, high expression levels of a short tail
form of myosin-Va lacking the actin-binding domain decreased GLUT4 delivery to the
PM.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic models of GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes.</bold> (A) In
response to insulin stimulation, Rab10 mediates GLUT4 translocation to the
PM via GSVs, and Rab14 does so via TfR-positive endosomal compartments.
Rab4A, Rab4B, and Rab8A mediate GLUT4 recycling after endocytosis. (B) After
being activated inside the cell, Rab10 attaches to GSVs, recruits myosin-Va,
and releases the intracellular retention of the vesicles. GSVs then move
along microtubules close to the PM. In the periphery, GSVs transition to
actin filaments beneath the PM and use myosin-Va to get into sites on the
PM, where docking and fusion machineries are located.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201111091_Fig10"/></fig><p>These findings help clarify the insulin signaling transduction mechanism that
regulates GLUT4 in the PM of adipocytes. They reveal an important role for Rab10 in
GSV release from intracellular retention, recruitment to, and docking at the PM, and
show that a myosin-Vaâmediated step is needed for ultimate vesicle fusion.
They also provide new insights into the GLUT4 trafficking defects observed upon
knocking down Rab10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sano et al., 2007</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2008</xref>) and a Rab10-specific GEF DENND4C
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sano et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Besides revealing the role of Rab10 in GSV translocation to the PM, we also
discovered that Rab14 mediates insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the PM via
endosomal compartments, which contain both GLUT4 and TfR. Given that Rab14 is also a
AS160 GAP domain substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MÃ®inea et al.,
2005</xref>), this finding reveals an additional pathway for GLUT4 to reach the
PM in response to insulin that is also regulated through AS160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>). The Rab14-mediated endosomal pathway functions in
parallel with the Rab10-mediated GSV pathway to deliver GLUT4 to the PM in response
to insulin. This endosomal pathway could help shift intracellular GLUT4 to the PM
more efficiently under insulin stimulation as well as serve as a backup pathway to
mobilize GLUT4 to the PM in the absence of Rab10. Such a role for Rab14 in GLUT4
trafficking is consistent with the findings that insulin stimulation increases TfR
on the PM (Fig. S2 H), and that ablation of endosomes containing GLUT4 and TfR
reduces insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zeigerer et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>We also found that Rab4a, Rab4b, and Rab8A colocalize with GLUT4, but do not
associate with insulin-responsive GLUT4 compartments. Therefore, they likely
participate in recycling of GLUT4 through endosomal membranes after its delivery to
the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>). This would provide a
mechanism to retrieve GLUT4 back to endosomal compartments and GSVs.</p><p>Our discovery that myosin-Va associates with insulin-responsive GLUT4 vesicles by
interacting with Rab10 and Rab14 provides new molecular insights into how these
vesicles navigate through the dense peripheral actin meshwork to position themselves
for fusion with the PM in response to insulin. Previous studies have revealed a role
for actin in efficient GLUT4 delivery to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Omata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanzaki and
Pessin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lopez et al.,
2009</xref>). Our work suggests how this may occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 B</xref>). By engaging Rab10 on GSVs and Rab14 on GLUT4-containing
endosomal compartments, myosin-Va could bridge individual insulin-responsive GLUT4
vesicles to the actin meshwork beneath the PM, directing them through the dense
actin meshwork and then positioning them into the docking/fusion sites, where the
ultimate fusion event occurs. Myosin-Va ST lacking the actin binding domain
decouples insulin-responsive GLUT4 vesicles from the cortical actin network, leaving
them at the ends of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lizunov et al.,
2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>) and
unable to access docking/fusion sites. Other myosin proteins, including myosin 1-C
and myosin II, do not appear to be necessary for the final steps in GLUT4 delivery
to the PM, although they could be important for earlier steps.</p><p>In summary, we provide live cell imaging data supporting the involvement of multiple
Rab proteins in GLUT4 trafficking. Foremost is the critical role for Rab10 and
myosin-Va in the regulation of GSV dynamics in adipocytes. In association with GSVs,
GTP-bound Rab10 regulates GLUT4 levels in the PM by facilitating the GSVâs
translocation to and docking at the PM in response to insulin. These events are
controlled upstream by insulin through tuning of AS160 GAP activity. Recruited GSVs
with activated Rab10 then engage myosin-Va and other fusion factors to merge with
the PM. In an alternative pathway, Rab14 mediates GLUT4 delivery to the PM via
GLUT4-containing endosomal compartments, also in an insulin-responsive manner. This
helps shift intracellular GLUT4 storage toward a greater buildup of GLUT4 on the PM.
Myosin-Va serves as a common effector of Rab10 and Rab14, preparing
insulin-responsive GLUT4 vesicles for fusion. Rab4A, Rab4B, and Rab8A may then
recycle GLUT4 through the endosomal system after its delivery to the PM, retrieving
GLUT4 back to GSVs and endosomal compartments, where Rab10 and Rab14 regulate their
respective mobilization by insulin. Thus, multiple Rab proteins are important for
ensuring a continuous supply of GLUT4 molecules to the PM for optimal insulin
responsiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>3T3-L1 fibroblast cells were grown in high-glucose DME supplemented with 10%

Hamamatsu Photonics), a HCX Plan-Apochromat 100Ã objective lens (NA 1.46;
Leica), a C-mount 1.6Ã expansion lens, and Leica AF6000 software. During
imaging, cells were kept in phenol redâfree DME (Invitrogen) at
37Â°C. Two-color acquisition was achieved by fast switching excitation
lasers so that images from green and red channels were aligned perfectly. To
capture IRAP-pHluorin fusion events, adipocytes showing no vesicle fusion before
insulin stimulation were preferentially chosen because they usually responded to
insulin very well, producing many fusion events after stimulation.</p><p>ImageJ and custom-written Matlab programs were used to process images. To
quantify colocalization between GLUT4 and Rab proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), 2â3 cells were selected for a particular
Rab protein, and in each cell GLUT4 vesicles in a selected region were examined
for the presence of the Rab protein. In Fig. S2, all vesicles in a particular
region were categorized into GLUT4 only, GLUT4 &amp; TfR, and TfR only based
on the presence of GLUT4 and TfR on the vesicle. Measurements of the intensities
from the fusion site and the adjacent annulus are illustrated in Fig. S3 B and
have also been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et
al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To determine the percentage of Rab-positive and -negative fusion, 2â3
cells were analyzed for each Rab protein. For each cell, a dual-color TIRF
microscopy video of 200 frames with an exposure time (covering a two-channel
cycle) around 200 ms was acquired 3 min after insulin stimulation. Normally,
â¼30â50 fusion events were easily identified in a video.
Categorization of fusion events is quite straightforward in most cases. In a few
cases, where local Rab vesicle density was high, there were chances that a
fusion event could coincidently overlap with one Rab vesicle near the fusion
site. When residing on the IRAP-pHluorin fusing vesicle, Rab10 and Rab14
diffused away along with IRAP-pHluorin after fusion, as did GLUT4 and TfR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>), resulting in similar intensity drops in green
and red channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, G and H</xref>).
However, in cases where coincidental overlap occurred, a similar intensity drop
was not observed (Fig. S3). So the classification criteria used here specified
that a Rab-associated IRAP-pHluorin fusion be counted only if there were similar
intensity drops observed in both channels. The same rule also applied to
classification of TfR and myosin proteins association with IRAP-pHluorin fusion
events.</p><p>To measure the intensity ratio of the TIRF image to the epifluorescence one, the
laser intensity was kept constant for each individual cell, and only the
penetration depth was adjusted. The penetration depth of 90 nm was used for TIRF
imaging, and the laser was straightened up to acquire the epifluorescence image.
All ratios were normalized to the mean value of the control cells. To monitor
and quantify insulin-stimulated GLUT4-EGFP and IRAP-pHluorin translocation to
the PM, TIRF images were first taken under basal conditions, and image
intensities were measured (I<sub>0 min</sub>). Insulin was then perfused, and
TIRF images were taken over 30 min with an interval of 3 min. Intensities
measured over time (I) are normalized with I<sub>0 min</sub> (I/I<sub>0
