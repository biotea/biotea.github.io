        <p id="Par1">DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are mainly repaired by either homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Here, we identify AUNIP/C1orf135, a largely uncharacterized protein, as a key determinant of DSB repair pathway choice.

AUNIP possesses intrinsic DNA-binding ability with a strong preference for DNA substrates that mimic structures generated at stalled replication forks. This ability to bind DNA is necessary for the recruitment of AUNIP and its binding partner CtIP to DSBs, which in turn drives CtIP-dependent DNA-end resection and HR repair. Accordingly, loss of AUNIP or ablation of its ability to bind to DNA results in cell hypersensitivity toward a variety of DSB-inducing agents, particularly those that induce replication-associated DSBs.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious form of DNA damage, which if unrepaired or repaired incorrectly, can contribute to various genetic disorders including cancer, neurodegeneration, and immunodeficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. DSBs can arise as a result of errors during DNA replication, and can be induced by exogenous DNA-damaging agents including ionizing radiation (IR) and various chemotherapeutic drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. DSBs are mainly repaired via two pathwaysânon-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), both of which are highly conserved from yeast to human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. NHEJ is a relatively fast and simple process that involves direct end-to-end ligation of the DSB ends, and this pathway is active throughout interphase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The key players in NHEJ include the DNA end-binding Ku70/80 heterodimer, the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), X-ray cross-complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), XRCC4-like factor (XLF), DNA ligase IV, and the newly identified PAXX (a paralog of XRCC4 and XLF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast to NHEJ, HR is a complex, multi-step repair pathway that requires the sequential activity of a cohort of proteins and occurs primarily in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. HR relies on the presence of a sister chromatid as a donor template, and is initiated by nuclease-mediated extensive 5â²-3â² resection of DSB ends, resulting in long stretches of 3â² single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that subsequently invades the homologous duplex DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. It is now well-established that DSBs are resected in a two-step manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Initially, the evolutionarily-conserved MRE11-RAD50-NBS1/XRS2 (MRN/X) complex and its associated factor CtIP/Sae2 carry out limited resection near the break site to generate a short 3â² overhang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The partially-resected DNA is further processed by two parallel pathways; one that is dependent on the 5â²-3â² exonuclease Exo1 and the other dependent on the concerted action of the BLM/Sgs1 helicase and the Dna2 endonuclease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">While both NHEJ and HR machineries can repair DSBs, choice of the more appropriate DSB repair pathway is key to maintenance of genome stability, especially at the organismal level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To date, a number of determinants have been reported to influence the choice between the two pathways. One of these is cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that efficient DNA end processing is restricted to the S and G2 phases, and is regulated by cell cycle-dependent CDK activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. By preventing HR outside of the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, exchanges between homologous chromosomes are reduced, cells thereby suppress DSB-associated loss of heterozygosity and chromosomal rearrangements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In addition to effects arising from cell cycle, the nature of DSBs also influences choice of repair pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Indeed, although both NHEJ and HR contribute to repair of X- or Î³-ray-induced two-ended DSBs in the S and G2 phases in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, HR-deficient cells are much more tolerant to irradiation, indicating that NHEJ likely plays a more important role in the repair of two-ended DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. By contrast, replication-associated one-ended DSBs are repaired almost exclusively by HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In support of this working model, NHEJ is accountable for the genome instability and cell cytotoxicity phenotypes in HR-deficient cells when challenged with agents known to induce replication-associated DSBs, including camptothecin (CPT, a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how the nature of DSB determines usage of DSB repair pathways.</p>
      <p id="Par5">In this study, we used an affinity purification approach to isolate CtIP-containing protein complexes, and have identified AUNIP/C1orf135 as a primary determinant of DSB repair pathway choice. We show that AUNIP is recruited to DNA damage sites through a DNA-binding motif that shows a strong binding preference for DNA substrates that mimick structures generated at stalled replication forks. We further demonstrate that AUNIP physically interacts with CtIP and is required for efficient CtIP concentration at DNA lesions. Consequently, loss of AUNIP, or ablation of its ability to bind to DNA or CtIP, impaired CtIP-dependent DNA-end resection, compromised HR repair, and resulted in cell hypersensitivity toward a variety of DSB-inducing agents, particularly those that induce replication-associated DSBs. Our results support a model in which AUNIP serves as a sensor of DNA damage, anchoring CtIP to DSB sites to drive CtIP-dependent DNA end resection and ensuing HR repair.</p>

        <title>Identification of AUNIP as a CtIP-associated protein</title>
        <p id="Par6">To further elucidate the role of CtIP in DNA end resection and DSB repair pathway choice, we performed tandem affinity purification (TAP) using a HEK293T cell line that stably expresses SFB-tagged (S-protein tag, Flag epitope tag, and streptavidin-binding peptide tag) wild-type CtIP to isolate proteins that associate with CtIP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Mass spectrometric analysis identified a number of previously reported CtIP-interacting proteins, including the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex, FANCD2, TopBP1, ATM, BRCA1, and BARD1 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary DataÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Intriguingly, we also reproducibly recovered AUNIP/C1orf135<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, a largely uncharacterized protein, as a putative CtIP-interacting protein (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary DataÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). To determine if AUNIP could indeed form a complex with CtIP, we conducted reverse TAP experimentations using a cell line engineered to stably express SFB-tagged AUNIP, and uncovered CtIP, MRE11, RAD50, and DNA2 as major AUNIP-associated proteins (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref> and Supplementary DataÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that AUNIP and CtIP exist in the same protein complex in cells. AUNIP was originally identified as an Aurora-A-interacting protein and has been shown to target Aurora-A to spindle poles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Interestingly, AUNIP does not contain any known functional motifs, and human AUNIP orthologs are found exclusively in vertebrates, such as <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>, <italic>Bos Taurus</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Canis lupus familiaris</italic>, and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Identification of AUNIP as a CtIP-associated protein. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>c</bold> CtIP (<bold>a</bold>) or AUNIP (<bold>c</bold>) protein complexes separated by SDS-PAGE were stained with Coomassie blue. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>d</bold> Proteins identified by mass spectrometric analyses of CtIP or AUNIP protein complexes are listed.

</p>
        <p id="Par7">To verify the TAP-mass spectrometry data, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates derived from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with plasmids that encode SFB-tagged AUNIP together with expression constructs that encode Myc-tagged CtIP, -MRE11, -RAD50, or -NBS1. As shown in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>, AUNIP interacted with CtIP and all three components of the MRN complex, but not with the unrelated protein Morc3. We further carried out reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cells and confirmed that endogenous AUNIP and CtIP proteins formed a complex in vivo (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). The complex formation was not affected by CPT treatment, and was resistant to benzonase treatment, arguing against the possibility that the observed interaction was mediated by DNA/RNA (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Notably, cross-species amino-acid sequence alignment revealed that both termini of the AUNIP peptide are highly conserved (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). We thus tested whether these evolutionarily-conserved regions of AUNIP are involved in its interaction with CtIP. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that AUNIP interacted with CtIP through its conserved C-terminus, since a deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 77 amino acids (1â280) was unable to co-precipitate with CtIP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par8">To test whether the interaction between AUNIP and CtIP was direct, we performed GST pull-down assays using recombinant GST-tagged AUNIP and MBP-tagged CtIP purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, wild-type, but not the 1â280 deletion mutant of AUNIP, directly interacted with CtIP in vitro. Interestingly, the C-terminal region alone (281â357) was also able to directly interact with CtIP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). Altogether, these results suggested that the conserved C-terminal region of AUNIP is necessary and sufficient for its interaction with CtIP.</p>

        <title>AUNIP accumulates at sites of DNA damage</title>
        <p id="Par9">Given that AUNIP exists in a complex with CtIP, we examined whether AUNIP may also be recruited to damaged replication forks or to DNA lesions. Because we were unable to detect AUNIP by indirect immunofluorescence experiments using our in-house anti-AUNIP antibodies, we, therefore, utilized the CRISPR/Cas9-directed recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated gene targeting approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> to integrate an SFB tag onto the C-terminus of the endogenous AUNIP gene (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). DNA sequencing results confirmed that the tag was targeted correctly, and expression of the AUNIP-SFB protein was confirmed on immunoblots probed with anti-Flag antibody (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>).

However, when cells were treated with the topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT, AUNIP concentrated into distinct nuclear foci (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Notably, although AUNIP foci only partially colocalized with RPA2 foci (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>), they were found exclusively in RPA2 foci-positive cells (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>), indicating that AUNIP foci may correspond to perturbed replication forks.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>AUNIP accumulates at perturbed replication forks and at sites of DNA damage. <bold>a</bold> Endogenous AUNIP accumulates at perturbed replication forks.

        <p id="Par11">To determine which domain is responsible for the recruitment of AUNIP to laser-irradiated sites, we generated a series of AUNIP deletion mutants that span the entire AUNIP protein (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), and monitored the recruitment of each of these deletion mutants. Since the very end of the N-terminus of AUNIP contained a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) (K<sup>21</sup>RRK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>) (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e</xref>), we added an NLS to the N-terminus of the 81â357 deletion mutant (lacking the N-terminal 80 amino acids) to ensure its proper nuclear localization. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, aside the NLS-81â357 deletion mutant, all other AUNIP mutants retained the ability to accumulate at laser-induced Î³H2AX-marked DNA damage tracks, indicating that the N-terminus of AUNIP is indispensable for its recruitment to DNA lesions.

        <title>AUNIP promotes HR and inhibits NHEJ</title>

The observation that AUNIP existed in a complex with CtIP and accumulated at DNA damage sites prompted us to test whether AUNIP may be involved in DSB repair. To this end, we used two previously established U2OS cell lines that harbor a chromosomally-integrated copy of the DR-GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> or EJ5-GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> reporter to measure the repair rates of I-SceI-induced DSBs in chromosomal DNA by HR or NHEJ, respectively (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, c</xref>). We first stably overexpressed AUNIP in these reporter cell lines and measured the efficiency of DSB repair. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, overexpression of AUNIP led to a dramatic increase in the frequency of HR. Conversely, overexpression of AUNIP substantially inhibited NHEJ (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

        <p id="Par14">To verify and extend the above findings, we took advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing approach to inactivate AUNIP gene expression in the U2OS DR-GFP cell line. We confirmed the absence of AUNIP in this cell line by Western blotting analysis (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Consistent with the notion that overexpression of AUNIP promotes HR and inhibits NHEJ, knockout of AUNIP led to a dramatic decrease in the frequency of HR (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e, f</xref>). In addition, downregulation of AUNIP increased the frequency of NHEJ (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b, c</xref>). Notably, these effects were not a simple consequence of the changes in cell cycle phase distribution (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par15">To investigate how AUNIP facilitates the HR process, we examined whether AUNIP deficiency may affect RAD51 foci formation in response to CPT. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g, h</xref>, in the absence of AUNIP, CPT-induced RAD51 foci formation were severely impaired. By contrast, AUNIP silencing had no effect on Î³H2AX and 53BP1 foci formation (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3eâh</xref>). Moreover, expression of RAD51 and relevant HR factors were not affected by loss of AUNIP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). To ensure that the observed phenotypes were directly related to AUNIP inactivation, we reconstituted AUNIP-deficient cells with wild-type AUNIP and performed rescue experiments. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3eâh</xref>, re-expression of wild-type AUNIP in AUNIP-deficient cells fully restored RAD51 focus formation and HR repair, strongly indicating that these observed HR defects are associated with AUNIP deficiency. By contrast, re-introduction of AUNIP mutants that were either defective in accumulating at DNA damage sites or in interacting with CtIP did not reverse the AUNIP-associated deficits in HR repair repair (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3eâh</xref>). These results suggest that the ability of AUNIP to localize to DSBs and to bind to CtIP are both critical for its function in DSB repair.</p>

        <title>AUNIP stimulates DNA end resection</title>
        <p id="Par16">The key event that controls the DSB repair pathway choice is DNA end resection, which prevents repair by NHEJ and commits cells to homology-dependent repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Because AUNIP promotes HR and inhibits NHEJ, we speculated that AUNIP might regulate DNA end resection. We, therefore, determined whether knockout of AUNIP in HeLa cells would affect RPA2 foci formation in response to CPT or X-ray treatment. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4aâd</xref>, RPA2 foci formation was markedly impaired in the absence of AUNIP. Similar results were obtained in U2OS cells (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4aâe</xref>). By contrast, AUNIP silencing had no obvious effect on RPA2 foci formation induced by the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU), a drug that can generate resection-independent exposure of ssDNAs by uncoupling the DNA polymerase and the MCM helicase at replication forks (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>). These results suggest that the loss of AUNIP specifically impaired RPA2 foci formation in response to DNA damage. To further substantiate the role of AUNIP in DNA end resection, we used a BrdU-staining method to monitor ssDNA levels under non-denaturing conditions. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g, h</xref>, BrdU foci formation was dramatically reduced in AUNIP-deficient cells, indicating that AUNIP is required for the efficient generation of RPA-coated ssDNA at resected DSBs.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>AUNIP stimulates DNA end resection. <bold>a</bold>â<bold>d</bold> Knockout of AUNIP impairs CPT-or X-ray-induced RPA2 foci formation.

Importantly, defects in RPA2 and BrdU foci formation, as well as dampened RPA2 hyper-phosphorylation, were fully restored by re-expression of wild-type AUNIP in AUNIP-deficient cells, but not by mutants that either lack the ability to localize to sites of DNA damage or bind to CtIP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4jâl</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4f, g</xref>).

        <title>AUNIP promotes CtIP recruitment to sites of DNA damage</title>
        <p id="Par18">To obtain mechanistic insight into how AUNIP contributes to DNA end resection, we assessed whether AUNIP may affect DNA damage-dependent recruitment of factors known to be involved in this process. To this end, we first performed time-lapse imaging of micro-irradiated U2OS cells that stably express GFP-tagged AUNIP, -CtIP or -NBS1 (the GFP tag was added to the C-terminus of NBS1 to avoid unwanted functional deficits) to compare the recruitment kinetics of AUNIP with that of CtIP and NBS1. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>, the recruitment of NBS1 to sites of DNA damage could be observed as early as 25âs after micro-irradiation. By contrast, we observed a substantial delay in the recruitment of GFP-CtIP to laser-induced DNA lesions, compared with that of NBS1-GFP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). These findings are in agreement with previous observations where the MRN complex is required for efficient recruitment of CtIP to sites of DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Remarkably, GFP-AUNIP accumulated at sites of laser-inflicted DNA damage tracks with kinetics similar to NBS1-GFP, indicating that AUNIP might also act upstream of CtIP in DNA end resection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). Indeed, loss of AUNIP significantly and reproducibly hampered GFP-CtIP recruitment to laser-generated DSB tracks (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>). Consistently, loss of AUNIP also impaired the recruitment of CtIP to CPT-induced DNA damage foci (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e, f</xref>). More importantly, wild-type AUNIP, but not its mutants that either lack the ability to localize to sites of DNA damage or in binding to CtIP, completely restored CtIP recruitment to DNA damage sites in AUNIP-deficient cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5câf</xref>). These results, taken together with the observation that CtIP depletion did not noticeably affect AUNIP accumulation at sites of laser-induced DNA damage (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5gâi</xref>), argue in favor of the idea that CtIP functions downstream of both MRN and AUNIP in DNA end resection.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>AUNIP promotes CtIP recruitment to DNA damage sites. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Kinetic studies of accumulation of GFP-tagged AUNIP, NBS1, or CtIP at laser-induced DNA damage sites.

        <title>AUNIP is a structure-specific DNA-binding protein</title>
        <p id="Par20">Having established that AUNIP accumulates at DNA lesions and facilitates CtIP-dependent DNA-end resection, we next sought to determine the mechanism by which AUNIP is recruited to sites of DNA damage. We first examined whether AUNIP recruitment to DNA damage sites may be dependent on the ATM or ATR kinase pathway. As shown in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>, ATM inhibition did not noticeably affect AUNIP recruitment to sites of DNA damage. In line with this notion, depletion of H2AX or RNF8 had no effect on AUNIP concentration at DNA breaks (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b, c</xref>). Moreover, there was also no significant change in the localization of AUNIP to sites of DNA damage using an ATR inhibitor (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). These findings prompted us to hypothesize that AUNIP might be recruited to sites of DNA damage via direct interaction with DNA. To test this hypothesis, recombinant wild-type AUNIP was purified and analyzed in electromobility shift assays against a variety of DNA substrates. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6aâi</xref>, AUNIP bound strongly to splayed arm, 5â²-flap, and 3â²-flap DNA substrates, but only weakly to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), dsDNA with a tail, or ssDNA. Notably, the Î25â70 deletion mutant, which had lost the ability to accumulate at DSB sites, failed to bind to splayed arm under the same experimental conditions(Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6j</xref>).

Moreover, loss of AUNIP resulted in cell hypersensitivity to agents that induced replication-associated DSBs, including CPT, Topotecan (a CPT derivative, also known as CPT-11), and the PARP inhibitor ABT-888 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7câe</xref>).

Consistently, AUNIP silencing decreased the frequency of HR but increased the frequency of NHEJ. Second, AUNIP physically interacted with CtIP and was required for efficient CtIP recruitment to sites of DNA damage and the subsequent CtIP-dependent DNA end resection. Third, AUNIP possessed intrinsic DNA-binding activity, a feature that was required for its relocalization to sites of DNA damage and its function in DNA end resection. Finally, AUNIP-deficient cells showed a marked increase in cellular sensitivity to DSB-inducing agents, particularly to those that induce replication-associated DSBs. Our results provide novel insights into how DSBs are recognized and may be channeled to specific repair pathways.</p>
      <p id="Par23">A scenario is emerging in which the nature of DSBs caused by stalled replication forks is distinct from that caused by X- or Î³-rays. Indeed, ample evidence now indicate that DSBs arising from stalled replication forks are predominantly repaired by HR, whereas those that are induced by X- or Î³-rays are mostly processed by NHEJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, the manner in which these replication-associated DSBs are distinguished from two-ended DSBs in cells is largely unclear.</p>
      <p id="Par24">In this study, we found that AUNIP preferentially bound to DNA substrates that mimicked structures generated at stalled replication forks and was critical for CtIP recruitment to sites of DNA damage. We proposed that AUNIP may serve as a molecular sensor for stalled replication forks, and by tethering CtIP at DNA intermediates generated during replication fork stalling, directs replication-associated DSBs toward the HR repair pathway (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>). On the other hand, since AUNIP displayed low affinities for dsDNA ends, it is tempting to speculate that the CtIP protein may not be fully activated at two-ended DSBs, including those that are generated by X- or Î³-rays (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>). This model thus offers an explanation to address and to further experimentally examine why two-ended DSBs are primarily repaired by NHEJ. Importantly, this model is supported by our observations where AUNIP-deficient cells were hypersensitive to genotoxins that induce replication-associated DSBs, but were only mildly sensitive to X-rays. Thus, the identification of AUNIP represents an important step toward understanding how cells channel repair processes to resolve specific problems associated with DNA damage.</p>
      <p id="Par25">CtIP and its homologs are well-known molecular switches that regulate DNA end resection, and their function in this process is strictly dependent on their appropriate recruitment to sites of DNA damage. However, exactly how CtIP is recruited to DSBs is not fully understood. Studies have shown that the MRN complex physically interacts with CtIP and helps retain CtIP at DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In addition to its direct involvement in CtIP recruitment, the MRN complex also facilitates CtIP recruitment through tethering broken DNA ends and in promoting ATM activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that ATM-mediated CtIP phosphorylation may unmask the DNA-binding motif in CtIP, which then binds to DNA at DSBs, resulting in CtIP recruitment to DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In resemblance to the MRN complex, AUNIP also binds to DNA, forms a complex with CtIP, and is required for efficient CtIP recruitment to sites of DNA damage. However, AUNIP is not involved in ATM activation (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Moreover, DNA damage-induced recruitment of AUNIP and the MRN complex are independent of each other. These results indicate that AUNIP may serve as a DNA-binding module for the AUNIP-CtIP-MRN complex to target specific DNA lesions, and that the multiple DNA-binding modules on the AUNIP-CtIP-MRN complex might play coordinated roles to support full activation of CtIP at sites of DNA damage. In addition to AUNIP, the MRN complex, and ATM, several other proteins including BRCA1, LEDGF/p75, SRCAP, and USP4, are also involved directly or indirectly in recruiting CtIP to sites of DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. However, the mechanistic details with which these proteins cooperate to support optimal recruitment of CtIP is still not clear and warrants further investigation.</p>
      <p id="Par26">In summary, the identification and biochemical characterization of the AUNIP protein described here provides new insights into the molecular mechanism by which DSBs, in particular replication-associated DSBs, may be recognized and repaired in human cells. Understanding the detailed mechanisms and regulation of this process will help in the design of more efficient anti-cancer therapeutics.</p>
