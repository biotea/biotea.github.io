        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>The cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks is orchestrated by the protein kinase ATM, which phosphorylates key actors in the DNA repair network. WRAP53Î² is a multifunctional protein that controls trafficking of factors to Cajal bodies, telomeres and DNA double-strand breaks but what regulates the involvement of WRAP53Î² in these separate processes remains unclear. Here, we show that in response to various types of DNA damage, including IR and UV, WRAP53Î² is phosphorylated on serine residue 64 by ATM with a time-course that parallels its accumulation at DNA lesions. Interestingly, recruitment of phosphorylated WRAP53Î² (pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup>) to sites of such DNA damage promotes its interaction with Î³H2AX at these locations. Moreover, pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> stimulates the accumulation of the repair factor 53BP1 at DNA double-strand breaks and enhances repair of this type of damage via homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. At the same time, phosphorylation of WRAP53Î² is dispensable for its localization to Cajal bodies, where it accumulates even in unstressed cells. These findings not only reveal ATM to be an upstream regulator of WRAP53Î², but also indicates that phosphorylation of WRAP53Î² at serine 64 controls its involvement in the DNA damage response and may also restrict its other functions.</p>

      <p>The <italic>WRAP53</italic> (WD40 encoding RNA Antisense to p53) gene, originally identified in our laboratory as an antisense gene of the p53 tumor suppressor,<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> encodes a WD40 protein WRAP53Î² (also known as WRAP53, WDR79, TCAB1) involved in multiple cellular processes. First, this protein plays a central role in the maintenance of the nuclear organelles known as Cajal bodies, recruiting factors such as the SMN (survival of motor neuron) protein, scaRNAs (small Cajal body-specific RNAs) and telomerase to these bodies.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2-4</sup></xref> Upon loss of WRAP53Î² these organelles collapse and cannot reform, resulting in mislocalization of associated factors.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Second, via Cajal bodies WRAP53Î² targets telomerase to telomeres, thereby regulating their elongation.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Third, WRAP53Î² helps orchestrate the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by recruiting the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 (Ring finger protein 8) to DNA breaks important for both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5,6</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The significance of WRAP53Î² for tissue homeostasis is demonstrated clearly by the finding that inherited mutations in this protein lead to dyskeratosis congenita, a syndrome characterized by failure of the bone marrow and a predisposition to develop cancer.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Moreover, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene or downregulation of this protein predisposes individuals to various sporadic forms of cancer, including breast, ovarian and head-neck cancer, and are also correlated with shorter survival of such patients and resistance of head-neck tumors to radiotherapy.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6,8-10</sup></xref> In addition, overexpression of WRAP53Î² has been detected in some types of tumor, including head-neck,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,12</sup></xref> lung<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and rectal<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> cancer. Even though recent observations demonstrate that overexpression of WRAP53Î² leads to more efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> the clinical relevance of such overexpression in connection with cancer remains vague. Furthermore, the exact manner in which the different functions and regulators of WRAP53Î² are coordinated is not yet clear.</p>
      <p>As with so many other processes, post-translational modifications of proteins, including phosphorylation play a crucial signaling role in the orchestration of cellular responses to DNA damage. The protein kinases related to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase) initiate the damage cascade by phosphorylating nearby molecules of histone H2AX (at serine 139) to form Î³H2AX, a well-established marker of DNA damage and repair.</p>
      <p>Although these kinases all recognize Serine-Glutamine (SQ) and Threonine-Glutamine (TQ) motifs,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,17</sup></xref> with a preference for phosphorylating serine over threonine, their co-factors and the types of damage by which they are activated differ. For example, ATM senses double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation (IR), whereas ATR responds primarily to single-strand breaks, replication stress and bulky lesions induced by ultraviolet (UV) light.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> While often functioning in a manner similar to ATM, DNA-PK is also distinct in acting mainly together with the Ku proteins of the NHEJ repair pathway.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,20</sup></xref> In addition to H2AX, a proteomic screen following induction of DNA damage by IR revealed 700 other potential substrates for ATM/ATR.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
      <p>We reported previously that following exposure of cells to IR, WRAP53Î² is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks by a process that requires MDC1, Î³H2AX and ATM.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> At these sites, WRAP53Î² acts as a scaffold for interactions between RNF8 and MDC1, thereby mediating ubiquitylation of damaged chromatin and promoting recruitment of downstream repair factors (RNF168, 53BP1, BRCA1 and RAD51).<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In the current investigation, we demonstrate that upon DNA damage WRAP53Î² is phosphorylated on serine 64 by ATM and this phosphorylation promotes its localization to DNA double-strand breaks, its interaction with Î³H2AX and, in addition, its role in the repair of these lesions.</p>

        <title>WRAP53Î² is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage</title>
        <p>A proteomic screen previously identified serine residue 64 (S64) on WRAP53Î², as a putative site for phosphorylation by ATM/ATR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.Â 1A</xref>).<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Comparative analysis revealed maintenance of this site and the subsequent glutamine (the SQ motif) throughout evolution, an indicator of its biological importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.Â 1B</xref>). To examine whether in cells WRAP53Î² is phosphorylated at S64, we generated a phosphorylation-specific antibody targeting this site (pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup>). The specificity of this antibody was first confirmed by expressing a WRAP53Î² construct in which serine 64 was mutated to alanine and indeed binding was only obtained to the wild-type (WT) and not the phospho-incompetent variant (S64A) of WRAP53Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.Â 1C</xref>). No major change in protein stability was observed between WT and the S64A mutant of WRAP53Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.Â 1D</xref>). Strikingly, this antibody revealed S64-phosphorylation of Flag-WRAP53Î² in response to DNA damage triggered by a variety of agents, including IR, UV, hydroxyurea, camptothecin and mitomycin C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.Â 1E</xref>).

Furthermore, knockdown of WRAP53Î² attenuated such phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Fig.Â 2B and 2C</xref>), again confirming the specificity of our antibody. WRAP53Î² phosphorylation was more rapid following exposure to IR than UV, in agreement with the relative kinetics of induction of DNA damage by these agents,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and as reflected in the slower formation of Î³H2AX after UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Fig.Â 2D</xref>).

However, detection of phosphorylated WRAP53Î² was weak in comparison to total WRAP53Î², indicating that only a small proportion of this protein is normally phosphorylated at S64.

        <title>Phosphorylated WRAP53Î² accumulates at DNA double-strand breaks</title>
        <p>To determine whether phosphorylated WRAP53Î² is recruited to sites of DNA damage, we employed three different approaches. The first of these was based on U2OS cells in which site-specific DNA double-strand breaks can be induced by FokI endonuclease. These cells are stably transfected with a reporter containing several hundred repeats of the Lac operator (LacO) and expression of an mCherry-tagged Lac repressor (LacI) fused to FokI (mCherry-LacI-FokI) results in binding of LacI to the LacO, in which the nonspecific FokI endonuclease creates double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3A</xref>),<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref> as confirmed here by the formation of Î³H2AX at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3B</xref>). Interestingly, upon formation of DNA breaks in the LacO array, endogenous pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> was recruited to this array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3C</xref>), a pattern observed with different antibodies against WRAP53Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3C</xref>). Next, following laser micro-irradiation, endogenous phosphorylated WRAP53Î² was observed to rapidly re-localize to the sites of DNA damage (laser stripes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3D</xref>). Thus, endogenous pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> is recruited to DNA damaged sites induced by FokI or laser micro-irradiation.

        <p>Finally, we examined whether pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> accumulated in repair foci, which previously has been observed for endogenous WRAP53Î² and as also confirmed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3E</xref>).<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> While we were unable to detect foci formation of endogenous pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> upon DNA damage, phosphorylated WRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> formed foci in irradiated U2OS cells that stably overexpress Flag-tagged WRAP53Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3F</xref>) and these foci clearly overlapped with Î³H2AX foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3F</xref>). The fact that IR-induced foci of pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> were only detected in cells stably overexpressing WRAP53Î² could be due to the weak detection of phosphorylated endogenous WRAP53Î². Foci formation of WRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> overlapping both Î³H2AX and the repair factor RPA2 (replication protein A2) was also observed in cells overexpressing Flag-WRAP53Î² after UV exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3F</xref>). Together, these findings reveal that phosphorylated WRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> localizes to sites of DNA damage induced by IR, UV or FokI, indicating that it performs a function there.</p>
        <p>WRAP53Î² is highly enriched in Cajal bodies and to examine whether this localization depends on phosphorylation of WRAP53Î², cells were transfected transiently with WT or the phospho-incompetent mutant of WRAP53Î² tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). This revealed that the phospho-incompetent mutant of WRAP53Î² accumulated in these bodies to the same extent (or often to a greater extent) as the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3G</xref>). This demonstrates that phosphorylation of WRAP53Î² is dispensable for its localization to Cajal bodies, in agreement with the fact that this protein accumulate in these organelle also in non-irradiated or unstressed cells where the level of pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> should be low.</p>
        <p>We also explored whether phosphorylated WRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> localizes to Cajal bodies. Although co-staining between pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> and the Cajal body marker protein coilin revealed localization of pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> in Cajal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.Â 3H</xref>), this localization was observed less frequently using the pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> antibody (pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> detected in around 50% of Cajal bodies) compared to antibodies targeting total WRAP53Î² (total WRAP53Î² detected in 100% of Cajal bodies).</p>

        <p>It is known that WRAP53Î² facilitates recruitment of repair factors (RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1, BRCA1 and RAD51) to double-strand breaks<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5,9</sup></xref> and we wanted to explore the influence of WRAP53Î² phosphorylation in this context as well. Loss of this protein impairs accumulation of these factors at DNA lesions and we examined whether WRAP53Î² S64A could correct this defect. When constructs encoding siRNA-resistant forms of WT or S64A WRAP53Î² were introduced into cells depleted of endogenous WRAP53Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.Â 4B</xref>), notably, only the WT could restore 53BP1 foci induced by IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.Â 4C and 4D</xref>), clearly indicating that phosphorylation of WRAP53Î² stimulates its recruitment of 53BP1 to double-strand breaks.</p>
        <p>Loss of WRAP53Î² also results in increased amounts of residual Î³H2AX foci 24Â h after IR, due to impaired DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.Â 4E</xref>).<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> While re-introduction of WT WRAP53Î² restored clearance of IR-induced Î³H2AX foci, re-introduction of the S64A mutant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.Â 4E</xref>), again indicating that phosphorylation of WRAP53Î² stimulates its function in repair of double-strand breaks.</p>
        <p>WRAP53Î² has recently been shown to be a rate-limiting factor in the repair of double-strand breaks and overexpression of this protein results in more efficient HR and NHEJ repair and fewer DNA breaks.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Therefore, we asked whether phosphorylation of WRAP53Î² influences HR and NHEJ employing reporter assays that measure restoration of a functional GFP protein by these processes. The HR assay involves U2OS cells stably carrying a construct with the direct repeat (DR)-GFP sequence, in which a single DNA double-strand break can be introduced by expression of exogenous I-SceI endonuclease. Repair of this break by HR creates a functional GFP gene and its expression level provides an accurate measure of the efficiency of HR.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The NHEJ assay is similar, but involves a GFP reporter construct (EJ5-GFP) with two I-SceI sites flanking a <italic>puro</italic> gene. Following cleavage of these sites by I-SceI, the <italic>puro</italic> gene is removed and repair of these double-strand breaks by NHEJ places a promoter adjacent to the GFP gene and allows expression of GFP.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Strikingly, overexpression of WT or S64A of WRAP53Î² in these cells revealed that only the WT had an effect on the efficiency of HR and NHEJ, enhancing these approximately 4 and 3-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.Â 4F</xref>). Thus, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of WRAP53Î² promotes the role of this protein in the repair of double-strand breaks, possibly by facilitating its recruitment to these lesions and interaction there with Î³H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig.Â 5</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In addition to controlling recruitment of factors to and maintenance of Cajal bodies, WRAP53Î² safeguards genome integrity by regulating both telomere elongation and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Regulation of WRAP53Î² itself in connection with these different processes has been unknown, but here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of S64 by ATM controls its role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. In response to various DNA damaging agents, WRAP53Î² is phosphorylated with a time-course that, in the case of IR treatment, parallels the accumulation of this protein at DNA double-strand breaks. Inhibition of the upstream protein kinases ATM, ATR and DNA-PK revealed that only inhibition of ATM completely abolished this phosphorylation in response to IR and UV-induced DNA damage.</p>
      <p>Our findings clearly demonstrate that phosphorylated WRAP53Î² is recruited to sites of DNA damage, induced by the FokI endonuclease, IR or UV, indicating that it plays a functional role at these sites. Indeed, phosphorylated, but not unmodified WRAP53Î² interacts with Î³H2AX, a known interaction partner of WRAP53Î² upon DNA damage. Notably, the known involvement of WRAP53Î² in promoting the interaction between the ubiqutin ligase RNF8 and its upstream partner MDC1 at double-strand breaks does not appear to be influenced by phosphorylation of WRAP53Î², since unmodified WRAP53Î² still interacts with both MDC1 and RNF8. Our finding that the the mutant form of WRAP53Î² that could not be phoshporylated was fully capable of interacting with both RNF8 and MDC1 is in agreement with our previous observations that this binding is independent of both DNA damage and ATM.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Furthermore, this indicates that WRAP53Î² forms a complex with MDC1 and RNF8 prior to DNA damage and subsequent phoshorylation of WRAP53Î² triggers recruitment of this protein complex to DNA lesions. Moreover, we previously showed that this recruitment of WRAP53Î² also requires MDC1,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> as well as RNF8 (data not shown), and these proteins may thus be necessary for stable association of WRAP53Î² with sites of DNA damage.</p>
      <p>To unravel the function of pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> at DNA lesions, we monitored accumulation of the repair protein 53BP1 (formation of 53BP1 repair foci) at these breaks, a process known to require WRAP53Î².<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> 53BP1 is involved in the selection of repair pathway employed upon double-strand break formation and promotes repair via NHEJ.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Strikingly, re-introduction of WT, but not S64A of WRAP53Î² into irradiated cells depleted of this protein could restore formation of these foci, clearly demonstrating that phosphorylation of WRAP53Î² by ATM is required for its role in the repair of double-strand breaks. Moreover, only the WT, but not S64A of WRAP53Î² could resolve residual Î³H2AX foci induced by irradiation of cells lacking endogenous WRAP53Î². In addition, overexpression of WRAP53Î² was recently shown to results in more efficient HR and NHEJ repair. Our current findings demonstrate that only the WT, and not the phospho-incompetent mutant of WRAP53Î² had any effect on the efficiency of HR and NHEJ repair, again indicating that phosphorylation of WRAP53Î² promotes the role of this protein in the repair of double-strand breaks.</p>
      <p>Our finding that only a small proportion of WRAP53Î² is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, provides support for our hypothesis that the protein modified in this manner by ATM plays a specific role in DNA repair rather than the other functions of WRAP53Î². For instance, phosphorylation could trigger re-distribution of WRAP53Î² from Cajal bodies to DNA breaks.</p>
      <p>Indeed, accumulation of pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> in Cajal bodies was detected less frequently compared to the localization of total WRAP53Î² in Cajal bodies, although this could also be due to low amounts of pWRAP53Î²<sup>S64</sup> at this site below the threshold of detection. Moreover, S64A WRAP53Î² accumulated to a greater extent in Cajal bodies than the WT protein, indicating that an inability to become phosphorylated traps the protein at this location.</p>
      <p>In summary, we demonstrate here that in response to DNA damage the Cajal body protein WRAP53Î² is phosphorylated by ATM and that this phosphorylation is important for the recruitment of WRAP53Î² to DNA lesions, its interaction with Î³H2AX, subsequent localization of the downstream repair factor 53BP1 to DNA breaks, as well as for HR and NHEJ repair. The present results represent a first step toward understanding how this multifunctional protein is regulated and, in particular the signals that govern its involvement in repair of DNA damage.</p>
