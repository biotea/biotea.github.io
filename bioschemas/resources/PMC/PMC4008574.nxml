      <abstract>
        <p>The chemokine domain of fractalkine (FKN-CD) binds to the classical RGD-binding site of Î±vÎ²3 and that the resulting ternary complex formation (integrin-FKN-CX3CR1) is critical for CX3CR1 signaling and FKN-induced integrin activation. However, only certain cell types express CX3CR1. Here we studied if FKN-CD can activate integrins in the absence of CX3CR1. We describe that WT FKN-CD activated recombinant soluble Î±vÎ²3 in cell-free conditions, but the integrin-binding defective mutant of FKN-CD (K36E/R37E) did not. This suggests that FKN-CD can activate Î±vÎ²3 in the absence of CX3CR1 through the direct binding of FKN-CD to Î±vÎ²3. WT FKN-CD activated Î±vÎ²3 on CX3CR1-negative cells (K562 and CHO) but K36E/R37E did not, suggesting that FKN-CD can activate integrin at the cellular levels in a manner similar to that in cell-free conditions. We hypothesized that FKN-CD enhances ligand binding to the classical RGD-binding site (site 1) through binding to a second binding site (site 2) that is distinct from site 1 in Î±vÎ²3. To identify the possible second FKN-CD binding site we performed docking simulation of Î±vÎ²3-FKN-CD interaction using Î±vÎ²3 with a closed inactive conformation as a target. The simulation predicted a potential FKN-CD-binding site in inactive Î±vÎ²3 (site 2), which is located at a crevice between Î±v and Î²3 on the opposite side of site 1 in the Î±vÎ²3 headpiece. We studied if FKN-CD really binds to site 2 using a peptide that is predicted to interact with FKN-CD in site 2. Notably the peptide specifically bound to FKN-CD and effectively suppressed integrin activation by FKN-CD. This suggests that FKN-CD actually binds to site 2, and this leads to integrin activation. We obtained very similar results in Î±4Î²1 and Î±5Î²1. The FKN binding to site 2 and resulting integrin activation may be a novel mechanism of integrin activation and of FKN signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Fractalkine (FKN, CX3CL1) is a membrane-bound chemokine of the CX3C family <xref rid="pone.0096372-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096372-Bazan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. FKN is expressed on the cell surface of IL-1- and TNFÎ±-activated endothelium as a membrane-bound form <xref rid="pone.0096372-Bazan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. FKN has an N-terminal chemokine domain (residues 1â76) <xref rid="pone.0096372-Umehara1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. FKN is cleaved by metalloproteinases ADAM-10 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 10) and ADAM-17 and soluble FKN is released <xref rid="pone.0096372-Garton1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0096372-Hundhausen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. FKN's highly selective receptor CX3CR1 (a G-protein coupled receptor, GPCR) is expressed in monocytes, T cell, NK cells, and neuron <xref rid="pone.0096372-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0096372-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Interaction between membrane-bound FKN and CX3CR1 promotes leukocyte adhesion to endothelium <xref rid="pone.0096372-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096372-Fong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096372-Goda1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Integrins are a family of cell adhesion receptors that recognize extracellular matrix ligands and cell surface ligands <xref rid="pone.0096372-Hynes1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Activated integrins support both cell migration and adhesion in a cation-dependent manner. Upon activation, integrins undergo a series of conformational changes that result in increased binding affinity for their respective ligands <xref rid="pone.0096372-Takada1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. FKN enhances cell adhesion through integrin activation that triggers arrest and firm adhesion. It has been well established that FKN-mediated integrin activation is typically mediated by CX3CR1 engagement <xref rid="pone.0096372-Goda1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096372-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0096372-Gerard1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We recently discovered that the chemokine domain of FKN (FKN-CD) binds to integrins Î±4Î²1 and Î±vÎ²3 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The affinity of FKN-CD binding to Î±vÎ²3 is extremely high as an integrin ligand (KDâ=â3.0Ã10<sup>â10</sup> M in Mn<sup>2+</sup>). FKN-CD binds to the ligand-binding site common to other known integrin ligands (classical RGD-binding site). The integrin-binding defective FKN-CD mutant (the Lys36 to Glu/Arg37 to Glu (K36E/R37E) mutant) is defective in FKN signaling, while it still binds to CX3CR1. CX3CR1, FKN-CD, and integrin make a ternary complex through the direct integrin binding to FKN-CD. We propose a model in which FKN on endothelial cells binds to leukocytes through CX3CR1 and integrins (Î±vÎ²3 and Î±4Î²1), and in which integrins are directly involved in FKN signaling and leukocyte trafficking through binding to FKN-CD. We demonstrated that K36E/R37E suppressed CX3CR1 signaling (integrin activation) in a concentration-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0096372-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, suggesting that K36E/R37E is a dominant-negative antagonist of CX3CR1.</p>
      <p>The expression of CX3CR1 is limited to certain cell types. In the present study, we studied if FKN-CD can activate integrins in the absence of CX3CR1. We describe that FKN-CD can activate Î±vÎ²3 in the absence of CX3CR1, but that this activation requires the direct binding of FKN-CD to Î±vÎ²3. We hypothesized that FKN-CD enhances ligand binding to the classical RGD-binding site (site 1) through binding to a second binding site (site 2) that is distinct from site 1 in Î±vÎ²3. We identified a potential FKN-CD-binding site (site 2), which is located at a crevice between Î±v and Î²3 on the opposite side of site 1 in the Î±vÎ²3 headpiece. We provide evidence that FKN-CD actually binds to site 2, and this leads to integrin activation. The FKN binding to site 2 and resulting integrin activation may be a novel mechanism of integrin activation and of FKN signaling.</p>

After washing with PBS, K562, Î±vÎ²3-K562, and Î±4-K562 cells in 100 Âµl RPMI 1640 were added to the wells and incubated at 37Â°C for 1 h. After unbound cells were removed by rinsing the wells with the medium used for adhesion assays, bound cells were quantified by measuring endogenous phosphatase activity.</p>

        <title>FKN-CD activates integrins Î±vÎ²3 in cell-free conditions</title>
        <p>It has been reported that FKN rapidly enhances cell adhesion through activating integrins, which is mediated solely by CX3CR1 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0096372-Schafer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Is FKN totally inactive in CX3CR1-negative cell types? This question is biologically relevant since the expression of CX3CR1 is limited to certain cell types (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>). We first studied if FKN-CD activates integrins in a CX3CR1-independent manner using recombinant soluble Î±vÎ²3 in cell-free conditions. WT FKN-CD markedly enhanced the binding of soluble Î±vÎ²3 (in 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to keep Î±vÎ²3 inactive) to immobilized Î³C399tr, a specific ligand to Î±vÎ²3 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Yokoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, in a concentration-dependent manner, but K36E/R37E (the integrin-binding defective FKN-CD mutant) was defective in this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096372-g001">Figures 1a and 1b</xref>). We obtained essentially the same results using another Î±vÎ²3-specific ligand, the disintegrin domain of ADAM-15 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096372-g001">Figure 1c</xref>), suggesting that this phenomenon is not ligand specific. These results suggest that FKN-CD activates integrins without CX3CR1 in a cell-free condition and this activation requires direct integrin binding of FKN-CD.</p>

        <p>We studied if FKN-CD activates Î±vÎ²3 at the cellular level in a CX3CR1-independent manner. It has been reported that K562 cells do not express detectable CX3CR1 mRNA and do not bind to soluble or membrane-bound FKN, while K562 cells that express recombinant CX3CR1 robustly bind to FKN <xref rid="pone.0096372-Fong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We also confirmed that CX3CR1 is not detectable in Î±vÎ²3-K562 cells by western blotting (data not shown). We studied if FKN-CD induces Î±vÎ²3 activation using K562 cells that express recombinant Î±vÎ²3 (Î±vÎ²3-K562 cells). To reduce the basal levels of integrin activation 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was included in the assay medium. The binding of FITC-labelled Î³C399tr was measured in flow cytometry. Interestingly, WT FKN-CD enhanced the binding of Î³C399tr to Î±vÎ²3-K562 in a concentration-dependent manner, but K36E/R37E did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096372-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). The original observation of FKN-induced integrin activation is enhanced cell adhesion to substrate by FKN in a CX3CR1-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0096372-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We found that FKN-CD can enhance cell adhesion of Î±vÎ²3-K562 cells to ADAM-15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096372-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). These results suggest that FKN-CD can directly activate Î±vÎ²3 in the absence of CX3CR1 and this activation can be detected using different binding assays and different integrin ligands.</p>

        <p>The FKN-induced Î±vÎ²3 activation in Î±vÎ²3-K562 cells may be cell-type specific. So we performed similar experiments using another CX3CR1-negative cells. It has been reported that CHO cells do not express detectable CX3CR1 mRNA and do not bind to FKN or show intracellular signals in response to FKN (Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, MAP kinase activation or AKT activation), while CHO cells that express recombinant CX3CR1 do <xref rid="pone.0096372-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0096372-Kansra1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. We also confirmed that CX3CR1 is not detectable in Î²3-CHO cells by western blotting (data not shown). Using CHO cells that express recombinant Î±vÎ²3 (Î²3-CHO cells), we obtained the results that are very similar to those of Î±vÎ²3-K562: FKN-CD markedly enhanced the binding of Î³C399tr to Î²3-CHO cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but K36E/R37E was defective in this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096372-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). These findings suggest that FKN-CD induced Î±vÎ²3 activation in a CX3CR1-independent manner is not cell-type specific. Thus there may be another mechanism of FKN-CD-induced integrin activation in addition to the well-established CX3CR1-mediated pathway (inside-out signaling).</p>

        <title>Docking simulation predicts that there is a second FKN-CD binding site in Î±vÎ²3</title>
        <p>We demonstrated that FKN-CD activates integrin Î±vÎ²3 in a CX3CR1-independent manner and K36E/R37E is defective in this function, suggesting that this activation involves direct Î±vÎ²3-FKN-CD interaction. If this is the case, since the classical RGD-binding site may be occupied by Î±vÎ²3 ligands (Î³C399tr and ADAM15), it is hypothesized that FKN-CD binds to another binding site. The crystal structure of the active ligand-bound form of Î±vÎ²3, however, contains only one RGD-containing peptide (PDB code 1L5G) <xref rid="pone.0096372-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In our previous study, docking simulation of interaction between FKN-CD and active Î±vÎ²3 predicts that FKN-CD binds to the classical RGD-binding site <xref rid="pone.0096372-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> (designated site 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096372-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). We suspected that the inactive form of Î±vÎ²3, in which site 1 is in a closed conformation, may have an open second ligand-binding site. We thus performed another docking simulation of FKN-CD-Î±vÎ²3 interaction using the inactive form of Î±vÎ²3 (PDB code 1JV2) as a target. The simulation identified a second FKN-CD-binding site (docking energy -24 kcal/mol) (designated site 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096372-g003">Figure 3b</xref>), which is distinct from site 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096372-g003">Figure 3c</xref>).

FKN-CD at 1 Âµg/ml or less induced detectable Î±4Î²1 and Î±5Î²1 activation. S2-Î²3 peptide suppressed FKN-CD-induced Î±4Î²1 and Î±5Î²1 activation, but control GST or S2-Î²3scr peptide did not. These results suggest that WT FKN-CD activates integrins Î±4Î²1 and Î±5Î²1 in a CX3CR1-independent manner through binding to site 2.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study establishes that FKN-CD can activate integrins Î±vÎ²3, Î±4Î²1 and Î±5Î²1 in a CX3CR1-independent manner. We presented evidence that FKN-CD activates soluble Î±vÎ²3 in cell-free conditions and integrins on the surface of cells that do not express CX3CR1. We identified a potential mechanism of CX3CR1-independent integrin activation by FKN. Docking simulation predicted another FKN-CD binding site in the closed form of Î±vÎ²3 (site 2) that is distinct from the classical RGD-binding site (site 1). Notably, a peptide from site 2 (S2-Î²3) directly bound to FKN-CD and suppressed FKN-CD induced activation of integrins Î±vÎ²3, Î±4Î²1 and Î±5Î²1. These findings suggest that FKN-CD directly binds to the newly identified site 2, and this interaction potentially induces conformational changes that enhance ligand binding to site 1. We also showed that peptide sequences corresponding to S2-Î²3 peptide from other integrin Î² subunits bound to FKN-CD. This suggests that site 2 in other integrin Î² subunits may also be involved in FKN-CD-mediated integrin activation. These findings are consistent with the docking model. We did not detect significant binding of FKN-CD to the ligands in ELISA-type binding assays (data not shown). It is unlikely that FKN-CD affects the ligands used (Î³C399tr, H120, and FN8-11) and enhanced their binding to integrins. To detect the FKN-CD induced integrin activation we needed to keep integrin in an inactive state by using assay media that contain 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> or RPMI1640 medium that contains Ca<sup>2+</sup> (approx. 0.4 mM). When Î±vÎ²3 on K562 cells is activated by 1 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup>, soluble Î³C399tr bound to Î±vÎ²3 at a maximal level without FKN-CD, and we did not detect further activation by FKN-CD or inhibition by S2-Î²3 peptide (data not shown). This is consistent with the idea that the direct binding of FKN-CD to site 2 activates integrins that are inactive in the physiological body fluids that contain high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (1.1â1.4 mM).</p>
      <p>We showed that CX3CR1-independent integrin activation by FKN can be detected at 1 Âµg/ml FKN-CD or less in our assay system, suggesting that FKN-CD can induce CX3CR1-independent integrin activation in at FKN concentrations widely used in other studies. We recently reported that FKN-CD has KD of 10<sup>â8</sup> M to integrin Î±vÎ²3 in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (which reduces integrin affinity) <xref rid="pone.0096372-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus it is reasonable that FKN-CD concentration at 0.1â1 Âµg/ml (about 8â80 nM) may be required for FKN to bind to site 2 and activate integrins in the absence of CX3CR1. It is important to note that FKN is expressed as a membrane-bound form (e.g., of endothelial cells), unlike other soluble chemokines, and highly concentrated on the cell surface. Kinetics of interaction between membrane-bound FKN and integrins may be different from that between soluble FKN and integrins. These issues should be addressed in future studies.</p>
      <p>We propose that integrins on CX3CR1-negative cells (such as K562) can be efficiently activated upon binding to membrane-bound FKN (on endothelial cells) in an CX3CR1-independent manner. CX3CR1 is not widely expressed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>). Interestingly only 2 out of 12 human hematopoietic cell lines tested express CX3CR1 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Goda1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Also, 7 breast cancer cell lines, 12 melanoma cell lines tested and their normal counterparts (mammary epithelial cells and melanocytes) do not express CX3CR1 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Our results suggest that FKN may induce integrin activation (and perhaps subsequent phenotype changes) in CX3CR1-negative cells as well, which have not been recognized as target cells for FKN.</p>
      <p>It has been well established that ligand binding to integrins induces global and/or local conformation changes in integrins. Binding of a RGD-mimetic peptide induces changes in the tertiary structure of Î±vÎ²3 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and Î±IIbÎ²3 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> in the Î²3 I-like domain. RGD or ligand-mimetic peptides activate purified, non-activated Î±IIbÎ²3 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and Î±vÎ²3 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Legler1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. This process does not require signal transduction and it appears that RGD or ligand-mimetic peptide triggers conformational changes that lead to full activation of integrins. These findings suggest that these peptides enhance integrin affinity by conformational changes in the headpiece possibly through additional ligand-binding sites in the integrin <xref rid="pone.0096372-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. A previous study suggests that there are two RGD-binding sites in integrin Î±IIbÎ²3, and that one binding site acts as an allosteric site based on binding kinetic studies <xref rid="pone.0096372-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Also, another study suggests that two distinct cyclic RGD-mimetic peptides can simultaneously bind to distinct sites in Î±IIbÎ²3, and the estimated distance between two ligand-binding site is about 6.1 +/â 0.5 nm <xref rid="pone.0096372-Cierniewski1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The possible allosteric ligand-binding site has not been pursued probably because the Î±vÎ²3 structure (ligand occupied, open) contains only one RGD-binding site <xref rid="pone.0096372-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In our docking model the distance between site 1 and site 2 is about 6 nm. Thus, the position of site 2 is consistent with the previous report. Based on previous studies it is likely that the newly identified site 2 has ligand specificity that overlaps with that of site 1, interacts with integrin ligands other than FKN-CD (e.g., RGD), and is potentially involved in integrin regulation in an allosteric mechanism. It is reasonable to assume that FKN-CD binding to site 2 induces global conformational changes in integrins. The open and closed structures of Î±vÎ²3 are superposable, while the specificity loop undergoes conformational changes (0.1 nm shift) upon RGD binding to Î±vÎ²3 <xref rid="pone.0096372-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It is therefore striking that docking simulation distinguished open and closed conformations of Î±vÎ²3. One possibility is that only slight changes in conformation in the headpeice (e.g., specificity loop) are involved in activation and inactivation of integrins. It would be interesting to address these questions in future studies.</p>
      <p>Taken together the present study suggests a new mechanism of integrin activation by chemokine FKN through direct binding to integrins without inside-out signaling. This does not require CX3CR1 expression or signal transduction, and may play an important role in both CX3CR1-negative and -positive cell types. Thus the ligand-site 2 interaction may be a novel target for drug discovery and site 2 peptides may have potential as therapeutics.</p>
