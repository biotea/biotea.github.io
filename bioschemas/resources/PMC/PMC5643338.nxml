        <p id="Par1">Many double-stranded DNA viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus, can establish persistent infection, but the underlying virusâhost interactions remain poorly understood. Here we report that in human airway epithelial cells Epstein-Barr virus induces TRIM29, a member of the TRIM family of proteins, to inhibit innate immune activation. Knockdown of TRIM29 in airway epithelial cells enhances type I interferon production, and in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells results in almost complete Epstein-Barr virus clearance. TRIM29 is also highly induced by cytosolic double-stranded DNA in myeloid dendritic cells. <italic>TRIM29</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice have lower adenovirus titers in the lung, and are resistant to lethal herpes simplex virus-1 infection due to enhanced production of type I interferon. Mechanistically, TRIM29 induces K48-linked ubiquitination of Stimulator of interferon genes, a key adaptor in double-stranded DNA-sensing pathway, followed by its rapid degradation. These data demonstrate that Epstein-Barr virus and possible other double-stranded DNA viruses use TRIM29 to suppress local innate immunity, leading to the persistence of DNA virus infections.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">The airway epithelium and adjacent innate immune cells are responsible for orchestrating defense against inhaled viruses, bacteria, fungi, allergens, pollution, and other environmental insults. The human airway epithelium is a pseudostratified mucosal barrier, consisting of airway epithelial cells (AECs) and other cell types sitting at the interface between external environment and internal milieu of the respiratory tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. AECs are the first line of defense against invading pathogens including viruses in the respiratory tract by providing both a physical barrier and immunological functions. Under normal conditions, mucociliary and barrier functions of AECs help to limit the entry and the foster removal of pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, it has become clear that AECs have a much more active role in the initiation of immune reactions. Under homeostatic conditions, AECs express many pattern recognition receptors including Toll-like receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, RIG-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, C-type lectins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and cyclic GMPâAMP synthase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> to rapidly detect and respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns found in microbes or to damage-associated molecular patterns released upon tissue damage, cell death, or cellular stress. The activation of epithelial pattern recognition receptors on AECs leads to the release of type I interferon (IFN-I), cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides that attract and activate innate and adaptive immune cells, which can function to clear the invading pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, suggesting that AECs play critical roles in host defense against invading pathogens.</p>
      <p id="Par4">Although IFN-I was initially described based on their antiviral properties, it was quickly realized that these cytokines had antiproliferative and anticancer activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These observations ultimately led to the clinical use of IFN-I for the treatment of cancers such as melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and chronic myelogenous leukemia and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is the key adaptor in cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. STING pathway activation with antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment leads to production of IFN-I and the spontaneous generation of antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. STING agonists drive IFN-I production and are therapeutic in mouse tumor models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of antitumor activities by IFN-I should enable improved clinical manipulation of the IFN-I system in cancer.</p>
      <p id="Par5">DNA virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma herpesvirus and an oncogenic virus associated with a large number of human malignancies including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. EBV could infect both, B-memory lymphocytes and epithelial cells, causing a range of lymphoid and epithelial malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Indeed, EBV infection is found in almost all cases of NPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Importantly, high levels of cell-free EBV DNA in blood are associated with poor survival of NPC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, high levels of EBV DNA were detected in NPC patients who relapsed after radiotherapy. By contrast, NPC patients with continuous clinical remission had low or undetectable levels of EBV DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. All these studies suggest a critical role for EBV infection in NPC. However, the mechanism of EBV in transformation in human epithelial malignancies remains unclear. Therefore, understanding the biology of EBV infection in human epithelial cells is crucial to the understanding of the pathogenic role of EBV in human epithelial malignancies including NPC.</p>
      <p id="Par6">In this study, we find that DNA viruses, including EBV, employ TRIM29, which is highly expressed in human AECs and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-induced in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), to suppress the host innate immune response. TRIM29 functions as a key negative regulator of the innate immune response to DNA viruses through targeting STING, leading to the persistence of DNA viruses.</p>

        <title>Human TRIM29 is specifically expressed in AECs and mDCs</title>
        <p id="Par7">Microarray gene expression analysis showed that TRIM29 is specifically expressed in AECs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis showed that TRIM29 is also expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, but not in prostate epithelial cells or renal epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis showed that TRIM29 is highly induced by cytosolic dsDNA poly (dG:dC) in human primary mDCs from one random donor (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). Because nasopharynx AECs are the major target of EBV to induce NPC, we compared the TRIM29 expression levels in both human healthy nasopharyngeal epithelium tissues (normal) and NPC tissues, which are EBV-positive. Microarray gene expression analysis showed that the mRNA level of TRIM29 is indeed higher in NPC than in normal epithelium (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). These data showed that TRIM29 is highly expressed in AECs, dsDNA induced in mDCs and associated with EBV-positive NPCs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The expression of TRIM29 in human cells. <bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold> Human myeloid cells and lymphoid cells were purified from PBMCs using a cell sorter.

        <title>Human TRIM29 plays an important role in EBV-induced NPC</title>
        <p id="Par8">To further investigate the role of TRIM29 in EBV-induced NPC, human healthy airway epithelial cell line BEAS-2B cells, EBV-negative nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP69 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and human NPC cells CNE1 were employed for stable knockdown of TRIM29 expression through the use of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Two distinct TRIM29-targeting shRNA constructs efficiently knocked down the expression of TRIM29 protein among BEAS-2B, NP69, or CNE1 cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2aâc</xref>). We stimulated the cells with dsDNA from VACV-70 or poly(dG:dC) delivered via lipofectamine 3000 for 6âh and measured the production of IFN-I in the cultured cells by quantitative real-time PCR. Knockdown of TRIM29 enhanced the productions of IFN-Î±4 and IFN-Î² by BEAS-2B cells, NP69 cells, and CNE1 cells by up to fourfold in response to intracellular VACV-70 or poly(dG:dC) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2dâf</xref>). Because NPC is caused by EBV infection in human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, we assessed the production of IFN-I by BEAS-2B cells, NP69 cells, and carcinoma cells CNE1 upon EBV infection. Knockdown of TRIM29 enhanced production of IFN-Î±4 and IFN-Î² after EBV infection by up to sevenfold as compared to the controls (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2dâf</xref>). We also measured viral titers of EBV in those cells by quantitative PCR, and found that the EBV viral load was lower in TRIM29 knockdown cells than in control cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2gâi</xref>). In line with these results, knockout (KO) of TRIM29 by CRISPR/Cas9 strategy also enhanced production of IFN-Î± and IFN-Î² in both, BEAS-2B and CNE1 cells, in response to intracellular VACV-70, poly(dG:dC) or EBV infection, and EBV viral loads were lower in TRIM29 KO cells than in control cells (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). These data showed that TRIM29 plays a critical role in suppressing IFN-I production and promoting EBV infection in NPC.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The function of TRIM29 in human airway epithelial cells and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. <bold>a</bold>â<bold>c</bold> Immunoblot analysis of TRIM29 in human bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B cells <bold>a</bold>, nasopharyngeal epithelial cells NP69 cells <bold>b</bold>, or nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells CNE1 cells <bold>c</bold> treated with control shRNA with scrambled sequence (sh-Ctrl), shRNA targeting mRNA encoding TRIM29 (two shRNAs: T29-#a and T29-#b).

        <title>TRIM29 regulates IFN-I production in dendritic cells</title>
        <p id="Par9">Given that TRIM29 is also highly expressed in dsDNA-induced mDCs, we next determined the function of TRIM29 in both human dendritic cells and mouse splenic mDC cell line D2SC by stable knockdown of TRIM29 expression. Two distinct TRIM29-targeting shRNA constructs efficiently knocked down the expression of TRIM29 protein in both human dendritic cells and mouse dendritic cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, c</xref>). Knockdown of TRIM29 enhanced the production of IFN-Î± and IFN-Î² in human and mouse dendritic cells by up to fourfold in response to intracellular herpes simplex virus (HSV)-60, VACV-70, or cGAMP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, d</xref>). These data suggested that dsDNA-induced TRIM29 negatively regulated the production of IFN-I in both human and mouse mDCs in response to cytosolic dsDNA. To further determine the role of TRIM29 in immune cells, we prepared bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from wild-type mice (WT) and <italic>Trim29</italic>-KO mice. We then stimulated those BMDCs and BMDMs for 16âh with VACV-70, HSV-60, c-di-GMP (a ligand of STING), cGAMP, or zymosan. KO of TRIM29 enhanced production of IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 in BMDCs in response to VACV-70, HSV-60, c-di-GMP, or cGAMP twofold to fivefold (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). The kinetics of IFN-Î² expression in WT and KO BMDCs by dsDNA stimulation showed that IFN-Î² expression increased over time until reaching a maximum at around 12âh, and gradually decreased later (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Similarly, compared with WT cells, <italic>Trim29</italic>-KO BMDMs produced twofold to threefold more IFN-Î±, IFN-Î², TNF-Î±, and IL-6 in response to VACV-70, HSV-60, c-di-GMP, or cGAMP (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). By contrast, deletion of <italic>Trim29</italic> had no effect on the production of IFN-Î² and IL-6 in both BMDCs and BMDMs induced by zymosan (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These data indicated a negative role for TRIM29 in sensing viral dsDNA, c-di-GMP, and cGAMP in both human and mouse immune cells. Infectious diseases as a result of DNA viruses, including EBV-induced NPC, are a major health concern worldwide. The common characterization of DNA viruses is to produce dsDNA when infecting the host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. IFN-I production by the host is the frontline antiviral defense strategy, and it is one of the main outcomes of the cytosolic sensing of DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We therefore employed two classical DNA viruses, HSV-1 and adenovirus, to determine the role of TRIM29 in sensing DNA viruses in mouse mDCs. BMDCs from WT mice and <italic>Trim29</italic>KO mice were infected for 6, 12, or 20âh with HSV-1 and adenovirus. KO of TRIM29 enhanced production of IFN-Î² and IFN-Î± in BMDCs in response to HSV-1 or adenovirus infection twofold to fourfold at 6, 12, or 20âh post infection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). Similarly, compared with WT cells, <italic>Trim29</italic>-KO BMDMs produced twofold to fivefold more IFN-Î² and IFN-Î± in response to HSV-1 or adenovirus infection than did WT BMDMs at 6, 12, or 20âh post infection (Supplementary Figs.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

        <title>TRIM29 inhibits the expression of STING</title>
        <p id="Par12">The previous data showed that TRIM29 was highly expressed in human AECs and NPC (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We next determined the TRIM29 expression in different types of human cells with or without EBV infection by quantitative real-time PCR. TRIM29 mRNA was undetectable in both human THP1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In contrast, TRIM29 was highly expressed in human epithelial BEAS-2B cells, non-neoplastic epithelial NP69 cells, and NPC CNE1 cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Importantly, TRIM29 was highly induced in BEAS-2B cells after EBV infection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). To further investigate how TRIM29 regulates dsDNA or DNA virus-induced signaling events, we identified TRIM29-interacting proteins by immunoprecipitation with antibody to TRIM29 (anti-TRIM29) in the mouse mDC line D2SC, followed by protein sequencing by liquid chromatographyâmass spectrometry. We identified STING among the group of TRIM29-interacting proteins (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). KO of STING dramatically reduced the productions of IFN-Î± and IFN-Î² by CNE1 cells after EBV infection (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>), suggesting that STING is essential for EBV-triggered IFN-I production in human NPC. We therefore determined the protein levels of both TRIM29 and STING in those above cells. Indeed, TRIM29 protein was highly expressed in CNE1, NP69, and BEAS cells, but not in THP1 cells and PBMCs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Interestingly, the highly expressed TRIM29 protein in cells could reduce STING expression, while STING was highly expressed in THP1 and PBMC with low TRIM29 expression (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis showed that TRIM29 plays little role in affecting STING mRNA expression among those cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). To further confirm the relationship of TRIM29 and STING in EBV induced NPC, NP69 cells, and CNE1 cells were employed for stable knockdown of TRIM29 expression through the use of shRNA. Knockdown of TRIM29 expression could rescue the high expression of STING in both NP69 cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>) and CNE1 cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). By contrast, knockdown of TRIM29 did not affect the expression of TBK1 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>), a key adaptor in DNA-sensing pathway. Compared with BMDCs from WT mice, the protein level of STING is increased in BMDCs from <italic>Trim29</italic>-KO mice(Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Importantly, the reconstitution of TRIM29 in TRIM29-KO BEAS-2B cells could rescue the TRIM29 expression and reduce the protein level of STING (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>).

        <title>TRIM29 binds and colocalizes with STING</title>
        <p id="Par13">STING is a key adaptor molecule with antiviral activity in the DNA-sensing pathway. Our IP-MS (immunoprecipitationâmass spectrometry) data also showed that STING was among the group of TRIM29-interacting proteins (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We next determined the interaction between TRIM29 and STING in BMDCs at an endogenous protein level. Anti-STING antibody, but not control IgG, could pull down STING and TRIM29 in BMDCs activated by cytosolic dsDNA of HSV-60. By contrast, anti-STING antibody can not pull down TRIM29 without dsDNA stimulation, suggesting that there was indeed interaction between TRIM29 and STING in BMDCs under condition of cytosolic dsDNA stimulation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). To further map the binding sites between STING and TRIM29, we analyzed the interactions among Myc-tagged recombinant STING and truncation mutants of STING and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged recombinant full-length TRIM29 and truncation mutants of TRIM29. As results, both recombinant full-length STING and its truncation mutants, except for aa211â379, 1â160, or 1â110 of STING, interacted with TRIM29, suggesting that the amino acids 161â240 in c-di-GMP-binding domain of STING bound TRIM29 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Additionally, both recombinant full-length TRIM29 and the OmpH domain of TRIM29 bound STING (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Next, we expressed Myc-tagged STING together with HA-tagged full-length TRIM29 (T29) or TRIM29 with truncation of the âC domain (T29-âC, which lacks the STING-binding site) in HEK293T cells to determine their subcellular localization. Immunofluorescence imaging showed STING colocalized with the full-length TRIM29, but not the truncation lacking the STING-binding site (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence of TRIM29 and STING showed that endogenous TRIM29 colocalized with endogenous STING in the cytosol, and TRIM29 translocated to the perinuclear region in BEAS-2B cells after dsDNA stimulation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>).

        <p id="Par14">Because TRIM29 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, we next determined whether STING is the ubiquitination target of TRIM29. We co-expressed HA-STING with Myc-TRIM29 or vector control in HEK293T cells with or without treatment of MG132 and analyzed the expression of STING and TRIM29. As results, TRIM29 could significantly degrade STING, compared with the vector control (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Additionally, the treatment of MG132 could rescue the expression of STING (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>), suggesting that STING is indeed the ubiquitination target of TRIM29 in the proteasome manner. To determine whether the expression of both TRIM29 and STING was regulated by stimulation with dsDNA, we stimulated cells with HSV-60 for 0, 4, 8, or 12âh and then measured the protein levels of TRIM29 and STING in BMDCs. TRIM29 was upregulated in WT BMDCs after stimulation with HSV-60, while STING was downregulated after incubation with HSV-60 due to the degradation by TRIM29 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>).

To further determine whether the ubiquitination of STING by TRIM29 was affected by the mutation of STING, we transfected the HEK293T cells to express Myc-tagged STING or its mutants (K347R or K370R) and HA-tagged full-length TRIM29 with treatment of MG132. Cells were stimulated for 4âh with dsDNA. Cell lysates were prepared and followed by immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged STING. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that both Myc-tagged STING or its mutants (K347R or K370R) and HA-tagged full-length TRIM29 expressed similarly. As expected, the ubiquitination of STING or its mutant K347R was strongly enhanced by overexpression of TRIM29 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>).

      <p id="Par18">Worldwide, one-fifth of cancers in the human population are associated with viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. EBV is a DNA virus associated with NPC. NPC is a cancer arising from the nasopharynx epithelium. About 86,500 cases of NPC were reported worldwide in 2012. NPC is a relatively frequent disease in eastern countries, reaching an annual incidence rate of 40â50/100,000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. EBV is a human cancer-associated dsDNA virus that infects &gt;90% of the global population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Increasing evidence shows that TRIM29 is involved in a variety of cancers. Microarray analysis indicates that TRIM29 is overexpressed in the lung, pancreatic, gastric, bladder, colorectal, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, as well as plasma cell myeloma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. It is shown that upregulated TRIM29 promotes proliferation and metastasis of NPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, the biological function and clinical significance of highly expressed TRIM29 in NPC remain unclear. In this study, we found that human AECs selectively express TRIM29 and its expression can be further induced by EBV infection. Expression of TRIM29 then degrades STING, which inhibits the production of IFN-I and suppresses local innate immune responses. We provide evidence that TRIM29 interacts with STING and induces its ubiquitination at Lys370 site by K48-mediated linkage for protein degradation. IFN-I is a cytokine with a long record of use in clinical oncology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and IFN-I has been shown to kill NPC directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. It is reported that TRIM29 controls the innate immunity against respiratory viral and bacterial infections in the respiratory tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. TRIM29 itself has also been shown to increase aggressiveness of certain cancers including gastric cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and the protein of TRIM29 induces progression of NPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Knockdown of TRIM29 in AECs eliminates EBV infection, a virus that is known in the development of NPC. Deficiency of TRIM29 also enhanced the expression of STING, which plays a critical role in antitumor immunity and cancer immunotherapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. All those studies suggest that TRIM29 is a critical target for NPC therapy. Further studies have shown that TRIM29 was highly expressed in dsDNA-induced mDCs and negatively regulate IFN-I and proinflammatory cytokines productions in response to cytoplasmic dsDNA, STING ligands or DNA viral infection. Importantly, <italic>Trim29</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice infected by HSV-1 or adenovirus exhibited greatly reduced morbidity, enhanced IFN-I and cytokine production, and reduced viral load.</p>
      <p id="Par19">STING exerts pivotal roles in cytosolic nucleic acid-triggered innate immune response. Activation of the STING pathway is a central innate immune-sensing mechanism that leads to IFN-I production in the tumor microenvironment. As tumors with a IFN-I signature correlate with infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the use of intratumoral STING agonists holds promise as a cancer therapeutic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Until now, multiple mechanisms are involved in modulating STING-mediated signal transduction for generating an appropriate immune response. One such mechanism is K48-mediated ubiquitination to degrade STING. It is reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5 induces the K48-linked polyubiquitination of STING at Lys150 for subsequent degradation of STING, thereby downregulating the RNA virus-induced IFN-I response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. However, RNF5 is not expressed in human nasal respiratory epithelium where EBV majorly infected in NPC (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). A recent study has identified TRIM30a as a negative-feedback regulator of the DNA virus-triggered response by targeting STING for degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. However, humans do not possess TRIM30a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. To the best of our knowledge, TRIM29 represents the first E3 ligase to induce STING degradation in human cells. It is reported that TRIM29 induces ubiquitination and degradation of NEMO using an atypical B-box domain as E3 ligase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, TRIM29 may use E3 ligase activity for degrading STING in the same manner. The second mechanism is K63-mediated or K27-mediated ubiquitination or sumoylation of STING for signaling. It has been shown that either TRIM family protein TRIM56 or TRIM32 promotes STING-dependent innate immune responses by inducing the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. It is found that ER (endoplasmic reticulum)-resident autocrine motility factor receptor and the insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) protein complex mediate the K27-linked polyubiquitination of STING and thereby recruit TBK1 for activating efficient downstream signaling transduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. TRIM38 has been shown to regulate the sumoylation of STING<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The third mechanism is to regulate the duration and intensity of STING signaling by phosphorylation. It is reported that cGAMP induces the phosphorylation of STING at S366 by Unc51-like autophagy activating kinase 1, which inactivates STING and then prevents sustained innate immune signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Further studies suggest that the phosphorylation of STING at S366 is required for the direct binding of STING to a positively charged surface of IRF3 and activation of downstream signaling, because the S366A and S366D mutations of STING are inactive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The last mechanism is to regulate the stability of the STINGâTBK1 complex. It was reported that NLRC3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, ZDHHC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, and iRhom2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> mediate the positive regulation of STING signaling to stabilize the STING complex. Although Lys20, Lys 150, Lys224, and Lys 236 have been identified as ubiquitination sites of STING<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, we herein demonstrated that TRIM29 induced the ubiquitination of STING at Lys370 by K48-mediated linkage for protein degradation. Lys370 was identified as the ubiquitination site of STING.</p>
      <p id="Par20">The activation of sensors and adaptors to recognize viral nucleic acids by immune cells is critical for the elimination of invading microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. However, uncontrolled production of IFN-I and cytokines induced by DNA and RNA may lead to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The identification of TRIM29 as a negative regulator of STING in DNA-sensing will have important implications for the understanding of not only antiviral innate immunity but also the pathogenesis of EBV-induced NPC as well as human autoimmune diseases.</p>
