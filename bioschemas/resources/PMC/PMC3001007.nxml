      <abstract>
        <p>Following the mutation screening of genes known to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in index cases from 107 familial ALS (FALS) kindred, a point mutation was identified in vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB), or VAMP-associated protein B, causing an amino acid change from threonine to isoleucine at codon 46 (T46I) in one FALS case but not in 257 controls. This is an important finding because it is only the second mutation identified in this gene that causes ALS. In order to investigate the pathogenic effects of this mutation, we have used a motor neuron cell line and tissue-specific expression of the mutant protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We provide substantial evidence for the pathogenic effects of this mutation in abolishing the effect of wild type VAPB in the unfolded protein response, promoting ubiquitin aggregate formation, and activating neuronal cell death. We also report that expression of the mutant protein in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> motor system induces aggregate deposition, endoplasmic reticulum disorganization, and chaperone up-regulation both in neurons and in muscles. Our integrated analysis of the pathogenic effect of the T46I mutation and the previously identified P56S mutation indicate extensive commonalities in the disease mechanism for these two mutations. In summary, we show that this newly identified mutation in human FALS has a pathogenic effect, supporting and reinforcing the role of VAPB as a causative gene of ALS.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> is a common degenerative disease, causing muscle weakness and atrophy, paralysis, and bulbar symptoms, which eventually leads to death due to respiratory failure within 3â5 years of symptom onset. ALS is caused by loss of motor neurons, and a characteristic pathological feature of the disease is the presence of ubiquitinated inclusions containing TDP-43. The mechanism whereby the disease specifically affects motor neurons is unclear, and current therapy is limited in effectiveness. Major advances have occurred recently with the identification of mutations causing the familial form of ALS (FALS), which is clinically indistinguishable from the sporadic form (SALS), accounts for â¼5% of cases, and shares the same pathological features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Mutations in seven genes are known to give rise to FALS, superoxide dismutase (SOD1), vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB), senataxin, alsin, dynactin, TARDBP, and FUS, which has shed light on the importance of oxidative stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR), protein aggregation, and abnormal RNA processing in the pathogenesis of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Multiple mutations have been described for all of these genes with the exception of VAPB, where only one missense mutation (P56S) has been reported to date, being present in seven Brazilian kindred exhibiting clinically diverse phenotypes, including ALS and late onset spinal muscular atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). No other VAPB mutations have been identified in SALS or other ALS populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) until now, where we report a second VAPB mutation and further provide evidence for its pathogenic effects.</p><p>VAPB is a member of the VAP family, which includes VAPA, an established regulator of vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). VAPB plays a role in the UPR, which is activated when misfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). VAPs are also known to control lipid metabolism and lipid transfer between the ER and other organelles by interacting with proteins such as oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBPs), Nir proteins, ceramide transfer protein (CERT), and Opi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, DVAP-33A (DVAP) controls the number and size of boutons at the neuromuscular junction. Furthermore, loss of DVAP disrupts the synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), causing an increase in miniature junctional potential amplitudes and postsynaptic glutamate receptor clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated pathogenic actions of this novel VAPB mutation, promoting the formation of ubiquitinated aggregates, activating cell death pathways, and leading to the generation of a robust motor phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> in larval neurons, adult eye, and neuromuscular junction of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We have further developed a model of disease through the integration of our findings with those already reported for the P56S-VAPB mutation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Sequencing</title><p>A cohort of 185 FALS kindred was used for this analysis. Patients and families were referred by general practitioners and physicians, and the diagnosis of ALS was carried out according to the El Escorial World Federation of Neurology criteria for diagnosis of ALS with evidence of both upper and lower motor neuron involvement. The mean age at death of patients lacking SOD1 mutations was 55.6 years (confidence interval (CI), 54.3â56.9 years; <italic>n</italic> = 389) and mean disease duration was 3.3 years (CI, 2.7â3.9 years; <italic>n</italic> = 193) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In our study, we used 110 FALS cases from this cohort, where DNA was available, in search of additional mutations in VAPB. The sequencing reaction was carried out with a total of 50 ng of DNA and amplified using primers listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.161398/DC1">supplemental Table S1</ext-link>. PCR products were purified using a Nucleospin extraction kit (Clontech) and eluted in 20 Î¼l of molecular grade water (Sigma). The purified PCR products were sequenced using a forward or reverse primer and the ABI Prismâ¢ BigDyeâ¢ terminator kit. DNA sequencing was carried out using an ABI 377 automatic sequencer.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular Cloning of Wild Type and Mutant VAPBs into GFP and RFP Vectors</title><p>To generate the full-length VAPB fragment, the PCR was performed using 5â² and 3â² VAPB primers (GCCAAAGGTGCTCCGCCGC and CTACAAGGCAATCTTCCC) with a VAPB template purchased from OriGene. This fragment was cloned into pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen) via TA cloning, which produced a N-terminal GFP fusion protein. For generating the RFP fusion VAPB, additional restriction enzyme cutting sequences of EcoRI (GAATTC) and BamHI (GGATCC) were placed at the 5â²-end of VAPB 5â² and 3â² primers, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2 (Invitrogen) via TA cloning and then subcloned into pDsRed2-C1 (Clontech) via EcoRI/BamHI. To introduce the mutations, a traditional two-step mutagenesis PCR was performed as described in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.161398/DC1">supplemental material</ext-link>.

Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To establish VAPB-stable expression cell lines, NSC-34 cells were transfected with either wild type (WT) or T46I-VAPB and were selected in 10% FBS containing DMEM plus 400 Î¼g/ml G418 (Invitrogen).</p><p>For western blotting, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, except for the solubility analysis, which was carried out as described by Kanekura <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Proteins were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE, and blotting was carried out using conditions specified for the antibodies. For immunofluorescence studies, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized for 30 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Nuclei were stained with 0.5 Î¼g/ml DAPI in PBS for 10 min. PBS washes were applied between reagent changes. After the final staining and wash, coverslips were mounted onto slides using Fluorsave reagent (Calbiochem) and left to dry at 4 Â°C overnight.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies for Immunocytochemistry or Immunofluorescence</title><p>Antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (1:3000; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin (1:200; Dako), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-eIF2Î± (1:1000; Cell Signaling), anti-Î²-actin (1:25000; Sigma), peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Vector), and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000; Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Death Analysis</title><p>NSC-34 cells were trypsinized, washed with ice-cold PBS twice, and stained using the annexin V-phycoerythrin apoptotic detection kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

For temperature pulses, to induce a higher expression of the GAL4 protein, flies of the relevant genotypes were left to mate at room temperature for 24 h, and then the parents were removed, and the progeny was shifted to 30 Â°C in a water bath. Site-directed mutagenesis on DVAP cDNA was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Transgenic UAS lines were made by cloning the DVAP cDNA carrying the T48I mutation into the PUAST vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Constructs were injected into the embryonic germ cells, and transgenic lines were established following standard procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Transfections and Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Full-length T48I-DVAP and DVAP ORF constructs were generated by PCR and cloned into Myc- and FLAG-tagged pCMV expression vectors, respectively. COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. COS-7 cells were seeded on poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysine-coated glass coverslips (BD BioCoat) at a concentration of 150,000 cells/ml. The day after, cells were transfected with transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h later, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton-x-100 containing 10% normal goat serum. Staining with the relevant antibodies was performed according to the procedure described under âImmunocytochemistry.â Rabbit anti-Myc (Sigma) and mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) primary antibodies were used at a concentration of 1:500 and 1:200, respectively. Secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were all used at a concentration of 1:500.</p></sec><sec><title>Scanning Electron Microscopy and Eye Histology</title><p>Eyes were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 <sc>m</sc> sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, for 2â3 h and further processed and analyzed as described in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.161398/DC1">supplemental material</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy and Morphological Quantification</title><p>To acquire the two-dimensional images for processing, the bodies were photographed using a digital camera attached to an Olympus stereomicroscope and processed as described in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.161398/DC1">supplemental material</ext-link>. Quantification of the eye phenotype was performed using the Oculus version 1.0 software. Oculus version 1.0 is a tool written in MATLAB, which was developed in house to aid measurement of the size of the adult fly eyes. Unlike the shape selection tools provided in image processing software, such as ImageJ (available at the National Institutes of Health Web site; developed by Wayne Rasband), the Oculus version 1.0 software presented each image at a zoomed out level and permitted the border of the eye to be traced pixel-by-pixel; this method encouraged detailed examination of the boundary and therefore increased the precision of the delineation. Subsequent automated validation operations ensured that the highlighted path was closed and skeletonized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), so the outline could be saved to a data base. The area of each eye was then measured using a flood-fill operation in these enclosed regions, and the number of pixels counted was inserted into a spreadsheet for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Body wall muscles from wondering third instar larvae were dissected and stained according to Chai <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).

The typical ER localization pattern of a weblike distribution within the cytosol extending from the nuclear surface was shown for the WT-VAPB construct, whereas both T46I-VAPB and P56S-VAPB constructs produced VAPB protein aggregates within cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>), as reported previously for P56S-VAPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).

Under normal conditions, the mRNA for the transcription factor, XBP1, contains a premature stop codon and thus produces an immature protein with a short half-life.

The ALS-associated mutations in VAPB, T46I and P56S, abolish the ability of WT-VAPB to activate IRE1/XBP1, as shown in this study.

Interestingly, chromogranin-associated mutant SOD1 is secreted into the extracellular milieu and induces microgliosis and neuronal cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Here we report that the co-culture of WT- and T46I-VAPB-expressing cells results in much greater cell death compared with T46I alone. This observation, together with the finding that untransfected cells cultured with mutant VAPB transfected cells are more likely to contain ubiquitinated aggregates than controls, suggests that mutant VAPB-expressing cells are able to affect neighboring cells that, although not producing the mutant protein themselves, become stressed and eventually undergo cell death. Recent findings have drawn attention to features of amyloid Î² and Ï pathology in Alzheimer disease that are common to prion disease, whereby an abnormal protein causes propagation of protein misfolding between cells (for a review, see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). Such propagation may also occur following transfer from one cell to the next by exocytotic release followed by neuronal uptake, which may also be relevant to non-cell-autonomous processes occurring in ALS.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the N-terminal MSP domain of DVAP is secreted and may act as a ligand of the Eph receptor, and the P58S mutation in DVAP, equivalent to the human P56S mutation in VAPB, inhibits the ability of the WT protein to be secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>). However, because we have been unable to recover any VAPB fragments from the culture medium, it is still undetermined whether the non-cell-autonomous effect is caused by VAPB directly or by the release of other factors triggered by VAPB. It is possible that mutant VAPB is released within exosomes, as has previously been shown for Î±-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>), where the authors suggested that this was a potential process involved in Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Fly Model Expressing Mutant VAPB</title><p>The effect of the newly identified mutation on cellular processes known to play a role in neurodegeneration, such as UPR, accumulation of ubiquitinated aggregates, and cell death, were studied in cell lines. In a parallel and complementary approach, we used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system to assess <italic>in vivo</italic> effects on relevant ALS mechanisms. More specifically, the contributions of different tissues and systems (peripheral motor system, muscle, and central nervous system) to the pathogenic effects induced by the novel mutation were investigated in our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model.</p><p>Previous studies have established <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a suitable model system to study VAP-induced ALS. In particular, a wealth of experimental evidence indicates that human VAPB and DVAP are functionally interchangeable both in loss-of-function and overexpression paradigms. First, many of the fundamental biochemical properties of human VAPB, including its ability to oligomerize and to interact with lipid-binding proteins, are conserved in DVAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). Second, transgenic expression of DVAP carrying the ALS-causing mutation recapitulates many of hallmarks of the human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) (this work). Furthermore, expression of human VAPB in a mutant background for DVAP fully rescues the lethality and the morphological and the electrophysiological phenotypes associated with DVAP loss-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> is an excellent model organism to investigate both the WT function of VAP proteins and their role in ALS pathogenesis.</p><p>Expression of T48I-DVAP throughout the nervous system in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is lethal, and it causes premature death. To investigate the pathogenic mechanisms in more detail, we analyzed the effect of transgenic expression of the mutant allele in particular areas of the nervous system. We have shown that expression of T48I-DVP in neurons of the larval motor system leads to accumulation of intracellular aggregates, and targeted expression into the eye causes cell degeneration. Furthermore, expression of the mutant allele depletes the WT protein from its normal localization and recruits it into the aggregates. As already shown for the P56S mutation (<italic>e.g.</italic> see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the pathogenic allele causes a loss-of-function of WT VAP by a dominant negative mechanism.</p><p>Dramatic ER restructuring has been reported in cell culture systems expressing P56S-VAP allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). Furthermore structural abnormalities in the ER characterized by ER fragmentation and Golgi cisternal dilation have been reported in motor neurons of patients affected by sporadic ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). To test whether this is also the case for the novel identified mutation, we analyzed the ER structure in larval neurons expressing T48I-DVAP. We found that the ER in these transgenic animals appears fragmented, supporting the hypothesis that structural alterations of the ER are a consistent hallmark of ALS and a possible cause of motor neuron degeneration. Finally, these neuropathological features, together with the up-regulation and accumulation of chaperone proteins in clusters, indicate a gradual overwhelming of the neuronal capacity to properly handle the pathogenic DVAPs and identify cellular processes that are likely to be crucial for ALS pathogenesis.</p><p>Heat shock protein induction has been reported in a mouse model with widespread mutant SOD1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), with chaperones being found co-localized with SOD1 inclusions in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). The fact that chaperones do not overlap with DVAP-immunoreactive aggregates is an interesting and distinct feature of fly models for motor neuron diseases when compared with mouse models for the same disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>). A similar result has been reported for the expression of the pathogenic version of SOD1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in which a chaperone response was not present in neurons but in a subset of surrounding glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>).</p><p>Although the presence of inclusions suggests an overwhelming of the neuronal capacity to properly handle the accumulation of the pathogenic protein, the lack of co-localization of these aggregates with Hsp70 suggests that Hsp70 induction may reflect its cytoprotective effect in regulating other pathways, such as autophagy and apoptosis.</p><p>The conventional belief that ALS is exclusively a motor neuron disorder has been recently challenged by the fact that the disease is associated with a broad range of neuropsychological and behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>) and affects non-neuronal tissues, such as muscle, that may exacerbate the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In support of this concept, we showed that expression of T48I-DVAP in muscle is sufficient to induce the accumulation of large intracellular aggregates of the mutant protein. This would, in turn, trigger a local stress response, as occurs in motor neurons, which is characterized by sarcotubular fragmentation and up-regulation of HSP70. The results of this study show that muscle expression of the mutant protein can induce muscle stress and dysfunction independently from the consequences of motor neuron degeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of T46I-VAP on Lipid Dysfunction in ALS</title><p>VAP proteins interact with lipid-binding proteins, such as CERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>), a ceramide transfer protein required for sphingolipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). Interestingly, the Thr<sup>46</sup> residue is located in a conserved core of VAP responsible for binding the FFAT motif and is essential for binding CERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). Therefore, it is very likely that the T46I mutation affects the ability of VAP to interact with these proteins and as a consequence causes dysfunction in lipid metabolism. Furthermore, flies lacking CERT activity exhibit increased sensitivity to oxidative damage, motor disabilities, and reduced life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>), and inactivation of CERT in mice causes dilation of the ER, induction of UPR, and impaired mitochondrial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>), all of which may play a crucial role in ALS pathogenesis. Indeed, ALS patients carrying the P56S-VAPB mutation exhibit hyperlipidemia and increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and more recent studies have revealed that ALS patients are more likely to show evidence of hyperlipidemia compared with controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>). To conclude, data reported here and in earlier studies suggest that a correlation may exist between dysfunction in lipid metabolism and ALS pathogenesis, which warrants further investigation.</p><p>In summary, based on the data presented here and from earlier studies, we propose a model for the effects of ALS-associated VAPB mutations and define putative pathogenic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>). As we have shown here, mutant VAPB has a profound effect on the IRE1 component of UPR, abolishing the ability of VAPB to activate this pathway and thereby impairing induction of ER chaperones and ERAD activity. This in turn prolongs the effects of ER stress. Accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates reflects this abnormality and promotes cell death. This pathway would be augmented by aggregation of mutant VAPB and ER fragmentation. In addition, recruitment of VAPA and wild type VAPB to mutant VAPB dimers could cause dysregulation of lipid trafficking and further reduce cell viability.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec>
