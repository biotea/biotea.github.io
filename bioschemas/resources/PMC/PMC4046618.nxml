        <title>Summary</title>
        <p id="P1">A hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE), (GGGGCC)<sub>n</sub>, in <italic>C9orf72</italic> is the most common genetic cause of the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here we identify a molecular mechanism by which structural polymorphism of the HRE leads to ALS/FTD pathology and defects. The HRE forms DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes with distinct structures and promotes RNAâ¢DNA hybrids (R-loops). The structural polymorphism causes a repeat length-dependent accumulation of transcripts aborted in the HRE region. These transcribed repeats bind to ribonucleoproteins in a conformationdependent manner. Specifically, nucleolin (NCL), an essential nucleolar protein, preferentially binds the HRE G-quadruplex, and patient cells show evidence of nucleolar stress. Our results demonstrate that distinct <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE structural polymorphism at both DNA and RNA levels initiates molecular cascades leading to ALS/FTD pathologies, and provide the basis for a mechanistic model for repeat-associated neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Nucleotide repeat elements, including microsatellites and short tandem repeats, are common in eukaryotic genomes<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Recently, a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE), (GGGGCC)<sub>n</sub>, in a noncoding region of <italic>C9orf72</italic> was linked to the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. ALS is characterized by a loss of motor neurons, with 90% of ALS cases being sporadic and the other ~10% having a family history<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>; the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE represents the most common genetic cause of both familial and sporadic ALS<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. FTD is characterized by degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and is the second most common type of dementia in people younger than 65<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Again, the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE is one of the most common genetic causes of FTD<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Increasing evidence suggests that ALS and FTD are two related diseases in a continuous clinical spectrum<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, and there is a possibility that the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE also contributes to Alzheimerâs and Huntingtonâs diseases<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P3">Normal human <italic>C9orf72</italic> alleles have 2 to 25 intronic GGGGCC repeats, with the majority having fewer than eight repeats and more than half having two repeats<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The expanded repeats associated with ALS/FTD are thought to have variable lengths, ranging from tens to thousands of hexanucleotide repeats<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, but correlations between the repeat lengths and clinical onset or progression have yet to be established. Although a molecular understanding of <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE pathological phenotypes has begun to emerge, the mechanisms by which the GGGGCC repeat expansion causes ALS/FTD pathology is unknown and our understanding of nucleotide repeats in the context of human disease is still in its infancy<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P4">Here we report that the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE DNA/RNA sequence is structurally polymorphic; it can fold into stable G-quadruplex secondary structures and form transcriptionally induced RNAâ¢DNA hybrids known as R-loops. The DNA of the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE forms both antiparallel-and parallel-stranded G-quadruplexes, whereas the RNA adopts only parallel-stranded G-quadruplex conformations. These structural features of the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE lead to truncated HRE-containing abortive transcripts. We identified ribonucleoproteins bound to the repeat RNA in an RNA conformation-dependent manner. Nucleolin (NCL), an essential nucleolar protein that binds specifically to <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE G-quadruplexes, is mislocalized in patient cells carrying the mutation. Accordingly, nucleolar function is impaired in patient cells. Furthermore, this nucleolar pathology can be recapitulated by introducing <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE-containing abortive transcripts into wild-type cells. These results point to the structural conformations of both the DNA and RNA hexanucleotide repeats as fundamental determinants of the pathogenic mechanisms of <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE-linked ALS/FTD</p>

        <title>G-quadruplexes Formed by HRE DNA/RNA</title>
        <p id="P5">To understand how expansion of the GGGGCC repeat in the <italic>C9orf72</italic> gene impedes cellular functions and leads to the associated diseases, we began by examining the repeat sequence for unique structural characteristics. The <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE GGGGCC DNA repeat sequence has properties that would allow it to form G-quadruplexes, which are stacks of planar tetramers consisting of four guanines connected by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. To look for such quadruplexes we first examined the secondary structures formed by the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeats using circular dichroism (CD) absorptivity. The (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> DNA shows a characteristic spectrum for antiparallel G-quadruplexes in 100 mM KCl<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, with a maximum absorbance at 295 nm and a minimum at 260 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). This conformational change at physiologically relevant levels of KCl (100 mM) is also apparent in the decreased mobility of the DNA in a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gel shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P6">To provide further conformational insight into the DNA G-quadruplex formed by (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub>, we used dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting following classical Maxam and Gilbert sequencing methods<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. On the sequencing gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>), the band pattern resulting from guanine depurination is markedly reduced in the presence of KCl, indicating that the guanine N7 positions are protected from DMS methylation and subsequent base cleavage as a result of hydrogen bonding in a G-quartet conformation. These results provide evidence that the (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> DNA forms a four-stack antiparallel G-quadruplex motif, with the guanines on the exterior of the stacks being more accessible to chemical modifications than the guanines buried in the interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). Through a series of spectroscopic characterizations, we observed that the GGGGCC sequence can adopt intermolecular, intramolecular, and also parallel G-quadruplex structures when the number of repeats is varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 1aâf</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Results</xref>). However, the antiparallel G-quadruplex appears to be the most dominant and the most stable conformation at physiologically relevant conditions.</p>
        <p id="P7">We next investigated the structural conformation and stability of the <italic>C9orf72</italic> RNA HRE sequences. Through a series of experiments measuring CD absorptivity, the (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> RNA shows a signature spectrum for parallel G-quadruplexes<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, with a minimum absorbance at 240 nm and a maximum at 260 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>), which is consistent with recent results for similar RNA HRE sequences<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. When the (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> RNA was examined by native PAGE, its mobility is decreased in the presence of 100 mM KCl, in agreement with a K<sup>+</sup>-dependent formation of G-quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P8">To provide further conformational insight, we performed an RNase protection assay. The RNA digestion pattern for endonuclease RNase T1, which cleaves single-stranded RNAs at the 3Â´ end of guanine residues, shows clear structural differences in the presence and absence of KCl. Without KCl, the (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> RNA forms a secondary structure consistent with singlestranded bulges and hairpin regions as indicated by the RNase protection pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of 100 mM KCl the RNA adopts a G-quadruplex structure, in which every fourth guanine is highly sensitive to single-stranded cleavage. This provides evidence for a topology of a three-stacked parallel-stranded G-quadruplex with a guanine and two cytosines in the single-stranded loop region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE RNA preferentially adopts a parallel G-quadruplex topology and is stable at physiological KCl concentrations, pH, and temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 1g</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S4">
        <title>Impeded transcription and abortive RNAs</title>
        <p id="P9">To understand the functional consequence of structural polymorphism at the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE, we examined transcription of the repeat region. First, we established an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assay by creating GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeats of varying lengths (3â70 repeats) <italic>de novo</italic> via repeat-primed PCR, and placing the repeats downstream of a T7 promoter as transcription templates. When <italic>in vitro</italic> transcriptional products are resolved by denaturing PAGE periodic abortive transcripts are observed, with longer repeats producing increasing amounts of truncated transcripts that correspond to the template hexanucleotide repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Importantly, the increase in the abortive transcripts causes a concomitant decrease in full-length transcripts. To quantify this observation, we compared the levels of full-length transcripts, which contain regions downstream (3Â´) of the repeats, with the total levels of all transcripts, which contain regions upstream (5Â´) of the repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). The plot of this 3Â´/5Â´ ratio shows that there is a transition to more abortive transcripts relative to full-length products with increasing repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Furthermore, we verified that the repeat templates were not extensively modified by depurination of the DNA sequence, excluding this potential modification as the cause of the observed abortive transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, these <italic>in vitro</italic> results demonstrate that the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE causes RNA polymerase processivity to be impaired in the repeat region, leading to an accumulation of repeat-containing abortive transcripts and loss of full-length transcripts.</p>
        <p id="P10">Next, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying abortive RNA transcript production. We examined the structural features unique to the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE region on the plasmid DNA and found that, consistent with data on the DNA oligonucleotides in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the plasmid also forms stable G-quadruplexes in the presence of KCl, which was directly assessed by the preferential binding of the G-quadruplex-specific BG4 nanobody<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> to the DNA G-quadruplex structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 3aâb</xref>). The formation of these G-quadruplexes leads to transcripts being aborted earlier and to a further decrease in full-length transcripts in the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assay; these repeat-containing abortive transcripts accumulate over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 3câd</xref>). These results indicate that the formation of G-quadruplexes impairs polymerase processivity within the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE region.</p>
        <p id="P11">Next, we examined the nascent RNA transcript to look for possible mechanistic contributions to abortive transcription. First, using a G-quadruplexâ¢hemin complex-catalyzed peroxidase-like colorimetric assay<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, we demonstrated that the repeat-containing transcripts also form RNA G-quadruplexes, but the formation of these structures on nascent RNA during transcription has negligible effects on the decrease in polymerase processivity (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4aâb</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Results</xref>). However, we noted that treatment with RNase H, which specifically digests RNA in an RNAâ¢DNA hybrid, decreases the accumulation of abortive transcripts and increases longer transcripts during the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 4c</xref>). To test whether nascent RNAâ¢DNA template hybrids (R-loops) form on the GGGGCC repeats, we performed the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assay, and then treated the samples with RNase H and RNase A to remove the RNA in this hybrid state and the excess single-stranded RNA, respectively. In the absence of the RNases, the mobility of the plasmid decreases, and consistent with the heterogeneity of their sizes as a result of R-loop formation, the plasmids migrate as a smear above the previously compact supercoiled/circular plasmid band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Results</xref>). However, upon simultaneous treatment with RNase H and RNase A, the plasmids then migrate as distinct compact bands. The control plasmid shows a minimally altered mobility when compared to the HRE-containing plasmid after treatment with RNase H and/or RNase A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 4dâe</xref>). Together, these results provide evidence that the formation of R-loops is an additional structurally polymorphic feature of the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE that contributes to the abortive transcription mechanism.</p>
        <p id="P12">To further extend our observations concerning <italic>in vitro</italic> abortive transcription to possible truncation of the endogenous <italic>C9orf72</italic> transcript, we examined the production of pre-mRNA transcripts at different positions along the <italic>C9orf72</italic> gene in patient cells. Primers targeting intronic regions immediately upstream (5Â´) of the HRE versus downstream (3Â´) of the HRE region were used with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) to measure pre-mRNA levels. These results indicate that patient B lymphocytes carrying the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE show a significant decrease in the ratio of 3Â´/5Â´ pre-mRNA levels relative to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). This observation was extended to pathologically relevant tissue from patients such as motor cortex and cervical spinal cord. Quantitative measurements of pre-mRNA levels employing NanoString technology<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> show a similar decrease in the ratio of 3Â´/5Â´ pre-mRNA levels in patients carrying the HRE.

        <p id="P13">Since the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE can generate both full-length and abortive transcripts capable of forming RNA G-quadruplexes, we explored conformation-dependent protein interactions associated with the RNA repeat sequences. Biotinylated (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> RNAs, in either G-quadruplex or hairpin conformations, and antisense (CCCCGG)<sub>4</sub> hairpin RNAs were conjugated to streptavidin beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 1h</xref>). In order to comprehensively and quantitatively identify the conformation-dependent ribonucleoprotein complexes formed by these HRE RNAs, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> using HEK293T cells grown in medium containing normal, medium, or heavy amino acids prior to performing the RNA pulldown as shown in Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. In brief, labeled cell lysates were incubated with RNA-conjugated streptavidin beads and the isolated ribonucleoprotein complexes were washed with increasing KCl concentrations to remove proteins that were loosely associated with the RNA or with other proteins. Then the final eluted fractions were analyzed for complexes binding the (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> G-quadruplex, (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> hairpin, and (CCCCGG)<sub>4</sub> hairpin with the respective labels by mass spectrometry. The SILAC analysis provided a list of 288 proteins with quantitation of their binding preferences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) for the various RNA structures formed by the sense GGGGCC or the antisense CCCCGG sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P14">To confirm the specificity of the major proteins in binding to the various RNA structures identified by SILAC, we performed Western blot analysis on the increasingly stringent fractions from the RNA pulldown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). NCL and hnRNP U preferentially recognize the RNA G-quadruplex motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3aâc</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figure 6</xref>). The protein hnRNP F and RPL7, a, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein and a ribosomal protein, respectively, prefer guanine-rich RNA and bind both the G-quadruplex and the alternative hairpin of the GGGGCC repeat. The protein hnRNP K, an RNA-binding protein that binds cytosine-rich RNA, shows preferential binding to the antisense CCCCGG repeat. Differential KCl salt elution indicates that while the ribonucleoprotein complexes with hnRNP U or hnRNP F are more easily destabilized with increasing KCl, the interactions with NCL or RPL7 are more robust and survive high KCl concentrations. These results are in accordance with the SILAC quantitative analysis. To further demonstrate that NCL binds directly to the G-quadruplex motif, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA pulldown with a recombinant GST-NCL fusion protein. NCL was shown to preferentially pull down the (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> RNA G-quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>).

        <p id="P15">To investigate the consequences of the specific binding of NCL, a principal component of the nucleolus<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> to G-quadruplex complexes formed by the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE RNA, we examined phenotypic differences in the cellular localization of NCL in <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE patient cells and controls. In control B lymphocyte cells, endogenous NCL immunofluorescent (IF) staining is condensed in the nucleolus. In contrast, the nucleolus appears more fractured and NCL is more dispersed throughout the nucleus in patient cells carrying the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE, as shown in heat maps indicating the NCL density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Quantitation of NCL distribution in the nuclei of patient and control cells confirms a significant shift of NCL away from dense nucleoli to a more dispersed localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7a</xref>). This NCL pathology is also observed in <italic>C9orf72</italic> patient fibroblasts, but not in fibroblasts from non-ALS or non-<italic>C9orf72</italic> ALS controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7a</xref>). Next, we examined the NCL localization pattern in iPS motor neuron cells derived from patient fibroblasts<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. As seen for the B lymphocytes, IF staining for NCL in disease-relevant motor neurons from patients with the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE shows NCL dispersion that occupies a significantly increased area of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7a</xref>). No obvious phenotypic differences were observed for hnRNP F, hnRNP U, or hnRNP K between <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE B lymphocytes and those of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P16">To confirm the association of NCL with <italic>C9orf72</italic> repeat RNA in pathologically relevant patient tissues of ALS/FTD patients with the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE, we performed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in combination with NCL immunostaining in motor cortex tissues from these patients. The distribution of NCL in postmortem tissues appears variable; however, it is evident that NCL frequently colocalizes with the GGGGCC RNA foci in the neurons of the motor cortex only in <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE ALS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7c</xref>). These results support the interaction of NCL and the GGGGCC repeat transcripts in vivo and suggest the possible occurrence of functional defects associated with nucleolar stress in ALS/FTD patients.</p>
        <p id="P17">Next, we examined whether the NCL mislocalization and nucleolar stress in the patient cells were caused by a gain in toxicity of the aberrant <italic>C9orf72</italic> RNA. To directly address this question, we transfected HEK293T cells with the abortive transcripts generated in the aforementioned <italic>in vitro</italic> reactions. Treatment with the 21-repeat-containing abortive transcripts recapitulates the NCL pathology observed in patient cells carrying the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE: NCL is significantly more dispersed in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7f</xref>). Furthermore, the transfected HRE transcriptional products show a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability compared to a control transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7g</xref>). Thus, our results establish a direct link between abortive <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE transcripts, cytotoxicity, and patient pathology.</p>
        <p id="P18">The mislocalization of another nucleolar component, nucleophosmin/B23, in B lymphocytes carrying the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE further indicates general nucleolar stress (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figure 8aâb</xref>). To determine whether the functions of the nucleolus are impaired in patient cells and tissues, we used qRT-PCR to measure the processing and maturation of the 45S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Figure 8c</xref>). The results show a decrease in the processing of the precursor 45S rRNA into the mature cleaved 28S, 18S, and 5.8S rRNAs in <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE patient B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Figure 8d</xref>). Furthermore, this rRNA maturation is significantly decreased in the motor cortex tissues from ALS patients carrying the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Figure 8d</xref>). Taken together, these results identify a functional defect involving the biochemical effects of the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE in nucleolar stress and directly link this defect to disease pathology.</p>
        <p id="P19">Next, to examine other RNA-related functional defects that could arise in addition to the chronic nucleolar stress identified in <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE patients, we measured the abundance of processing bodies (P bodies) in patient-derived motor neurons. P bodies, which are composed of ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in the degradation of untranslated mRNAs<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, are significantly increased in number, but not size, in iPS motor neurons from patients carrying the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Figure 9a â b</xref>). This increase in P bodies is consistent with observations of decreased ribosomal maturation caused by nucleolar stress, which can then lead to increased untranslated mRNA in the cytoplasm and to a global perturbation in RNA processing.</p>
        <p id="P20">Finally, to test whether the cells of patients harboring the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE are more sensitive to proteotoxic stress, we treated the iPS motor neurons with tunicamycin, which induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response. <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE patient neurons show a dose-dependent increase in sensitivity to tunicamycin compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Figure 9câd</xref>).

Two primer sets were designed using Primer 3 (v.0.4.0) to recognize an intronic region upstream (5Â´) of the repeats and an intronic region downstream (3Â´), respectively, one corresponding to a position between exon 1A and the repeats, and the other located in intron 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). qRT-PCR was performed using an IQ<sup>â¢</sup> SybrÂ®Green kit (Biorad) and following manufacturerâs recommended thermocycler settings. Fluorescence was measured on a mini-Opticon (Biorad) and C<sub>T</sub> values were analyzed using the accompanying software. The 3Â´ C<sub>T</sub> values were normalized to the 5Â´ C<sub>T</sub> values following qRT-PCR analysis. This 3Â´/5Â´ normalization was then used to compare the relative ratio differences between controls and <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE patients. The relative linear-fold change between human cells with and without the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE was quantified by using the Livak method<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and normalized to the levels in the pre-repeat intron for analysis of abortive transcription. All calculations were performed in Numbers/Excel and Graphpad Prism.</p>
        <p id="P35">NanoString quantification of the <italic>C9orf72</italic> pre mRNA levels in the motor cortex and cervical spinal cord from patients was performed using the NanoString detection system and a customdesigned codeset as previously described<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In brief, approximately 0.1â0.2 Âµg of RNA was used to quantify gene expression via the nCounter Analysis System according to the manufacturerâs protocol. RNA counts were normalized using the nCounter program (NanoString), and the endogenous controls, GAPDH, GUSB, and OAZ1, were used to normalize for RNA quantity (Extended Data <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The RNA counts for the 3Â´ levels were divided by the 5Â´ levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), and then the patients carrying the <italic>C9orf72</italic> HRE were compared to controls.

        <p id="P36">The RNA pulldown assays were performed as previously described<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Annealing of 10 Âµg of 3Â´-biotinylated RNA oligomers, (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> and (CCCCGG)<sub>4</sub>, was carried out in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, Â± 100 mM KCl by heating at 95Â°C for 10 min and cooling slowly to RT. The RNA was incubated with ~ 20 ÂµL of Pureproteome streptavidin magnetic beads (Millipore) in lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, with 200 mM KCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) for 20â30 min on a rotary shaker. The beads were pre-washed twice in lysis buffer at 4Â°C for 5 min each. HEK293T cells were labeled using the SILAC method<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Cells were cultured for at least six doublings with SILAC medium supplemented either with medium lysine (4<sup>2</sup>D<sub>1</sub>) and medium arginine (6<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>) or heavy lysine (6<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> 2<sup>15</sup>N<sub>7</sub>) and heavy arginine (6<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> 4<sup>15</sup>N<sub>7</sub>), along with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) and penicillin/streptomycin. Adequate SILAC labeling was confirmed prior to use for immunoprecipitation with desired RNA molecules. Cells were pelleted and washed twice with cold 1ÃPBS, resuspended in lysis buffer, and then gently sonicated. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C, and the supernatant was removed and analyzed via BCA assay (Pierce). Egg white avidin (10 Âµg) and yeast tRNA (0.5 mg) per 1 mg of protein were added to the lysate and incubated with gentle shaking at 4Â° C for 20 min. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was treated with 200 U/mL of the RNasin (Promega). The cleared lysate supernatant was incubated with different RNA molecules: (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> G-quadruplex, (GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> hairpin, and (CCCCGG)<sub>4</sub> hairpin, which were mixed with cell lysates of heavy, medium, or light SILAC labels, respectively. The RNA-conjugated beads or beads alone were incubated with HEK293T cell cleared lysates on a rotary shaker at 4Â°C for 2 h. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. Increasing concentrations of KCl in lysis buffer (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 M) were sequentially used for washing. The beads were then boiled in elution buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 1% SDS and 100 mM DTT) and combined. The buffer was exchanged with 8 M urea in 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, using the FASP method<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Proteins were then reduced with 10 mM DTT at 60Â°C for 30 min and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide at RT for 30 min. The samples were incubated with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at 37Â°C overnight. The trypsin-digested samples were then purified on an SDS-removal column (Thermo Fisher), and the peptides were desalted using a C18 StageTip<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. The peptide samples were loaded onto a trap column (2 cm, 75 Âµm diameter) and separated by an analytical column (20 cm, 75 Âµm diameter) packed with C<sub>18</sub> materials (Magic C18AQ, 5 Âµm, 100 Ã pore) using a 100 min gradient on an EASY nLC (Thermo Scientific) online system connected to an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). High-resolution data were acquired twice in a top-15 data-dependent acquisition mode using HCD fragmentation. MS data were processed using the Proteome discoverer platform and searched against the human protein database using the Mascot algorithm. Oxidation at methionine and acetylation at protein N-termini were set as variable modifications along with SILAC labels, while carbamidomethylation at cysteine was set as a fixed modification. Duplicate LC-MS/MS runs of SILAC samples were performed to identify peptide sequences at a 1% false-discovery rate.</p>

        <p id="P68">The DNA and RNAâ¢DNA structures formed in the GGGGCC repeat region impede RNA polymerase transcription, which results in transcriptional pausing and abortion. This leads to a loss of full-length products and an accumulation of abortive transcripts. Abortive transcripts that contain the hexanucleotide repeats form G-quadruplexes and hairpins and bind essential proteins in a conformation-dependent manner. Sequestration of these proteins leads to nucleolar stress and other downstream defects. The repeat-containing transcripts can also escape the nucleus and be bound by ribosomal complexes, thereby increasing repeat-associated non-ATG-dependent translation that results in aggregative polydipeptides.</p>

CD spectra were obtained as described in Methods with temperatures ranging from 25â95Â°C in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 with 50 mM KCl. This two-state transition was evaluated by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the CD melting spectra (Matlab).

The ~135 nucleotide 5Â´-end-radiolabeled cleavage fragment in the pCR8-70 samples serves as a size marker for the lower boundary of the repeat region corresponding to the region where the repeats would begin to appear on the gel.

The left panel shows the small depurination differences between the piperidine-treated template without prior treatment and those that went through the denaturing/annealing treatments Â± KCl. The middle and right panels show that treatment with piperidine causes similar patterns of minimal cleavage for the pCR8-70 and control GFP templates, respectively, as compared to the acid-induced depurination controls, consistent with basal levels of nonspecifically/spontaneously cleaved products. The densitometry analysis was done using ImageJ and plotted in Prism.</p>

        <p id="P72"><bold>a)</bold> RNA transcripts containing many GGGGCC repeats form G-quadruplexes under physiologically relevant KCl concentrations. A colorimetric assay was performed to identify the formation of RNA G-quadruplexes utilizing the enzyme-like peroxidase activity of G-quadruplexâ¢hemin complexes<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. <bold>b)</bold> Workflow considerations for the transcriptional assay. The linear plasmid was first annealed Â± 100 mM KCl or 100 mM NaCl in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. To prevent salt concentration-dependent effects on the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcriptional assay, a second adjustment was made to adjust the salts to a final 50 mM concentration in the assay. Reducing the effects on RNA polymerase allowed us to disambiguate the effects of salt on the conformation of DNA versus the nascent RNA. Comparison of DNA annealed in 0 mM KCl and 100 mM NaCl shows similar reduced polymerase processivity, suggesting that possible formation of G-quadruplexes on the nascent RNA transcripts makes a negligible contribution, but does not exclude intrinsic RNA hairpin-induced termination. <bold>c)</bold> RNase H treatment during transcription reduces the periodic accumulation of abortive transcripts and increases full-length transcripts. Treatment with RNase H, which specifically cleaves RNAâ¢DNA hybrids, during transcription of the <italic>C9orf72</italic> repeats causes a shift from truncated transcripts to full-length transcripts, suggestive of the formation of alternative secondary structures, known as R-loops, caused by increased nonduplex DNA during transcription. <bold>d)</bold> R-loop formation is observed for the plasmid containing the HRE insert, (GGGGCC)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, but not for a GFP insert in a control. Treatment with RNase A removes ssRNA but does not affect R-loops. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, the HREs induce the formation of R-loops that cause a decrease in the plasmid mobility but can be relieved with RNase H treatment, which specifically cleaves RNAâ¢DNA hybrids. The addition of RNase A and RNase H has little effect on the mobility of the plasmid containing the GFP insert. Radiolabeling the transcriptional products during <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription confirms the formation of R-loops, demonstrated by the shift consistent with the supercoiled and relaxed plasmids having altered mobility, which is relieved by treatment with both RNases. The transcripts were bodylabeled by including 20 Î¼Ci of Î±-[<sup>32</sup>P]UTP (Perkin Elmer) and then performing the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription as previously described. <bold>e)</bold> There is a significant increase in the R-loop-induced plasmid mobility shift for the (GGGGCC)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and (GGGGCC)<sub>~70</sub> containing plasmids when compared to the GFP control insert. The shifted supercoiled plasmid bands were quantified by densitometrically measuring each band intensity after treatment with RNase A versus those after treatment with both RNase A and Rnase H (ImageJ, NIH).
