      <abstract>
        <p>NF-ÎºB is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that regulates a large number of genes in response to diverse physiological and pathological stimuli. The regulation of the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB is often dependent on its interaction with IÎºBÎ±. Proteins that bind to IÎºBÎ± are critical regulators of NF-ÎºB activity. DDRGK1 is a member of the DDRGK domain-containing protein family with unknown function. In this study, we showed that the depletion of DDRGK1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion. Microarray analysis indicated that the expression of NF-ÎºB target genes showed the most significant decrease after depleting of DDRGK1, suggesting that DDRGK1 may play an important role in the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that DDRGK1 interacts with IÎºBÎ± and regulates its stability, thereby regulates the NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity. Our findings identify DDRGK1 as an important regulator of the NF-ÎºB pathway.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) family is a group of inducible transcription factors that is ubiquitously expressed in almost all cell types and regulates the expression of a large number of genes in response to physiological and pathological stimuli and other stress responses that require the rapid reprogramming of gene expression. NF-ÎºB plays a fundamental role in not only inflammatory and immune responses but also tumorigenesis <xref rid="pone.0064231-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064231-Jacobs1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064231-Karin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This family of transcription factors consists of five members, p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 (NF-ÎºB1), and p52/p100 (NF-ÎºB2). In unstimulated cells, NF-ÎºB family proteins exist as homo- or heterodimers that are bound to inhibitor IÎºB family proteins; the IÎºB proteins mask the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of the NF-ÎºB proteins and thereby ensure that these proteins remain sequestered in an inactive state in the cytoplasm <xref rid="pone.0064231-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064231-Jacobs1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Upon its activation by a variety of extracellular stimuli, the IÎºB protein undergoes rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ultimately proteolytic degradation; this process allows NF-ÎºB to translocate to the nucleus and activate the expression of specific genes <xref rid="pone.0064231-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The p65/p50 heterodimer is the first form of NF-ÎºB to be identified, and it is predominantly regulated by IÎºB. IÎºBÎ± masks the NLS of p65 without blocking the NLS of p50; thus, the p65 subunit of NF-ÎºB provides the gene regulatory function of the heterodimer. The dynamic balance between the cytosolic and nuclear pools of the p65/p50 heterodimer changes in response to a variety of stimuli, producing physiological and pathological responses <xref rid="pone.0064231-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The human DDRGK domain-containing 1 (DDRGK1) gene (also known as C20orf116, CT116 and Dashurin) is located on chromosome 20p13 and has an unknown function <xref rid="pone.0064231-Neziri1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. DDRGK1 has been highly conserved during evolution, suggesting that it may exert fundamental cellular functions. DDRGK1 has no characteristic features of functional domains or motifs, except for a conserved PCI domain (Proteasome, COP9, and initiation factor-3) at the C-terminus. This domain is known as a protein-protein interaction motif <xref rid="pone.0064231-Neziri1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064231-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064231-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been shown that DDRGK1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its expression is induced by ER stress <xref rid="pone.0064231-Lemaire1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recent studies indicate that DDRGK1 interacts with a protein complex containing UFL1 (UFM1-specific ligase 1), the putative tumor suppressor LZAP/C53 and UFM1 (ubiquitin fold modifier 1), and both UFL1 and LZAP/C53 have a regulatory role in the NF-ÎºB pathway <xref rid="pone.0064231-Lemaire1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064231-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064231-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, the function of this protein complex and its regulatory mechanisms in the NF-ÎºB pathway remain largely unknown. In particular, the role of DDRGK1 in NF-ÎºB pathway has not previously been investigated. In this study, we identified DDRGK1 as an important regulator of the NF-ÎºB pathway. We demonstrated that DDRGK1 interacts with IÎºBÎ± and regulates its stability, thereby regulates the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB and the expression of NF-ÎºB target genes.</p>

        <title>The Depletion of DDRGK1 Expression Inhibits Cell Proliferation</title>
        <p>Human DDRGK1 is an abundant cytoplasmic protein <xref rid="pone.0064231-Lemaire1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064231-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. To investigate the cellular function of the DDRGK1 protein, we examined the effect of DDRGK1 depletion by the two specific siRNAs in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The proliferation of U2OS cells transfected with either of the two individual DDRGK1 siRNAs or the siRNA mixture was assessed by MTT assay and Giemsa staining. The resulting data indicate that the depletion of DDRGK1 expression significantly inhibits cellular proliferation in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g001">Figure 1</xref>, B and C). Similarly, we found that the depletion of DDRGK1 inhibits proliferation in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these results indicate that DDRGK1 is involved in the cell proliferation.</p>

        <p>To further explore the effect of DDRGK1 on cell proliferation, we examined the expression of cyclins. We observed that the depletion of DDRGK1 decreased the mRNA expression of cyclin D1, while had no effects on the expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin E1 in MCF-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

Using luciferase reporter assays with the promoter of cyclin D1, we found that the depletion of DDRGK1 by siRNAs significantly inhibited the cyclin D1 promoter activity in both U2OS and MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

        <title>The Depletion of DDRGK1 Inhibits Cell Migration and Invasion in U2OS Cells</title>
        <p>We then examined the effects of DDRGK1 on cell migration and invasion through a Matrigel barrier. We observed that the depletion of DDRGK1 by the siRNA mixture resulted in an approximately 5-fold decrease in cellular migration ability and an even more pronounced reduction in cell invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting a role for DDRGK1 in cell migration and invasion.

To determine whether DDRGK1 regulates the expression of MMP9, we examined the expression of MMP9 in DDRGK1-depleted U2OS cells. The results show that the depletion of DDRGK1 significantly decreased the MMP9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, the depletion of DDRGK1 by siRNAs significantly inhibits MMP9 promoter activity in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that DDRGK1 regulates the expression of MMP9 at transcriptional levels.</p>

The hierarchical clustering of 391 NF-ÎºB target genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/">http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/</ext-link>) revealed systematic features of gene expression that were affected by the transfection of the DDRGK1 siRNAs compared with the control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Among the 391 NF-ÎºB target genes, 138 were downregulated by transfection with DDRGK1 siRNA1, and 131 were downregulated by transfection with DDRGK1 siRNA2, compared to control siRNA transfection. The NF-ÎºB target genes that were consistently down-regulated by more than two-fold after transfection with both DDRGK1 siRNA1 and DDRGK1 siRNA2 are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064231.s001">Table S1</xref>. To confirm the results of the microarray analysis, the expression levels of 4 selected NF-ÎºB target genes, including MMP9, cyclin D1, CX3CL1, and SAA2, were analyzed by RT-PCR. Consistent with the microarray data, the expression of these genes was significantly reduced by the siRNA-mediated down-regulation of DDRGK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In combination, these results indicate that DDRGK1 regulates the expression of NF-ÎºB target genes at transcriptional levels.</p>

            <p>(A) The expression levels of NF-ÎºB target genes were analyzed by microarray. U2OS cells were transfected with DDRGK1 siRNA1 and siRNA2, respectively. The mRNAs were isolated for microarray analysis. The ratio of the abundance of transcripts of each gene in a given sample to its median abundance is represented by the color of the corresponding cell in the Tree View-generated diagram. Green cells represent the genes with transcript levels below their median abundances, black cells represent genes with transcript levels equal to their median abundances, and red cells represent genes with transcript levels that are greater than their median abundances. Gray cells indicate technically inadequate or missing data. The color saturation of each cell reflects the magnitude of the ratio relative to the mean for each gene. NF-ÎºB target genes were selected based on information from the Boston University network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/">http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/</ext-link>). (B) RT-PCR analysis of selected NF-ÎºB target genes was performed to validate the results of the microarray. U2OS cells were transfected with DDRGK1 siRNA1 or siRNA2, and total RNAs were extracted. The expression of DDRGK1 and four selected NF-ÎºB target genes (MMP9, cyclin D1, CX3CL1 and SAA2) were analyzed by RT-PCR with the specific primers listed in the Experimental Procedures. GAPDH was used as a loading control.</p>

        <p>To understand the mechanism of DDRGK1 in the regulation of NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity, we examined the effects of the down-regulation of DDRGK1 on the levels of NF-ÎºB family protein expression. The depletion of DDRGK1 by siRNAs resulted in a notable increase in IÎºBÎ± expression. However, the expression of other members of the NF-ÎºB family, including p65, p50, and IKKÎ±, IKKÎ², IKKÎ³, appears to be unchanged with the depletion of DDRGK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

        <p>The degradation of IÎºBÎ± is a central event in the NF-ÎºB activation process, and it is initiated by the specific phosphorylation of IÎºBÎ±. Following this phosphorylation, IÎºBÎ± is ubiquitinated and then degraded by the proteasome, allowing p65/p50 NF-ÎºB heterodimers to translocate into the nucleus and mediate NF-ÎºB activity <xref rid="pone.0064231-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. To investigate the effects of DDRGK1 on the phosphorylation and degradation dynamics of IÎºBÎ±, the levels of IÎºBÎ± expression and phosphorylation were examined every 20 minutes after stimulation with TNF-Î± in U2OS cells transfected with either control or DDRGK1 siRNAs. As expected, the protein level of IÎºBÎ± in the control cells decreased quickly and was almost undetectable at 40 minutes after stimulation with TNF-Î±. However, the degradation of IÎºBÎ± was significantly delayed, by up to 80 minutes, in DDRGK1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Correspondingly, the phosphorylation of IÎºBÎ± was effectively inhibited after stimulation with TNF-Î± in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In the control cells, the phosphorylation of IÎºBÎ± was readily detectable at 20 minutes of TNF-Î± treatment. However, in the DDRGK1-depleted cells, the phosphorylation of IÎºBÎ± was not observed until 60 minutes of TNF-Î± treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064231-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this report, we identified DDRGK1 as an important regulator of NF-ÎºB. We found that DDRGK1 depletion inhibited cell migration and invasion in U2OS cells. Microarray analysis revealed that the depletion of DDRGK1 by siRNAs specifically inhibited NF-ÎºB target gene expression. We further confirmed that DDRGK1 regulated NF-ÎºB DNA binding activity and the transcriptional activity of an NF-ÎºB luciferase reporter. Importantly, we demonstrated that DDRGK1 interacts with the amino terminus (1â106 aa) of IÎºBÎ±, which contains critical phosphorylation sites (Ser32 and Ser36) and ubiquitination sites (Lys21 and Lys22), and regulates its phosphorylation and stability, thereby modulating the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB and the expression of NF-ÎºB target genes. The NF-ÎºB target genes that are inhibited by DDRGK1 siRNAs include cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and receptors, as well as enzymes that are involved in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and stress responses, suggesting an important role for DDRGK1 in the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.</p>
      <p>Translocations in regions near the DDRGK1 gene on chromosome 20p13 have been found to be associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia and acute promyelocytic leukemia <xref rid="pone.0064231-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064231-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and a recent genome-wide association study identified one SNP (rs11697186) located in the DDRGK1 gene that showed strong associations in the minor-allele-dominant model with the decrease in platelet counts that occurs in response to pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C <xref rid="pone.0064231-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These observations further support the functional relevance of DDRGK1 in NF-ÎºB signaling.</p>
      <p>An earlier study demonstrated that C53/LZAP is a putative tumor suppressor that plays important roles in the NF-ÎºB signaling <xref rid="pone.0064231-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. C53/LZAP directly interacts with p65, inhibits the NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity by regulating the phosphorylation of p65, thereby inhibiting basal and stimulated NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity.</p>
      <p>Several recent reports have independently revealed that DDRGK1, C53/LZAP, UFL1 and UFM1 are all components of a large protein complex. Using biochemical and proteomic approaches, Tatsumi et al. demonstrated that DDRGK1 (C20orf116 in their work) is a UFM1-specific substrate and that UFL1 may be the E3 ligase for DDRGK1 ufmylation <xref rid="pone.0064231-Tatsumi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In a search for LZAP-interacting proteins, Kwon et al. identified UFL1 (NLBP in their work), DDRGK1 and UFM1 in C53/LZAP immunoprecipitates subjected to proteomic analyses and found that UFL1 has negative effects on the NF-ÎºB pathway <xref rid="pone.0064231-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Similarly, Wu et al. demonstrated that C53/LZAP interacts with DDRGK1 and UFL1 (RCAD in their work) and that UFL1 regulates the stability of both C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 <xref rid="pone.0064231-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, data from this study also suggest that UFL1 may function to stabilize C53/LZAP and block NF-ÎºB signaling <xref rid="pone.0064231-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In a recent study, Lemaire et al. have shown that DDRGK1 (UFBP1 in their work), C53/LZAP and UFL1 interact with UFM1 and that these three proteins are components of the UFM1 conjugation pathway <xref rid="pone.0064231-Lemaire1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Together, these studies suggest that these four proteins form a novel multi-protein complex. However, the function and regulation of this complex is largely unclear.</p>
      <p>DDRGK1 has a highly conserved PCI domain at its carboxyl terminus. The PCI is a protein-protein interaction motif <xref rid="pone.0064231-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Proteins that contain this domain appear to be part of large multi-protein complexes. It would be interesting to determine whether the PCI domain in DDRGK1 is an interacting module for the protein complex containing LZAP, UFL1 and UFM1.</p>
      <p>Notably, in our immunoprecipitation experiments, we readily detected UFM1-conjugated DDRGK1, LZAP and UFL1, indicating that these four proteins are present in the same complex and are all conjugated by UFM1 (unpublished data). All of these proteins are highly conserved during evolution. Ufm1 is the most recently discovered ubiquitin-like modifier <xref rid="pone.0064231-Komatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The function of UFM1 conjugation (ufmylation) is currently unknown. Interestingly, we have observed that UFM1-conjugated proteins, such as DDRGK1, LZAP and UFL1, can easily be detected in UFM1 immunoprecipitates. Thus, ufmylation may not be associated with the proteolysis of these proteins. Whether ufmylation plays a role in the assembly of this multi-protein complex or in the regulation of its activity warrants further investigations.</p>

        <title>cDNA Microarrays and Statistical Analyses</title>
        <p>Human genome 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray analyses were performed by the CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China). A complete human genome oligonucleotide set from Operon (version 4.0) containing 35,035 oligonucleotide probes representing approximately 25,100 genes and 39,600 transcripts, excluding control oligos, was used. Briefly, mRNAs extracted from U2OS cells that had been transfected with control siRNA were used as a reference control sample to prepare cDNAs labeled with Cy3-dCTP, and mRNAs from U2OS cells transfected with DDRGK1 siRNA were used to prepare cDNAs labeled with Cy5-dCTP. The two differentially labeled cDNA probes were mixed and then simultaneously hybridized to the human genome oligonucleotide microarrays. The microarrays were scanned with a confocal LuxScanTM scanner, and the obtained images were then analyzed using the LuxScanTM 3.0 software (CapitalBio). For individual channel data extraction, faint spots for which the intensities were below 400 units after the background was subtracted in both channels (Cy3 and Cy5) were removed. A space- and intensity-dependent normalization based on LOWESS was employed. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, version 3.02) was performed to identify significantly differentially expressed genes.</p>

        <title>p65 DNA-binding Assay</title>
        <p>U2OS cells were transiently transfected with DDRGK1 siRNAs or control siRNA. After 48 hours, nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif). The DNA-binding activity of p65 was determined using the NF-ÎºB p65 transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. 2.5 Âµg nuclear extracts of each sample were incubated with immobilized oligonucleotides containing the consensus ÎºB site of <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-GGGACTTTCC-3â²</named-content> for 1 h. The p65 protein that was bound to ÎºB DNA was then visualized by incubation with p65-specific antibody, HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and developing solution. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a multifunctional microplate reader.</p>

        <title>Luciferase Assay</title>
        <p>Cells were plated in triplicates in 24-well plates the day before transfection. Reporter plasmids and DDRGK1 siRNAs or control siRNA were transiently transfected into cells together with the internal control plasmid pRL-TK. 24â48 h after transfection, firefly luciferase reporter activity was assayed using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Results were expressed as the mean firefly luciferase activity Â±SD normalized by renilla luciferase activity from three independent experiments.</p>

          <p>The down-regulation of NF-ÎºB target genes by DDRGK1 depletion in U2OS cells identified by microarray analysis. NF-ÎºB target genes that were down-regulated by at least two-fold by both DDRGK1 siRNA1 and DDRGK1 siRNA2 were classified according to their biological functions. The gene ID designations were defined in accordance with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The ratios were calculated based on the value of Cy5 divided by the value of Cy3 for a given gene and are presented as the mean changes observed in the DDRGK1 siRNA1 and DDRGK1 siRNA2 transfection experiments.</p>
