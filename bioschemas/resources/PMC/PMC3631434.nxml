        <p id="P1">Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 14 (PTPN14) is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers. However, the cell signaling pathways regulated by PTPN14 largely remain to be elucidated. Here, we identify a list of potential substrates of PTPN14 using a phospho-proteomic approach. We show that p130Cas is a direct substrate of PTPN14 and that PTPN14 specifically regulates p130Cas phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 128 (Y128) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. We engineered CRC cells homozygous for a p130Cas Y128F knock-in mutant and found that these cells exhibit significantly reduced migration and colony formation, impaired anchorage-independent growth, slower xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, and have decreased phosphorylation of AKT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SRC phosphorylates p130Cas Y128 and that CRC cell lines harboring high levels of pY128 Cas are more sensitive to SRC family kinase inhibitor Dasatinib. These findings suggest that p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation may be exploited as a predictive marker for Dasatinib response in cancer patients. In aggregate, our studies reveal a novel signaling pathway that plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation governs numerous signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and migration (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Many PTKs have been identified to be oncogenes that are crucial to tumorigenic processes (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Increasing evidence indicates that PTPs also play important roles in tumorigenesis (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In a systematic mutational analysis of the PTP gene family in colorectal cancers (CRCs), protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 14 (PTPN14) was identified as one of the six PTPs that are mutated in CRCs (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Recent studies revealed that PTPN14 is also mutated in breast, head and neck, kidney, liver, ovarian and skin cancers (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), suggesting that PTPN14 may play an important role in tumorigenesis of multiple types of cancers.</p>
      <p id="P3">PTPN14, also known as Pez, PTP36 and PTPD2, consists of an N-terminal FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain and a C-terminal phosphatase domain (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It has been shown that PTPN14 may regulate cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, cell migration and cell growth (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study indicates that PTPN14 also regulates TGFÎ² gene expression, thereby modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Knockdown of the PTPN14 homolog in zebrafish results in developmental defects (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Although PTPN14 was shown to regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Î²-catenin (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), it remains to be determined how this regulation impacts tumorigenesis. Given that PTPN14 is mutated in various cancers including CRCs, it is important to identify more substrates of PTPN14 in CRC cells. In this study, we identified a list of putative substrates of PTPN14 using a phospho-proteomic approach. We further validated p130 Crk-associated substrate (p130Cas) as a critical PTPN14 substrate.</p>
      <p id="P4">p130Cas was originally identified as a Crk-associated protein (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). It is also known as breast-cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein 1 (BCAR1), because p130Cas overexpression renders breast cancer cells resistant to Tamoxifen treatment (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Moreover, p130Cas is overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Transgenic mice overexpressing p130Cas shorten the latency of Her2/neu-induced breast cancer development (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Furthermore, p130Cas is required for SRC-mediated transformation (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that p130Cas is a key player in tumorigenesis. p130Cas is an adaptor protein that mediates integrin and growth factor signaling (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It contains several conserved domains for protein-protein interactions. At the N-terminus, there is a substrate domain with 15 YXXP repeats which can be heavily phosphorylated (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Here, we report that PTPN14 dephosphorylates the tyrosine 128 (Y128) residue, one of the YXXP repeats, on p130Cas. We further demonstrated that regulation of Y128 p130Cas phosphorylation plays a critical role in CRC tumorigenesis.</p>

        <title>Identification of p130Cas as a substrate of PTPN14 using a phospho-proteomic approach</title>
        <p id="P5">To identify potential substrates of PTPN14, we constructed two stable SW480 CRC cell lines expressing either a wild-type (WT) PTPN14 PTP domain or a PTPN14 D1079A trapping mutant PTP domain. It is well documented that PTP trapping mutants can trap phospho-substrates in their catalytic pockets and protect the substrates from dephosphorylation, thereby potentially enriching the phospho-substrates (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Proteins were extracted from these cell lines as well as the parental SW480 cells and digested with trypsin. Phospho-tyrosine (pY) containing peptides were enriched using anti-pY antibody columns. Peptides from each cell line were profiled by mass spectrometry analyses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). pY peptides were quantified as described by Rush at al (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Those pY containing peptides that were either down-regulated in the cell lines overexpressing the WT phosphatase or up-regulated in the cell line overexpressing the trapping mutant compared to the parental cells are potential candidate substrates (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Of these candidate substrates, we chose to further characterize p130Cas because the pY128 containing peptides of p130Cas were enriched over 150 fold in the cell line overexpressing the PTPN14 trapping mutant phosphatase (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

        <title>PTPN14 regulates phosphorylation of p130 at the tyrosine 128 residue in CRC cells</title>
        <p id="P6">We set out to determine if PTPN14 indeed regulates p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation. To this end, we first generated a pY128 p130Cas specific antibody. As shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>, the antibody recognized a phospho-signal on the wild-type p130Cas. In contrast, it failed to detect any signal on p130Cas Y128F mutant protein (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>), indicating that this antibody specifically recognizes phosphorylated Y128 of p130Cas. We then performed Western blot analyses on the aforementioned SW480 CRC cell lines using this antibody. Consistent with the proteomic data, compared to parental cells, overexpression of WT PTPN14 phosphatase resulted in reduced levels of pY128 p130Cas (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), whereas overexpression of the trapping mutant led to increased levels of this phosphorylation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Conversely, knockdown of PTPN14 by two independent shRNAs resulted in increased levels of pY128 p130Cas in a genetically engineered DLD1 CRC cell line (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), in which the endogenous PTPN14 proteins are epitope-tagged with 3xFLAG (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrated that PTPN14 regulates phosphorylation of p130Cas Y128 in CRC cells.</p>

        <title>PTPN14 directly dephosphorylates p130Cas</title>
        <p id="P7">To determine whether PTPN14 directly regulates p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation, we first employed a substrate trapping assay developed by Flint et al. (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). WT or substrate trapping mutant (D1079A) of PTPN14 phosphatase domain was fused to GST and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. GST fusion proteins were purified and attached on Glutathione beads. Equal amounts of WT and mutant GST-fusion proteins were used for a trapping assay (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S2</xref>, the trapping mutant fusion proteins pulled down p130Cas abundantly from cell lysates made from two different CRC cell lines DLD1 and SW480. In contrast, the WT GST-fusion proteins only pulled down minimal amount of p130Cas, whereas GST alone did not bind to p130Cas. Secondly, when mixed with phosphorylated p130cas substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>, the WT PTPN14 GST fusion proteins dephosphorylated p130Cas at the Y128 site in comparison with controls with equal amounts of GST or the enzymatically inactive mutant proteins (trapping mutant) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In aggregate, our results showed unequivocally that p130Cas is a direct substrate of PTPN14. However, we failed to detect protein-protein interaction between PTPN14 and p130Cas in DLD1 cell lysates by a co-immunoprecipitation assay (data not shown), suggesting that the two proteins only interact transiently when the enzymatic reaction occurs.</p>

        <title>SRC phosphorylates p130Cas at Tyr128</title>
        <p id="P8">Having demonstrated that PTPN14 dephosphorylates Y128 of p130Cas, we set out to identify the kinase that phosphorylates this site. Because SRC kinase has been shown to phosphorylate p130Cas at several tyrosine residues other than Y128, we elected to test whether SRC could also phosphorylate Y128 on p130Cas. Three lines of evidence indicated that SRC indeed phosphorylates this site: (1) Treatment of DLD1 cells with a SRC inhibitor AZD0530 led to dephosphorylation of pY128 p130Cas (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>); (2) Knockdown of SRC by two independent shRNAs also resulted in reduced levels of pY128 p130Cas in DLD1 cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>); (3) Overexpression of SRC led to increased levels of pY128 on p130Cas (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

        <p id="P9">SRC family kinase inhibitor Dasatinib is used in clinic to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and there are several ongoing clinical trials using Dasatinib in combination with other drugs to treat colon cancers (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). To test if p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation associates with Dasatinib inhibition, we treated six colon cancer cell lines with various doses of Dasatinib and the IC50s of these cell lines were shown in up panel of <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>. Remarkably, colon cancer cell lines harboring higher levels of pY128 p130Cas were more sensitive to growth inhibition by Dasatinib (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Phosphorylation of p130Cas Y128 can be stimulated by EGF</title>
        <p id="P10">Given that we have identified the kinase and phosphatase that regulate p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation, it is of interest to identify stimuli that may activate this phosphorylation in CRC cells. To this end, we treated DLD1 cells with various growth factors and cytokines including EGF, FGF, PDGF-AA, Il-6, and VEGF. Among them, EGF could robustly stimulate p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation after 30 minute treatment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S3A</xref>). In contrast, other growth factors and cytokines, including PDGF-AA, failed to activate p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation, although PDGF was able to activate ERK1/2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S3B</xref>). Furthermore, EGF also induced phosphorylation of p130Cas Y128 in multiple CRC cells including RKO cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3A</xref>). Given that EGF signaling plays a critical role in CRC tumorigenesis and that anti-EGFR antibodies are approved by the FDA to treat CRC patients (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), we chose to study p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation in the context of EGF stimulation.</p>

        <title>Engineering p130Cas Y128F mutant knock-in (KI) CRC cells</title>
        <p id="P11">To rigorously test whether regulation of p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation is critical to colorectal tumorigenesis, we set out to engineer p130Cas Y128F knock-in (KI CRC) cell lines. The adeno-associated virus (AAV) targeting system was used to engineer the knock-in cell lines because of its high homologous recombination frequency in somatic cells (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We first chose to knock in the p130Cas Y128F mutant allele into the human colon cancer cell line RKO, because we had shown that p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation can be activated by EGF in RKO cells as described above and that RKO cells are widely used for gene targeting (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The targeting strategy is outlined in the schematic diagram in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>. After the first round of gene targeting, 7 targeted clones were identified out of 96 geneticin resistant clones screened. To ensure the presence of the mutant allele, genomic PCR products of exon 3, which encodes the Y128 residue, from the targeted clones were sequenced. Five of the 7 targeted clones harbored p130Cas Y128F mutant allele. Two clones were infected with adenovirus expressing Cre-recombinase to excise the neomycin resistance gene (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and targeted for the second allele to generate homozygous KI clones. To confirm that there was no WT p130Cas allele expression in the homozygous p130Cas Y128F mutant clones, the genomic PCR products of p130Cas were sequenced. As expected, both WT p130Cas alleles were replaced by the p130Cas Y128F mutants in the homozygous KI clones (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Furthermore, Western blot analyses showed that p130Cas proteins were expressed in the homozygous KI cells but they remained unphosphorylated at residue 128 after EGF stimulation, while p130Cas proteins in the parental cells were heavily phosphorylated at Y128 post EGF stimulation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These data indicated that we had successfully engineered p130Cas Y128F mutant KI cells. We chose two independently derived heterozygous and homozygous KI clones for in-depth analyses and both clones behaved similarly in all the studies described below. To ensure that what we observe with RKO cells is not cell line specific, we used the same method to generate p130Cas Y128F mutant DLD1 cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

To gain insights into the effects of this phosphorylation on downstream signaling, we examined how the p130Cas Y128F KI affects phosphorylation of signaling molecules in CRC cells after EGF stimulation. It is well-documented that EGF receptors, once they are engaged by their ligands, activate multiple well-characterized signaling pathways including Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, PLC-Î³ and STATs (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We tested the phosphorylation status of 27 sites on 16 proteins that could be potentially modulated by EGF signaling (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). In both RKO and DLD1 CRC cells, phosphorylation of AKT Thr308 was significantly reduced in p130Cas Y128F KI cells in comparison with the parental cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A and B</xref>). However, the kinetics of AKT activation appeared to be faster in RKO cells than in DLD1 cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A and B</xref>). Although no difference in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed between the RKO parental and Y128F KI cells, ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels were elevated in DLD1 p130Cas Y128F mutant cells, suggesting that a compensatory effect occurred in the DLD1 mutant cells.</p>

        <title>The p130Cas Y128F mutant proteins bind less p85 than the WT p130Cas</title>
        <p id="P17">The above results indicate that AKT is a critical downstream mediator of the p130Cas pY128 signaling. It is well documented that AKTs are activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). PI3K, which consists of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). PIP3 then recruits AKT the plasma membrane, which, in turn, activates AKT (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). PI3K becomes activated when it is recruited to the membrane by interaction between p85 and pY residues on membrane-bound receptors or adaptor proteins (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Interestingly, several studies demonstrate that membrane-associated p130Cas activates PI3K through interaction with p85 (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and that this interaction is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrate-binding domain on p130Cas (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Given that the Y128 belongs to one of the YXXP repeats (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), we postulated that the reduced AKT activity in the p130Cas Y128F mutant cells might be due to weaker binding affinity of the mutant p130Cas protein to p85. Indeed, as shown in <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, less p85 proteins associated with the p130Cas Y128F mutant compared to the WT p130Cas.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P18">Using a phospho-proteomic approach, we identified and validated p130Cas as a substrate of PTPN14. PTPN14 dephosphorylates an unappreciated Y128 residue on p130Cas protein. PTPN14 regulated p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis, because the genetically engineered p130Cas Y128F mutant CRC cells exhibit reduced abilities in colony formation, anchorage-independent growth, cell migration and xenograft tumor growth.</p>
      <p id="P19">PTPN14 is identified to be mutated in various human cancers including breast, colon, head and neck, kidney, liver, ovarian and skin cancers (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), thereby providing genetic evidence suggesting that this PTP plays a role in tumorigenesis. In a fraction of tumors, one allele of PTPN14 is mutated whereas the other allele is lost (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), consistent with a âtwo-hitâ tumor suppressor model. Therefore we postulate that PTPN14 may function as a tumor suppressor. Consistent with this notion, PTPN14 negatively regulates an oncogenic target pY128 p130Cas, because the unphosphorylatable p130Cas Y128F KI DLD1 and RKO cells exhibit reduced colony formation ability and soft-agar growth (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Furthermore, the RKO p130Cas Y128F mutant cells grow much slower as xenograft tumors, although the p130Cas Y128F mutation in DLD1 cell does not affect xenograft tumor growth. We hypothesize that this discrepancy is due to a compensatory effect in the DLD1 p130Cas mutant cells. In support, we observed that ERK activities are up-regulated in the DLD1 p130Cas mutant KI cells, but not in the RKO mutant KI cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A and B</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P20">We also demonstrated that SRC is the kinase that phosphorylates p130Cas Y128 residue (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, CRC cell lines harboring high levels of pY128 p130Cas are more sensitive to SRC inhibitor Dasatinib-induced growth inhibition than those cell lines with low levels of pY128 p130Cas (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Dasatinib is used in the clinic to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia, and there are several ongoing clinical trials using Dasatinib in combination with other drugs to treat solid tumors including colon cancers (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Our data suggest that pY128 p130Cas may be exploited as a prediction marker for Dasatinib response in cancer patients. It is worth noting that Src also phosphorylates other sites of the YXXP repeats on p130Cas including the Y253 that regulate transformed cell growth and migration (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). As the future directions, it is of interest to determine if PTPN14 dephosphorylates the other sites and if there is a cross-talk between the Y128 phosphorylation and the other Y residues of the YXXP repeats.</p>
      <p id="P21">The oncogenic signaling of p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation seems to be mediated by the PI3K/AKT pathway, as we showed that AKT T308 phosphorylation, a key to AKT activation, is reduced in both DLD1 and RKO p130Cas Y128 mutant KI cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A and B</xref>). It has been reported previously that p130cas can activate PI3K through binding to the regulatory subunit p85 (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that p130Cas pY128 phosphorylation is crucial for its binding to p85. Although the p130Cas interacting protein CRK is shown to activate PI3K through the FAK-p85 interaction (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), our results indicate that the p130Cas Y128F mutant does not affect its binding to CRK.</p>
      <p id="P22">Lastly, the phospho-proteomic approach used in this study represents a novel method to globally identify potential substrates of PTPs. Identification of substrates of PTPs has been a challenge. Although phosphatase trapping pull-down has been widely used to validate PTP substrates, it has limited success in identification of new substrates (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). We show here that, coupling with global phospho-proteomic profiling, overexpression of the trapping mutant PTPN14 PTP domain can enrich the target pY containing peptides and provides a systematic approach to identify candidate substrates. We also successfully employed a similar method to identify substrates of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor T (PTPRT) (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). We further validated that STAT3 and paxillin are the substrates of PTPRT (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, our studies suggest that the phospho-proteomic approach is a generally applicable method for identification of PTP substrates.</p>

        <p id="P37">Transwell membranes (pore size 8.0 Î¼m; Corning Incorporated., Corning, NY) were coated with 50 Î¼g/ml fibronectin. Cells were detached with 2 mM EDTA and re-suspended in serum-free medium with 0.1% of BSA. Five hundred thousand cells were added to the upper compartment of the transwell chamber in the wells of a 24-well plate and allowed to migrate to the underside of the inserts for 24 hours. Non-migrating cells on the upper membrane were removed with a cotton swab, and cells that had migrated and become attached to the bottom surface of the membranewere fixed and stained with crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted microscopically. The experiments were repeated three times with two replicates for each cell line. Average numbers of migrated cells from each experiment were plotted.</p>

Cell lysates were made from the parental SW480 CRC cells, stable clones expressing either a wild-type (WT) PTP domain or a PTPN14 D1079A trapping mutant PTP domain. Proteins were digested with trypsin and pY containing peptides were enriched by anti-pY antibody (pY100)-conjugated beads. Peptide mixtures were profiled by mass-spectrometry. <bold>(B)</bold> List of the top candidate substrates of PTPN14. ND, not detected.</p>

Cell lysates made from the cell lines used in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> were blotted with the indicated antibodies. <bold>(B)</bold> Knock-down of PTPN14 leads to increased levels of pY128 Cas in CRC cells. Cell lysates from stable clones of DLD1 CRC cells expressing scramble shRNAs or shRNAs against PTPN14 were blotted with the indicated antibodies. N14-1 and N14-2 are two independent shRNAs against PTPN14. <bold>(C)</bold> A PTPN14 trapping mutant traps p130Cas protein. GST, GST-WT and GST-D1079A trapping mutant PTPN14 PTP domains were expressed in <italic>E. Coli</italic>, purified and resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel (bottom panel). Arrow indicates the GST fusion proteins. Equal amounts of the purified protein were mixed with DLD1 cell lysates in the phosphatase trapping assay. The trapped p130Cas proteins were detected by Western blot (top panel). <bold>(D)</bold>. PTPN14 dephosphorylates pY128 Cas <italic>in vitro</italic>. Phosphorylated p130Cas proteins were incubated with the indicated GST fusion proteins. The pY128 Cas proteins were quantified by Western blot analysis.</p>
