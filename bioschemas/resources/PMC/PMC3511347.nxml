      <abstract>
        <p>Friend of GATA 2 (FOG-2), a co-factor of several GATA transcription factors (GATA-4, -5 and 6), is a critical regulator of coronary vessel formation and heart morphogenesis. Here we demonstrate that FOG-2 is SUMOylated and that this modification modulates its transcriptional activity. FOG-2 SUMOylation occurs at four lysine residues (K312, 471, 915, 955). Three of these residues are part of the characteristic SUMO consensus site (ÏKXE), while K955 is found in the less frequent TKXE motif. Absence of SUMOylation did not affect FOG-2â²s nuclear localization. However, mutation of the FOG-2 SUMOylation sites, or de-SUMOylation, with SENP-1 or SENP-8 resulted in stronger transcriptional repression activity in both heterologous cells and cardiomyocytes. Conversely, increased FOG-2 SUMOylation by overexpression of SUMO-1 or expression of a SUMO-1-FOG-2 fusion protein rendered FOG-2 incapable of repressing GATA-4-mediated activation of the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) promoter. Moreover, we demonstrate both increased interaction between a FOG-2 SUMO mutant and GATA-4 and enhanced SUMOylation of wild-type FOG-2 by co-expression of GATA-4. These data suggest a new dynamics in which GATA-4 may alter the activity of FOG-2 by influencing its SUMOylation status.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The cardiac development program involves a number of transcriptional regulators. One essential organizer of cardiogenesis is the transcription factor GATA-4, which recognises the consensus WGATAR motif, found in many cardiac promoters. Many studies have implicated GATA-4 in heart development processes. For instance, it is involved in the differentiation of progenitors into beating cardiac cells <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0050637-Grepin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and in heart tube formation and yolk sac development <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0050637-Molkentin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Moreover GATA-4 is required for the expression of cardiac structural genes such as troponin, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and Î± and Î² myosin heavy chain (MHC) <xref rid="pone.0050637-Pikkarainen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Despite the physical association of GATA-4 with several co-factors <xref rid="pone.0050637-Pikkarainen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, it is its interaction with the multi-zinc finger protein Friend of GATA 2 (FOG-2) that appears to be crucial for its cardiac function <xref rid="pone.0050637-Crispino1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>FOG-2 is a multi-zinc finger protein that, like the related haematopoietic factor FOG-1, operates as a co-factor of GATA proteins. FOG-2 is expressed with GATA-4, -5 and -6 in both the developing and adult heart and the generation of a FOG-2 deficient mouse demonstrated that it is essential for heart morphogenesis and proper cardiovascular development <xref rid="pone.0050637-Tevosian1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The phenotype of FOG-2<sup>â/â</sup> mice was recapitulated to a large extent by a GATA-4 knock-in animal that expresses a GATA-4 molecule that fails to interact with FOG-2 <xref rid="pone.0050637-Crispino1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, suggesting that FOG-2 is indispensable for GATA-4 activity. Typically, FOG-2 acts as a repressor of GATA-4-mediated activation but could also be a transcriptional activator depending on the cellular and promoter context <xref rid="pone.0050637-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. GATA-4 is functionally involved in cardiac hypertrophy <xref rid="pone.0050637-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and is required for the hypertrophic response <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0050637-Oka1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. FOG-2 is capable of counteracting this effect and protecting cultured cardiac cells against hypertrophy <xref rid="pone.0050637-Hirai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The mechanism by which FOG-2 modulates GATA-4 activity is yet to be fully elucidated. It is known, however, that FOG-2 interacts functionally with the co-repressor CtBP in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos <xref rid="pone.0050637-Deconinck1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and in cellular assays <xref rid="pone.0050637-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but this interaction appears to be dispensable for the cardiac-specific ANF promoter examined by Svensson et al <xref rid="pone.0050637-Svensson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition, there is evidence that the N-terminal domain of FOG-2 constitutes an independent NuRD-interacting repression domain <xref rid="pone.0050637-Svensson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050637-Roche1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Importantly, this region is conserved in FOG-1, where it serves as a docking domain for the NuRD complex, and is necessary for FOG-1/GATA-1-mediated transcriptional repression <xref rid="pone.0050637-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Additionally, FOG-2 may repress transcription by competing directly with GATA-4 for binding to the co-activator p300 <xref rid="pone.0050637-Hirai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to protein-protein interactions, the function of many transcription factors is altered by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation. Modification by the <underline>S</underline>mall <underline>U</underline>biquitin-related <underline>Mo</underline>difier (SUMO) leads to diverse effects depending on the substrate modified <xref rid="pone.0050637-Verger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. SUMOylation is a dynamic modification in which a SUMO moiety is covalently added, in an enzymatic process, to target lysine residues within the consensus site ÏKXE (where Ï is large and hydrophobic and X is any amino acid). The SUMOylation pathway consists of an E1 activating enzyme (the SAE1/SAE2 heterodimer) and an E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) which transfers the SUMO molecule to the target residue <xref rid="pone.0050637-Melchior1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. While E1 and E2 enzymes are sufficient for the SUMOylation of substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>, specific SUMO E3 ligases and de-SUMOylating enzymes have also been described <xref rid="pone.0050637-Melchior2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>SUMOylation of transcriptional regulators often contributes to their ability to repress gene expression <xref rid="pone.0050637-Verger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050637-Gill1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. For instance, mutation of the SUMOylation site of the repressor BKLF resulted in elimination of its repression activity <xref rid="pone.0050637-Perdomo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In addition, the lack of SUMO modification of several activators, including Sp3 <xref rid="pone.0050637-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and p300 <xref rid="pone.0050637-Girdwood1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> renders them more potent activators, suggesting that SUMOylation confers a repressive attribute to these molecules. In contrast, lack of SUMO modification reduced the ability of FOG-1 to transactivate the c-mpl promoter <xref rid="pone.0050637-Snow1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and rendered Ikaros a more potent repressor of transcription <xref rid="pone.0050637-GmezDelArco1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we report that FOG-2 SUMOylation is necessary for the biological activity of FOG-2. We show that endogenous FOG-2 is SUMOylated and localized the SUMO acceptor sites between zinc fingers 2 and 3, 4 and 5, and 7 and 8, at lysines 324, 471, 915 and 955. Mutation of these residues completely abolishes FOG-2 SUMOylation. Our data indicate that SUMOylation functions to inhibit the capacity of FOG-2 to repress GATA-4-mediated activation. As such, mutant FOG-2 incapable of SUMOylation demonstrates enhanced repression activity, and de-SUMOylation of FOG-2 by SENP1 or SNEP-8 also increases FOG-2-mediated repression. We propose that the enhanced repression activity in the absence of SUMOylation is due to a higher affinity physical interaction between FOG-2 and GATA-4.</p>

            <p>(A) COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors for murine FOG-2 (lane 1) or FOG-2 and HA-SUMO-1 (lane 2). Western blot was performed on nuclear extracts from the transfected cells using an anti-FOG-2 antibody. Co-expression of FOG-2 and HA-SUMO-1 resulted in the appearance of at least two slower migrating bands detected by the FOG-2 antibody (Upper panel, arrowheads). Expression of HA-SUMO-1 resulted in increased total SUMOylation (lower panel). SUMOylation in COS-7 cells was detected with an anti-SUMO-1 antibody in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of co-transfected HA-SUMO-1 (B) Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from C2C12 myocytes were obtained in the absence (lanes 2 and 4) or presence (lanes 3 and 5) of the de-SUMOylation inhibitor NEM. FOG-2 was detected by the anti-FOG-2 antibody in the nuclear fraction (lanes 2 and 3). A slower migrating band appeared only when NEM was present, indicating that endogenous FOG-2 is modified by SUMO in these cells (lane 3). FOG-2 SUMOylated with HA-SUMO-1 in COS-7 cells is shown for comparison (lane 1). Asterisks indicate non-specific bands detected by the FOG-2 antibody.

Mutations in fragments 279-1151 and 881-1092 are indicated in the figure. All FOG-2 fragments were SUMOylated. Mutation of K915 and K955 in the 881-1092 fragment caused the disappearance of the previous SUMOylation band (lane 4, lower panel), indicating that K955 is a site for SUMO modification in FOG-2. (B) FOG-2 wt and single, triple and quadruple mutants were co-expressed with GFP-SUMO-1 (lanes 3 to 9). The SUMOylated FOG-2 species are indicated by black dots in the blot and by arrowheads (upper panel). Mutation of K955 (lane 7) abolished the fourth SUMOylation band, indicating that, apart from K955, FOG-2 possesses 3 additional SUMO acceptor sites. Mutation of the other 3 sites (K324/471/915) results in a single SUMOylation band corresponding to K955 (lane 8). Mutation of K324/471/915/955R led to the abolition of FOG-2 SUMOylation (lane 9). The expression of GFP-SUMO-1 and the total SUMOylation levels in the cell extracts are shown in the middle and lower panels, respectively. IB, immunoblot.</p>

        <title>FOG-2 is a Target for SUMOylation</title>
        <p>Inspection of the mouse FOG-2 sequence with the SUMOsp package <xref rid="pone.0050637-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> found 12 lysine residues that were potential SUMOylation sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050637-t001">Table 1</xref>). These putative SUMOylated amino acids are distributed along the molecule but are not found within zinc finger domains. To determine if FOG-2 is a substrate for SUMO modification, COS-7 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding murine FOG-2 in the presence or absence of a SUMO-1 expression vector (it is convenient to analyze the SUMOylation of proteins which might possess multiple SUMOylation sites with SUMO-1 since it does not form poly-SUMO chains). Nuclear extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-FOG-2 antibody. FOG-2 was readily detected at an apparent molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). FOG-2 is typically observed at an apparent molecular mass higher than the predicted 127 kDa in COS-7, HeLa, 293 Cells and in cell free transcription/translation systems (J. Perdomo, unpublished). Svensson et al <xref rid="pone.0050637-Svensson2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> also observed FOG-2 at a higher molecular mass in COS-7 cells and in an in vitro transcription/translation system. Higher molecular mass species were detected with the anti-FOG-2 antibody only when the SUMO-1 expression vector was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, arrowheads) indicating that FOG-2 can be modified by SUMO-1 when both proteins are co-expressed in COS-7 cells.</p>

        <p>To ascertain if endogenous FOG-2 was modified by SUMO, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were obtained from C2C12 myoblasts in the presence or absence of the SUMO isopeptidase inhibitor NEM, which prevents deSUMOylation. A slower migrating band was detected in the nuclear fraction by the FOG-2 antibody only in the presence of NEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), indicating that endogenous FOG-2 is modified by SUMO in C2C12 cells.</p>

        <title>FOG-2 is SUMOylated at Lysines 324, 471, 915 and 955</title>
        <p>Lysine residues with a high probability of SUMOylation are shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. Three of these lysines (324, 471 and 915), fall within canonical SUMOylation sites, while the other predicted residues are part of non-consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050637-t001">Table 1</xref>). The putative SUMOylated lysines within the consensus sequences were mutated to arginine and vectors encoding these constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells in the presence or absence of HA-SUMO-1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> shows that both wild-type and the mutants K324R, K471R or K915R were SUMOylated by HA-SUMO-1, suggesting that there may be more than one acceptor site in FOG-2.</p>
        <p>It is apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> that FOG-2 is being modified by more than one SUMO-1 moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, arrowheads). However, the high molecular mass of FOG-2 precluded unambiguous separation of the SUMOylated species as SUMO-1 increases the apparent molecular mass of modified proteins by only approximately 20 kDa. For this reason, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for FOG-2 and a GFP-SUMO-1 fusion that increases the size of the SUMO moiety to approximately 50 kDa. At least 3 slower migrating species were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lane 2, arrowheads) indicating that more than two lysine residues in FOG-2 could be targeted by SUMO-1. A number of single and combination mutants were generated and then expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed by Western blot. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 3â6, shows a selection of these mutants. Combinations of double and triple mutants revealed that all SUMOylation bands, except one, were abolished when lysine residues 324, 471 and 915 were mutated to arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lane 6).</p>
        <p>Mutation of several other residues that also had a high theoretical probability of being SUMOylated such as K729 and K1049 in conjunction with residues 324, 471 and 915 did not prevent the appearance of a single SUMOylation band (data not shown). To define the region of the last SUMOylation site of FOG-2, a series of deletion mutants was created and then subjected to SUMOylation in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Fragments 509â1151 and 729â1151 were SUMOylated at apparently a single site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, FOG-2(509â1151), lane 3 and FOG-2(729â1151), lane 2). Single point mutations in the 729â1151 fragment did not completely abrogate SUMO modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, FOG-2(729â1151)KR mutants, lanes 3â5). Additional mutations in the fragment containing amino acids 881â1092 of FOG-2 identified K955 as a SUMO-acceptor residue, and mutation of this amino acid, in combination with K915, resulted in the complete elimination of SUMOylation of this FOG-2 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, FOG-2(881â1092), lane 4). The validity of this result was then confirmed in the context of the full-length protein. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> shows that the quadruple mutant (from now on termed FOG-2-4KR) is not modified by SUMO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, lane 9, upper panel). Thus K324, K471, K915 and K955 are the only SUMO acceptor sites in mouse FOG-2.</p>
        <p>The mapping of the FOG-2 SUMOylation sites was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of SUMOylated FOG-2 wt, K324/471/915R and 4KR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> shows that at least two SUMOylated bands are pulled down by the anti-GFP antibody when FOG-2 wt is SUMOylated by GFP-SUMO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, lane 2, upper panel). The anti-GFP antibody also precipitated a single SUMOylated band when the K324/471/915R mutant molecule was used as a substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, lane 3, upper panel). In contrast, no SUMOylated FOG-2 was immunoprecipitated when the K324/471/915/955R mutant was co-expressed with GFP-SUMO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, lane 4, upper panel). Collectively, these experiments show that FOG-2 is targeted for SUMO modification at K324, 471, 915 and 955. The four SUMOylation sites identified in murine FOG-2 show strong conservation across the species examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), which would suggest preserved biological functionality.</p>

We expressed GFP-FOG-2 fusion proteins in COS-7 cells and asked whether intact SUMOylation sites were required for nuclear localization.

        <title>Lack of SUMOylation Potentiates FOG-2â²s Repression Capacity</title>
        <p>The transcriptional activity of FOG proteins was demonstrated previously in transient transfection assays in heterologous cells <xref rid="pone.0050637-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050637-Svensson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050637-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

        <p>As reported previously <xref rid="pone.0050637-Svensson2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, GATA-4 increased the activity of the reporter gene significantly and this activation was repressed by co-expression of increasing amounts of wild-type FOG-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).

            <p>HeLa cells were co-transfected with a reporter construct containing the luciferase gene under the control of the BNP promoter and the indicated vectors. Dual luciferase assays were performed 24 h post-transfection. (A) The BNP promoter was activated by GATA-4 and, as expected, wt FOG-2 repressed this activation. Expression of the SUMOylation mutant molecule (FOG-2-4KR) resulted in significantly stronger repression activity. The immunoblots represent total cell lysates from the transfected cells probed with the antibodies indicated in the Figure. (B) The BNP promoter was activated by GATA-4 and this activation was strongly repressed by FOG-2-4KR. The constitutively SUMOylated fusion protein SUMO-1-FOG-2-4KR failed to repress GATA-4-mediated activation. The immunoblots represent total cell lysates from the transfected cells probed with the antibodies indicated in the Figure. Data represent the mean Â± SD from 3 independent experiments (C) Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were nucleofected with the vectors indicated in the Figure. In agreement with the findings in <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, FOG-2-4KR showed stronger repression activity than the wt, while the SUMO-1-FOG-2-4KR fusion demonstrated significantly reduced repression capacity. Of note, co-expression of GATA-4 in cardiomyocytes did not activate the BNP promoter significantly most likely due to quenching by the presence of endogenous GATA-4. In addition, the repression exerted by FOG-2 and FOG-2-4KR reduced luciferase activity to levels lower than the reporter itself, again suggesting that the promoter alone was activated by endogenous GATA-4 and that FOG-2 repressed this activity. Data represent the arithmetic mean from 2 independent experiments. IB, immunoblot; ns, not significant; nr, no reporter; S-1, SUMO-1; F2m, FOG-2-4KR; S-1F2m, SUMO-1-FOG-2-4KR.</p>

        <p>Having shown that mutation of the SUMO acceptor lysines in FOG-2 led to enhanced repression capacity, we wished to corroborate the observations using an artificially SUMOylated molecule. It has been shown that mimicking SUMOylation by fusing SUMO to a substrate can recapitulate to a large extent the effects of SUMO modification at the natural target sites <xref rid="pone.0050637-Gill2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. To this end, we fused SUMO-1 at the N terminus of mutant FOG-2 (SUMO-1-FOG-2-4KR) and tested the transcriptional activity of this chimeric construct. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> shows that expression of SUMO-1-FOG-2-4KR abolished the capacity of FOG-2-4KR to repress GATA-4-mediated transcription, thus implicating SUMOylation in a mechanism that leads FOG-2 to alternate between a repressive and a more permissive transcriptional status. Even though SUMO fusion proteins are artificial and probably exhibit an aberrant level of SUMOylation (the fusion protein is constantly SUMOylated), the fact that SUMO-1-FOG-2-4KR reversed the repression activity of FOG-2-4KR strongly implies that SUMOylation attenuates FOG-2-mediated repression.</p>
        <p>We next examined whether SUMOylation is relevant for the transcriptional activity of FOG-2 in cardiac cells. AmaxaÂ® nucleofection technology was used to co-transfect the expression vectors indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g006">Fig. 6C</xref> into neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The transfection efficiency was determined visually by co-transfection of a GFP expression vector. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g006">Fig. 6C</xref> substantiates the observations in HeLa cells, with FOG-2-4KR demonstrating augmented repression capacity and the SUMO-1-FOG-2-4KR chimera neutralizing the repressive competence.</p>
        <p>Moreover, co-expression of increasing amounts of SUMO-1 in HeLa cells reduced the repression activity of wt FOG-2 but not that of FOG-2-4KR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). As anticipated from their function, co-expression of the SUMO-specific de-SUMOylating enzymes SENP-1 and SENP-8 resulted in the abrogation of FOG-2 SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Notably, co-expression of both SENP-1 and SENP-8 also led to a significant increase in FOG-2â²s repression capacity in the presence of SUMO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Altogether, the data imply that absence of SUMOylation renders FOG-2 a more effective transcriptional repressor.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>SUMO modification is a post-translational process regulates the biological activity of many proteins. The experiments presented in this study demonstrate that SUMOylation is a key factor in the biological function of the transcriptional co-regulator FOG-2. Specifically we show that: 1) FOG-2 undergoes SUMO modification and mutation of four specific lysines is sufficient to abrogate SUMOylation; 2) SUMOylation is not required for the nuclear distribution of FOG-2; 3) lack of SUMOylation switches FOG-2 into a more potent transcriptional repressor; and 4) there is a correlation between the FOG-2/GATA-4 interaction and SUMO modification.</p>
      <p>Systematic mutation of putative SUMOylation sites in FOG-2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050637-t001">Table 1</xref>) led to the identification of the first three SUMO acceptor lysines (K324, K471 and K915). These residues lie within the characteristic SUMO consensus sequence ÏKXE, where the amino acid preceding the target lysine is large and hydrophobic, most commonly a valine, leucine or isoleucine. A fourth SUMOylation site (K955) was found within the less frequent TKEE sequence, where a hydrophilic residue, namely a threonine, precedes the target lysine. The TKXE consensus, though uncommon, has also been reported for TIF1Î², p45-NF-E2 and TEL/ETV6 <xref rid="pone.0050637-Mascle1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050637-Shyu1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050637-Kotaja1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The four SUMOylation sites identified in murine FOG-2 are conserved across the species examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) suggesting functional conservation.</p>
      <p>Most substrates contain only one or two SUMO acceptor residues <xref rid="pone.0050637-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. There are some factors, however, with multiple SUMOylation sites; these include PML, GRIP1 and ELK-1 with three SUMOylation sites each <xref rid="pone.0050637-Kotaja1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050637-Kamitani1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050637-Salinas1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and TIF1Î² which is modified by SUMO at six positions <xref rid="pone.0050637-Mascle1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Moreover, there appears to be preferential modification of certain residues, for instance BKLF is modified at one major and one minor site <xref rid="pone.0050637-Perdomo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> while TIF1Î² contains three major and three minor SUMOylation sites <xref rid="pone.0050637-Mascle1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In FOG-2, K471 and K955 are modified strongly by SUMO-1 while K324 and K915 are SUMOylated to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050637-g003">3</xref> and data not shown). SUMOylation of endogenous FOG-2 in C2C12 cells revealed only one main SUMOylated species. However, detection of all endogenous SUMOylated species is not always feasible due to the small amount of SUMO-conjugated proteins usually found in cells <xref rid="pone.0050637-Jakobs1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although the role of SUMOylation in nuclear targeting has been established for some proteins <xref rid="pone.0050637-Pichler1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the nuclear localization of many other proteins is unaffected by SUMOylation <xref rid="pone.0050637-Snow1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050637-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Our data show that nuclear targeting of FOG-2 in COS-7 and HeLa cells does not depend on the presence of intact SUMOylation sites, indicating that for FOG-2 SUMO modification is dispensable for nuclear transport. Nevertheless, SUMOylation was found to be functionally required for the transcriptional activity of FOG-2. Mutations that abolished SUMOylation, or de-SUMOylation by SUMO peptidases strengthened the capacity of FOG-2 to repress the GATA-4-activated BNP promoter. Lack of SUMOylation leading to increased repression activity was previously observed in the erythroid transcription factor Ikaros <xref rid="pone.0050637-GmezDelArco1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Conversely, additional FOG-2 SUMOylation or expression of a SUMO-1-FOG2-4KR chimeric protein abrogated the repressive function of FOG-2 and FOG-2-4KR, respectively, linking SUMO to the modulation of FOG-2-mediated transcription. How can SUMOylation restrain FOG-2â²s activity? The finding that the E3 ligases examined did not increase FOG-2 SUMOylation suggested that other factors could be involved in the control of FOG-2 SUMO modification. Recent work <xref rid="pone.0050637-Snow1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and our unpublished observation that the SUMOylation of FOG-1 is increased in the presence of GATA-1 led to the finding that FOG-2 SUMOylation is strongly enhanced by the presence of GATA-4. Moreover, the FOG-2/GATA-4 interaction is influenced by the SUMOylation state of FOG-2, with a more than 3-fold increase in the retention of GATA-4 by the mutant FOG-2-4KR molecule. This strongly suggests that the level of FOG-2 SUMOylation may be part of a regulatory loop in which GATA-4 itself modulates the activity of its co-repressor. Since SUMOylation is a dynamic and reversible modification, this could serve as a flexible mechanism to rapidly fine-tune the activity of FOG-2. This study supports the proposal that an increase in SUMOylation promotes GATA-4 transcriptional activity by up-regulating GATA-4 activation <xref rid="pone.0050637-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and by decreasing the repression activity of FOG-2.</p>
      <p>In summary, this study provides evidence that the biological activity of FOG-2 is dependent on the presence of intact SUMOylation sites. FOG-2 SUMO mutants served as stronger transcriptional repressors and interacted more efficiently with GATA-4. These observations suggest that SUMO modification is a crucial mechanism for FOG-2-mediated transcriptional repression. In addition, it is known that FOG-2 is essential for cardiac development <xref rid="pone.0050637-Tevosian1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and that GATA-4 <xref rid="pone.0050637-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, NKX-2.5 <xref rid="pone.0050637-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050637-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, p300 <xref rid="pone.0050637-Girdwood1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and other cardiac proteins <xref rid="pone.0050637-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> are also targets for SUMO modification and that decreased SUMOylation can result in development of congenital heart defects <xref rid="pone.0050637-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. All these data together with our findings place SUMOylation as a critical regulatory event of both cardiogenesis and adult cardiac function.</p>

<bold>E3 ligases or Ubc9 do not increase FOG-2 SUMOylation.</bold> (A) COS-7 cells were transfected with a FOG-2 expression vector (left panel) or FOG-2 plus GFP-SUMO-1 (right panel) and the expression vectors indicated in the figure. Cell lysates were obtained in the presence of NEM and the proteins detected by Western blot. The presence of the SUMO E2 ligase Ubc9 in the absence (lane 2, left panel) or presence (lane 7, left panel) of co-expressed SUMO-1 did not increase FOG-2 SUMOylation. An inactive mutant of Ubc9 (Ubc9C93S) was used as negative control (lane 3, left panel). Co-expression of FOG-2 with a minimal amount of GFP-SUMO-1 plasmid (100 ng) led to weak FOG-2 SUMOylation (lane 1, right panel, arrowheads). Co-transfection of the indicated SUMO E3 ligases did not increase FOG-2 SUMOylation (lanes 2 to 5, right panel). In fact there was a decrease in FOG-2 SUMOylation in the presence of Ubc9 (lane 7, left panel) or E3 ligases (lanes 2 to 5, right panel). This is likely due to the depletion of available SUMO due to the E2- and E3-mediated increase in SUMOylation of other cellular proteins. Together, these experiments indicate that, in COS-7 cells the SUMOylation of FOG-2 is not influenced by co-expression of E2 or E3 ligases. (B) Nuclear localization in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-FOG-2 or GFP-FOG-2-4KR fusion proteins as indicated in the figure. The cell nuclei were stained with PI (red). There was no detectable difference in the sub-cellular or sub-nuclear distribution of wt and mutant FOG-2. Asterisks indicate non-specific bands detected by the FOG-2 antibody. IB, immunoblot.</p>
