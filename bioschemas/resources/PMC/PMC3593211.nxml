        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Various specialized domains have been described in the cytosol and the nucleus; however, little is known about compartmentalization within the mitochondrial matrix. GRSF1 (G-rich sequence factor 1) is an RNA binding protein that was previously reported to localize in the cytosol. We found that an isoform of GRSF1 accumulates in discrete foci in the mitochondrial matrix. These foci are composed of nascent mitochondrial RNA and also contain RNase P, an enzyme that participates in mitochondrial RNA processing. GRSF1 was found to interact with RNase P and to be required for processing of both classical and tRNA-less RNA precursors. In its absence, cleavage of primary RNA transcripts is abnormal, leading to decreased expression of mitochondrially encoded proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings suggest that the foci containing GRSF1 and RNase P correspond to sites where primary RNA transcripts converge to be processed. We have termed these large ribonucleoprotein structures âmitochondrial RNA granules.â</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitochondria are involved in many metabolic processes, a primary function being to convert energy from nutrients into ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. These organelles are thought to derive from an ancient endosymbiotic event between an Î±-proteobacterium and the ancestor of modern eukaryotic cells. Over evolutionary time most of the ancestral bacterial genes have been transferred to the nucleus, requiring &gt;1,000 nuclear-encoded proteins to translocate to the mitochondrion following cytosolic synthesis (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Pagliarini etÂ al., 2008</xref>). As a result, most mitochondrial genomes are generally smaller than their bacterial ancestors, as is the case for the 16.6 kb human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).</p>
      <p>The human mitochondrial genome encodes two ribosomal RNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 open reading frames (ORFs) that are transcribed and translated within the organelle. The mitochondrial genetic information is indispensable for the function of respiratory complexes I, III, IV, and V, as exemplified by the large number of human disorders attributed to mtDNA mutations and the role such mutations may play in aging (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Trifunovic etÂ al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Wallace, 1997</xref>).</p>
      <p>Mitochondrial transcription occurs on both DNA strands and gives rise to three polycistronic primary transcripts (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Montoya etÂ al., 1983</xref>). The primary mitochondrial transcripts are composed of ORFs and rRNAs that are usually punctuated by tRNAs (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ojala etÂ al., 1981</xref>). Cleavage of tRNAs at their 5â² and 3â² ends byÂ RNase P and RNase Z, respectively, releases individual RNA species from the polycistronic precursor that are further matured, as reviewed by <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Temperley etÂ al. (2010)</xref>. Defects in mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) processing have been associated with several mitochondrial disorders (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki etÂ al., 2011</xref>), making it important to understand in more detail how mtRNA processing is spatially and temporally organized with regard to both transcription and translation.</p>
      <p>Recently, one of the RNA processing enzymes was identified in mitochondria (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Holzmann etÂ al., 2008</xref>). It is a protein-only RNase P, composed of three subunits, MRPP1 (RG9MTD1), MRPP2 (HSD17B1), and MRPP3 (KIAA0391). These three proteins are necessary and sufficient for 5â² tRNA processing inÂ vitro. An additional RNA-containing RNase P has been reported, but its substrate specificity has not been confirmed (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen etÂ al., 2006</xref>). Processing of the tRNA 3â² end is performed by an RNase Z type enzyme, namely ELAC2 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brzezniak etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Four of the mtORFs are not flanked on both sides by a tRNA. The 5â² junction of <italic>MTCO1</italic> with noncoding RNA (ncRNA) does not have an intervening canonical tRNA. However, the upstream ncRNA sequence has been proposed to adopt a tRNA-like structure, and so the processing of this transcription unit also depends on RNase P (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Mercer etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez etÂ al., 2011</xref>). The three other ORF junctions that are devoid of tRNAs are <italic>MTND6</italic>-ncRNA, <italic>MTND5</italic>-<italic>MTCYB</italic>, and RNA14-<italic>MTCO3</italic>, and these do not depend on RNase P/Z for their processing (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brzezniak etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez etÂ al., 2011</xref>). In the case of <italic>MTND5</italic>-<italic>MTCYB</italic>, it has been shown that the pentatricopeptide-containing protein PTCD2 is necessary for processing (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Xu etÂ al., 2008</xref>), but, to our knowledge, no factor has been identified that can resolve the processing of the two others.</p>
      <p>GRSF1 (G-rich sequence factor 1) was originally identified asÂ aÂ cytosolic RNA-binding protein with high affinity for G-rich sequences (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Qian and Wilusz, 1994</xref>). GRSF1 belongs to the family of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins F/H (hnRNP) (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Schaub etÂ al., 2007</xref>) and contains three quasi-RNA-recognition motifs (qRRM) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ufer, 2012</xref>). Members of this family are involved in different steps of posttranscriptional RNA processing, such as RNA splicing, polyadenylation, and transport in RNA granules, as shown in oligodendrocytes (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Han etÂ al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">White etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, GRSF1 has been reported to play a role in the translation of mRNA species of both cellular and viral origin, including those containing IRES elements (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Jablonski and Caputi, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kash etÂ al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Park etÂ al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ufer etÂ al., 2008</xref>). Thus, GRSF1 appears to be a multifunctional protein, whose function is likely to involve binding to G-rich sequences (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ufer, 2012</xref>). Recently, GRSF1 has been identified in a proteomic analysis of mitochondria and appeared in a list of proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bayona-Bafaluy etÂ al., 2011</xref>; R.N.L., unpublished data; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Pagliarini etÂ al., 2008</xref>). The mitochondrial function of GRSF1 remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Here, we report that an isoform of GRSF1 resides in a novel mitochondrial structure that we have called âmitochondrial RNA granules,â where it plays an essential role in precursor RNA processing.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.1">
        <title>GRSF1 Is a Mitochondrial Protein</title>
        <p>We investigated whether several isoforms of GRSF1 might beÂ responsible for the multiple roles attributed to the gene. According to the NCBI database, the <italic>GRSF1</italic> gene encodes two splice variants (i.e., isoform 1 [NM_002092] and isoform 2 [NM_001098477]; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A). The longer mRNA corresponds to isoform 1 and encodes a 480 amino acid protein. Isoform 2 contains an alternate exon in the 5â² coding region and utilizes a downstream start codon. Thus, the resulting isoform 2 has a shorter N terminus that lacks the first 162 amino acids presentÂ in isoform 1. The three conserved qRRM are present in both GRSF1 variants. Mitochondrial targeting prediction tools (MitoProt II [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Claros and Vincens, 1996</xref>]) yield a probability of 98.99% that isoform 1 has a mitochondrial localization signal, withÂ a cleavage site predicted after tyrosine 118. In contrast, isoform 2 is not predicted to have any mitochondrial localization signal (0.02%, MitoProt; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A).</p>
        <p>We tagged both isoforms of GRSF1 at their carboxyl termini and expressed them in HeLa cells. GRSF1 isoform 1 was observed in mitochondria, where it colocalized with the mitochondrial protein Tom20 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B). Intriguingly, this isoform was concentrated in discrete foci inside the mitochondrial tubules. In contrast, expression of isoform 2 resulted in a diffuse staining in both the cytosol and nucleus. The different localizations between GRSF1 isoforms were confirmed in mitochondrial import assays where we could successfully import radiolabeled inÂ vitro-translated GRSF1 isoform 1, but not isoform 2, into mitochondria isolated from 143B cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C). This import was dependent on the membrane potential (ÎÎ¨m), and after import we observed presequence cleavage of GRSF1 isoform 1, which was not further investigated.</p>
        <p>To analyze the localization of endogenous GRSF1, 143B cells were immunolabeled with anti-GRSF1 and anti-Tom20 antibodies. GRSF1 was exclusively localized in mitochondria and accumulated in discrete foci in 143B or HeLa cells, suggesting that these cells preferentially express isoform 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). Protein immunoblotting in different cell lysates confirmed the expression of isoform 1 in HeLa, 143B, HEK293T, and Jurkat cells (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref> online). In addition, in contrast to other cell types, Jurkat cells showed additional bands of lower molecular weight, which may correspond to additional isoforms. In agreement with our import experiment, we observed that endogenous GRSF1 isoform 1 was protected from degradation when mitochondria isolated from 143B cells were exposed to Proteinase K, even when mitochondria were swollen to rupture their outer membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D). These data indicate a matrix localization of the protein, and alkaline sodium carbonate treatment demonstrated that it was not integrated in the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E). Thus, in diverse cell types, GRSF1 is a mitochondrial matrix protein that is organized in discrete foci.</p>

        <title>GRSF1 Colocalizes with Nascent Mitochondrial RNA in Mitochondrial RNA Granules</title>
        <p>Next we characterized the nature of the foci formed by GRSF1. To assess whether the foci depend on genetic material of mitochondrial origin, we immunolabeled GRSF1 in 143B Ï<sup>0</sup> cells, which lack mtDNA and therefore mtRNA. Although GRSF1 was still localized to mitochondria in these cells, the protein was not concentrated in foci but was rather diffuse in the matrix, indicating that the formation of GRSF1 foci requires the presence of a mitochondrial genome (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>). The GRSF1 foci were reminiscent in terms of both size and distribution of those formed by mtDNA nucleoids. To test if these foci had overlapping contents, we immunolabeled HeLa cells with antibodies against both GRSF1 and the nucleoid marker mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein (mtSSB). Fewer than 8% of the GRSF1 foci were found to colocalize with mtSSB foci (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2C). Similar results were obtained with another nucleoid marker, Twinkle-EGFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). Since GRSF1 is an RNA-binding protein, we hypothesized that the GRSF1 foci may contain RNA and thus performed bromouridine (BrU) labeling experiments to detect nascent mtRNAs, as previously described (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Iborra etÂ al., 2004</xref>). Eighty-eight percent of BrU-labeled foci colocalized with GRSF1 foci, strongly suggesting that GRSF1 associates with nascent RNA in mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C). We have named these foci composed of nascent RNA and GRSF1 âmitochondrial RNA granulesâ (MRGs).</p>

        <title>GRSF1 Is Required to Maintain Mitochondrial Gene Expression</title>
        <p>Given the colocalization of GRSF1 and nascent mtRNA, we tested whether GRSF1 may play a role in mtRNA metabolism. Downregulation of GRSF1 was obtained by lipotransfection of a synthetic RNAi (RNAi1) or by using lentiviral-mediated shRNA delivery (RNAi2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). Interestingly, we found that the protein levels of COX1 and COX2, two mitochondrially encoded proteins, were significantly reduced in both RNAi1-treated and RNAi2-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). The effect of GRSF1 RNAi on mitochondrially encoded proteins was specific to the mitochondrial form of GRSF1, since RNAi1 only targets isoform 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A). GRSF1-depleted cells were found to adopt a glycolytic metabolism, as shown by acidification of the culture medium, a common feature observed when cells cannot properly perform oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B). To further understand the role of GRSF1 on mitochondrial function, we analyzed the levels of mitochondrially encoded RNAs in GRSF1-depleted 143B cells and found that GRSF1 depletion affected 9 of the 11 mRNA transcription units tested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C). As expected, GRSF1 isoform 1 transcripts themselves were reduced by &gt;85% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>D), whereas nuclear-encoded transcripts were unaffected or slightly upregulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>E). These results were confirmed by northern analysis of RNAi2-treated cells and also showed that rRNA and certain tRNA were affected by the absence of GRSF1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>F and 3G and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>). In accordance with these results, we observed a global decrease in mitochondrial translation products in RNAi2-infected 143B cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>H and 3I). Together these results show that GRSF1 is required to maintain mitochondrial gene expression in 143B cells.</p>

        <p>To gain further insight into the mechanism by which GRSF1 regulates mtRNA levels, we searched for GRSF1 binding partners. For this experiment, GRSF1, along with any interacting proteins was affinity purified from HEK293T cells expressing GRSF1-FLAG, and the resulting protein mixture was analyzed by mass spectrometry (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). Among the putative GRSF1 partners, RNase P showed the highest emPAI value (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ishihama etÂ al., 2005</xref>), with a score of 35.9 and 8.2 for MRPP2 and MRPP1, respectively. To confirm the interaction between GRSF1 and MRPP1, we performed reverse coimmunoprecipitation in which HEK293T cells were transfected with MRPP1-FLAG and GRSF1-HA and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG antibodies. We found that a significant amount of GRSF1-HA coimmunoprecipitated with MRPP1-FLAG, confirming our initial findings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). Similar results were obtained when RNA was degraded with RNase A prior to the pull-down assay, indicating that the interaction between GRSF1 and MRPP1 was not mediated byÂ RNA. In agreement with these results, we observed that MRPP1 colocalized with GRSF1 and BrU in MRGs, with 92% of foci showing both MRPP1 and GRSF1 labeling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B and 4C). MRPP3, the third component of RNase P, was not significantly enriched in the GRSF1 affinity purification. This was not unexpected, since the affinity between this subunit and the other two components is known to be weak and to be significantly decreased in the presence of salt (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Holzmann etÂ al., 2008</xref>). We therefore checked MRPP3 localization by immunocytochemistry using a MYC tag positioned at its C terminus. We found that, like MRPP1 and GRSF1, MRPP3 also accumulates in MRGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). Finally, our results with RNase P prompted us to investigate whether RNase Z (ELAC2) also colocalizes with MRGs. However, in contrast to RNase P, ELAC2 was found to be diffuse in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>A).</p>
        <p>In addition to RNase P, the coimmunoprecipitation experiment also identified a number of other putative GRSF1 partners, among which were several RNA-related proteins, including components of the cytosolic or mitochondrial ribosomes. This prompted us to test whether GRSF1 itself could be a component of mitoribosomes. However, using isokinetic sucrose density gradients we did not find cosedimentation of GRSF1 with either the mitoribosomal protein MRPL12 or DAP3 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Together, these data show that GRSF1 interacts and colocalizes with RNase P in mtRNA granules.</p>

        <title>Loss of GRSF1 Leads to Aberrant Mitochondrial RNA Processing</title>
        <p>RNase P has previously been reported to play a role in the processing of a number of transcripts that are flanked by tRNAs. RNase P cleaves tRNAs at their 5â² end and thereby participates in the so-called âtRNA punctuation modelâ (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ojala etÂ al., 1981</xref>). This prompted us to test whether GRSF1 may cooperate with RNase P in the processing of mitochondrial primary transcripts involving tRNA excision (a linear representation of the mitochondrial genome can be found in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A). Using northern blot analyses of mtRNAs from control and GRSF1-depleted 143B cells, we observed a decrease in mature mitochondrially encoded tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, 16S rRNA, tRNA<sup>Leu(UUA/G)</sup>, <italic>MTND1</italic>, RNA14, <italic>MTCO3</italic>, and <italic>MTND5</italic> in GRSF1-deficient cells, confirming the data obtained by Nanostring analysis as described above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>). In contrast to the decrease in processedÂ RNA, we found that several precursors, most notably tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> and tRNA<sup>Val</sup> precursors, were significantly increased in GRSF1-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B, 5F, and 5G). Similar results showing even more dramatic increases were obtained for tRNA-containing precursors in MRPP1-deficient cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>) (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Holzmann etÂ al., 2008</xref>). However, in GRSF1-depleted cells, not all transcripts showed this expression profile, as, for example, steady-state levels of tRNA<sup>Met</sup> remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B, 5F, and 5G).</p>
        <p>Except for the 5â² upstream region of <italic>MTCO1</italic>, RNase P is notÂ involved in the processing of precursor RNA devoid of flanking tRNA (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez etÂ al., 2011</xref>). We tested whether instead GRSF1 would play a more general role, including the processing of the tRNA-less RNA precursors. Analysis of RNA processing at the RNA14-<italic>MTCO3</italic>, <italic>MTND5-CYB</italic>, and <italic>MTND6-</italic>ncRNA junctions revealed a significant increase in the amounts of precursor transcripts for RNA14-<italic>MTCO3</italic> and <italic>MTND5-CYB</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>D, 5F, and 5G). In addition, we found that <italic>MTND6</italic>, the only mitochondrial mRNA encoded by the light strand, was shorter inÂ GRSF1-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D), whereas certain high-molecular-weight forms of <italic>MTND6</italic> accumulated in the absence of GRSF1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D, arrows 2, 3, and 4), while others decreased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D, arrow 1). Thus, in contrast to RNase P, GRSF1 appears to be involved more generally in the processing ofÂ a wide range of primary transcripts.</p>
        <p>Most mtRNA precursors are thought toÂ have a short life span, although certainÂ precursors have been reported to accumulate in mitochondria from humanÂ cells and tissue (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Temperley etÂ al., 2010</xref>). Among these, RNA19, a polycistronic RNA composed of 16SÂ rRNA, tRNA<sup>Leu(UUA/G)</sup>, and <italic>MTND1</italic>, is one of the most abundant (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bindoff etÂ al., 1993</xref>). The function of this stable RNA species isÂ currently unknown, but its accumulation has been described in several human mitochondrial pathologies (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Northern blot analysis of RNA19 using probes directed against 16S rRNA, tRNA<sup>Leu(UUA/G)</sup>, or <italic>MTND1</italic> showed a decrease in RNA19 in GRSF1 RNAi2-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 5F).</p>
        <p>Our data indicate that mtRNA processing is strongly perturbed in the absence of GRSF1, in a manner that appears to extend beyond dysfunction of RNase P.</p>

        <title>Short-Term Transcription Inhibition Results in the Loss of Mitochondrial RNA Granules</title>
        <p>As mentioned above, MRGs are not observed in Ï<sup>0</sup> cells that lack mtRNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>). We hypothesized that RNA plays an essential role in the formation of MRGs. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited RNA transcription in 143B cells by treatment with 3Â Î¼M actinomycin D (Act D) for 2Â hr (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). Importantly, whereas transcription inhibition did not affect the level of mature tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, or <italic>MTCO3</italic> transcripts, it significantly affected their precursor RNAs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C). We then tested whether transcription inhibition could have an impact on the formationÂ of MRGs. HeLa cells transfected with GRSF1-HA were incubated for 2Â hr with 3Â Î¼M ActD or 3Â Î¼g/mL ethidium bromide (EtBr), another transcription inhibitor, and were subsequently immunostained with anti-HA and anti-Tom20 antibodies. Whereas untreated cells showed MRGs, those treated with ActD or EtBr lacked MRGs as assessed by GRSF1 immunostaining. Indeed, in cells treated with transcription inhibitors, GRSF1 was homogenously distributed in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D). Similar results were obtained using MRPP1-FLAG as a MRG marker (data not shown). All together, these experiments show a correlation between a reduction in the level of precursor RNAs and the disappearance of MRGs, suggesting that unprocessed transcripts may be required for the organization ofÂ MRGs.</p>

        <title>The Kinetics of RNA Release from MRGs Is Dependent on RNA Processing</title>
        <p>All data presented above suggest that MRGs may be sites where precursor RNA transcripts converge to be processed before release (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). Based on this hypothesis, we predicted that altering RNA processing should increase the time RNA precursors would spend within the granules. To test this hypothesis, we measured the half-life of BrU-labeled MRGs following a BrU/uridine pulse chase. To perform this experiment, cells were labeled during a 60Â min pulse of BrU followed by a chase with excess uridine for up to 180Â min. As expected, before the chase, BrU-labeled transcripts were concentrated in MRGs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A). Following addition of unlabeled uridine, the number of cells with mitochondrial BrU foci decreased with time up to 90Â min, at which point no cell with labeled MRGs could be detected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A and 7C). In agreement with previous results from Iborra and collaborators (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Iborra etÂ al., 2004</xref>), we estimated that the half-life of BrU foci was â¼50Â min (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C). We next perturbed RNA processing by depleting cells of either GRSF1 or MRPP1, and then the half-life of BrU positive MRGs was measured. 143B cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying an empty vector or a shRNA against GRSF1, which led toÂ a drastic reduction in GRSF1 expression in all cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B). BrU pulse-labeling experiments showed that the half-life of BrU-labeled MRGs was significantly longer in GRSF1-depleted cells (â¼130Â min) than in control cells (â¼50Â min) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A and 7C). Similar results were obtained when GRSF1-depleted cells and control cells were mixed and cultured together for 24Â hr, prior to BrU pulse-chase and microscopic analysis. Expression ofÂ GFP in the control cells allowed us toÂ distinguish each population. Before chase, both control and GRSF1-deficient cells expressed BrU-labeled MRGs whose number and fluorescence intensity did not appear to differ between the twoÂ populations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>D). In contrast, after 90Â min of chase, only the GRSF1-depleted cells showed labeled MRGs. A similar observation was made when RNA processing was altered by downregulation of MRPP1, where again we observed a strong delay in the disappearance of BrU-labeled MRGs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>A). This effect was unlikely to be the consequence of a defect in mitochondrial translation, since inhibition of translation using the protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol did not modify the half-life of BrU-labeled MRGs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>B). All together, our data demonstrate that the presence of nascent RNA in MRGs is transient and that its release from MRGs depends on the efficiency of RNA processing.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we report that isoform 1 of the RNA-binding protein GRSF1 colocalizes with nascent RNA and RNase P in a submitochondrial compartment that we have called âmitochondrial RNA granulesâ (MRGs). We found that GRSF1 is required for mtRNA expression and protein synthesis in mitochondria. Moreover, downregulation of GRSF1 or MRPP1, a subunit of RNase P, delays the transit of nascent RNA through MRGs, leading to reduced levels of mature mtRNA and reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis. These data strongly suggest that mtRNA processingÂ and generation of functional RNA species are dependent on the integrity of the MRG.</p>
      <p>Little is known about the mechanisms and regulation of mtRNA processing. We have identified GRSF1 as a key player in the processing of tRNA-containing andÂ tRNA-lacking precursors. We have shown that GRSF1 binds the MRPP1 and MRPP2 subunits of RNase P, while the third subunit, MRPP3, was shown to colocalize with GRSF1 by immunohistochemistry. In addition, GRSF1 probably also acts in an RNase P-independent manner, since its activity is implicated in the processing of the tRNA-lacking precursors. Indeed, we found that GRSF1 is the first protein to be required for the processing of RNA14-<italic>MTCO3</italic> and <italic>MTND6</italic>-ncRNA precursors. The mechanism by which GRSF1 exerts these functions is still unclear, and it remains to be determined whether the protein is able to bind to specific nucleotide sequences present in these precursors.</p>
      <p>Is GRSF1 also involved directly in mitochondrial protein synthesis, in addition to its role in RNA processing? We cannot rule this out, and the marked decrease in de novo mitochondrial protein synthesis upon GRSF1 depletion is perhaps more dramatic than would be predicted solely from the effects on RNA processing or stability. Moreover, we did see mitoribosomal proteins in the crude immunoprecipitation experiment. However, our sucrose gradient density fractionation showed no evidence of tight association between GRSF1 and mitoribosomal subunits. Further investigations will be required to understand whether GRSF1 could play a direct role in translation, whether a minor fraction of GRSF1 also interacts with the mature ribosomes, or whether the presence of mitoribosomal proteins in the immunoprecipitation corresponds to intermediates in the process of mitoribosome assembly.</p>
      <p>We show that the MRGs are distinct from mitochondrial nucleoids. Only fewer than 10% of them overlapped with the DNA-containing structures, and these MRGs may correspond to BrU-labeled foci found in close proximity to nucleoids as described by <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Iborra etÂ al. (2004)</xref>. Nucleoids overlapping with newly synthesized RNA have been previously reported to contain the mitochondrial transcription factor TEFM and have therefore been described as transcriptionally active nucleoids (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Minczuk etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the precursor transcripts may rapidly accumulate and mayÂ themselves promote the formation of MRGs by recruiting GRSF1, RNase P, and possibly other proteins involved in RNA precursor processing. This is supported by our findings that transient inhibition of transcription specifically affects the levels of precursor but not mature RNA and leads to the concomitant disappearance of MRGs. In contrast, inhibition of translation has no impact on the formation of MRGs, excluding the possibility that the disappearance of MRGs in cells exposed to transcription inhibitors is due to a drop in mitochondrial encoded proteins. How newly synthesized RNA dynamically induces the formation of granules is unknown, although this is likely to be through interaction with proteins, and thus a more complete analysis of the protein components of the MRG is likely to prove informative. In this context, it was recently proposed that RNA binding proteins containing low-complexity sequences could represent the organizing principle for the formation of cytosolic RNA granules (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Han etÂ al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kato etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Whether proteins of this type are involved in the formation of MRGs remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>It is likely that MRGs are dynamic structures whose number and composition may vary according to the metabolic state ofÂ the cell. Based on the phenotypic consequences of GRSF1 and RNase P knockdown on RNA processing, we postulate that at least part of RNA processing occurs in MRGs. This does not exclude the possibility that GRSF1 and RNase P may have additional functions outside MRGs, nor does it exclude the possibility that MRGs may have other functions beyond a role in RNA processing. Based on our hypothesis on the role of MRGs in processing of tRNA-containing polycistronic transcripts, we expected that RNase Z, the enzyme that cleaves tRNA at its 3â² terminus, would be enriched in MRGs; however, this does not appear to be the case. Instead, RNase Z immunostaining is diffuse in the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting that theÂ protein may have additional functions outside of MRGs and/or that its mitochondrial concentration is high enough in the matrix and not limiting for RNA processing in MRGs. Alternatively, RNase Z-induced cleavage of tRNA in precursor transcripts could occur outside of MRGs. Indeed, previous work has demonstrated that tRNAs are cleaved sequentially, initially at the 5â² end by RNase P, then at the 3â² end by RNase Z. Indeed, cells treated with RNAi against RNase P accumulate 3â² tRNA junctions (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez etÂ al., 2011</xref>). The MRG transcriptome analysis currently in progress in our laboratory should allow us to determine which precursor RNAs are found in these structures and may shed more light on the MRG-dependent events involved in mtRNA processing.</p>
      <p>In previous experiments, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Iborra etÂ al. (2004)</xref> observed the formation of BrU-positive foci that decreased exponentially after chase. In agreement with their results, we calculated that the half-life of BrU-labeled RNA in MRGs is â¼50Â min. The decrease in BrU-positive foci could be explained by RNA degradation or by its release into the matrix. Although we do not exclude the possibility of RNA degradation in MRGs, we favor the hypothesis that the granules are no longer visible when the transcripts have been released into the matrix, where their concentration drops significantly. Based on this hypothesis, we predicted thatÂ a dysfunction of the RNA processing machinery should lead to an increase in the time spent by nascent RNAs in MRGs. This prediction was confirmed by our observation that in the absence of GRSF1 or MRPP1, the persistence of BrU-positive MRGs was significantly increased compared to control.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have identified a new mitochondrial subcompartment, the mitochondrial RNA granules, where GRSF1 and RNase P act together to ensure mtRNA processing. Further characterization of the proteome and transcriptome of these structuresÂ should prove to be very useful in advancing our understanding of mtRNA processing and may reveal other essential posttranscriptional steps involved in mitochondrial gene regulation.</p>

        <p>Transcription Inhibition Induces the Disappearance of Mitochondria RNA Granules</p>
        <p>(A) Working model: we hypothesize that nascent mitochondrially encoded precursor RNAs converge to mitochondrial RNA granules (MRGs). MRGs contain nascent RNAs, GRSF1, and RNase P.

        <p>(A) Confocal analysis of 143B infected with pLKO or GRSF1 RNAi2-carrying lentiviruses after 60Â min of BrU pulse and 0 or 90Â min of chase with uridine.

        <p>(D) Confocal analysis of BrU pulse chase of mixed control (green) and GRSF1 RNAi2 cells. Control 143B cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying an empty pLKO vector and lentiviruses carrying the GFP gene (pLKOÂ + GFP), whereas GRSF1-depleted cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing GRSF1 RNAi2. All control cells were found to express GFP (data not shown). The two cell populations were mixed, selected with puromycin for 24Â hr to eliminate those cells that would not have been infected by lentiviruses, and incubated with BrU for 60Â min before chase with uridine. Cells were immunostained with anti-BrU and anti-Tom20 antibodies.</p>
