        <title>Human MIEF1 recruits Drp1 to mitochondrial outer membranes and promotes mitochondrial fusion rather than fission</title>
        <p>Mitochondrial morphology depends on the balance between fission and fusion events. This study identifies a receptor for the fission factor Drp1 within the mitochondrial outer membrane, which inhibits Drp1-mediated fission and activates fusion.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Mitochondrial morphology is controlled by two opposing processes: fusion and fission. Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) and hFis1 are two key players of mitochondrial fission, but how Drp1 is recruited to mitochondria and how Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission is regulated in mammals is poorly understood. Here, we identify the vertebrate-specific protein MIEF1 (mitochondrial elongation factor 1; independently identified as MiD51), which is anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Elevated MIEF1 levels induce extensive mitochondrial fusion, whereas depletion of MIEF1 causes mitochondrial fragmentation. MIEF1 interacts with and recruits Drp1 to mitochondria in a manner independent of hFis1, Mff (mitochondrial fission factor) and Mfn2 (mitofusin 2), but inhibits Drp1 activity, thus executing a negative effect on mitochondrial fission. MIEF1 also interacts with hFis1 and elevated hFis1 levels partially reverse the MIEF1-induced fusion phenotype. In addition to inhibiting Drp1, MIEF1 also actively promotes fusion, but in a manner distinct from mitofusins. In conclusion, our findings uncover a novel mechanism which controls the mitochondrial fusionâfission machinery in vertebrates. As MIEF1 is vertebrate-specific, these data also reveal important differences between yeast and vertebrates in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitochondria have critical roles in many cellular processes, including energy metabolism, intracellular calcium homeostasis and apoptosis. Mitochondrial morphology is dynamic and controlled by a balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Okamoto and Shaw, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Chan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kiefel et al, 2006</xref>). When mitochondrial fusion is reduced, mitochondria become fragmented due to ongoing fission. Conversely, when the balance shifts towards fusion, mitochondria elongate resulting in a tubular interconnected network. Mitochondrial dynamics controls not only the morphology but also the function of mitochondria, thereby impacting on a wide range of cellular processes. Dysfunction of mitochondrial dynamics has been implicated in ageing and a variety of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liesa et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Schafer and Reichert, 2009</xref>) including neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Knott et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mattson et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Reddy et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Wang et al, 2009</xref>), diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Zorzano et al, 2009</xref>), cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hom and Sheu, 2009</xref>) and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Modica-Napolitano and Singh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Grandemange et al, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The molecular mechanisms controlling mitochondrial fusion and fission are beginning to be unravelled, and genes important for these processes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Okamoto and Shaw, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hoppins et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Merz et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Berman et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liesa et al, 2009</xref>). The dynamin-like GTPases, mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), have a critical role in the fusion process. Mfn1 and Mfn2 are localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and are believed to interact <italic>in trans</italic> to promote mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Koshiba et al, 2004</xref>). OPA1 (optic atrophy 1), another dynamin-like GTPase, is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and mediates the fusion of the inner membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Delettre et al, 2000</xref>). On the fission side, Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) has a central role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lackner and Nunnari, 2010</xref>), and mice lacking Drp1 die at an early embryonic stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Ishihara et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Wakabayashi et al, 2009</xref>). Drp1 is also a dynamin-like GTPase and is primarily distributed in the cytoplasm, but shuttles between the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Smirnova et al, 2001</xref>). At the mitochondrial surface, Drp1 is assembled into a higher-order complex, and is thought to wrap around the mitochondria to induce fission via its GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liesa et al, 2009</xref>). hFis1 is a fission-promoting integral mitochondrial outer membrane protein and believed to serve as a receptor for recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">James et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Yoon et al, 2003</xref>). In yeast, Fis1p (the hFis1 orthologue) interacts with Dnm1p (the Drp1 orthologue) and recruits Dnm1p to the mitochondrial surface through one of the two adaptor proteins, Mdv1p or Caf4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Mozdy et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Tieu and Nunnari, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Tieu et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Griffin et al, 2005</xref>). However, orthologues of Mdv1p and Caf4p have not been identified in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Westermann, 2010a</xref>). Moreover, increased or reduced levels of hFis1 do not affect the amount of mitochondrial-associated Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Suzuki et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lee et al, 2004</xref>), suggesting that additional factors potentially contribute to the recruitment of Drp1 to the mitochondrial surface. One Drp1-recruiting factor, mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), has recently been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Otera et al, 2010</xref>), but the process of how Drp1 becomes recruited to mitochondria and regulates mitochondrial fission is likely to be more complex and warrants further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hoppins et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Santel and Frank, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liesa et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lackner and Nunnari, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this report, we have characterized a novel vertebrate-specific integral mitochondrial outer membrane protein, designated MIEF1 (mitochondrial elongation factor 1). Ectopic expression of the protein results in extensive mitochondrial elongation and perinuclear clustering, whereas depletion of the protein induces mitochondrial fragmentation. MIEF1 interacts with Drp1 and triggers translocation of cytoplasmic Drp1 to mitochondria, but despite this fact, MIEF1 acts as a suppressor to sequester Drp1 and impedes Drp1-mediated fission, leading to a mitochondrial fusion phenotype. MIEF1 also interacts with hFis1, separate from its interaction with Drp1, and elevated hFis1 levels reverse the MIEF1-induced fusion phenotype. Our data provide novel insights into how cytoplasmic Drp1 is recruited to mitochondria and how Drp1-mediated fission is regulated in vertebrates. In addition to inhibiting Drp1, MIEF1 also actively promotes fusion, in a manner distinct from mitofusins. Our finding that the vertebrate-specific protein MIEF1 interacts with Drp1 and hFis1, which are highly conserved in yeast and vertebrates, also reveals important differences between yeast and vertebrates with regard to the underpinning mechanisms for regulation of mitochondrial morphology.</p>

        <title>MIEF1âa novel integral mitochondrial outer membrane protein</title>
        <p>To identify proteins with potential roles in controlling mitochondrial morphology, we searched an intracellular protein localization database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lifedb.de/lifedb/">http://www.lifedb.de/lifedb/</ext-link>) that contains information about the intracellular localization of a large number of GFP-tagged fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Simpson et al, 2000</xref>). We identified a mitochondrial protein, which we designated MIEF1, as ectopic expression of the protein triggered extensive mitochondrial elongation (see below). MIEF1 is encoded by the SMCR7L gene and contains 463 amino-acid residues with an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). MIEF1 is highly conserved in all vertebrate species analysed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), but was not found in yeast, invertebrates and plants.</p>
        <p>Western blotting showed that endogenous MIEF1 with a molecular mass of â¼52 kDa was expressed at various levels in a number of human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of MIEF1 mRNA was relatively high in adult human heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Endogenous MIEF1, as well as a C-terminally V5-tagged MIEF1 (MIEF1-V5), was localized to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). In agreement with this, MIEF1-V5, together with the two mitochondrial membrane proteins Tom20 and Tim23, was predominantly confined to the mitochondrial fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>). Mitochondrial fractions isolated from cells expressing MIEF1-V5 were incubated under conditions that resulted in release of soluble and peripheral membrane-associated proteins from the outer and inner membranes. MIEF1-V5, like Tom20 and Tim23, was predominantly retained in the mitochondrial membrane pellet, whereas the intermembrane space protein AIF was found in the supernatant fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1G</xref>). This suggests that MIEF1 is an integral mitochondrial membrane protein. To determine the membrane topology of MIEF1, proteinase K (PK) treatment resulted in the disappearance of MIEF1-V5 and the outer membrane protein Tom20 from mitochondrial fractions, whereas the inner membrane protein Tim23 was protected, unless Triton X-100 was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1H</xref>). Taken together, the data indicate that MIEF1 is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane with its C-terminal region facing the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>MIEF1 promotes mitochondrial elongation and fusion</title>
        <p>The basic mitochondrial morphology in non-transfected or empty vector transfected 293T cells was a mixed reticulum with tubular and round forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1I</xref>), with only a few cells displaying a tubular network of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1J</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1M</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of MIEF1 induced extensive mitochondrial elongation in most (â¼90%) of the cells, with frequent mitochondrial tubular clusters with long tubules emanating from the perinuclear clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1K</xref>) or with a more compact cluster of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1L</xref>). The compact cluster phenotype over time became more dominant, at the expense of the tubular cluster phenotype, which initially after transfection was more prevalent (quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1M</xref>).</p>
        <p>At the electron microscopy (EM) level, mitochondria in non-transfected cells appeared as multiple short tubules, and were distributed throughout the entire cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2AâC</xref>). In contrast, in cells overexpressing MIEF1, both elongated tubular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D and E</xref>) and compact cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2FâH</xref>) morphologies were observed, corresponding to the phenotypes observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1K and L</xref>, respectively. Reconstruction of serial ultrathin sections revealed one single extremely long mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>), which was never observed in non-transfected cells. In areas of compact clusters of mitochondria, the two outer membranes between tethered mitochondria often became obscured due to accumulation of electron-dense material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G, H and I</xref>), but were also found in the process of fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G and J</xref>, arrows) or completely fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G, H and K</xref>, arrows).</p>
        <p>To further assess the role of MIEF1 in mitochondrial fusion, we used an <italic>in vivo</italic> cell fusion assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Liesa et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kamp et al, 2010</xref>). Two sets of 293T cells transiently transfected with mito-GFP or mito-DsRed, respectively, were cocultured and transfected with either MIEF1-V5 or empty vector, and cell fusion was induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG). After subsequent culturing in the presence of cycloheximide, mitochondrial fusion was analysed by measuring the extent of mito-GFP and mito-DsRed colocalization. Polykaryons expressing MIEF1-V5 showed significantly higher incidence of mitochondrial fusion as compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2L and M</xref>), suggesting that MIEF1 promotes mitochondrial fusion.</p>
        <p>In keeping with its role in regulating mitochondrial fusion, MIEF1 distribution was punctate on the mitochondrial surface, at the connection sites between two adjacent mitochondrial units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2N</xref>, arrows) and at the tips of mitochondrial tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2N</xref>, arrowheads) in cells expressing lower amounts of MIEF1-V5. In mitochondria that underwent MIEF1-V5-induced elongation, MIEF1 coated the outer mitochondrial membrane more evenly with fewer distinct foci of MIEF1 observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2O</xref>, arrows).</p>
        <p>The mitochondrial phenotype caused by MIEF1 overexpression was distinct from that caused by Mfn2 overexpression. Elevated Mfn2 expression induced perinuclear aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2P</xref>), in keeping with an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Huang et al, 2007</xref>), but the aggregation consisted of individual small mitochondria in a tightly apposed grape-like structure rather than an aggregation of tubular elements observed in clusters following MIEF1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2Q</xref>). This indicates that MIEF1 induces mitochondrial fusion in a manner distinct from Mfn2. To further corroborate this notion, we examined the effect of MIEF1-V5 expression on mitochondrial morphology in cells depleted of <italic>Mfn2</italic> by RNA interference (RNAi). Knockdown of <italic>Mfn2</italic> resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Eura et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Chen et al, 2005</xref>). Expression of MIEF1-V5 reversed the <italic>Mfn2</italic> RNAi-induced fission phenotype and resulted in mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), suggesting that Mfn2 is not essential for MIEF1-induced mitochondrial fusion.</p>

        <title>Depletion of endogenous MIEF1 leads to mitochondrial fragmentation</title>
        <p>To further elucidate the role of MIEF1, knockdown of endogenous MIEF1 was performed by RNAi. Reduction of endogenous MIEF1 levels by two different siRNAs, which reduced MIEF1 protein levels by &gt;80 and 90%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>), led to a significant increase in the proportion of cells with partially fragmented mitochondria (76.1Â±6.8% and 80.1Â±5.4%, respectively, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001), compared with control cells (4.2Â±2.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).

        <title>MIEF1 undergoes oligomerization</title>
        <p>Next, we asked whether MIEF1 oligomerizes. Under reducing conditions, the V5-tagged MIEF1 appeared as a monomer with a molecular mass of â¼56 kDa, whereas under non-reducing conditions, it appeared as two bands, with a molecular mass of â¼110 and â¼56 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G</xref>). When cells expressing MIEF1 were chemically crosslinked, several high molecular weight bands were detected, while under non-crosslinking conditions only a single band was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3H</xref>). Furthermore, two differently tagged MIEF1 proteins could be coimmunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3I</xref>).</p>

An N-terminal deletion mutant lacking the first 48 amino-acid residues (MIEF1<sup>Î1â48</sup>) retained the capacity to dimerize, whereas a mutant lacking the first 195 residues (MIEF1<sup>Î1â195</sup>) could not dimerize. In sum, these data show that MIEF1 can oligomerize and that residues 49 to 195 are required for MIEF1 dimerization.</p>

        <title>MIEF1 interacts with Drp1 and recruits cytoplasmic Drp1 to mitochondria</title>
        <p>We observed that MIEF1 was colocalized with both exogenous HA-Drp1 and endogenous Drp1 on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4AâC</xref>). We next tested whether MIEF1 interacts with Drp1, and endogenous Drp1 was indeed coimmunoprecipitated with MIEF1-V5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>). A functional interaction between MIEF1 and Drp1 was further supported by the fact that the MIEF1<sup>Î1â48</sup> mutant, which was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm because of the deletion of the TM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>), still induced an extensive tubular cluster phenotype of mitochondria. This was reminiscent of the mitochondrial phenotype caused by inhibition of Drp1 activity with a dominant negative mutant Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> lacking the GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Yoon et al, 2001</xref>). The mitochondrial tubular cluster phenotype induced by wild-type MIEF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1K</xref>) or by MIEF1<sup>Î1â48</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>) was similar to that induced by Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4F</xref>), or by depletion of <italic>Drp1</italic> or <italic>Mff</italic> by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Drp1</italic> silencing did not affect the mitochondrial phenotype induced by MIEF1 and MIEF1<sup>Î1â48</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4H</xref>, arrows; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4I</xref> for a summary of the mitochondrial phenotypes). Taken together, these data suggest that MIEF1 interacts with Drp1 and inhibits Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission.</p>
        <p>How Drp1 becomes localized to mitochondria has remained enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Okamoto and Shaw, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liesa et al, 2009</xref>), and the interaction between MIEF1 and Drp1 led us to further address whether MIEF1 was able to recruit Drp1 to mitochondria. In non-transfected 293T cells, Drp1 was both diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and associated with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>), in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Smirnova et al, 2001</xref>). In contrast, in cells expressing MIEF1-V5, the majority of endogenous Drp1 was recruited from the cytoplasm to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>), where it colocalized with MIEF1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). In keeping with this, a significant increase of Drp1 levels in the mitochondrial fraction and a corresponding decrease in the cytosolic fraction in cells expressing MIEF1-V5 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, MIEF1-mediated mitochondrial recruitment of Drp1 was more pronounced for the Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> mutant, which showed extensive cytoplasmic localization in cells expressing Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>) but showed a distinct mitochondrial localization following cotransfection with MIEF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>). Drp1<sup>K38A</sup>, like wild-type Drp1, was readily coimmunoprecipitated with MIEF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5F</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that MIEF1 recruits cytoplasmic Drp1 to mitochondria in a manner that does not require the GTPase activity of Drp1.</p>
        <p>Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) with a set of MIEF1 deletion mutants identified two regions in MIEF1 important for its interaction with Drp1 (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Removal of the C-terminal domain (MIEF1<sup>Î431â463</sup>) reduced but did not abolish binding to Drp1, whereas removal of amino-acid residues 160 to 169 (MIEF1<sup>Î160â169</sup>) led to a complete loss of binding ability to Drp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). In keeping with the reduced and abolished Drp1-binding ability, most cells expressing MIEF1<sup>Î431â463</sup> or MIEF1<sup>Î160â169</sup> exhibited relatively normal mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), whereas the MIEF1<sup>Î66â79</sup>, MIEF1<sup>Î92â103</sup>, MIEF1<sup>Î130â139</sup> and MIEF1<sup>Î1â48</sup> mutants, which retained the ability to bind to Drp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>), produced fusion phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). In addition, elevated levels of MIEF1 did not affect levels of Drp1, hFis1, Mff, Mfn2 and Tim23 in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). In line with this, MIEF1<sup>Î1â48</sup>, which lacks the TM domain but retains the ability to bind to Drp1 and to induce mitochondrial elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E and I</xref>), sequestered Drp1 in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>). This suggests that MIEF1âDrp1 interaction, rather than MIEF1's mitochondrial localization, is crucial for the MIEF1-induced fusion phenotype, and in keeping with this, the mitochondrial phenotype induced by the cytoplasmic MIEF1<sup>Î1â48</sup> mutant was more similar to the phenotypes induced by the Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> mutant, or by RNAi-mediated silencing of the fission components Drp1 or Mff, as compared with the wild-type MIEF1 phenotype. However, mitochondrial localization of MIEF1 was required for further inducing a compact cluster of mitochondria (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4EâH</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6B</xref>).</p>

        <p>The potential effect of MIEF1 on Drp1's GTP-binding ability, oligomerization and phosphorlyation was assessed. The GTP binding of both endogenous Drp1 and exogenously expressed HA-Drp1 was reduced by MIEF1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, the extent of oligomerization of endogenous Drp1 was not affected by expression of MIEF1-V5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7E</xref>). Using a phosphorylation-specific (Ser637) Drp1 polyclonal antibody, we showed that the low basal level of Drp1-Ser637 phosphorylation, which was, in keeping with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chang and Blackstone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cribbs and Strack, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Han et al, 2008</xref>), augmented by the protein kinase A activator forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7F</xref>), was not affected by MIEF1 overexpression, neither in the presence nor in the absence of forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test whether the MIEF1-induced relocalization of Drp1 to mitochondria depends on the phosphorylation status of Drp1, we expressed wild-type Myc-Drp1, the phosphorylation-deficient Myc-Drp1<sup>S637A</sup> mutant or the phosphomimetic Myc-Drp1<sup>S637D</sup> mutant in the presence or absence of MIEF1-V5. Expression of wild-type Drp1, Myc-Drp1<sup>S637A</sup> or Myc-Drp1<sup>S637D</sup> revealed a predominantly cytoplasmic distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>), whereas coexpression with MIEF1-V5 led to recruitment of wild-type Drp1, Myc-Drp1<sup>S637A</sup> and Myc-Drp1<sup>S637D</sup> to mitochondria, where they colocalized with MIEF1-V5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>).

In sum, these data show that MIEF1 reduces Drp1's GTP-binding activity, but does not affect oligomerization or phosphorylation of Drp1, and conversely, the phosphorylation status of Drp1-Ser637 is not critical for its interaction with MIEF1.</p>

        <p>hFis1 serves as a potential mitochondrial receptor for Drp1 and is important for promoting fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Yoon et al, 2003</xref>). We therefore examined whether MIEF1 interacts with hFis1. Co-IP revealed that hFis1 was co-immunoprecipitated both with wild-type MIEF1 and with the mutants MIEF1<sup>Î431â463</sup> and MIEF1<sup>Î160â169</sup>, which only weakly or not at all bind Drp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8A and B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this report, we characterize a novel vertebrate-specific mitochondrial outer membrane protein MIEF1, which regulates mitochondrial morphology. Overexpression of MIEF1 shifts the balance towards a fusion phenotype, characterized by extensively elongated mitochondrial tubules and perinuclear tubular clusters, whereas knockdown of MIEF1 leads to mitochondrial fragmentation. MIEF1 binds to and recruits Drp1 to the mitochondrial surface. Despite the fact that MIEF1 recruits Drp1 to mitochondria, it negatively affects the fission-promoting capacity of Drp1 by sequestering and inhibiting Drp1 activity, resulting in the mitochondrial fusion phenotype. To our knowledge, MIEF1 is the first Drp1 suppressor protein identified in vertebrates that efficiently impedes Drp1-mediated fission. Multiple lines of evidence support that MIEF1 has a key role in inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission. Firstly, MIEF1âDrp1 binding and the MIEF1-mediated recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria do not require hFis1, Mff and Mfn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>), as well as are independent of Drp1 GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>) or phosphorylation status. MIEF1 can efficiently bind to wild-type Drp1 as well as the Drp1<sup>S637A</sup> and Drp1<sup>S637D</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Moreover, MIEF1 overexpression does not affect the phosphorylation level of Drp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). Secondly, MIEF1 overexpression reduces the GTP-binding levels of both endogenous Drp1 and exogenous HA-Drp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that MIEF1 may affect the GTPase activity of Drp1 via a reduction of its GTP-binding ability. Thirdly, the MIEF1 mutant MIEF1<sup>Î1â48</sup>, which is cytoplasmically localized but retains Drp1-binding ability and sequesters Drp1 in the cytoplasm, causes a mitochondrial fusion phenotype similar to that induced by Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> or by knockdown of <italic>Drp1</italic> or <italic>Mff</italic> mRNA by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref>). Conversely, the MIEF1 mutant MIEF1<sup>Î160â169</sup>, which is membrane tethered but does not bind to Drp1, does not cause the mitochondrial fusion phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Collectively, the findings presented in this work shed light on the longstanding question of how Drp1 translocates from the cytoplasm to mitochondria and how Drp1-mediated fission is regulated in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hoppins et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Santel and Frank, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liesa et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Westermann, 2010b</xref>). Consistent with our findings, another group characterized the same cDNA of MIEF1(MiD51) and published their findings during the editorial processing of this work. They showed that MIEF1/MiD51 recruits Drp1 to mitochondria and that overexpression of MIEF1/MiD51 induces mitochondrial fusion, confirming a role for MIEF1 in inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Palmer et al, 2011</xref>). The function of MIEF1 is distinct from the recently characterized vertebrate-specific Mff protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Otera et al, 2010</xref>). While Mff, like MIEF1, recruits Drp1 to mitochondria, overexpression of Mff leads to a fission phenotype, whereas Mff knockdown promotes fusion. We therefore suggest that MIEF1 and Mff have opposite effects on mitochondrial fission. MIEF1 has a key role in inhibiting Drp1-induced mitochondrial fission, while Mff has a role in promoting Drp1-induced mitochondrial fission. Therefore, Mff and MIEF1 positively and negatively regulate Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in vertebrates, respectively.</p>
      <p>Mitochondrial fusion is thought to be initiated by Mfn-mediated mitochondrial tethering. Tethering of adjacent mitochondria is required for bringing membranes into close apposition for consequent membrane fusion events, where the GTPase activity of Mfn may function downstream of mitochondrial tethering to mediate full fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Koshiba et al, 2004</xref>). However, it seems plausible that MIEF1, in addition to blocking Drp1 fission activity, also actively promotes fusion. Notably, overexpression of MIEF1 can induce a high proportion of cells to exhibit a compact cluster of mitochondria, while inhibition of mitochondrial fission via MIEF1<sup>Î1â48</sup> or Drp1<sup>K38A</sup>, or via depletion of either Drp1 or Mff does not induce a highly compact cluster phenotype (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that MIEF1 has the capacity to bring the mitochondrial membranes into close apposition and ultimately facilitates the process of membrane fusion as revealed by EM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>. Moreover, the data from an <italic>in vivo</italic> cell fusion assay reveal that MIEF1 overexpression promotes mitochondrial fusion. Conversely, depletion of endogenous MIEF1 results in partially fragmented mitochondria. Two lines of evidence indicate that MIEF1 promotes fusion in a manner independent of the fusion-promoting GTPase Mfn2. Firstly, the mitochondrial fusion phenotypes caused by overexpression of MIEF1 and Mfn2 are not identical, and secondly, MIEF1 is capable of inducing mitochondrial fusion also under conditions when Mfn2 expression is knocked down by RNAi. The accumulation of MIEF1 into discrete puncta at the connection sites of adjacent mitochondrial units, along with the observation that MIEF1 undergoes oligomerization by self-association, indicates that interactions between MIEF1 proteins on opposing mitochondrial membranes may contribute to the fusion process.</p>

The fact that elevated expression of hFis1, in contrast to MIEF1, does not relocalize Drp1 to mitochondria argues against a direct role for hFis1 in the recruitment process in vertebrates. Furthermore, hFis1 localizes evenly throughout the mitochondrial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Suzuki et al, 2003</xref>), whereas MIEF1 and Drp1 colocalize as discrete puncta extensively. MIEF1 shows a robust interaction with hFis1, in contrast to a much weaker interaction observed between hFis1 and Drp1. The MIEF1âhFis1 interaction is likely to be of functional significance, as elevated hFis1 partially reverts the MIEF1-induced fusion phenotype. While it may be tempting to speculate that MIEF1, because it can interact with Drp1 and hFis1 through non-overlapping domains, would serve as a bridging protein between Drp1 and hFis1, our data indicate that the MIEF1âDrp1 and MIEF1âhFis1 interactions are independent. Firstly, the binding between hFis1 and Drp1 is not affected by elevated levels of MIEF1 or MIEF1 mutants. Secondly, depletion of hFis1 or Drp1 by RNAi does not affect MIEF1 interaction with Drp1 and hFis1, respectively. Thirdly, the native gel electrophoresis (NGE) shows that the complexes containing MIEF1 and Drp1 differ in size from those containing MIEF1 and hFis1. Assuming that MIEF1 independently interacts with hFis1 and Drp1, it may be argued that the relative levels of hFis1 and MIEF1 regulate Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission, such that high levels of MIEF1 promote a MIEF1âDrp1 interaction, which inhibits Drp1-mediated fission, leading to mitochondrial fusion, whereas high levels of hFis1 reverse the MIEF1-induced fusion phenotype, thus leading to mitochondrial fission.</p>
      <p>The characterization of MIEF1 also highlights that mitochondrial morphology is differently regulated in vertebrates and yeast. We suggest that the molecular machinery controlling mitochondrial dynamics has evolved such that two of the central components, the Dmn1p/Drp1 and Fis1p/hFis1 proteins, are highly conserved in both yeast and vertebrates, while the interacting proteins, that is MIEF1 and Mff versus Mdv1p and Caf4p, are quite evolutionarily and functionally diverged.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the characterization of MIEF1 sheds new light on how the molecular machinery controlling mitochondrial morphology in mammals is organized and also highlights important differences between yeast and mammals in the composition of this machinery. Given the importance of mitochondrial dynamics for many cellular processes, the discovery of a novel key regulator protein in the process may provide further options to experimentally steer the process, which may be of importance in understanding the role of mitochondrial dynamics in cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
