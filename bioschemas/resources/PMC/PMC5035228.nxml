          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a debilitating disease that involves impaired blood supply to the femoral head and leads to femoral head collapse.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We use whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing to analyse a family with inherited osteonecrosis of the femoral head and fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to functionally characterise the variant protein.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We report a family with four siblings affected with inherited osteonecrosis of the femoral head and the identification of a c.2480_2483delCCCG frameshift deletion followed by a c.2486T&gt;A substitution in one allele of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) gene. <italic>TRPV4</italic> encodes a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable cation channel known to play a role in vasoregulation and osteoclast differentiation. While pathogenic <italic>TRPV4</italic> mutations affect the skeletal or nervous systems, association with osteonecrosis of the femoral head is novel. Functional measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through mutant TRPV4 channels in HEK293 cells and patient-derived dermal fibroblasts identified a TRPV4 gain of function. Analysis of channel open times, determined indirectly from measurement of TRPV4 activity within a cluster of TRPV4 channels, revealed that the TRPV4 gain of function was caused by longer channel openings.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>These findings identify a novel <italic>TRPV4</italic> mutation implicating TRPV4 and altered calcium homeostasis in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis while reinforcing the importance of TRPV4 in bone diseases and vascular endothelium.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is characterised by compromised blood flow to the femoral head leading to bone cell apoptosis and its eventual collapse. The aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are not fully elucidated, with treatment at advanced stages involving total hip arthroplasty. However, microvascular thrombosis is a common finding in non-traumatic osteonecrosis, indicating a vascular role in disease pathogenesis.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A major risk factor for non-traumatic osteonecrosis includes high-dose glucocorticoid treatment for inflammatory disorders and haematological malignancies, a complication of glucocorticoid treatment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Inherited osteonecrosis and osteonecrosis in the absence of risk factors are rare, with the only previously identified genetic cause of inherited osteonecrosis of the femoral head consisting of three mutations in <italic>COL2A1</italic>, which expresses type II collagen and is essential to cartilage.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
      <p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) forms a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable cation channel that is stimulated by heat, cell swelling, mechanical stress, and endogenous and synthetic ligands.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In the small arteries that regulate systemic resistance, endothelial TRPV4 channels regulate blood flow by controlling endothelium-dependent vasodilation in response to physiological agonists.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> At the bone level, TRPV4 promotes terminal differentiation and inhibits apoptosis of bone-absorbing osteoclasts.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Mutations in <italic>TRPV4</italic> are pleiotropic with over 50 mutations pathogenic for six skeletal dysplasias (brachyolmia type 3, spondylo-epimetaphyseal dysplasia Maroteaux pseudo-Morquio type 2, spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type, parastremmatic dysplasia, metatropic dysplasia, familial digital arthropathy brachydactyly) and three motor and sensory neuropathies (congenital distal spinal muscle atrophy, CharcotâMarieâTooth disease type 2C and scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The proband was diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the femoral head at age 21 and in the same year had bilateral hip core decompressions and bone grafting. There was a positive family history with four of six siblings identified with advanced bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103829F1">figure 1</xref>A), all harbouring a heterozygous mutation in <italic>TRPV4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103829F1">figure 1</xref>B) and absence of risk factors. Diagnosis was made by several bone radiologists and orthopaedic surgeons using modalities including radiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103829F1">figure 1</xref>C) and MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103829F1">figure 1</xref>D), the gold standard for diagnosis. The extent of hip involvement or staging was evaluated according to the Steinberg classification.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Osteonecrosis was ruled out in one unaffected sibling by radiography (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S1) and the other unaffected sibling did not participate in the study. Parents and grandparents are deceased; family members recall symptoms of joint pain in their father that were never evaluated. <italic>TRPV4-</italic>associated skeletal dysplasias were ruled out by a complete physical examination performed by a medical geneticist and total body skeletal surveys. Characteristics of these skeletal dysplasias including short stature, platyspondyly, abnormal vertebral hooking or beaking or osteoarthropathy of the fingers and toes were absent (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary note</xref> for clinical details). Classical osteoporosis was also absent. <italic>TRPV4</italic>-related polyneuropathies were ruled out by neurological examination and motor and sensory nerve conduction studies performed by a neuromuscular neurologist. Thrombophilia markers, implicated as causative factors in osteonecrosis, were negative in affected family members (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table</xref> S1).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> When the clinical profiles of the affected family members were compared with a cohort comprising 49 patients with sporadic osteonecrosis of the femoral head described previously (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table</xref> S2), wild type for the <italic>TRPV4</italic> mutation (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S2) and absent for thrombophilia markers, all affected family members had bilateral hip involvement, whereas only two-thirds of the sporadic patients had bilateral disease.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Also, approximately 90% of these patients had one or more risk factors.</p>

          <p>Clinical and genetic findings in a family with inherited osteonecrosis of the femoral head. (A) Family pedigree. Siblings affected with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (black symbols) all harbour a heterozygous frameshift deletion in transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (<italic>TRPV4</italic>) (TRPV4<sup>+/â</sup>). In unaffected siblings (white symbols) <italic>TRPV4</italic> was wild type in one unaffected sibling (TRPV4<sup>+/+</sup>) and the other unaffected sibling did not participate in the study. One affected sibling has an unaffected 5âyear old daughter. Parents and grandparents are deceased. (B) Sequencing shows the heterozygous <italic>TRPV4</italic> mutation in proband (III-6) gDNA, wild type in unaffected sibling III-4. (C) Radiographs of the pelvis of two affected siblings showing femoral head changes (black arrows). Using the Steinberg classification, sibling III-5, <italic>left</italic>, has Stage V disease of left hip and Stage IV disease of right hip. The proband (III-6), <italic>right</italic>, has Stage IV disease of left hip and Stage III of right hip. (D) MRI images of the pelvis corresponding to radiographs showing femoral head changes (red arrows). Sibling III-5, <italic>left</italic>, has Stage V disease of the left hip and Stage IV disease of right hip. The proband (III-6, <italic>right</italic>) has Stage IV disease of both hips. (E) Sequence conservation of TRPV4 C-terminal amino acid residues. The altered residues (red) and stop codon (*) are indicated in family members affected with osteonecrosis (ON). Altered residues reside within a calmodulin-binding domain.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>

      <p>Genetic analysis involved first excluding the common <italic>COL2A1</italic> mutation in the proband followed by exome sequencing of proband genomic DNA (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S3). No mutations in <italic>COL2A1</italic> were present. Variant filtering focused on mutations in collagen genes and potentially damaging mutations (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S4). Three candidate genes were identified: two mutations in collagen genes (<italic>COL12A1</italic>:c.G3532A and <italic>COL5A1</italic>:c.C260A) and a novel c.2480_2483delCCCG frameshift deletion followed by a c.2486T&gt;A substitution in one allele of <italic>TRPV4</italic> (NM_021625.4), included due to its bone-related phenotypes and the damaging nature of the mutation (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table</xref> S3). Segregation analysis of the candidate genes confirmed the <italic>TRPV4</italic> mutation in all affected siblings, wild type in the unaffected sibling (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table</xref> S4 for primer sequences). The affected siblings did not carry the two collagen gene variants identified from exome sequencing and they were therefore eliminated as candidate genes. The <italic>TRPV4</italic> mutation is located in the last exon and was confirmed in proband cDNA (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S5). It truncates the 871 amino acid protein (V829WfsX3), eliminating a highly conserved region including residues within a calmodulin-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103829F1">figure 1</xref>E).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> While all previously identified pathogenic <italic>TRPV4</italic> mutations are autosomal dominant, only two other mutations are truncating and no other mutations are located beyond residue 799 (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S6).</p>
      <p>To measure the activity of wild-type and mutant TRPV4, HEK293 cells were transduced to stably overexpress wild-type or mutant TRPV4 (TRPV4-WT and TRPV4-V829WfsX3, respectively) with a C-terminal FLAG tag. Human-derived dermal fibroblasts obtained from the proband and a healthy control were also measured. It was not possible to obtain tissue from the disease site in affected family members. <italic>TRPV4</italic> mRNA expression was confirmed in fibroblasts and transduced cells by qPCR (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref>s S7A and S7B). Anti-FLAG western blot confirmed wild-type and mutant TRPV4 expression in TRPV4-WT and TRPV4-V829WfsX3 cells, respectively (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S8A), with twofold greater expression in TRPV4-WT cells (n=4, online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S8B). Upper bands were confirmed as glycosylated TRPV4 by PNGase F deglycosylation (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S9).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Anti-TRPV4 antibodies could not detect TRPV4 in fibroblasts, likely due to low <italic>TRPV4</italic> expression relative to TRPV4-WT and TRPV4-V829WfsX3 cells determined by qPCR (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S10).</p>
      <p>We recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV4 channels within a cluster in the form of TRPV4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets with image analysis providing indirect measurement of single channels.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The opening of TRPV4 channels at each sparklet site causes a local increase in fluorescence that is step-like or quantal, representing the opening of one channel from the cluster. In the fibroblasts, baseline TRPV4 sparklet activity per site, calculated as NP<sub>O</sub> (where N is the number of channels per site and P<sub>O</sub> is the probability of finding the channel being open),<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> was low, but significantly higher in proband versus control fibroblasts (n=5, p=0.0264; data not shown). An all-points histogram of fractional fluorescence (F/F<sub>0</sub>) traces revealed a quantal (single channel) level of 0.28 ÎF/F<sub>0</sub> (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S11), similar to previous measurements in native endothelial cells.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> We stimulated channel activity with TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A (GSK101 hereafter, 3ânM) and found that sparklet activity per site was 3.3-fold higher in proband fibroblasts versus control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103829F2">figure 2</xref>A). However, the observed maximum number (N) of channels per site, determined by dividing the maximum fluorescence signal by the quantal level (0.28 ÎF/F<sub>0</sub>), was four for both control and proband fibroblasts, suggesting that higher sparklet activity (NP<sub>O</sub>) was not due to more channels. Measurement of sparklet activity in native HEK293 cells identified no discernible sparklet activity in the absence or presence of GSK101 (1â100ânM). In the TRPV4-WT and TRPV4-V829WfsX3 cells, baseline activity was high, with 1ânM GSK101 causing Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and cell death. However, addition of selective TRPV4 inhibitor GSK2193874 (GSK219; 100ânM) almost completely inhibited (93%) sparklet activity (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S12). The baseline TRPV4 sparklet activity per site was 2.5-fold higher in TRPV4-V829WfsX3 vs TRPV4-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103829F2">figure 2</xref>B) despite a maximum of four channels per site, as seen in fibroblasts, and lower relative TRPV4 expression in TRPV4-V829WfsX3 cells, as determined by western blot. These functional TRPV4 measurements in fibroblasts and transduced HEK293 cells identify a novel <italic>TRPV4</italic> gain-of-function mutation.</p>

      <p>We postulated that this novel gain-of-function mutation increases sparklet activity in proband fibroblasts and TRPV4-V829WfsX3 cells due to longer channel openings rather than an increase in channel number per site. In the measurement of TRPV4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets, the majority of the TRPV4 sparklets lasted more than 1âs, indicating that each sparklet event may represent a burst of channel openings, as Loukin <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> found single TRPV4 channel openings to last only a few milliseconds. To compare TRPV4 channel open times, fractional fluorescence (F/F<sub>0</sub>) traces were analysed to determine the mean burst open times at each quantal level, finding twofold longer mean burst open times for each quantal level in proband fibroblasts compared with control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103829F2">figure 2</xref>C). Similarly, the mean burst open times were longer for all quantal levels in TRPV4-V829WfsX3 cells compared with TRPV4-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016103829F2">figure 2</xref>C). Thus, this mutation leads to a gain of function of TRPV4 channels by impeding channel closure.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study identifies a novel mutation in <italic>TRPV4</italic> in a family affected with inherited osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The genetic finding is supported by identification of a TRPV4 gain of function in cultured cells. Strengths of the study include the genetic support provided by segregation of the mutation within the family and functional measurements performed on proband-derived fibroblasts and transduced HEK293 cells. Limitations of the study include the availability of a single family, which adds difficulty to eliminating all variant candidates in an autosomal-dominant model of inheritance and a lack of available phenotype-relevant cell types for functional measurements or an animal model to provide additional evidence of causation.</p>
      <p>Previous studies investigating TRPV4 C-terminal truncations found loss of TRPV4 activity, contrary to a gain of function.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> As the frameshift deletion alters residues within a calmodulin-binding domain, altered TRPV4 channel regulation by calmodulin could be the molecular basis for the TRPV4 gain of function and will be investigated in addition to other TRPV4 regulatory factors and binding partners. Furthermore, SNPs in three glutamate receptor genes were recently identified as risk factors of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis in a genome-wide association study.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> As Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is known to modulate release of chemical transmitters including glutamate in the brain, this finding could implicate TRPV4 in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
      <p>The pathogenesis of non-traumatic osteonecrosis is complex, involving compromised vasculature in the development of bone loss that is joint-specific. Interestingly, TRPV4 is known to regulate vascular tone as well as osteoclastic differentiation while also exhibiting mechanosensitive properties, proposed to play a role in the sensing of weight loading essential to bone development.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18â20</xref> The femoral head lacks collateral blood vessels, increasing risk for subchondral fracture and collapse. It is also a weight-bearing joint undergoing constant mechanical stress, which could promote localised TRPV4 activation in addition to systemic activation by the <italic>TRPV4</italic> gain-of-function mutation. Together, this could cause Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, leading to endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction, resulting in bone loss at the hip. TRPV4-mediated vasoconstriction was recently demonstrated in the vascular endothelium by G protein-coupled receptor potentiation of TRPV4 through COX-dependent prostanoid production and thromboxane receptor activation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> While TRPV4 is expressed in endothelium,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> measurements of TRPV4 function in human platelets have not been well described. However, in a washed human platelet aggregation assay, no response to GSK101 was found (R. Ramachandran, personal communication, 2015), suggesting that TRPV4 activation in endothelial cells is the most plausible origin of the microthrombotic process underlying osteonecrosis, possibly via a thromboxane-related mechanism. Our findings identify an association between <italic>TRPV4</italic> and inherited osteonecrosis of the femoral head, providing additional insight into osteonecrosis pathogenesis and reinforcing the importance of TRPV4 in vascular endothelium and bone homeostasis.</p>
