    <p id="P4">Oculofacialcardiodental syndrome (OFCD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by teeth with extremely long roots (radiculomegaly), and craniofacial, eye and cardiac abnormalities<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. OFCD is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern in heterozygous females, and males with OFCD cannot survive due to embryonic lethality. Frequent eye anomalies include congenital cataracts and microphthalmia. Facial deformities include long narrow face, high nasal bridge, and cleft palate. Congenital cardiac abnormalities include septal defect and mitral valve defect. Among the many dental defects reported in OFCD patients, enlarged roots of canine teeth is the most consistent and typical finding<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The roots mainly consist of dentin, a bone-like mineralized tissue that serves to anchor the tooth in alveolar bone. After tooth eruption, root formation is well-synchronized with alveolar bone growth and virtually stops growing at certain ages<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. On the contrary, in OFCD patients, the roots of mandibular incisors and canines can grow continuously until they reach the lower border of the mandible; the roots of maxillary incisors and canines can extend to the cortical plate of the orbit. Thus, canine radiculomegaly has been considered to be an important sign for OFCD diagnosis<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P5">Genetic studies have found that mutations in BCL6 co-repressor (BCOR) are responsible for OFCD syndrome<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The most common mutations in BCOR are truncation and frameshift mutations, resulting in premature termination of the protein with deletion of the C-terminal domain<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. BCOR was originally identified as a co-repressor of the transcription repressor BCL-6<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Chromosomal translocations of BCL-6 are common genomic alterations in Non-Hodgkinâs B-cell lymphomas<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. BCOR has been found to interact with histone deacetylase (HDAC), demethylase and H2A ubiquitin ligase, suggesting that BCOR may mediate repression through chromatin modification<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Mouse <italic>Bcor</italic> has been found to be expressed in tooth primordium, eye, neural tube and branchial arches which correlate with tissues affected in OFCD patients<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Genetic studies, through deleting <italic>Bcor</italic> in embryonic stem cells, suggest that <italic>Bcor</italic> plays an important role in early mouse embryonic development<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P6">Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were originally isolated from bone marrow and are multipotent since they can differentiate into a variety of cell types including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes and adipocytes. Growing evidence indicates that MSCs are also present in non-bone marrow tissues<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Recently, a new population of MSCs has been isolated from dental and craniofacial tissues based on their stem cell properties<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. These cells are multipotent, osteo/dentinogenic and capable of self-renewal. When transplanted into immunocompromised mice, they generated bone/dentin-like mineralized tissue and were capable of repairing dental and craniofacial defects<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Characterization of MSCs from root apical papilla strongly suggests that these cells are responsible for root dentin formation and root growth. Since OFCD patients have enlarged and continuously growing root, <italic>BCOR</italic> mutation may have an intrinsic effect on the proliferation and function of MSCs from root apical papilla. To test our hypothesis, we isolated MSCs from the root apical papilla of an OFCD patient and examined their stem cell properties. While <italic>BCOR</italic> mutation did not affect stem cell marker expression, BCOR mutation resulted in enhanced osteo/dentinogenic potential of MSCs by inducing AP-2Î±. Mechanistically, we found that <italic>BCOR</italic> mutation increased histone H3 K4/36 methylation and reduced binding of BCL-6 to the <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> promoter, thereby resulting in a loss of BCL-6/BCOR repressive function. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the abnormal root growth of OFCD syndrome.</p>
    <p id="P7">MSCs were isolated from apical papilla of an OFCD patient undergoing surgical root apex removal due to radiculomegaly. This patient had a single nucleotide deletion, c.2613delC, resulting in a frameshift mutation with premature stop codon, p.F871Lfs8X<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Like many of the mutations found in other OFCD patients, this frameshift mutation led to the deletion of the BCOR C-terminus (approximately 800 amino acid deletion). MSCs isolated from the OFCD patient (MSC-O) proliferated at a faster rate in vitro than wild type MSCs isolated from a healthy human subject (MSC-WT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>). Of note, the expression levels of <italic>BCOR</italic> mRNA in MSC-WT and MSC-O cells were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S1b,c</xref>). Since radiculomegaly indicated that root was heavily mineralized, increased proliferation could not fully account for the phenotype of OFCD. Thus, we further examined whether BCOR mutation intrinsically affected MSC function. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, FACS profiling showed that MSC-O expressed stem cell markers of MSCs similar to those of MSC-WT cells<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Root dentin is a specialized mineralized tissue like bones<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Since OFCD patients display abnormal root formation, we tested whether MSC-O cells had increased osteo/dentinogenic potentials. Both MSC-O and MSC-WT cells were treated with differentiation-inducing media containing dexamethasone, ascorbic acid and Î²-glycerophosphate as described previously<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. To minimize the effect of cell growth on differentiation, both MSC-O and MSC-WT cells were plated in a confluent condition. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, shortly upon induction, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, an early marker for osteo/dentinogenic differentiation, was more strongly induced in MSC-O cells as compared with MSC-WT cells. Three weeks after induction, Alizarin Red staining revealed that calcium deposition or mineralization was also significantly higher in MSC-O cells than in MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Consistently, Real-time RT-PCR found that bone/dentin extracellular matrix genes, including <italic>OCN</italic> and <italic>SPP1</italic>, were more strongly induced in MSC-O cells as compared with MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Dental sialoprotein (DSP) is an extracellular matrix protein highly expressed in dentin relative to other tissues<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. We found that the induction of DSP was significantly higher in MSC-O cells than in MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Finally, our in vivo transplantation also demonstrated that MSC-O cells generated more bone/dentin-like mineralized tissues than MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">Since OFCD is an X-linked dominant syndrome in heterozygous females, the initial MSC-O cells from the patient may be a mixed population expressing wild type or mutant <italic>BCOR</italic> mRNA due to X-inactivation. Thus, it is important to determine whether enhanced osteo/dentinogenic differentiation in passaged MSC-O cells is mainly due to cells expressing mutant <italic>BCOR</italic> mRNA. Total RNA from MSC-O cells was extracted and RT-RCR was performed using the specific primers which were from different exons and spanned the mutation site of <italic>BCOR</italic>. The PCR products were subcloned into a TA clone vector and sequenced. We found that the majority of clones (52 out of 60) expressed mutant <italic>BCOR</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S1d</xref>), suggesting that the mutant cells outgrew the wild-type cells in expanded MSC-O cell cultures. To further confirm our results, we also used shRNA to knock-down <italic>BCOR</italic> in MSC-WT cells. The knock-down of <italic>BCOR</italic> expression also significantly enhanced osteo/dentinogenic differentiation of MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Moreover, the knock-down of <italic>BCOR</italic> in MSCs isolated from the dental pulp, also known as dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs)<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, potently enhanced osteo/dentinogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">To determine whether enhanced osteo/dentinogenic potentials associated with MSC-O cells were directly due to <italic>BCOR</italic> mutation, we tested whether the restoration of wild type <italic>BCOR</italic> (isoform C) in MSC-O could inhibit osteo/dentinogenic potentials of MSC-O cells. To rule out clonal variation, MSC-O cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing <italic>Flag-BCOR</italic> and control vector. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, using specific primers to detect <italic>Flag-BCOR</italic>, RT-PCR confirmed that wild type <italic>BCOR</italic> was stably expressed in MSC-O (MSC-O/BCOR) cells, but not in control cells (MSC-O/GFP). Real-time RT-PCR showed a 5-fold increase in <italic>BCOR</italic> mRNA expression in MSC-O/BCOR cells compared to MSC-O/GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), using primers which detect both endogenous <italic>BCOR</italic> and ectopic <italic>Flag-BCOR</italic>. The over-expression of wild type <italic>BCOR</italic> significantly inhibited the proliferation of MSC-O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Restoration of wild type BCOR in MSC-O cells strongly inhibited ALP activity upon induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Consistently, mineralization was potently inhibited in MSC-O/BCOR cells compared with MSC-O/GFP cells as determined by Alizarin Red staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">Our studies suggest that BCOR mutation has intrinsic effects on MSC differentiation capacity. However, because <italic>BCOR</italic> mutation increases cell proliferation, the enhancement of osteo/dentinogenic potentials of MSCs may be an indirect effect. To resolve this crucial issue, we performed gene expression profiling to identify the BCOR target genes that might be associated with osteo/dentinogenic potentials using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Together with this information, gain- and loss-of-function experiments would help to determine whether BCOR-regulated target genes were crucial for enhanced osteo/dentinogenic potentials, thereby providing direct evidence to verify the functional role of BCOR mutation in osteo/dentinogenic capacity. Importantly, microarray revealed that the transcription factor <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> was the second highest differentially expressed gene in MSC-O cells as compared to MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Other highly expressed genes in MSC-O cells (&gt;5-fold) relative to MSC-WT cells were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Previously, genetic studies found that <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> was associated with craniofacial development and the knock-out of <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> caused craniofacial and skeletal defects<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. RT-PCR confirmed that <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> was strongly expressed in MSC-O cells, but not in MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Consistently, Western blot analysis found that AP-2Î± was highly expressed in MSC-O cells, but only was barely detected in MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Furthermore, we found that AP-2Î± was not expressed in MSCs from three different healthy human subjects, indicating that the difference was unlikely due to individual variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P11">To determine whether AP-2Î± was a key mediator for enhanced osteo/dentinogenic potentials resulting from <italic>BCOR</italic> mutation, we first tested whether the over-expression of AP-2Î± potentiated differentiation capacity of MSC-WT cells. To avoid clonal variation, MSC-WT cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing <italic>Flag</italic>-<italic>AP-2Î±</italic> or control vector. Western blot analysis confirmed that AP-2Î± was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Over-expression of AP-2Î± did not affect MSC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f, g</xref>, we found that over-expression of AP-2Î± significantly enhanced ALP activity and mineralization upon induction. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis also revealed that the over-expression of AP-2Î± enhanced expressions of <italic>OCN</italic>, <italic>SPP1</italic>, and DSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h, i, j</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">To further confirm that AP-2Î± was responsible for enhanced osteo/dentinogenic potentials of MSCs, we utilized small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock-down <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> expression in MSC-O cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that approximately 90% of AP-2Î± in MSC-O cells were knocked down by retroviruses expressing shRNA against AP-2Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The knock-down of AP-2Î± did not significantly change cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), but it significantly reduced ALP activity and mineralization in MSC-O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Consistently, the knock-down of AP-2Î± decreased expressions of <italic>OCN</italic>, <italic>SPP1</italic> and DSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4eâg</xref>). We transplanted both MSC-O cells expressing <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> shRNA (MSC-O/<italic>AP-2Î±</italic>shRNA) and MSC-O expressing <italic>luciferase</italic> shRNA (MSC-O/<italic>Luc</italic>shRNA) into nude mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>, the knock-down of AP-2Î± also significantly reduced bone/dentin-like tissue formation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
    <p id="P13">We found that over-expression of BCOR suppressed AP-2Î± expression in MSC-O cells, as determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Conversely, the knock-down of <italic>BCOR</italic> in MSC-WT cells increased <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>). These results further confirm that BCOR controls <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> expression. We then examined whether BCOR was associated with the <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> promoter in MSC cells. A BCL6-binding site (TTTAGGAA), which is located 1439 bp upstream of the transcription start site, was found on the <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> promoter. Chromatin co-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that BCOR was present at the BCL6-binding site of <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> in MSC-WT cells, but not in MSC-O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Of note, anti-BCOR antibodies could not recognize the mutant BCOR proteins in MSC-O cells. As a negative control, BCOR was not detected in a region located in the open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>AP-2Î±</italic>. Interestingly, although BCL-6 was expressed at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>), BCL-6 binding to the <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> promoter was reduced in MSC-O cells compared with MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the BCOR complex contains polycomb group proteins and JHDM1B/FBXL10 demethylase<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. While the functional role of these molecules in the BCOR complex is not clear, their findings suggest that BCOR may utilize an epigenetic mechanism to direct gene silencing. Abnormal histone methylation due to BCOR mutation might affect BCL-6 binding to the <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> promoter. JHDM1B is a histone demethylase that has been shown to demethylate trimethylated lysine 4 or dimethylated 36 on histone 3 (H3K4me3 or H3K36me2)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. In general, methylation at H3K4 and H3K36 is associated with transcriptional activation <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. Since the BCOR C-terminus is required to interact with these molecules, we hypothesized that BCOR mutation in OFCD might impair the recruitment of JHDM1B to chromatin. However, despite our repeated efforts, available anti-JHDM1B antibodies did not work for our ChIP assays. To overcome this problem, we retrovirally expressed HA-JHDM1B in MSC-WT and MSC-O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>) and performed ChIP assays using anti-HA antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>, HA-JHDM1B on the <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> promoter in MSC-WT cells was significantly higher than that in MSC-O cells. Moreover, we directly examined whether BCOR mutation affected H3K4/36 methylation of the <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> promoter in MSCs. ChIP assays revealed that H3K36me2 on the <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> promoter in MSC-O cells was 7-fold higher than in MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). H3K4me3 on the <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> promoter in MSC-O cells was also significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5j</xref>). To further confirm our results, we over-expressed both wild type and OFCD-mutant forms of <italic>BCOR</italic> (<italic>O-BCOR</italic>) in MSC-O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). ChIP assays showed that the restoration of wild type-<italic>BCOR</italic> significantly reduced H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 in MSC-O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i, j</xref>). On the contrary, over-expression of O-BCOR had no effects on H3K4/36 methylation in MSC-O cells. Of note, a recent study showed that JHDM1B is an H3K36me2-specific demethylase. H3K4me3 changes might be indirect<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. To determine whether the BCOR/JHDM1B complex played a role in the inhibition of MSC functions, we utilized shRNA to knock-down <italic>JHDM1B</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>) in MSC-WT cells. The depletion of <italic>JHDM1B</italic> resulted in the induction of <italic>AP-2Î±</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S4b</xref>). Moreover, the depletion of <italic>JHDM1B</italic> enhanced osteo/dentinogenic differentiation of MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S4câf</xref>). Finally, since the BCOR complex is associated with ubiquitylation of histone H2A, we performed ChIP assays to determine whether BCOR mutation affects ubiquintylation of H2A. ChIP assays revealed that ubiquintylation of H2A was significantly reduced in MSC-O cells as compared with MSC-WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P14">Our studies provide a possible explanation for dental and craniofacial defects of OFCD patients. We showed that <italic>BCOR</italic> mutation led to the upregulation of AP-2Î± in MSCs and promoted osteo/dentinogenesis. Mechanistically, <italic>BCOR</italic> plays a critical role in development and maintenance of homeostasis via epigenetic modification of histone methylation. In normal conditions, BCOR interacts with JHDM1B and represses gene transcription by inhibiting H3K36/4 methylation on the target gene promoter in MSCs. In OFCD patients, the BCOR mutation fails to recruit JHDM1B to the target gene promoter, resulting in increased H3K36/4 methylation and transcription activation of silenced gene in MSCs. Supporting this conclusion, the depletion of JHDM1B in MSCs also induces AP-2Î± expression and enhances osteo/dentinogenic differentiation of MSCs. Based on analysis of our microarray results, the BCOR complex may repress a large number of genes in MSCs. In addition to <italic>AP-2Î±</italic>, it is possible that other genes may also play a role in dental and craniofacial defects of OFCD patients. For example, <italic>PAX3</italic>, which is associated with craniofacial development, is also activated in MSC-O cells. In addition to craniofacial defects, cataracts are the most frequent ocular phenotype of OFCD patients<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Interestingly, transgenic mice over-expressing AP-2Î± developed cataracts<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, further supporting the notion that AP-2Î± plays a role in the pathogenesis of OFCD. MSCs are also involved in cardiac development and formation. In future studies, it will be interesting to examine how <italic>BCOR</italic> mutation affects heart development and whether AP-2Î± plays a role in congenial heart defects associated with OFCD patients. In summary, by studying a rare human genetic disease, we identified the BCOR complex as a novel negative regulator of osteo/dentiogenic capacity of MSCs.</p>
