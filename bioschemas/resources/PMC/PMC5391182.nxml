        <p>LIMCH1 specifically associates with contractile stress fibers. The N-terminus of LIMCH1 directly interacts with the head of NM-IIA. LIMCH1 depletion modulates the myosin regulatory light chain and FAK phosphorylation. Actin stress fiber and focal adhesion are decreased in LIMCH1-depleted cells, leading to increased cell migration.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Nonmuscle myosin II (NM-II) is an important motor protein involved in cell migration. Incorporation of NM-II into actin stress fiber provides a traction force to promote actin retrograde flow and focal adhesion assembly. However, the components involved in regulation of NM-II activity are not well understood. Here we identified a novel actin stress fiberâassociated protein, LIM and calponin-homology domains 1 (LIMCH1), which regulates NM-II activity. The recruitment of LIMCH1 into contractile stress fibers revealed its localization complementary to actinin-1. LIMCH1 interacted with NM-IIA, but not NM-IIB, independent of the inhibition of myosin ATPase activity with blebbistatin. Moreover, the N-terminus of LIMCH1 binds to the head region of NM-IIA. Depletion of LIMCH1 attenuated myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) diphosphorylation in HeLa cells, which was restored by reexpression of small interfering RNAâresistant LIMCH1. In addition, LIMCH1-depleted HeLa cells exhibited a decrease in the number of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, leading to enhanced cell migration. Collectively, our data suggest that LIMCH1 plays a positive role in regulation of NM-II activity through effects on MRLC during cell migration.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cell migration plays an important role in a wide variety of biological phenomena, such as embryonic development, wound healing, immune response, and cancer metastasis. Various signaling pathways involving growth factors and extracellular matrix mediate directional cell migration to regulate cytoskeletal and adhesion machinery within the cell (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ridley <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Cell movement comprises several steps executed in distinct cellular areas: 1) formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, mediated by polymerization of actin filament, at the leading edge to extend the cell membrane; 2) assembly of adhesions at the leading edge and its release at the rear of the cell; and 3) retraction of the rear of the cell by actomyosin-mediated traction force to translocate the cell body (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>). Optimal migration requires spatiotemporal coordination between actin filaments and nonmuscle myosin II (NM-II) to control adhesion turnover (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gupton and Waterman-Storer, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Nonmuscle myosin II, an actin-based motor protein, is a hexamer composed of two myosin heavy chains (MHCs), two essential light chains (MELCs), and two regulatory light chains (MRLCs). Each MHC bears a motor domain carrying the actin-binding site and ATPase, two IQ domains that bind the MELC and MRLC, respectively, and an Î±-helical coiled-coil responsible for NM-II assembly into filaments. NM-II isoforms execute various cellular functions, depending on their location (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Vicente-Manzanares <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Ronen and Ravid, 2009</xref>). For instance, NM-IIA mediates traction force to promote retrograde F-actin flow in the lamella and inhibits cell spreading (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cai <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Localized in the rear and center of the cell, NM-IIB regulates cell polarity and tail retraction (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kolega, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Vicente-Manzanares <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Cooperative interaction between NM-IIA and NM-IIB promotes actomyosin bundling, generating stable focal adhesions (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Vicente-Manzanares <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Regulation of NM-II activity depends on phosphorylation of MRLC, which induces a conformational change in the motor domain to facilitate interaction with actin, resulting in the activation of myosin ATPase. Therefore higher phosphorylation of MRLC can enhance cell contraction. (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Vicente-Manzanares <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Phosphorylation of MRLC at Ser-19 (pMRLC-S19) activates the ATPase activity of myosin and induces NM-II assembly. In comparison to pMRLC-S19, diphosphorylation of MRLC at both Ser-19 and Thr-18 (ppMRLC-S19/T18) results in higher ATPase activity and more NM-II assembly (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ikebe and Hartshorne, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ikebe <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tan <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1992</xref>) and markedly enhances the formation of actin stress fibers (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Joo <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Whereas diphosphorylation of MRLC is regulated by Rho kinase (ROCK), zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK), and citron kinase, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and myotonic dystrophy kinaseârelated CDC42-binding kinase can phosphorylate MRLC at Ser-19 alone (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Murata-Hori <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Tan <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Actin stress fibers are typically composed of actomyosin filaments; these filaments are thick and stable in low-motility cells but thin, dynamic, and less developed in high-motility cells (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pellegrin and Mellor, 2007</xref>). Actin stress fibers are classified as dorsal stress fibers, ventral stress fibers, transverse arcs, and perinuclear actin cap (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Heath, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Small <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Khatau <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Unlike other fiber types, NM-II was not embedded into dorsal stress fibers, which lack contractility (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Tojkander <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Transverse arcs are formed of contractile unitsâthe product of the endwise assembly of actininâcross-linked actin filaments and NM-II/tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tojkander <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Transverse arcs may associate with dorsal stress fibers to form ventral stress fibers (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</xref>). During cell migration, the transverse arc generates retrograde flow from the leading edge toward the cell center and inhibits membrane protrusion (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Vicente-Manzanares <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Tojkander <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Ventral stress fibers connect with focal adhesions at both ends and facilitate cell movement by the retraction of the rear of the cell (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 1981</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison and Cramer, 1996</xref>).</p><p>LIM and calponin-homology domains 1 (LIMCH1) was identified from a border cell migration screen based on conditional ectopic expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We used the UAS-GAL4 system to evaluate a number of human genes showing altered expression patterns in hepatocellular carcinoma to determine their effects on cell migration. The border cell cluster expressing a partial limch1/kiaa1102 coding sequence exhibited a migration delay (unpublished data). Here we investigated the role of LIMCH1 in cell migration and identified its interacting protein, NM-IIA. Cellular studies have shown that LIMCH1 promotes the assembly of actin stress fiber during cell spreading, thereby accelerating cell contraction. We hypothesized that the presence of LIMCH1 on contractile stress fibers enhances the spatiotemporal regulation of NM-II activity during cell migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Characterization of LIMCH1 expression pattern</title><p>On the basis of previous experiments, we constructed a full-length clone of the predicted human LIMCH1 protein (accession number NM_014988) encompassing a single calponin homology (CH) domain at the N-terminus, LIM domain at the C-terminus, and coiled-coil domains in the center region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The CH domain is believed to participate in actin binding and the LIM domain in protein interaction (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dawid <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gimona and Mital, 1998</xref>). Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG and anti-LIMCH1 antibodies revealed exogenous and endogenous LIMCH1 signals at â¼150 kDa (Supplemental Figure S1A). The LIMCH1 expression pattern was studied in various cancer cell lines; LIMCH1 was overexpressed in Mahlavu, J7, and HeLa cells, and MDA-MB-231 (stably overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor) and Huh7 cells showed low-level expression (Supplemental Figure S1, B and C).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>LIMCH1 associates with actin stress fibers and binds to actin.

These signals were eliminated after small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment (Supplemental Figure S1E). LIMCH1 was colocalized with actin stress fibers, as confirmed by the magnified image revealing its periodic distribution along these filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The association of LIMCH1 with actin stress fibers was confirmed by treatment of HeLa cells with an actin filamentâdepolymerizing reagent, cytochalasin D (CD). Depolymerization of the actin filament was accompanied by disruption of the dotted signal that overlapped with the condensed actin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Live imaging revealed that CD treatment altered the distribution of green fluorescent protein (GFP)âLIMCH1 in MDCK cells and directionally assembled it into compact foci (Supplemental Video S1). This is in line with myosin-II condensation during depolymerization of the actin filament (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Verkhovsky <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>LIMCH1 is colocalized with NM-II on the contractile stress fibers</title><p>In nonmuscle cells, actininâan actin cross-linking proteinâdisplays a periodic staining pattern along actin stress fibers (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Peterson <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and localizes adjacent to NM-II (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</xref>). We determined the relative location of LIMCH1, actinin-1, and NM-II with respect to each other in HeLa cells using specific antibodies. Of interest, LIMCH1 alternated along the actin stress fibers with actinin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and colocalized with MRLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with the previously defined contractile units (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tojkander <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), actinin-1 failed to overlap with MRLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Further magnification revealed that LIMCH1 displayed twin and condensed signals between the adjacent actinin-1âs. These signals partially colocalized with MRLC in a contractile unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, D and E</xref>). Whereas 69% of the contractile units showed a twin signal of LIMCH1, 31% of them exhibited a condensed LIMCH1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). A similar staining pattern was observed in GFP-LIMCH1âexpressing U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref> and Supplemental Figure S1F). Furthermore, the distance between adjacent signals of actinin-1 was determined and the average length of these contractile units measured; the length of contractile units coincided with that of the actin stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Peterson <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>, actinin-1 was equidistant from MRLC and LIMCH1, indicating partial colocalization of LIMCH1 with MRLC. These results suggest that LIMCH1 associated with actin stress fibers in a pattern complementary to actinin-1 and colocalized with NM-II.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>LIMCH1 colocalizes with NM-II in a contractile unit.

In addition, LIMCH1 was not detected at focal adhesions and peripheral actin filaments with vinculin and actinin-4 staining, respectively (Supplemental Figure S2, C and D).

Therefore it is important to understand the influence of NM-II activity on the association and interaction of LIMCH1 with actin stress fibers and NM-IIA, respectively. HeLa cells were treated with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, which is known to reduce MRLC phosphorylation in the cell center, thereby affecting NM-II activity (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Totsukawa <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Vicente-Manzanares <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The staining data revealed a periodic pattern of LIMCH1 in the cell center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), which it was lost when ROCK inhibitor disrupted the central stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, the expression of diphosphomimetic MRLC (MRLC-DD), which mimics ppMRLC-S19/T18, prevented Y27632-mediated stress fiber loss and maintained LIMCH1 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, magnified image). Thus the localization of LIMCH1 on the stress fiber was controlled by MRLC-DD, suggesting the regulatory role of ROCK signaling in LIMCH1 localization through MRLC phosphorylation. Furthermore, we inhibited myosin ATPase with blebbistatin treatment to achieve NM-II disassembly and studied the interaction of LIMCH1 with the disassembled NM-II. The immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the hypothesis that LIMCH1 interacted with NM-IIA after blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) and Y27632 treatment (unpublished data), suggesting that the association of LIMCH1 with NM-II was independent of actin stress fiber formation.

Recent studies have improved our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of NM-II assembly into actin stress fibers. However, the regulation of NM-II activity is not well understood. We showed that a new protein, LIMCH1, is recruited into contractile stress fibers through its interaction with NM-IIA. Loss of LIMCH1 expression reduces MRLC phosphorylation and assembly. Furthermore, LIMCH1 depletion affects the formation of actin stress fibers as well as the stability of focal adhesions, leading to increase in cell spreading and migration. Our data highlight the positive regulatory role of LIMCH1 in NM-II activity and actin stress fiber formation.</p><p>Contractile stress fibers are formed by NM-II/tropomyosin-containing actin filaments and exhibit endwise assembly with actininâcross-linked actin filaments (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tojkander <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). LIMCH1 displayed a complementary pattern to actinin-1 and colocalized with MRLC, suggesting its association with the NM-II/tropomyosin-containing actin filament. The absence of LIMCH1 at dorsal stress fibers indicates specific association between LIMCH1 and contractile stress fibers. However, not all types of actomyosin-constructed contractile fibers show association with LIMCH1 (e.g., the contractile ring). Inhibition of myosin ATPase activity disrupted the contractile units but failed to alter the interaction between LIMCH1 and NM-IIA. Thus the assembly of N-IIA into contractile stress fibers is accompanied by LIMC1. Furthermore, the N-terminal coiled-coil domain is involved in the localization of LIMCH1 on actin stress fibers, as well as its interaction with NM-IIA. The CH, LIM, and N-terminal coiled-coil domains of LIMCH1 are highly conserved and display homologies of 64, 60, and 59%, respectively, with LIM only 7 (LMO7; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Friedberg, 2009</xref>). LIMCH1 and LMO7 are proposed to exhibit similar roles in actin cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. Previous studies reported the association of LMO7 with actinin at the cellâcell junction for regulation of cell signaling (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ooshio <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yamada <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In addition, LMO7 regulates gene expression during muscle regeneration, which is inhibited by interactions with adhesion and nuclear proteins (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Dedeic <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Wozniak <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). LOM7 is also involved in EmeryâDreifuss muscular dystrophy and lung cancer progression (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mull <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).

Our results revealed the association between LIMCH1 and actin stress fibers in the internal region of the cell, where diphosphorylated MRLC is predominantly localized. However, LIMCH1 was absent at the distal lamella, where monophosphorylated MRLC is localized (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu and Ikebe, 2004</xref>). Moreover, LIMCH1 regulates the diphosphorylation of MRLC, as indicated by the decrease in the level of ppMRLC-S19/T18, but not pMRLC-S19, upon LIMCHC1 depletion. In comparison to its monophosphorylation, diphosphorylation of MRLC results in stronger ATPase activity of myosin (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ikebe and Hartshorne, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ikebe <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1988</xref>).

Increase in myosin phosphatase activity reduces MRLC phosphorylation not only on Ser-19/Thr-18 but also on Ser-19 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Koga and Ikebe, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Vallenius <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). However, LIMCH1 showed no effect on MRLC monophosphorylation, suggesting that the regulatory role of LIMCH1 in actin stress fiber formation does not involve myosin phosphatase. Therefore future studies should focus on the candidates involved in LIMCH1-mediated regulation of MRLC phosphorylation.</p><p>The initiation of cell movement at the leading edge of the cell forms broad lamellipodia, driven by the polymerization of actin filaments and stabilized by adhesion proteins connected to the extracellular matrix (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Small <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In contrast, NM-IIâgenerated actin retrograde flow in the lamella counters membrane extension through retraction of the leading edge (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Giannone <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The present study found that LIMCH1 primarily interacts with NM-IIA and not NM-IIB. Moreover, NM-IIA is a major isoform that generates the contractile force that drives the retrograde flow in the lamella and regulates membrane retraction (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cai <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Vicente-Manzanares <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Betapudi, 2010</xref>). We showed that LIMCH1-depleted cells extended over a greater area during the cell-spreading period, indicating that NM-IIAâmediated retrograde flow is interfered with by LIMCH1 depletion. In addition, NM-IIA controls the initiation of focal adhesion formation, and NM-IIB enhances NM-IIAâmediated actomyosin bundling, which stabilizes focal adhesions (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Betapudi, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Vicente-Manzanares <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). LIMCH1 depletion resulted in reduction in focal adhesions in the cell center; thus LIMCH1 enhances the activity of NM-IIA to promote maturation of focal adhesions. Given its role as an adaptor protein, the possibility that LIMCH1 regulates the NM-II activity through recruitment of other regulatory proteins cannot be excluded.</p><p>A spatiotemporal balance between actomyosin activity and focal adhesion assembly promotes optimal cell migration. An imbalance in the activity of NM-II can alter focal adhesion dynamics, thereby decreasing cell migration (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gupton and Waterman-Storer, 2006</xref>). In contrast, relaxation of NM-II contractility can increase cell migration (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dulyaninova <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Tripathi <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). LIMCH1 depletion provides an optimal threshold of traction for increasing cell migration through regulation of focal adhesion turnover, as determined by the phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-397. These findings suggest that LIMCH1 increases actomyosin activity, resulting in the assembly of actin stress fibers and stabilization of focal adhesions, thereby impeding cell migration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LIMCH1 plays a positive role in the spatiotemporal regulation of NM-II activity to modulate cell membrane protrusion and focal adhesion dynamics during cell migration. Future studies should examine whether LIMCH1 plays a role in cancer progression and normal tissue development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture, transfection, and reagents</title><p>HeLa and U2OS cells were cultured using DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit-Haemek, Israel) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA or plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per the manufacturerâs instructions. U2OS cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate transfection method. For transient transfection, cells were incubated with plasmid DNA for 48 h. Stable transfection was achieved by treating transfected cells with 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 1 wk, followed by flow cytometry analysis for sorting stably transfected cells. For knockdown experiments, cells were plated at low confluence (40%) and transfected with siRNA for 48 h.

Nonadherent cells were discarded by washing after incubation for 5 and 10 min. The adherent cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with crystal violet.

Fluorescence images were captured from four randomly selected fields using an Axio Imager Z1 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 20Ã/0.50 objective (Zeiss) and an AxioCamMR3 digital camera and processed into binary images. The cell area was measured using ImageJ software.</p><p>The Transwell migration assay was carried out using a chemotaxis chamber combined with a Transwell filter with 8-Î¼m pores (Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg, MD). The harvested cells (1 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells) were plated into the upper well in serum-free DMEM, and the bottom chambers contained 10% FBS-DMEM. After a 6-h incubation, cells on the filter were fixed with 100% ice-cold ethanol. The upper-side cells were scraped with a cotton swab, and the under-side cells were stained with 1 Î¼g/ml 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS. Fluorescence images were captured from five randomly selected fields per well using an Axio Imager Z1 microscope and a Plan-Neofluar 10Ã/0.30 objective.

The harvested cells were seeded on the fibronectin-coated glass coverslips for 60 min. After incubation, the coverslip was placed in a POC-R chamber (Zeiss), and time-lapse images were captured using an Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope equipped with an environmental chamber (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37Â°C). Phase-contrast images were acquired every 10 min for 8 h using an Achroplan 10Ã/0.45 objective. Migration paths were tracked by monitoring the position of the cell nuclei manually using ImageJ software. Cell velocities were derived for each cell by dividing the path length with the elapsed time.

The fixed cells were incubated with the blocking solution (2% BSA in PBS) for 1 h. These coverslips were treated with various primary antibodies diluted in the blocking solution. After a 2-h incubation, the coverslips were treated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies and phalloidin (Invitrogen) diluted in the blocking solution for 1 h. After incubation, the cells were mounted in Mowiol mounting medium (Polysciences, Warrington, PA).</p></sec><sec><title>Image analysis of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions</title><p>Immunofluorescence images of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions were processed by ImageJ software for quantification of intensity as well as number, as previously described (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Pasapera <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Harvested cells were seeded on 20 Î¼g/ml fibronectin-coated coverslips in 10% FBS-DMEM and incubated for 60 min. After incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS and stained with anti-paxillin, antiâNM-IIB, and anti-vinculin antibodies, as well as phalloidin. Fluorescence images of paxillin, NM-IIB, and phalloidin were processed using a median filter with 13-pixel-square kernel as the background image. The background images were used to create binary images of NM-IIB and phalloidin (dividing the original image with the background image) and to define the cell outline and central region. The intensity of actin stress fibers was evaluated by subtracting the phalloidin-background image from the original phalloidin image. Focal adhesions were counted by processing the paxillin-stained image using a median filter with 1-pixel-square kernel. The background image was subtracted from the paxillin-processed image to create a binary image of focal adhesions. Automatic particle analysis was applied to count these adhesions. Central focal adhesions were quantified with normalization of the value of central area to the value of total area. Processed images are shown in Supplemental Figure S4. The intensity of focal adhesions was quantified by the selection of a 0.3- to 19-Î¼m<sup>2</sup> area of focal adhesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay</title><p>Cells were lysed using immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM NaF, 20 mM Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and 1 mM NaVO<sub>4</sub>) supplemented with a 1Ã protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
