        <p>Delivering CFTR to ciliated cells of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients fully restores ion and fluid transport to the lumenal surface of airway epithelium and returns mucus transport rates to those of non-CF airways.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Dysfunction of CFTR in cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelium perturbs the normal regulation of ion transport, leading to a reduced volume of airway surface liquid (ASL), mucus dehydration, decreased mucus transport, and mucus plugging of the airways. CFTR is normally expressed in ciliated epithelial cells of the surface and submucosal gland ductal epithelium and submucosal gland acinar cells. Critical questions for the development of gene transfer strategies for CF airway disease are what airway regions require CFTR function and how many epithelial cells require CFTR expression to restore normal ASL volume regulation and mucus transport to CF airway epithelium? An in vitro model of human CF ciliated surface airway epithelium (CF HAE) was used to test whether a human parainfluenza virus (PIV) vector engineered to express <italic>CFTR</italic> (PIVCFTR) could deliver sufficient CFTR to CF HAE to restore mucus transport, thus correcting the CF phenotype. PIVCFTR delivered CFTR to &gt;60% of airway surface epithelial cells and expressed CFTR protein in CF HAE approximately 100-fold over endogenous levels in non-CF HAE. This efficiency of CFTR delivery fully corrected the basic bioelectric defects of Cl<sup>â</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> epithelial ion transport and restored ASL volume regulation and mucus transport to levels approaching those of non-CF HAE. To determine the numbers of CF HAE surface epithelial cells required to express CFTR for restoration of mucus transport to normal levels, different amounts of PIVCFTR were used to express CFTR in 3%â65% of the surface epithelial cells of CF HAE and correlated to increasing ASL volumes and mucus transport rates. These data demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that restoration of normal mucus transport rates in CF HAE was achieved after CFTR delivery to 25% of surface epithelial cells. In vivo experimentation in appropriate models will be required to determine what level of mucus transport will afford clinical benefit to CF patients, but we predict that a future goal for corrective gene transfer to the CF human airways in vivo would attempt to target at least 25% of surface epithelial cells to achieve mucus transport rates comparable to those in non-CF airways.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The ciliated epithelium that lines the conducting airways of the lung normally functions to transport hydrated mucus secretions out of the airways to maintain respiratory sterility. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease results from reduced airway surface hydration leading to decreased mucus clearance that precipitates bacterial infection and progressive obstructive lung disease. CF is a genetic disease, and the mutant protein is a chloride ion channel (CFTR) that normally regulates ion and fluid transport on the airway surface. Restoration of corrected CFTR function to the airway epithelium of CF patients by delivering a new <italic>CFTR</italic> gene to airway epithelial cells has long been envisioned as a therapeutic strategy for CF lung disease. Towards this goal, we use a novel viral vector to deliver <italic>CFTR</italic> to a culture model that represents the ciliated airway epithelium of CF patients and show that this strategy restores airway surface hydration and mucus transport to levels of that in non-CF individuals. This study demonstrates efficient and efficacious <italic>CFTR</italic> delivery to CF ciliated airway epithelium and that <italic>CFTR</italic> delivered to approximately 25% of the surface epithelial cells restores normal levels of airway surface hydration and mucus transport. These studies serve as a benchmark for the efficiency of <italic>CFTR</italic> gene delivery to CF airways for future CF gene therapy studies in vivo.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common recessive lethal genetic disorder in Caucasian populations and results from a defect in the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene. Although CF affects many organs, the pulmonary manifestations account for over 90% of the morbidity and mortality <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Koch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Dysfunction of CFTR in CF airway epithelium perturbs the normal regulation of ion transport, leading to a reduced volume of airway surface liquid (ASL), mucus dehydration, decreased mucus transport (MCT), and mucus plugging of the airways, which are hallmarks of early CF lung disease. Failure of effective mucus clearance initiates and exacerbates CF lung disease, resulting in an inability to effectively prevent or eradicate bacterial infection, typically dominated by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Persistent neutrophil-mediated inflammation in CF airways further compromises defective clearance and, over several decades, results in airway destruction and fatal decline of lung function.</p>
      <p>Airway mucus clearance is dependent on MCT facilitated by ciliated cell function and cough clearance, and constitutes âmechanicalâ innate defense of the lung <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Randell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Both MCT and cough clearance require sufficient hydration of mucus secretions for effective airway clearance. The currently accepted model for CF lung pathogenesis is that absence of CFTR function leads to ASL volume reduction that results in mucostasis. A logical therapeutic strategy to reverse CF lung pathogenesis would therefore replace CFTR function to CF airway epithelium, restoring ASL volume regulation and MCT. <italic>CFTR</italic> gene delivery strategies remain a rational approach towards this goal. To date, however, clinical trials in CF patients using <italic>CFTR</italic> gene delivery techniques have resulted in limited successful gene delivery that is widely considered to be insufficient for therapeutic benefit to CF patients. The fundamental hurdle to these approaches is the low efficiency of <italic>CFTR</italic> gene delivery to human conducting airway epithelial cells that regulate MCT.</p>
      <p>In non-CF human airways, CFTR is expressed in ciliated airway epithelial cells of the surface and submucosal gland ductal epithelium <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Kreda1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and in the fluid-secreting cells of the submucosal glands <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Ciliated cells are the predominant luminal epithelial cell type present throughout the proximal and distal conducting airways and are critical cell types for facilitating MCT <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Jeffery1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These properties of ciliated cells make them an abundant and relevant target for <italic>CFTR</italic> gene delivery. Since restoration of MCT or ASL volumes to normal non-CF levels has not been described after delivery of CFTR to CF airway epithelium either in vitro or in vivo, it remains unknown how much CFTR or how many surface epithelial cells will be required to express CFTR to restore mechanical innate defense to the airways.</p>
      <p>In vitro models of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE) recapitulate the morphology and physiology of the human airway epithelium and have been a valuable tool in the study of cell physiologic mechanisms that regulate ion and fluid transport and MCT in the human ciliated conducting airways <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1000155-Coakley1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Importantly, HAE retain phenotypic differences between non-CF and CF airway epithelium, i.e., CF HAE exhibit reduced or absent cAMP-mediated chloride ion (Cl<sup>â</sup>) secretion, dysregulation of sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>) absorption, excessive ASL absorption, dehydration of secreted mucus, and mucostasis <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This model has been predictive of the in vivo efficacy of drug- and gene-based therapeutics in human clinical studies <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1000155-Moss2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In particular, this model has been utilized to determine that currently available gene transfer vectors approved for clinical testing (e.g., adenovirus, lentivirus, AAV, and nonviral vectors) are inefficient at delivering CFTR to sufficient numbers of surface epithelial cells to restore CFTR function or ASL volume for effective MCT. The target number of cells in a ciliated airway epithelium needed to express CFTR for restoration of ASL and MCT is currently unknown.</p>
      <p>We have shown that human parainfluenza virus (PIV) selectively targets ciliated cells of HAE after luminal delivery <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Since recombinant PIV can be re-engineered to express large transgene inserts <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Skiadopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we used PIV to: (1) generate PIV-expressing <italic>CFTR</italic> as an additional gene (PIVCFTR); (2) test whether delivery of <italic>CFTR</italic> to CF ciliated cells restored mechanical innate defense, i.e., MCT, to human CF airway epithelia; and (3) determine the numbers of CF epithelial cells requiring CFTR to restore MCT rates to normal non-CF HAE levels. Using CF HAE, CFTR expression levels per cell and numbers of cells expressing CFTR were correlated with correction of ion transport, ASL volume regulation, and MCT rates to assess the relationship between gene transduction and restoration of normal mucociliary transport. We show that PIV-mediated delivery of CFTR to ciliated cells of CF HAE resulted in functional CFTR channel activity with restoration of ASL volume homeostasis and MCT. Further, we show that CFTR expression in individual ciliated cells does not require tight regulation of expression and that restoration of MCT rates to those measured in non-CF HAE required CFTR delivery to at least 25% of surface epithelial cells or approximately 30% of ciliated cells. Hence, we describe the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of efficient <italic>CFTR</italic> gene delivery to CF ciliated airway epithelium that is sufficient to correct the fundamental physiological dysfunctions that precipitate CF lung pathogenesis.</p>

Quantitation of lumenal cells infected by PIVGFP or PIVCFTR revealed that similar numbers of ciliated cells were infected by each virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Although ciliated cell numbers were variable in HAE derived from different donors (range 60% to 80%), the percentage of ciliated cells per square centimeter of epithelium surface area determined by Î²-tubulin IV immunodetection showed that on average approximately 70% of surface cells were ciliated cells. Since the total number of lumenal surface cells in HAE approximates 0.3Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells, we estimate that approximately 42% of surface cells or approximately 60% of ciliated cells were infected by PIV under these conditions.</p>

        <p>The PIV vector replicates in ciliated cells and by 24 h pi, sheds progeny virions onto the culture surface, resulting in further rounds of ciliated cell infection. However, when low viral titers (10<sup>3</sup> PFU) were used to inoculate HAE, evidence of further rounds of infection (i.e., spread) was not apparent until 48 h pi <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To determine whether the high efficiency of ciliated cell infection by PIVCFTR was dependent on spread of progeny virus from ciliated cell to ciliated cell, we compared infection rates at 24 h versus 48 h pi. HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR (10<sup>6</sup> PFU) for 2 h showed similar high infection rates at 24 h pi as for 48 h (2-h data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g002">Figure 2F vs. 2E</xref>), indicating that the initial high titer inoculum and not cellâcell spread of virus mediated the highly efficient targeting of ciliated cells by PIV. Prolonging or decreasing inoculation times to 8 h or 5 min produced modestly increased or decreased infection rates, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The high numbers of PIVCFTR-infected cells with only 5-min inoculation time highlight the high efficiency of PIV infection and suggest that short exposure times in the airways will be sufficient for efficient targeting of ciliated cells in vivo.</p>
        <p>Although equally efficient at targeting ciliated cells as PIVGFP, PIVCFTR stimulated significantly lower amounts of epithelial cell-derived inflammatory mediators associated with in vivo viral pathogenesis. Indeed, PIVCFTR only induced inflammatory mediator secretion to levels stimulated by inoculation with UV-inactivated PIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g002">Figure 2G</xref> for CXCL8, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000155.s002">Figure S2</xref> for CXCL10, IL-6, IL-12p40, MCP-1, and RANTES). Since PIVCFTR produced 10-fold fewer progeny virions than PIVGFP due to the insertion of the relatively large <italic>CFTR</italic> insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g002">Figure 2H</xref>), it is likely that the generation of inflammatory mediators is proportional to the rate of PIV replication in ciliated cells.</p>

        <title>PIV Delivers CFTR to Ciliated Cells, Resulting in Overexpression and Apical Localization of Functional CFTR</title>
        <p>Expression levels of transduced CFTR in CF HAE were determined by comparing the levels of exogenous <italic>CFTR</italic> mRNA expressed by PIVCFTR relative to endogenous <italic>CFTR</italic> mRNA in CF HAE and non-CF HAE using quantitative RT-PCR. Previously, it has been estimated that human airway cells contain only approximately 10 <italic>CFTR</italic> transcripts/cell <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Crystal1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In our experiments, we found that CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR produced a 236-fold increase in <italic>CFTR</italic> mRNA when compared to cultures inoculated with PIVGFP or mock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Since this large-fold increase in <italic>CFTR</italic> mRNA is in part reflective of the low endogenous copy number of <italic>CFTR</italic>, we also assessed CFTR protein levels semiquantitatively by western blot. CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR expressed large amounts of mature CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 3, band C), whereas no mature CFTR protein was detected in CF HAE inoculated with vehicle alone (lane 1) or PIVGFP (lane 2). Serial 10-fold dilutions of total protein lysates of CF HAE inoculated with PIVCFTR (lanes 4 and 5) provided a semiquantitative measurement of the amounts of exogenous CFTR protein in CF HAE compared to CFTR protein levels in non-CF HAE (lane 6). We estimate that an approximately 50-fold increase in mature CFTR protein in transduced CF HAE was achieved compared to non-CF HAE. Therefore, two independent measures of CFTR abundance indicate a significant overexpression of both <italic>CFTR</italic> mRNA and protein in transduced CF HAE. Note, these measures are likely an underestimate given that not all ciliated cells are infected by PIVCFTR. Because approximately 60% of ciliated cells were infected in these experiments, and ciliated cells on average comprise approximately 70% of surface cells within a culture, we estimate that individual infected ciliated cells likely overexpress CFTR protein by at least 100-fold over non-CF ciliated cells.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of CFTR in CF Ciliated Cells Does Not Increase Anion Transport Beyond That of Non-CF HAE</title>
        <p>Although others have shown that overexpression of CFTR was not detrimental to airway epithelial cell integrity in vitro and in vivo <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000155-Chroneos1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, we had anticipated that Fsk-stimulated Cl<sup>â</sup> secretion would exceed that of non-CF HAE since CF ciliated cells significantly overexpressed CFTR, i.e., CF HAE would be âsupercorrected.â That CF HAE overexpressing CFTR exhibited identical anion secretion as measured in non-CF HAE with endogenous CFTR levels suggested that the ceiling for anion secretion rates was not solely related to the absolute quantity of CFTR present in ciliated cells. Several explanations appeared plausible to account for this observation.</p>
        <p>A first explanation is that transduced CFTR was not trafficked to the apical membrane of CF ciliated cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, this was not the case, as immunofluorescent localization revealed clear targeting of transduced CFTR to apical domains of CF ciliated cells. It is possible, however, that not all correctly trafficked CFTR was inserted into the apical membrane in regions that facilitate function. Certainly, our immunolocalization data suggest CFTR is present in subapical membrane structures likely representing recycling endosomes.</p>
        <p>A second explanation is that overexpression of CFTR resulted in mislocalization of a fraction of CFTR to basolateral membranes of ciliated cells. This event would be predicted to dampen Fsk-induced CFTR responses as suggested for adenovirus-mediated CFTR delivery to airway epithelia <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Farmen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Although CFTR immunoreactivity was restricted to the apical domains of ciliated cells, even when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), we further tested for this possibility by using CFTR<sub>172</sub> as a probe to measure CFTR functional activity in apical and/or basolateral compartments of PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE. Addition of CFTR<sub>172</sub> to apical surfaces 15 min before or during Fsk-induced anion secretion resulted in rapid and complete inhibition of secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, CFTR<sub>172</sub> applied to basolateral surfaces before or during Fsk-induced anion secretion had no effect on Fsk-induced anion secretion, suggesting that no significant functional CFTR was present in the basolateral membranes of ciliated cells.</p>

        <p>A third explanation is that the Fsk responses are limited by the apical membrane driving force for Cl<sup>â</sup> secretion. We tested this possibility by comparing the Fsk responses with PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE (&gt;100-fold increased CFTR) to non-CF HAE (endogenous CFTR levels) with protocols designed to make the electrochemical driving force for Cl<sup>â</sup> secretion nonlimiting (bathing solutions changed from Cl<sup>â</sup> replete [Krebs bicarbonate Ringer, KBR] to Cl<sup>â</sup> deplete [high potassium low chloride, HKLC]). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, Fsk responses in CF HAE overexpressing CFTR and non-CF HAE were similar under conditions of physiological Cl<sup>â</sup> secretory driving forces (KBR). Importantly, when the apical membrane Cl<sup>â</sup> secretory driving force was made large and not limiting by lumenal Cl<sup>â</sup> substitution, Fsk again stimulated similar responses in CF HAE overexpressing CFTR compared to non-CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, HKLC). These observations strongly suggest that overexpressed levels of CFTR do not produce reduction in Cl<sup>â</sup> secretory driving forces that offset the additional quantity of CFTR in the apical membrane and hence buffer the Cl<sup>â</sup> secretion rates. As an additional control, UTP-mediated Cl<sup>â</sup> secretion (via calcium-activated Cl<sup>â</sup> channels) was increased &gt;20-fold in HKLC bathing solution compared to KBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that the maximal anion secretory capacity of cultures had not been reached.</p>
        <p>Collectively, these data suggest that CFTR overexpressed in CF ciliated cells is selectively trafficked to the apical domains of these cells. However, a ceiling of CFTR Cl<sup>â</sup> secretion is reached that approximates that of endogenous CFTR in non-CF HAE. We speculate that this ceiling reflects the limiting requirement of the number of potential apical membrane docking sites for CFTR and/or the limited amount of accessory/regulatory proteins localized at apical membranes of CF cells required for CFTR function. It is likely that CFTR insertion into the apical membranes of ciliated cells is tightly regulated with recycling and replenishment of CFTR governed by CFTR-rich recycling endosomes. To determine whether limited availability of docking sites or accessory proteins was unique to CF ciliated cells, non-CF HAE were inoculated with PIVCFTR and PIVGFP, and Fsk responses compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Overexpression of CFTR in non-CF HAE provided only moderately increased Fsk-mediated Cl<sup>â</sup> secretion compared to cultures inoculated with PIVGFP. Although modest but significant differences in resistance were measured before/after Fsk treatment in mock-treated non-CF HAE, no significant differences in resistance were measured before/after forskolin treatment after PIVCFTR versus PIVGFP inoculations: (Resistances [Î©.cm<sup>2</sup>] before/after Fsk: Mock, 550Â±49/401Â±0.5; PIVGFP, 452Â±39/402Â±0; PIVCFTR, 419Â±12/401Â±0.2; <italic>n</italic>â=â5 for each). Collectively, these data suggest replacement of a corrective <italic>CFTR</italic> gene to CF ciliated cells is the only manipulation required for correction of the CF defect since both CF and non-CF HAE regulate CFTR activity similarly.</p>

The change in <italic>V<sub>t</sub></italic>, in response to the Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker, benzamil (10<sup>â5</sup> M), indicated that Na<sup>+</sup> transport accounted for approximately 40% of the total <italic>V<sub>t</sub></italic> in non-CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, white bars) and approximately 80% of transport in CF HAE (black bars), consistent with a Na<sup>+</sup> hyperabsorptive phenotype for CF airway epithelia. Expression of CFTR, but not GFP, in CF ciliated cells significantly reduced the contribution of CF HAE Na<sup>+</sup> transport to levels measured in non-CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, red bars). These data show that delivery of CFTR to CF ciliated cells restored both Cl<sup>â</sup> secretion and the regulation of Na<sup>+</sup> absorption by CF airway epithelia to normal, non-CF HAE levels. The simplest conclusion drawn from these data is that ENaC and CFTR both reside in ciliated cells in the human airway epithelium.</p>

        <title>CFTR Expression in CF Ciliated Cells Restores Regulation of Apical Surface Hydration</title>
        <p>During these experiments, it was noted that the lumenal surfaces of PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE appeared hydrated compared to the dehydrated surfaces of CF HAE, suggesting that the rebalancing of Na<sup>+</sup> absorption and Cl<sup>â</sup> secretion consequent to delivery of CFTR to ciliated cells restored hydration to the lumenal surfaces of CF HAE. Therefore, we initiated experiments to measure ASL height regulation in CF HAE in the absence or presence of transduced CFTR in ciliated CF cells.</p>
        <p>ASL volume regulation was assessed by measuring ASL height with <italic>XZ</italic>-plane confocal microscopy 48 h after addition of 25 Âµl of PBS to the apical surfaces of CF HAE. In control CF HAE (inoculated with mock or PIVGFP), CF epithelia absorbed almost all fluid from their surfaces, resulting in an ASL height of 3 Âµm, i.e., the minimal space of compacted folded-over cilia and consistent with mucostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Tarran2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, in PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE, ASL height stabilized at approximately 8 Âµm, a height similar to that of non-CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These data show that delivery of CFTR to CF ciliated cells fully restored the regulation of ASL height to levels maintained by non-CF HAE, thus establishing the critical role of CFTR and ciliated cells in ASL height homeostasis.</p>
        <p>We next investigated whether the depletion of ASL over time impaired cilia beat by measuring ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of CF HAE under thin-film conditions. Immediately after addition of 25 Âµl of PBS to the apical surface of CF HAE, CBF was approximately 8 Hz, a value not different than exhibited by non-CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). However, consistent with the decreased ASL height in control CF HAE, effective CBF was reduced 48 h later in CF HAE compared to non-CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, effective CBF was maintained in PIVCFTR-inoculated, but not PIVGFP-inoculated, CF HAE at levels similar to those measured in non-CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These data strongly argue that ineffective cilia beat observed in CF HAE reflects a defect in ASL height regulation, not ciliary function, and restoration of ASL height regulation with PIVCFTR is sufficient to restore effective cilia beat in CF HAE.</p>

        <title>CFTR Expression in CF Ciliated Cells Restores Effective MCT</title>
        <p>A novel feature of the HAE model is the recapitulation of MCT, reflecting coordinated cilia beat that produces rotational flow of mucus over hydrated epithelial apical surfaces <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In CF HAE, the rotational flow is abolished due to ASL depletion, mimicking mucostasis described for CF airways in vivo <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. To determine whether expression of CFTR in CF ciliated cells could prevent mucostasis, CF HAE were inoculated with PIVCFTR, PIVGFP, or mock and, 24 h later, a small bolus of 1-Âµm fluorescent beads added to the apical surfaces and cultures maintained at &gt;95% humidity for 24 h. For control CF HAE, rotational flow of beads was rarely observed at 48 h pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5D, 5Ei, and 5Eii</xref>), i.e., mucostasis occurred. In contrast, PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE exhibited significant rotational flow of beads, indicating that MCT had been restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5D and 5Eiii</xref>). Under these conditions at 48 h pi, PIVCFTR restored approximately 50% of the MCT measured in parallel non-CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5D and 5Eiv</xref>). These data are the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that MCT can be restored to CF airway epithelia by delivering CFTR to ciliated cells, indicating that the cumulative effects of CFTR deficiency on mechanical innate defense can be reversed by this strategy.</p>
        <p>Why MCT was not completely restored to normal levels, especially when ion transport processes and ASL volume regulation were fully corrected, remains to be determined. A possible explanation may relate to potentially subtle cytopathic effects of PIV infection at 48 h pi. To address this possibility, we inoculated non-CF HAE with PIVGFP or PIVCFTR, and assessed MCT 48 h later. PIVGFP decreased MCT to 40Â±3% (<italic>n</italic>â=â5) of normal levels, whereas PIVCFTR decreased MCT to approximately 74Â±11% (<italic>n</italic>â=â5) of normal levels. These data strongly suggest that after 48 h of PIV infection, virus-induced cytopathic events, likely linked to virus replication capacity, limit complete restoration of MCT to non-CF levels.</p>
        <p>Duration of CFTR correction is limited by shedding of PIV-infected ciliated cells. Experiments to determine the duration of PIVCFTR-mediated bioelectric correction showed that significant functional correction was maintained for at least 1 wk with detectable, but decreased, levels of function remaining at 21 d pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Previously, we have shown that PIV-infected ciliated cells are shed from HAE 3â7 d pi by a poorly understood process of extruding infected ciliated cells from the epithelium onto the lumenal surfaces of HAE <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This process likely represents an innate defense function of the epithelium to rid itself of PIV-infected ciliated cells. To confirm that PIV-infected ciliated cells were being shed from the epithelium, we assessed the cellular composition of apical secretions 6 d after PIVGFP inoculation. By morphologic and immunodetection of GFP-positive cells and ciliated cells, we determined that PIV-infected ciliated cells were shed into apical secretions at a rate far exceeding that of natural ciliated cell shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Therefore, the temporally related loss of CFTR functional activity in PIVCFTR-corrected CF HAE likely reflects shedding of infected ciliated cells and suggests that the extent of correction is directly related to the numbers of ciliated cells expressing CFTR. To further explore this relationship, we counted the numbers of PIV-positive cells present in CF HAE over time and show that the loss of PIV-positive ciliated cells paralleled the loss of Cl<sup>â</sup> transport (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g006">Figure 6C to 6A</xref>), suggesting that the magnitude of correction was indeed directly proportional to the number of CF ciliated cells expressing CFTR.</p>

Because PIVCFTR has a lower replication capacity than PIVGFP, we speculate that ciliated cell shedding is related to the rate of virus replication and that identification or generation of PIV vectors with further attenuated replication may provide delivery vectors that prolong functional CFTR correction. Further characterization of the processes involved in PIV-induced ciliated cell shedding from HAE may also provide novel strategies to prolong the lifespan of CFTR-expressing ciliated cells.</p>

        <title>Efficacy of CFTR Correction Is Related to the Number of Surface Epithelial Cells Expressing CFTR</title>
        <p>A central question in CF gene transfer studies has been the efficiency of CFTR delivery required for clinical benefit. For chemical corrector therapies, efficiency reflects the percent increase in CFTR function per cell. With respect to gene transfer studies, when CFTR expression exceeds endogenous levels on a per cell basis, it may be speculated that efficiency reflects the number of cells within the epithelium targeted for CFTR delivery. Given the low endogenous level of CFTR expression in ciliated cells, coupled with high levels of exogenous CFTR expression generated from PIV vectors, we performed dose-effect experiments with PIV designed to ask what percentage of CF surface epithelial cells must be corrected to restore hydration and MCT to the airway surface in CF HAE.</p>
        <p>First, we determined that inoculation of CF HAE with different concentrations of PIVCFTR (range 10<sup>3</sup>â10<sup>6</sup> PFU) resulted in inoculum-dependent increases in the percentage of PIV-positive cells at 24 h pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

        <p>We next used this approach to determine the percentage of cells required to express CFTR to restore normal ASL homeostasis and MCT to CF HAE under thin-film conditions. ASL height and MCT were measured in CF HAE 24 h after inoculation with PIVCFTR at different concentrations. PIVCFTR resulted in concurrent increases in ASL height and MCT rates that were proportional to the percentages of PIV-positive cells, with a plateau occurring at approximately 40% of PIV-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g007">Figure 7E and 7F</xref>). As controls, PIV expressing GFP or <italic>ÎF508CFTR</italic> failed to increase ASL height or MCT rates in CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g007">Figures 7E and 7F</xref>). By comparison of these data to ASL height and MCT measurements in non-CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g007">Figure 7E and 7F</xref>, dashed lines), it was noted that ASL height and MCT rates both plateaued at levels similar to those measured in non-CF HAE, suggesting that normal homeostasis had been reached. We speculate that the plateau levels for ASL height and MCT reflect homeostatic feedback signals within ASL under the thin-film conditions, e.g., ATP release rates that regulate ion channel activity.</p>
        <p>By comparison of data obtained in corrected CF HAE to that in normal non-CF HAE, we calculate that at least 25% of surface epithelial cells (30% of ciliated cells) required CFTR expression to restore ASL height regulation to non-CF HAE levels. For MCT, approximately 40% of cells (50% of ciliated cells) required CFTR expression to approach MCT rates measured in parallel non-CF HAE. These data identify the efficiency of epithelial cell CFTR delivery to restore defective MCT in CF HAE. Of note is the observation that although PIVCFTR was able to restore MCT to nearly normal levels, MCT, unlike ASL height, was not fully restored. This discrepancy is likely related to the cytotoxic effects of PIV infection on MCT, but not ASL measurements. In these experiments, performed 24 h after inoculation, MCT restoration is much improved over that measured at 48 h pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), further suggesting that 48 h, but not 24 h, of infection with this prototypic PIV vector had detrimental effects on MCT. These data, taken together with those indicating that overexpression of CFTR on a per cell basis was not detrimental to ion and fluid transport processes, indicate that gene delivery vectors capable of targeting at least 25% of the surface airway epithelial cells will be sufficient to restore ASL height regulation and MCT to levels comparable to those exhibited in non-CF airway epithelia and that precise regulation of CFTR levels at least in ciliated cells is not required.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Successful gene transfer to CF airways in vivo has been principally hampered by a lack of efficacy due to the inefficiency of gene transfer to human airway epithelium that normally exhibits CFTR function <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Pickles2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1000155-ODea1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Although there is clear evidence that both airway surface and submucosal gland epithelia are dysfunctional in CF, presently, the precise airway regions of the CF lung that require CFTR delivery for restoration of normal physiological function and reduction of disease symptoms are not well established. Although dependent on antibodies used, CFTR has been localized to human ciliated cells <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Kreda1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and the fluid-secreting cells of the submucosal glands <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Previously noted physiologic characteristics of ciliated cells also indicate that ciliated cells function to maintain airway surface hydration <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Cotton1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Certainly, ciliated cells facilitate effective MCT and airway mucus clearance. Together, these properties of ciliated cells combined with the abundance of ciliated cells throughout the human airways make this cell type a logical, although not exclusive, target for CF lung gene delivery strategies.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have shown that PIV-mediated CFTR delivery to ciliated cells is efficient and sufficient for correcting the CF airway epithelium phenotype, i.e., efficient delivery of CFTR to CF human ciliated airway epithelium corrected hallmark characteristics of CF HAE that mimic the initiating events of CF lung disease, i.e., abnormal ASL volume homeostasis and mucostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g007">7</xref>). Abnormal ASL homeostasis in CF airway epithelium is due to dysregulated Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>â</sup> ion transport <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Tarran3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, both consequent to the absence/dysfunction of CFTR at the apical membrane <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Stutts1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Here, we have demonstrated that delivery of CFTR to ciliated cells restores Cl<sup>â</sup> secretion and reduces the Na<sup>+</sup> hyperabsorption characteristic of the CF airway epithelium in vitro and in vivo, providing confirmatory evidence that CFTR functions as both a Cl<sup>â</sup> channel and regulator of ENaC within ciliated cells. Further, we have demonstrated that correction of the ion channel defects of CF HAE restores the integrated physiology required for ASL regulation, which ultimately restores MCT (shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g007">Figure 7G</xref>).</p>
      <p>A critical variable for restoration of CFTR functional activity by PIV is the percentage of cells expressing CFTR. Using CF HAE, we demonstrate that restoration of normal ASL height and MCT required CFTR delivery to approximately 25% and approximately 40% of surface epithelial cells, respectively. We suggest that restoration of ASL height is the most predictive measure for these studies, as PIV clearly exerts cytotoxic effects on MCT, but not ASL measurements. These effects were isolated to MCT, but not ASL, suggesting that virus-mediated cytotoxicity may affect the synchrony of cilia beat, leading to modestly reduced effectiveness of ciliated cells to transport mucus.</p>
      <p>Previous studies with gap junctionâcoupled polarized, but not differentiated, airway epithelial cell lines suggested that approximately 6%â10% of cells required CFTR to correct the Cl<sup>â</sup> transport defect <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Johnson2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, whereas almost all cells (&gt;90%) required CFTR overexpression to correct ENaC hyperabsorption <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Clearly, expression of CFTR in nonciliated airway epithelial cells would be predicted to increase fluid secretion onto the apical surfaces of these cells although these previously published studies did not test this hypothesis. In our studies, we have directly shown that expression of CFTR in 60% of CF ciliated cells fully corrects the ENaC hyperabsorption defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and that CFTR expression in approximately 25% of cells (approximately 30% of ciliated cells) corrects ASL volume homeostasis in CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). With respect to ENaC activity after CFTR delivery, the reasons why our data differ from these previous studies are unclear, but it may be speculated that differentiated human airway epithelium models as used in this current study are more representative and relevant to the required efficiency of CFTR delivery to human airway epithelium in vivo.</p>
      <p>Although our data indicate that CFTR delivery to CF ciliated cells is sufficient for restoring MCT to CF HAE, it is likely that delivery of CFTR to other nonciliated surface epithelial cells may provide functional CFTR activity capable of hydrating the airway surface. At present, we are not aware of gene delivery vectors capable of delivering CFTR exclusively to nonciliated cells of HAE to determine whether CFTR expression in nonciliated cells also restores MCT. In our studies, we have combined the requirement of ciliated cells for generation of MCT with CFTR targeting of CF ciliated cells to restore defective MCT. Since ciliated cells are the predominant airway surface epithelial cell type throughout the human conducting airways, vectors targeting at least ciliated cells may achieve the required efficiency of delivery for restoration of MCT. We propose that targeting at least ciliated cells provides efficient and effective CFTR function that is sufficient for restoration of MCT.</p>
      <p>Our data using an in vitro model of human airway epithelium predict that CFTR delivery to 25% of CF airway epithelial cells will restore MCT to near normal levels. However, it remains to be determined what proportion of normal MCT rates in vivo would be beneficial to CF patients. Tracheal mucus velocities in young smokers are significantly reduced compared to young nonsmokers (3.4 mm/min versus 10.0 mm/min) but without significant differences in lung function, perhaps suggesting that MCT at rates below ânormalâ may be sufficient to maintain pulmonary healthy <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. These in vivo studies measured mucus velocities only in the trachea, whereas CF lung disease likely initiates in the more vulnerable, smaller bronchiolar airway regions. If these regions respond similarly to CFTR delivery, then it is possible that delivering CFTR to fewer than 25% of CF cells may provide sufficient MCT to maintain healthy airways. Further testing of this hypothesis will require appropriate in vivo studies.</p>
      <p>Since PIV infects ciliated airway epithelium of hamsters and human and nonhuman primates, but not those of the murine airways, testing our PIV vectors in vivo in appropriate models is difficult. Additionally, it has been recently reported that expression of human or murine CFTR in ciliated cells of <italic>CFTR<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice failed to correct the nasal epithelium bioelectric defect, although correction was demonstrated in neonatal, but not adult, tracheal epithelium <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Ostrowski1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. One explanation for these results, in contrast to our data, is that murine CFTR expressed in murine ciliated cells may not function correctly. Our study highlights the need to test vectors for CFTR delivery in appropriate human models and that such data obtained from CF mouse models require cautious interpretation. The recent generation of a CF pig model <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000155-Rogers2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> may be beneficial for testing such vector systems, but preliminary data using ciliated airway epithelial cultures derived from porcine trachea suggest that this species is also not infected by the human viruses from which our PIV vectors are generated.</p>
      <p>Using our prototypic PIV vector, we could not determine the lowest limit of CFTR expression on a per cell basis required for correction since this vector significantly overexpressed CFTR relative to endogenous levels. In this regard, because CFTR is critical for regulation of ASL homeostasis, there has been concern that overexpression of CFTR in CF airways would âsupercorrectâ Cl<sup>â</sup> transport and generate excessive fluid secretion. This concern, while reasonable, appears unwarranted based on our observations that ion transport rates and ASL heights in CF HAE after CFTR delivery did not exceed that measured in non-CF HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g005">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000155-g007">7</xref>). These data agree with previously published reports in which CFTR was transgenically overexpressed in mouse airway epithelium without deleterious results in terms of cell or organ toxicity <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Chroneos1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, in this transgenic study, CFTR was overexpressed in Clara cells and alveolar type II cells of the mouse lung, and so our study represents the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of the functional safety of CFTR overexpression in human ciliated cells. Since CFTR overexpression did not supercorrect ASL regulation, we speculate that normal airway epithelium exhibits multiple apical membrane regulatory mechanisms in addition to CFTR levels that prevent excessive secretion of fluid into the airway lumen, i.e., airway flooding.</p>
      <p>Demonstrating that PIV expresses CFTR at levels in excess of those required to restore full function to CF HAE suggests that further attenuation of PIV will be feasible while still providing sufficient CFTR for functional correction. Indeed, the lower replication capacity 10-fold reduction of PIVCFTR compared to PIVGFP, in the context of &gt;100-fold overexpression of CFTR in individual ciliated cells, suggests that further attenuation of PIV will continue to provide sufficient CFTR for correction of the CF MCT defect and possibly further reduce the generation of inflammatory mediators and cytotoxicity associated with our PIV vector prototype. The continued effort to develop vaccines against PIV has generated a wealth of live attenuated recombinant PIV <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> that exhibit attenuated replication. It is interesting to note that PIV3 vaccine candidates have been extensively evaluated after lumenal airway delivery in adults and infants as young as 3 mo <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Karron1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>; an age of CF patients in which CFTR replacement would be desirable.</p>
      <p>The demonstration of efficacious <italic>CFTR</italic> gene delivery to human ciliated airway epithelium overcomes a major hurdle to gene transfer approaches for CF lung disease. Other strategies to improve gene delivery to the human airways are ongoing and are focused on vector development <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Drapkin1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1000155-Zabner1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and/or manipulation of the host tissue <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Parsons1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000155-Coyne1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, the results so far published have not shown significant improvement in the ability to deliver transgenes to human ciliated airway epithelium. Lentiviral-based vectors pseudotyped with Ebola, influenza virus, baculovirus, Sendai, or SARS-CoV envelope proteins efficiently transduce airway epithelial cells in vitro and murine airways in vivo <xref rid="pbio.1000155-Kobinger1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1000155-Yonemitsu1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, suggesting that combining useful envelope glycoproteins with the potential longer duration of gene expression afforded by lentiviruses may provide novel vectors for lung gene transfer strategies. Similar vectors can be envisioned using the glycoproteins of PIV to target lentiviruses to human ciliated airways. However, to date, none of these vector systems have progressed to functional studies after delivery of CFTR to human ciliated airway epithelium, and no demonstration of correction of the CF phenotype (e.g., ASL height or MCT) has been reported.</p>
      <p>Collectively, the studies reported here demonstrate the efficiency of CFTR delivery to human CF ciliated airway epithelium that is sufficient to reverse the CF phenotype of ASL dehydration and mucostasis. Our prototypic PIV vector provides a useful tool for manipulating ciliated cell function and for investigating the future potential of delivering functional CFTR to the airways of CF patients.</p>

        <p>Immunolocalization of PIV F protein was performed on HAE fixed in 4% PFA and immunostained either en face or on paraffin-embedded histological sections. For en face detection, the apical surfaces of HAE were incubated with PIV3 F-specific monoclonal Ab (clone 216.16), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor594 (Invitrogen).
