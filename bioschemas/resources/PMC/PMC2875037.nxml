        <p>Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) plays an important role in the growth and survival of tumor cells. MORC2 is a member of the MORC protein family. The MORC proteins contain a CW-type zinc finger domain and are predicted to have the function of regulating transcription, but no MORC2 target genes have been identified. Here we performed a DNA microarray hybridization and found <italic>CAIX</italic> mRNA to be down-regulated 8-fold when MORC2 was overexpressed. This result was further confirmed by northern and western blot analysis. Our results also showed that the protected region 4 (PR4) was important for the repression function of MORC2. Moreover, MORC2 decreased the acetylation level of histone H3 at the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter. Meanwhile, trichostatin A (TSA) had an increasing effect on <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity. Among the six HDACs tested, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) had a much more prominent effect on <italic>CAIX</italic> repression. ChIP and ChIP Re-IP assays showed that MORC2 and HDAC4 were assembled on the same region of the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter. Importantly, we further confirmed that both proteins are simultaneously present in the PR4-binding complex. These results may contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms of <italic>CAIX</italic> regulation.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), also called MN or G250, is a member of the carbonic anhydrase family that catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide (H<sub>2</sub>O+CO<sub>2</sub>âH<sup>+</sup>+<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkq006i1.jpg"/></inline-formula>) and as such are vital to many biological and physical functions. CAIX is a transmembrane isozyme and has been implicated in the control of tumor cells growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Because CAIX expression correlates with lowered O<sub>2</sub> tension in tumors, CAIX is proposed as an intrinsic marker of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). CAIX may be involved in early gastric carcinogenesis as CAIX deficient mice show increased cellular proliferation and develop gastric hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). And it has been reported that the expression of CAIX correlates with an extremely poor prognosis in gastric adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In human malignancy, overexpression of CAIX is consistently seen in a strikingly high proportion of carcinomas of the cervix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and clear cell carcinoma of the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and, to a lesser degree, in other types of human tumors, such as carcinomas of the breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), head and neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and tumors of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, expression of CAIX is low or even lost in most gastric cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In addition, a subgroup of gastric cancers retain CAIX expression in cancer cells at the invasion front, implying that increased CAIX expression may contribute to invasion and thus advanced disease and tumor progression in a subset of gastric cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Therefore, in order to understand the roles of <italic>CAIX</italic> gene expression in the carcinogenesis and progress of gastric cancer, it is essential to gain a more intensive insight into the expression control of this gene.</p>
      <p>The promoter of <italic>CAIX</italic> gene has been characterized and localized in the region between â173 and +31 bp in respect to the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Hypoxia activates <italic>CAIX</italic> gene transcription through hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which binds to the hypoxia-response element (HRE) in the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter immediately upstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). There are five protected regions (PRs) within the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, of which PR1 and PR2 are the most critical for transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Transcription factors Sp1/Sp3 are described to up-regulate <italic>CAIX</italic> by binding to the PR1 and PR5 position of <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). HIF-1Î± and Sp1, in combination with CBP/p300, are identified as the crucial elements for CAIX expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Although a repressor complex, which directly contacts with PR4, is found to negatively regulate <italic>CAIX</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), the composition of the repressor complex and the repression mechanism remain unknown.</p>
      <p>MORC2 (<underline>m</underline>icr<underline>orc</underline>hidia 2) is a member of the MORC protein family characterized by conserved structures consisting of an ATPase domain, a zinc finger type CW domain, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and coiled-coil domains. There are four predicted MORC family proteins (MORC1, MORC2 [KIAA0852, ZCWCC1], MORC3 [KIAA0136, ZCWCC3, NXP-2] and MORC4 [ZCWCC2]) in human. The MORC family proteins belong to CW-domain-containing subfamilies I (MORC1 and MORC2) or IX (MORC3 and MORC4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). MORC1 is expressed specifically in male germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), whereas MORC2 and MORC3 are ubiquitously expressed. A recent study has showed that MORC3 regulates p53 activity by localization to a nuclear subdomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). And it is reported that MORC4 is a potential biomarker as it is highly expressed in a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p>
      <p>MORC family proteins are conserved in higher eukaryotes, predicting an important function for them in the biology of multicellular organisms, however, few studies have been made to identify the possible molecular function of MORC family proteins. MORC2 contains a CW zinc finger motif and the CW domain is predicted to play a part in DNA binding and/or promoting proteinâprotein interactions, therefore MORC2 may have a role in gene transcriptional regulation. To search for hitherto unidentified MORC2 target genes, we performed a DNA microarray hybridization (affymetrix). We found <italic>CAIX</italic> mRNA to be down-regulated 8-fold when MORC2 was overexpressed. We also confirmed the result by northern and western blot analysis, as well as the luciferase reporter assays. Moreover, we showed that the PR4 in the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter was important for the repression function of MORC2 on <italic>CAIX</italic> transcription. In addition, MORC2 decreased the acetylation level of histone H3 at the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter. Meanwhile, trichostatin A (TSA) had an increasing effect on <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity. Among the six histone deacetylases (HDACs) tested, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) had a much more prominent effect on <italic>CAIX</italic> repression. Finally, we found that MORC2 and HDAC4 were assembled on the same region of <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter. Importantly, we further confirmed that both proteins are simultaneously present in the PR4-binding complex. These data provide a basis for the further investigation into the mechanisms of <italic>CAIX</italic> gene regulation.</p>

        <title>Plasmids construction</title>
        <p>For the construction of <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-E-CP, the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter fragment comprising â173 to +31 bp was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA with sense primer 5â²-GTATTCGGGGTACCACCTGCCCCTCACTCC-3â² and antisense primer 5â²-ATCGAGGAAGATCTGGGTGTGTCCCAGCAC-3â². The amplified fragment was digested with <italic>Kpn</italic>I/<italic>Bgl</italic>II and inserted into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Enhancer (Promega). A series of 5â²-deleted constructs were derived from pGL3-E-CP by PCR. The sense primers were 5â²-GTATTCGGGGTACCCTTTGGTATGGGGGAGA-3â² (pGL3-E-C5, â132 to +31 bp), 5â²-GTATTCGGGGTACCGGAGAGGGCACAGGGCCA-3â² (pGL3-E-C4, â107 to +31 bp), 5â²-GTATTCGGGGTACCCTGTGAGACTTTGGCTCC-3â² (pGL3-E-C3, â71 to +31 bp), 5â²-GTATTCGGGGTACCGGCTTGCTCCTCCCCCAC-3â² (pGL3-E-C2, â45 to +31 bp) and 5â²-GTATTCGGGGTACCCACGTACAGCCCGTACAC-3â² (pGL3-E-C1, â8 to +31 bp). The antisense primer was the same as that used for pGL3-E-CP construction. For the construction of pcDNA3.1/MORC2, pcDNA3.1/MORC1 and pcDNA3.1/MORC3, human MORC2, MORC1 and MORC3 cDNA were obtained from NIH-MGC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov">http://mgc.nci.nih.gov</ext-link>) (Invitrogen) by PCR. The primers were as follows: MORC2 sense primer 5â²-ATAGATATTTAGGTACCAAGACGAGAG-3â², MORC2 antisense primer 5â²-CGACCACCAACTCGAGAATGAAG-3â², MORC1 sense primer 5â²-GTCTACGGGATCCATGGACGACAGGTACCCT-3â², MORC1 antisense primer 5â²-CGGGTCGACTCGAGTTAATTTTCCGAAGTCTT-3â², MORC3 sense primer 5â²-GTCTACGGGATCCATGGCGGCGCAGCCACC-3â² and MORC3 antisense primer 5â²-CGGGTCGACTCGAGTTAAGTACTACTGATTTC-3â². The amplified MORC2 fragment was digested with <italic>Kpn</italic>I/<italic>Xho</italic>I and inserted into pcDNA3.1/HisA plasmid (Invitrogen). The amplified MORC1 and MORC3 fragments were digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI/<italic>Xho</italic>I and inserted into pcDNA3.1/HisC plasmid (Invitrogen), respectively. All plasmids were confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing analysis. Plasmids expressing human HDAC1-6 (fused to the Flag-epitope) were kind gifts from Dr E. Seto (H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA).</p>

        <title>Cell culture, transfections and luciferase assays</title>
        <p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, human gastric cancer cell lines, BGC-823, MGC-803, SGC-7901, human colorectal cancer cell lines LS174T and Clone A were grown in DMEM (Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium) containing 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Transient and stable transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. For stable transfections, SGC-7901 cells were transfected with the recombinant vector pcDNA3.1/MORC2 or the empty (control) vector pcDNA3.1/HisA. Geneticin (800 Î¼g/ml) (Invitrogen) was used to select for stable clones. For transient transfections, cells were cotransfected with the listed constructs. After 24 h of transfections, cells were harvested, washed and lysed in 50â200 Î¼l of lysis buffer. Luciferase activities were analyzed using a Promega dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase control. Relative luciferase activity was analyzed using the luminometer Lumat LB 9507 (Berthold Technologies, Germany). All the results represent the means Â± SD based on at least three independent experiments.</p>

        <title>Total RNA isolation and northern blot analysis</title>
        <p>Total cellular RNA was extracted using a total RNA isolation system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Twenty microgram of total RNA was fractionated in a 1.2% agaroseâformaldehyde gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences). The probes of <italic>CAIX</italic> and <italic>MORC2</italic> cDNA labeled with [Î±-<sup>32</sup>P] dCTP were used in hybridization. rRNAs (28S and 18S) were used to assess the integrity of the RNA. The blots were routinely reprobed with human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA for RNA loading and transfer control.</p>

        <title>Protein isolation and western blot analysis</title>
        <p>Cells were lysed using ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer [50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA and protease inhibitor cocktail] for 15 min at 4Â°C. Total cell extracts were obtained by sonication and centrifugation. Equal amounts of denatured proteins were separated by SDSâPAGE (10% gels) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The samples were incubated with anti-MORC2 (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.), anti-His (GenScript), anti-CAIX (Santa Cruz) or anti-GAPDH (Kang Chen, as a loading control) antibodies. The samples were detected using the chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce Technology).</p>

        <title>Gene silencing</title>
        <p>Silencing of <italic>MORC2</italic> was achieved with an RNA interference (RNAi) approach using small interfering RNA (siRNA) for transient knockdown. The target sequences for <italic>MORC2</italic> were 5â²-GAAAGCAGAGCACGTAGCAAGGATT-3â² and 5â²-GAAGAAGACAGAGTCACCCATCAAA-3â². BGC-823 cells were transfected with 50 nM of either <italic>MORC2</italic> siRNAs or non-silencing siRNA (as a negative control) (Shanghai GeneChem Co. Ltd) using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer.</p>

        <title>Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR</title>
        <p>Total RNA (1 Î¼g) was reverse transcribed to cDNA in a total volume of 20 Î¼l using a RT (reverse transcriptase) reaction kit (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI 7500Â® real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturerâs instruction and SYBRÂ® Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) as a DNA-specific fluorescent dye. PCR was carried out for 40 cycles of 95Â°C for 10 s and 60Â°C for 40 s. Primer sequences for detection of <italic>CAIX</italic> mRNA expression were synthesized as 5â²-AGATGAGAAGGCAGCACAGAA-3â² (sense) and 5â²-GAAGTGGCATAATGAGCAGGA-3â² (antisense). Primer pairs for detection of <italic>MORC2</italic> mRNA expression were synthesized as 5â²-TCGGAAGCGGAGTGTC-3â² (sense) and 5â²- CGTGCAGCCCTTTATCT-3â² (antisense). The primers used for analysis of <italic>Î²-actin</italic> mRNA were: 5â²-TCGTGCGTGACATTAAGGAG-3â² (sense) and 5â²-ATGCCAGGGTACATGGTGGT-3â² (antisense). All the reactions were repeated at least three times. Gene expression levels were calculated relative to the housekeeping gene <italic>Î²-actin</italic> by using ABI 7500Â® System SDS software.</p>

        <title>ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) and ChIP Re-IP</title>
        <p>Transfected SGC-7901 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (final concentration) after washing. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer [50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS and protease inhibitor cocktail] and sonicated on ice, then precleared with protein A-agarose.

        <title>MORC2 down-regulates the mRNA and protein levels of <italic>CAIX</italic></title>
        <p>The MORC proteins are predicted to have the function of regulating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), but no MORC2 target genes have been identified. To search for hitherto unidentified MORC2 target genes, we carried out stable transfection experiment. SGC-7901 cells, which had low endogenous MORC2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1/MORC2 plasmid. Then we performed a DNA microarray hybridization experiment using RNA from the two stable-transfected cell lines and found a lot of MORC2 target genes, most of them were down-regulated. The genes were involved in a variety of biological functions including ion transport, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, response to hypoxia, etc. <italic>CAIX</italic> is one of the genes which are down-regulated markedly. In order to examine whether MORC2 expression is relative to the expression of CAIX in different colorectal and gastric cancer cell lines, we carried out northern and western blot analysis. Total mRNA was isolated and equal amounts of mRNA were subjected to northern blot analysis. The endogenous mRNA level of <italic>MORC2</italic> was high in CloneA, LS174T and BGC-823 cells, in which <italic>CAIX</italic> mRNA level was obviously low. Whereas in SGC-7901 cells, which did not express detectable level of <italic>MORC2</italic> mRNA, the endogenous <italic>CAIX</italic> mRNA level was distinctly high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). We performed western blot analysis using the same cell lines as used in the northern blot analysis. The result showed that the protein levels of MORC2 and CAIX in these cells were similar to their mRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Then we confirmed the MORC2-dependent decrease of the <italic>CAIX</italic> mRNA and protein levels by northern and western blot analysis, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D). These data suggested that MORC2 down-regulated the expression of CAIX. In order to know whether other MORC family members have the same repressive effect on CAIX expression, we carried out western blot analysis and found that ectopic expressed MORC1 also down-regulated CAIX expression. But MORC3 did not down-regulate the expression of CAIX obviously.

        <title>MORC2 down-regulates <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity, mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner</title>
        <p>In order to elucidate whether the decrease in <italic>CAIX</italic> mRNA is dependent on MORC2 as a regulator of transcription, we examined the regulation of the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter. As a reporter, we used the â173 to +31 fragment of the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene. This region has been shown to be sufficient for the transcriptional induction of <italic>CAIX</italic> gene in MaTu and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). MGC-803 cells were transfected with the pGL3-E-CP reporter construct and increasing amounts of MORC2 expression vector. The results showed that MORC2 down-regulated <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). To test the expression of MORC2 after the transfection, we carried out western blot analysis, at the same time, <italic>CAIX</italic> mRNA and protein levels were also examined. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C, with increasing amounts of MORC2 expression plasmid transfected, the mRNA and protein levels of <italic>CAIX</italic> were decreased. We also performed RT-PCR, real-time PCR and western blot analysis in SGC-7901 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of <italic>CAIX</italic> were reduced with the ectopic MORC2 expression level enhancing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D and E). In sum, these results show that MORC2 is able to down-regulate the expression of <italic>CAIX</italic> in a dose-dependent manner.

        <title>Specific knockdown of <italic>MORC2</italic> increases <italic>CAIX</italic> expression</title>
        <p>To further address the down-regulation of <italic>CAIX</italic> by MORC2, we tested whether specific knockdown of <italic>MORC2</italic> increased <italic>CAIX</italic> expression. BGC-823 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting <italic>MORC2</italic> or non-silencing control. After 24 h of transfection, northern and western blot analysis were carried out to detect the expression of <italic>MORC2</italic> and <italic>CAIX</italic> using these cells. The effective knockdown of <italic>MORC2</italic> enhanced the mRNA level of <italic>CAIX</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), western blot analysis showed the specific knockdown of <italic>MORC2</italic> increased the protein level of <italic>CAIX</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). We also performed luciferase assays to detect the promoter activity of <italic>CAIX</italic> after the expression of MORC2 was knockdown. The result showed that after the specific knockdown of MORC2, the promoter activity of <italic>CAIX</italic> was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). All these observations indicate that specific knockdown of <italic>MORC2</italic> increases <italic>CAIX</italic> expression.

        <title>The PR4 in the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter is important for the suppression function of MORC2 on <italic>CAIX</italic> transcription</title>
        <p>Five PRs within the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), to determine which regions are required for the suppression function of MORC2 on <italic>CAIX</italic> transcription, a series of luciferase reporter constructs containing 5â²-flanking deletions of the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) and transiently transfected into BGC-823 cells. Luciferase activities generated from these constructs upon transfection were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B. Compared to deletion to â132, the deletion to â107 had an increased luciferase activity, implying that PR4 was a negative regulatory element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), which is consistent with the obvious observation of another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Our attention was focused on the association of the negative element PR4 with the MORC2-mediated decreasing of <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity. Therefore, we carried out luciferase assays to test the effect of PR4 on the <italic>CAIX</italic> transcriptional inhibition by MORC2. We used the same luciferase reporters as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A. Significant decrease of <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity was observed in pGL3-E-CP and pGL3-E-C5 constructs, but not in pGL3-E-C4, pGL3-E-C3, pGL3-E-C2 and pGL3-E-C1, which had not the PR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). We therefore conclude that the PR4 region plays an important role in the suppression function of MORC2 on <italic>CAIX</italic> transcription.

        <title>Histone deacetylation is involved in the <italic>CAIX</italic> transcriptional repression</title>
        <p>Histone deacetylation is one of the best-characterized covalent modifications associated with a repressed chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In order to detect the influence of MORC2 on the acetylation level of histone H3 at the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, ChIP assay was carried out. The chromatin fragments from SGC-7901 cells transfected with MORC2 expression plasmid or pcDNA3.1 empty vector were immunoprecipitated with antibody against acetylated histone H3. Following the isolation of precipitated DNA, the â173 to +31 region of the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter was amplified. The result showed that the acetylation level of histone H3 was markedly decreased by the transfection of <italic>MORC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Furthermore, inhibition of HDAC activity by TSA, a known HDAC inhibitor, resulted in the elevation of <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, compare column 3 with 1). Thus, the activity of <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter was associated with HDACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). We performed the same experiment in two cell lines, HEK-293 cells and BGC-823 cells, and obtained similar result as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). These data strongly suggest that HDACs play important roles in the <italic>CAIX</italic> transcriptional repression. We further tested the effects of the six HDACs (HDAC1-6) on <italic>CAIX</italic> gene regulation. We transfected the pGL3-E-CP plasmid together with the empty vector or the HDAC constructs expressing HDAC1-6, respectively. After 24 h of transfection, luciferase activities were measured and normalized to <italic>Renilla</italic> activity. The result was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, which indicated that the six HDACs tested exerted distinct repressive effects on the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity, among which HDAC4 had a much more prominent effect on <italic>CAIX</italic> repression, bringing about a nearly 3-fold repression of the promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). To further investigate how the endogenous mRNA level of <italic>CAIX</italic> was affected by MORC2 and HDAC4, we performed RT-PCR and real-time PCR experiments. The results showed that HDAC4 was able to inhibit <italic>CAIX</italic> mRNA level independently and cumulatively with MORC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). We performed additional luciferase assays with HDAC4 expression plasmid and <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter deletion constructs used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E, obvious decrease of <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity was exhibited only in pGL3-E-CP and pGL3-E-C5 constructs, which had the PR4 region. The result indicates that HDAC4 probably also works through the PR4 element similar to MORC2. All these data demonstrate that histone deacetylation is involved in the <italic>CAIX</italic> transcriptional inhibition and PR4 plays an important role in the <italic>CAIX</italic> transcriptional repression by HDAC4.

        <title>HDAC4 and MORC2 act in a combinatorial fashion on the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter</title>
        <p>In an attempt to test the binding of MORC2 or HDAC4 to the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, we performed two ChIP assays. SGC-7901 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector or pcDNA3.1/MORC2 expression plasmid, ChIP was carried out using antibody against MORC2, followed by PCR with primers specific for the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter region. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, binding of MORC2 was detected at the â173 to +31 region in the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, but not the more up- or down-stream region of the <italic>CAIX</italic> gene. For another ChIP experiment, SGC-7901 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector or Flag-HDAC4 expression plasmid, the chromatin fragments from these cells were immunoprecipitated with antibody against Flag. Following the isolation of precipitated DNA, the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter were amplified. The result showed that HDAC4 was associated with the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, but not the more up- or down-stream region of the <italic>CAIX</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). To further examine whether MORC2 and HDAC4 were assembled on the same promoter, ChIP Re-IP assays were carried out. We divided the soluble chromatin derived from MORC2 and Flag-HDAC4 cotransfected or pcDNA3.1 transfected cells into two aliquots. One was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody followed by release of the immune complexes and reimmunoprecipitated (Re-IP) with anti-MORC2 antibody. The other was first immunoprecipitated with anti-MORC2 antibody followed by release and Re-IP with anti-Flag antibody. The same Re-IP was also performed on the unbound supernatant fractions from the primary immunoprecipitation. While both Flag and MORC2 antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter (â173/+31) after cells were cotransfected with MORC2 and HDAC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C), subsequent supernatant Re-IPs with either MORC2 antibody or Flag antibody were unable to do so. On the other hand, subsequent Re-IPs of the eluted primary immunoprecipitates were able to bind the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter (â173/+31) (âboundâ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C showed that both HDAC4 and MORC2 were bound to the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, apparently in the same complex. In order to show the specificity of such a co-interaction, we performed ChIP Re-IP assay with HDAC2 and MORC2. The result showed that HDAC2 neither bound the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter nor interacted with MORC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). These experiments support a model in which MORC2 and HDAC4 act in a combinatorial fashion on the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter.

        <title>MORC2 binds to HDAC4 and both of them bind to the PR4 region of the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter</title>
        <p>To test whether MORC2 could physically interact with HDAC4, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding study was done using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripted and translated full-length MORC2 and GST-tagged full-length HDAC4. The results indicated that MORC2 bound to the full-length HDAC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). To confirm the binding of MORC2 and HDAC4 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we carried out immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis. We transfected HEK-293 cells with His-tagged MORC2 and GFP-tagged HDAC4 or GFP empty vector. The results indicated that MORC2 and HDAC4 were in the same complex <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). To identify whether both MORC2 and HDAC4 bound to the PR4 region, PR4 oligonucleotides were synthesized and labeled with biotin as the probe. Nuclear extracts from BGC-823 cells were used. The results showed that PR4 probe formed a complex with nuclear extracts. The complex was competed by 50-, 100- or 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled PR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Further studies showed that the complex formed was super-shifted with anti-MORC2 or anti-HDAC4 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). PR4 probe also formed a complex with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripted and translated MORC2 protein. The complex was also competed by 50- or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled PR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). The complex was also super-shifted by antibody specific to MORC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>MORC2 belongs to the MORC protein family. Although the biological functions of MORC proteins have remained poorly understood, studies of the prokaryotic MORCs and their relatives suggest that their eukaryotic counterparts are likely to carry out chromatin remodeling function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). MORC2 contains a CW zinc finger motif and the CW domain is predicted to play a part in DNA binding and/or promoting proteinâprotein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), therefore MORC2 may have a role in gene transcriptional regulation. The main contribution of this study is the demonstration of the involvement of MORC2 and histone deacetylase 4 in transcriptional control of <italic>CAIX</italic> gene in gastric cancer cells.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have concentrated on <italic>CAIX</italic> gene regulation in non-gastric cancer cells, such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells, breast carcinoma MCF-7 and osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), and focused on the identification of <italic>cis-</italic>acting elements and their cognate transcription factors (cofactors) that activated <italic>CAIX</italic> gene. Six <italic>cis-</italic>acting elements were functionally characterized in the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, they are HRE and five PRs, among which five have a positive and one has a negative influence on promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). HRE is a positive regulatory element, which activated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Two of the positive <italic>CAIX cis</italic>-acting elements, PR1 and PR5, bind Sp1/Sp3 factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19â21</xref>). The PR2 and PR3 are also positive regulatory elements, which bind AP1 and proteins from nuclear extracts respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Although the PR4 has a negative effect on the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity, the presumed repressor binding PR4 has not been identified. In the present study, the transcriptional regulation of <italic>CAIX</italic> gene in gastric cancer cells was examined. We found that MORC2 repressed the mRNA and protein levels, as well as the promoter activity of <italic>CAIX</italic> in a dose-dependent manner in gastric cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). And this result was also proved by the specific knockdown of MORC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The luciferase assays using the deletion mutants showed that the PR4 region was important for the suppression function of MORC2 on <italic>CAIX</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of CpG sites in the proximity of promoters and/or post-translational modifications of histones, play a significant role in the control of gene expression, presumably by limiting access of transcription factors to <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements. Histone deacetylation is one of the best-characterized covalent modifications associated with a repressed chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The methylation status of the â74 and â6 CpG sites in the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter has been reported to negatively correlate with <italic>CAIX</italic> expression in renal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32 B33">30â33</xref>), but no one has studied the histone acetylation status at the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter. The study presented here showed that the acetylation level of histone H3 was markedly decreased by the overexpression of MORC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Thus, we presumed that histone deacetylase participated in the regulation of <italic>CAIX</italic> gene transcription. And this presumption was further supported by the result that inhibition of HDAC activity by TSA resulted in the elevation of <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, compare column 3 with 1).</p>
      <p>Among the six human HDACs tested in the present study, HDAC4 was found to be much more effective in suppressing the transcriptional activity of the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). HDAC1-6 represents the enzymes belonging to two different classes, which have distinct features in structure and exert different functions. Compared with Class I members, Class II HDACs, including HDAC4, 5, 6 and 7, display more specific responses to various signaling molecules. Such specificities allow specific target genes to be regulated by individual Class II HDAC members in a type-specific pattern. We have demonstrated that over-expression of HDAC4 resulted in markedly reduction of <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter activity and mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D), suggesting that members of Class II HDACs might be more effective in inhibiting transcription of the <italic>CAIX</italic> gene.</p>
      <p>As co-repressors, HDACs require specific transcription factors for recruiting them to target DNA elements for regulatory functions. In this study, we showed that both of MORC2 and HDAC4 were associated with the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter by ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). We also described experimental results to show that MORC2 and HDAC4 were assembled on the same promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). We performed additional ChIP Re-IP experiment to prove the specificity of such a co-interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). In addition, the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction of MORC2 and HDAC4 was confirmed by GST-pull down and IP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and B). Furthermore, we performed EMSA with PR4 and proved by super-shift that both proteins were simultaneously present in the PR4-binding complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C and D). HDAC4 is often found to form multisubunit complex with other corepressors, such as N-CoR etc, to regulate the transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Our findings indicated that MORC2 and HDAC4 were in the inhibitory complex to suppress the expression of the <italic>CAIX</italic> gene. Further studies are needed to identify other corepressors which might form a complex with HDAC4 to inhibit the transcription of the <italic>CAIX</italic> gene. Based on the previous knowledge, as well as findings from this study, we propose a hypothesized model in which MORC2 binds the PR4 in the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, and recruits HDAC4 that decreases the acetylation level of histone H3 at the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, leading to a closed chromatin structure and thus the transcriptional repression of <italic>CAIX</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).
<fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Proposed model showing roles of MORC2 and HDAC4 in regulation of the <italic>CAIX</italic> gene. MORC2 binds the protected region 4 in the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, and recruits HDAC4 that decreases the acetylation level of histone H3 at the <italic>CAIX</italic> promoter, leading to a closed chromatin structure and thus the transcriptional repression of <italic>CAIX</italic> gene.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkq006f8"/></fig></p>
      <p>The exact molecular mechanisms of gastric tumorigenesis are still unclear. The studies in <italic>CAIX</italic> knockout mice have indicated that CAIX is an important factor in gastric morphogenesis and homeostasis of the gastric epithelium possibly acting through the control of cell differentiation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported that the expression of CAIX correlates with an extremely poor prognosis in gastric adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). CAIX was highly expressed in the normal gastric mucosa and the expression declined in carcinomas with less differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Till now, few studies have been given to clarification the mechanisms of <italic>CAIX</italic> expression regulation in gastric cancer cells. Our findings may help to achieve a better understanding of the <italic>CAIX</italic> expression control in gastric cancer cells.</p>
