      <abstract>
        <p>The ether Ã  go-go family of voltage-gated potassium channels is structurally distinct. The N terminus contains an eag domain (eagD) that contains a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain that is preceded by a conserved sequence of 25â27 amino acids known as the PAS-cap. The C terminus contains a region with homology to cyclic nucleotide binding domains (cNBHD), which is directly linked to the channel pore. The human EAG1 (hEAG1) channel is remarkably sensitive to inhibition by intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) through binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin to three sites adjacent to the eagD and cNBHD. Here, we show that the eagD and cNBHD interact to modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin as well as voltage-dependent gating. Sustained elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> resulted in an initial profound inhibition of hEAG1 currents, which was followed by a phase when current amplitudes partially recovered, but activation gating was slowed and shifted to depolarized potentials. Deletion of either the eagD or cNBHD abolished the inhibition by Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>. However, deletion of just the PAS-cap resulted in a &gt;15-fold potentiation in response to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>. Mutations of residues at the interface between the eagD and cNBHD have been linked to human cancer. Glu-600 on the cNBHD, when substituted with residues with a larger volume, resulted in hEAG1 currents that were profoundly potentiated by Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> in a manner similar to the ÎPAS-cap mutant. These findings provide the first evidence that eagD and cNBHD interactions are regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating and indicate that the binding of the PAS-cap with the cNBHD is required for the closure of the channels upon CaM binding.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ether Ã  go-go potassium channel family (KCNH)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> of voltage-gated potassium channels consists of three subgroups, ether Ã  go-go (EAG), EAG-related gene (ERG), and EAG-like potassium (ELK) channels. In recent years, most of the focus has been on the ERG subfamily because of their crucial role in cardiac repolarization (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Relatively less is known about the physiological role of EAG channels. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where EAG channels were first discovered, the behavioral mutant (eag) causes spontaneous repetitive action potential (AP) firing in motor neurons and increased transmitter release that results in flight muscle paralysis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In mammals, EAG channel expression is normally restricted to the central nervous system, particularly the hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain stem (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Recently, a role for EAG channels in regulating presynaptic calcium and neurotransmitter release during high frequency trains of APs has been demonstrated in mouse cerebellar synapses (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). hEAG1 and hEAG2 channels are also aberrantly overexpressed in human cancers. hEAG1 is highly expressed in &gt;75% of non-CNS cancers (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">â</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and hEAG2 in a substantial subset of patients with medulloblastomas (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>hEAG1 channels are exquisitely sensitive to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, with a half-maximal inhibition at â¼100 n<sc>m</sc> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Regulation of ion channels by Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is critical for converting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals into electrical signals (<italic>e.g.</italic> slow and fast after hyperpolarizations), for altering the balance of ionic currents during APs, and for modulating membrane excitability. It is likely that Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> regulation of EAG1 channels exerts a feedback function that is important for long term effects in neuronal signaling (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">â</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Because Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is also important during the cell cycle, Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> regulation of hEAG1 channels may also be functionally important in cell proliferation and cancer progression (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>
      <p>Like other voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels, the central pore of KCNH channels is formed by the tetrameric assembly of S5âS6 helices and is surrounded by voltage sensor domains formed by S1âS4. The N terminus of hEAG1 contains an eag domain (eagD), which is unique to the KCNH channel family and contains a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) homology domain. PAS domains are structural folds that mediate protein-protein interactions in a variety of signaling proteins (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In KCNH channels, the PAS domain is preceded by a highly conserved sequence of 25â27 amino acids that has become known as the PAS-cap (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). NMR studies reveal that the first part of the PAS-cap is disordered, whereas the second half contains a stable amphipathic Î±-helix (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">â</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Both segments have been shown to be important for gating of hEAG1 and hERG1 channels (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">â</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The C terminus of the KCNH channel family contains a cyclic nucleotide binding homology domain (cNBHD) that is structurally similar to the cyclic nucleotide binding domains of CNG and HCN channels (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">â</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, KCNH channels lack key residues for cyclic nucleotide binding and are not directly regulated by cAMP or cGMP (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Instead, the functional role of the KCNH cNBHD appears to be to regulate channel gating through interactions with the eagD (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">â</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The cNBHD is connected to the S6 inner helix of the pore by a region of â¼60 amino acids known as the C-linker, providing a mechanism for coupling conformational changes in the cNBHD to changes in gating of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>The mechanism and structural basis for regulation of hEAG1 channels by Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> are largely unknown. Elegant studies by Schonherr <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and Ziechner <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) demonstrated that calmodulin (CaM) is the Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> sensor and inhibits hEAG1 currents by binding to the channels in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Three CaM binding domains (BD) have been identified using <italic>in vitro</italic> assays; two are on the C terminus close to the cNBHD (BD-C1, 674â683, and BD-C2, 711â721) and one is on the N terminus close to the eagD (BD-N, 151â165). GST fusion proteins containing BD-N or BD-C2 bind CaM in a strong Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). F151N/L154N mutations of BD-N and F714S/F717S mutations of BD-C2 reduce the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM by â¼20- and 6-fold, respectively, in isolated channel fragments and also substantially reduce the CaM-dependent inhibition of functional channels in excised patches (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The binding affinity of BD-C1 for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM seems to be much weaker, but nevertheless, biochemical and functional studies suggest it plays a role, perhaps as part of a complex involving BD-C2 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>
      <p>Analysis of the secondary structure of hEAG1 channels reveals that all the CaM-binding sites are located adjacent to the eagD and cNBHD. Given the importance of these structural domains for regulating voltage-dependent gating, we hypothesized that interactions between the eagD and cNBHD could also be critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-dependent regulation of hEAG1. In this study we show that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-dependent regulation is more complex than previously described. Elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> results in an initial profound inhibition, which is followed by a second phase not previously reported, during which current amplitudes begin to recover, although activation gating is profoundly slowed and shifted to depolarized potentials. Deleting either the eag domain or cNBHD completely abolishes calcium sensitivity. Intriguingly, deletion of just the PAS-cap (residues 2â26) results in a paradoxical increase of current in response to elevated intracellular calcium, which is mimicked by specific cNBHD mutations. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel role for the eagD and cNBHD in coupling Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM binding to closure of the channel pore. Furthermore, they suggest that hEAG1 channels undergo multiple conformational changes in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM binding and that the PAS-cap is required to stabilize the closed conformation.</p>

            <title>Wild-type hEAG1 Channels Undergo Two Distinct Phases of Inhibition in Response to Elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub></title>
            <p>To characterize the response of wild-type hEAG1 currents to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, oocytes were voltage-clamped, and 2-s voltage steps to +60 mV were applied repetitively at 10-s intervals from a holding potential of â90 mV. hEAG1 currents were characterized by relatively slow activation. To elevate Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore, ionomycin (I), and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (T), were applied. hEAG1 currents were initially profoundly inhibited by bath application of 5 Î¼<sc>m</sc> I and T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>Ai</italic>). Mean maximal inhibition was 74.3 Â± 2.3%, and mean time to maximal inhibition was 86.7 Â± 7.2 s (<italic>n</italic> = 21). After the initial inhibition, the hEAG1 current slowly started to increase in amplitude to a mean level after 300 s of 43 Â± 4% of the control current amplitude, despite the continued presence of I and T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Fluorescence imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes by confocal microscopy revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> was rapidly elevated by I and T. A ring-shaped fluorescence pattern was observed as a result of the light-absorbing properties of the oocyte yolk sac and thus the loss of signal from the deeper central portion of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). Importantly, cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was sustained at a high level, which we estimate to be â¼1 Î¼<sc>m</sc> (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). In most cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fluorescence reached a plateau and did not decline in the sustained presence of I and T. These results strongly suggest that the slow recovery of the hEAG1 current is not due to Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> returning to resting levels.</p>

            <p>The current observed with sustained application of I and T was characterized by very slow activation kinetics. Mean <italic>t</italic><sub>10â80%</sub> at +60 mV was 1201 Â± 93 ms, which was significantly longer than control values of 422 Â± 25 ms (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>n</italic> = 8). Like the control current, it was profoundly blocked by 50 Î¼<sc>m</sc> astemizole, a well characterized hEAG channel blocker. <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes are known to express Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>-activated Cl<sup>â</sup> currents, but these are unlikely to significantly contribute to the outward currents at +60 mV in our low Cl<sup>â</sup> recording solutions as the driving force for Cl<sup>â</sup> flux was small (â¼10 mV). Outward Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>-activated currents were also negligible in un-injected or water-injected oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>Aiii</italic>). Furthermore, although I- and T-dependent inward tail currents were observed in many cells at the â90 mV holding potential (when Cl<sup>â</sup> driving force is â¼160 mV), these rapidly declined, whereas the hEAG1 current increased. We excluded data from cells with inward tail currents greater than 1 Î¼A to further minimize the potential for contamination of hEAG1 currents.</p>
            <p>Representative traces of hEAG1 currents measured in response to an I-V protocol in control solution and after &gt;300 s in I and T are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>. In control solution, hEAG1 currents were activated at potentials positive to â40 mV. Conductance reached a peak at +60 mV and exhibited a small decrease at more positive potentials, consistent with a small amount of inactivation that has been described by others (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In comparison, the activation threshold for currents in I and T was shifted to depolarized potentials (positive to â20 mV), and the currents were far slower to activate and showed no rectification. The mean relationships for voltage dependence of isochronal activation in control and I and T solutions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>. Activation was shifted by +29 mV (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>n</italic> = 6, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Qualitatively similar responses were observed with 2 Î¼<sc>m</sc> lysophosphatidic acid (data not shown), which stimulates G<sub>q</sub>-coupled receptors and thus increases cytosolic calcium through inositol trisphosphate-dependent release from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Taken together, these results reveal a multiphasic response of WT hEAG1 currents to I and T, consisting of an initial rapid inhibition, followed by a second delayed phase during which current amplitudes start to increase, but activation is slowed and shifted to depolarized potentials by a Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>-dependent stabilization of the closed state.</p>

            <title>hEAG1 Inhibition by Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> Is CaM-mediated</title>
            <p>Additional experiments were performed to confirm that the observed responses to I and T were Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM mediated. First, we examined the effect of buffering Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> with 5 m<sc>m</sc> EGTA. Currents were first recorded under control conditions and then, while the oocyte was still voltage-clamped, EGTA was injected into the cell via a micropipette, and the response to I and T was recorded. With EGTA present, the current amplitudes were slightly increased rather than being inhibited by I and T, and there were no significant changes in the <italic>V</italic><sub>0.5</sub> and slope values for the voltage dependence of activation (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 5). To investigate whether the inhibition of WT hEAG1 was dependent on CaM binding to the channels, we tested the effect of I and T on mutants that reduce the binding affinity of CaM to either BD-N or BD-C2 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), the high affinity CaM-binding sites. The BD-C1 site binds CaM in the micromolar range and was not included. The F714S/F717S BD-C2 mutant displayed similar gating to WT hEAG1 under control conditions but showed considerably attenuated responses to I and T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>). There was an initial small inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>D</italic> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), but the current then quickly rebounded to control amplitudes, and the effect on <italic>t</italic><sub>10â80%</sub> activation at +60 mV (271 Â± 74, <italic>n</italic> = 6) was significantly reduced (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) compared with WT hEAG (820 Â± 77, <italic>n</italic> = 8). The shift in isochronal activation was +13 mV, which was significantly smaller than for WT hEAG1 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005). Interestingly, the F151N/L154N BD-N mutations had quite a different effect compared with BD-C2 mutations. The voltage dependence of activation was +47 mV more positive than WT hEAG1 in control solution, suggesting that CaM binding at this site influences channel function at basal/resting Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> levels. The <italic>t</italic><sub>10â80%</sub> activation at +60 mV was also faster than WT hEAG (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The time course of the response to I and T was also profoundly different. There was no initial fast component of inhibition as observed in WT hEAG1, and instead inhibition developed slowly and progressively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>D</italic>), without there being any marked slowing of time-dependent activation kinetics. The voltage dependence of activation was shifted too positive to quantify <italic>V</italic><sub>0.5</sub> during I and T, but the threshold for activation was 50 mV more depolarized than under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). Collectively, these results indicate that I and T exert their effects through a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-mediated process and that CaM is probably influencing channel gating under resting Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> conditions. They also indicate that there is a complex interplay between the CaM binding domains, with BD-N and BD-C2 each regulating different aspects of channel inhibition in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM.</p>

            <title>The Eag Domain and cNBHD Are Required for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM Regulation of hEAG1</title>
            <p>To test whether the hEAG1 channel response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM was mediated by interactions between the eag domain and cNBHD, we next tested the effect of deleting each structural domain in turn on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-dependent gating. Deleting the eagD (amino acids 2â135) dramatically altered gating and resulted in a slowly activating and slowly deactivating current. At potentials positive to +40 mV, current amplitudes progressively decreased and the tail currents, which also had a smaller peak amplitude, had a 'hooked' appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). This behavior resembles hERG channel gating, in which the rectification is due to rapid onset of inactivation, and the hooked tails are due to rapid recovery from inactivation followed by slow deactivation. Importantly, in ÎeagD hEAG1, the inhibition by elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> was completely abolished; instead, the current was significantly increased by 82 Â± 37% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005, <italic>n</italic> = 7, see <italic>I-V</italic> relationship in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic> and mean time course data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>E</italic>). The effect of I and T on the voltage and time dependence of ÎeagD activation was also significantly attenuated compared with WT hEAG1 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>F</italic>).</p>

            <title>hEAG1 Channels Lacking the PAS-cap Are Potentiated Rather than Inhibited by Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub></title>
            <p>The eagD can structurally be divided into the PAS domain (amino acids 27â135) and the PAS-cap (residues 1â26). The PAS-cap is highly conserved across the KCNH channel family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>), and functional studies have demonstrated that much of the regulation of both hEAG1 and hERG1 voltage-dependent gating attributed to the eagD is actually mediated by the PAS-cap. Consistent with this, deleting the PAS-cap results in currents (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>) with gating properties almost identical to when the entire eagD is deleted. ÎPAS-cap and ÎeagD hEAG1 currents both exhibit a profound slowing of activation and deactivation and increased rectification at positive potentials. To determine whether the PAS-cap is also functionally important for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-dependent gating, we investigated the response of ÎPAS-cap hEAG1 currents to I and T. Currents were elicited by repetitively stepping to +40 mV, and the responses before and during I and T are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>. Surprisingly, ÎPAS-cap hEAG1 currents were substantially <italic>increased</italic> by I and T application, with an average peak change of current of 15.70 Â± 1.42-fold relative to the control currents (<italic>n</italic> = 9). This is in stark contrast to the 75% <italic>inhibition</italic> of WT hEAG1. The potentiation of current in the continued presence of I and T reached a peak after a mean time of 43.3 Â± 4.7 s (<italic>n</italic> = 9) and then started to decline, although amplitudes stabilized at a level that was still 2.84 Â± 0.69-fold larger (<italic>n</italic> = 9) than the control current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>). The time courses of the ÎPAS-cap and WT hEAG1 responses to I and T are almost a mirror image of one another. ÎPAS-cap is potentiated, whereas WT hEAG1 is inhibited, but they both show an initial fast change, which is transient in nature, followed by a relatively slow ârecoveryâ phase. This suggests that both channels are Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>-sensitive and that there may be common underlying mechanisms. The results also demonstrate that the PAS-cap region is absolutely required for âlatchingâ the channel in a non-conducting state. To confirm that the underlying mechanism of PAS-cap hEAG1 current potentiation was mediated by CaM binding, we simultaneously mutated the CaM BD-C2 site. Representative currents for ÎPAS-cap/F714S/F717S hEAG1 before and during I and T are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic> and the mean time courses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>. This mutant was insensitive to I and T with no significant change of <italic>V</italic><sub>0.5</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>10â80%</sub> of activation or current amplitude compared with control (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 7â9), thus confirming the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM dependence of ÎPAS-cap hEAG1.</p>

            <title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-dependent Inhibition of hEAG1 Required Interactions between the PAS-cap and cNBHD</title>
            <p>Recently, an x-ray crystal structure of the eag domain in complex with the cNBHD of mEAG has been solved (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). There are a number of sites of contact between the two domains, including contact of the PAS domain with the intrinsic ligand and post-cNBHD motifs of the cNBHD, which are adjacent to the BD-C1 and BD-C2 CaM-binding sites of the channel. The other important region of contact is between the PAS-cap and the cNBHD, although it should be noted that the first 16 amino acids of the PAS-cap were not resolved. Interestingly, there are relatively few structural changes between the domains in the complex and those of the isolated domains when they were solved independently of one another. This suggests that the contacts are quite weak and consistent with the low binding affinity (13.2 Î¼<sc>m</sc>) measured using fluorescence anisotropy (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Other regions of the channel may both stabilize and regulate the interaction of these crucial regions. Of particular interest was that a number of disease-associated mutations (long QT causing mutations in hERG1 and cancer-linked mutations in hEAG1) mapped to the interface between the eag domain and cNBHD. We modeled the interaction of the hEAG1 eag domain in complex with the cNBHD, including the section of the PAS-cap missing in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). The PAS-cap folds back, and the amphipathic helix sits in a groove between the PAS domain and cNBHD, making contacts with both domains. To test whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-mediated inhibition of hEAG1 could be due to interactions of the PAS-cap with the cNBHD, we mutated Glu-600 (equivalent to Glu-627 in mEAG and Glu-788 in hERG1) to Ala, Arg, Gln, Ile, or Leu and tested the response of these point mutants to I and T. This position is highly conserved in the EAG channel family and mutations in the homologous hERG1 channel position are associated with long QT syndrome (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In mEAG, Ala and Arg mutations have been reported to cause robust depolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of activation of &gt;100 mV (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In hEAG1, the effects were not as marked but, remarkably, the E600R mutation reproduced much of the change in gating properties (slowed activation and deactivation, and rectification at positive potentials) seen in ÎPAS-cap hEAG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). The substantial Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>-dependent potentiation was also seen with the cNBHD E600R mutant. I and T resulted in a 12.3 Â± 2.6-fold increase in E600R hEAG1 current measured at +40 mV relative to control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, unlike the ÎPAS-cap mutant, the increase of current in I and T was sustained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>E</italic>). The response of Glu-600 mutants to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> was highly dependent on residue volume and not just the charge of the substituted residue. The E600A and E600Q mutants exhibited WT hEAG1 behavior and were inhibited by I and T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>F</italic> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Ala and Gln have van der Waals residue volumes of 67 and 96 â«<sup>3</sup>, respectively, which are smaller than Glu (109 â«<sup>3</sup>) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Substituting Glu-600 for Leu or Ile (each 124 â«<sup>3</sup>) resulted in potentiation of current by I and T of 3.16 Â± 0.6 (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and 6.43 Â± 0.72 (<italic>n</italic> = 11)-fold, respectively. The volume of Arg is largest of all (196 â«<sup>3</sup>) and gave the greatest potentiation. Collectively, these results suggest that Glu-600 is an important site of contact with the PAS-cap. They also suggest that the charge of the residue is not the critical factor. The functional data support a molecular model in which the PAS-cap packs against the cNBHD. Substitution of large residues at position 600 reduces PAS-cap binding affinity resulting in similar functional effects to deleting the PAS-cap entirely.</p>

            <p>In recent years, studies have shown the importance of interactions between the eagD and cNBHD for regulating voltage-dependent gating of both hEAG1 and hERG1 channels (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">â</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The cNBHD is directly coupled to the S6 inner helix of the pore by the C-linker. A similar structural motif is also found in CNG and HCN, and in these channels it is crucial for their cyclic nucleotide-dependent regulation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">â</xref><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). It seems likely that conformational changes in the cNBHD of hEAG1 and hERG1 channels will also be transduced to the pore via the C-linker. Interactions of the eag domain with the cNBHD regulate the gating of both hEAG1 and hERG1 channels but in a very different manner. In hERG1, the interaction between the two domains slows deactivation gating by stabilizing the open conformation of the channel (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The eagD also influences hERG1 inactivation, such that onset of inactivation is faster, and recovery from inactivation is slower when the eagD is present compared with when it has been deleted (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). For hEAG1 channels, the eagD has the opposite effects on gating. Because the PAS-caps are almost identical, it seems likely that the differential roles of the eagD and cNBHD are mediated by differences in how the PAS-cap binds to the PAS domain and cNBHD. The interactions are dynamic and influence both voltage-dependent gating and, in the case of hEAG1, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-dependent gating. hERG1 channels are not regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-mediated mechanisms (data not shown).</p>
            <p>This study provides mechanistic insight into how hEAG1 channels are regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>. The eagD and cNBHD are both required for transducing the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM binding. Further studies are required to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms. Our results suggest a complex sequence of events, with distinctive roles for the BD-C2 and BD-N CaM binding domains and the PAS-cap, PAS, and cNBHD structural domains. In the WT hEAG1 channel, raising Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> results in a multiphasic response consisting of an initial inhibition followed by a slow ârecoveryâ phase in which not only are current amplitudes returning to control levels but activation gating is profoundly slowed and shifted to depolarized potentials. It seems likely that different components of the transduction mechanism coupling CaM binding to changes of gating of the pore are involved in regulating this process. The PAS-cap is an integral component. When deleted, the hEAG1 channels remain Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>-sensitive, but instead of being inhibited, they are potentiated by more than 15-fold. Hypothetically, the effects of deleting the PAS-cap could be due to alterations of PAS domain structure, leading to allosteric effects on PAS domain interactions with the cNBHD or other structural domains. However, mutations of Glu-600 on the cNBHD cause a similar substantial potentiation, suggesting the PAS-cap interacts directly with this critical site and that this PAS-cap interaction with the cNBHD is required for stabilizing the closed state of the channel. Without this interaction, channel activity is very high. Nevertheless, there is one clear difference. Deletion of the PAS-cap causes a peak and plateau type of response, whereas mutations of the cNBHD cause a sustained potentiation. Thus, Glu-600 cNBHD mutations also destabilize conformations that occur later on when elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> levels are sustained. Mutations to the CaM-binding sites also have differential effects. Mutating BD-N results in only a slow onset of inhibition, perhaps because CaM binding at this site is required for early conformational changes that lead to the fast inhibition. In contrast, when the BD-C2 site is mutated, the currents still show an initial early response to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, but then they fully recover to control amplitudes, suggesting that this site is required for stabilizing conformations that occur with elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>.</p>
            <p>hEAG1 is one of a number of ion channels that are modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> in a CaM-dependent manner (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Several of these channels are also modulated by phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). There is growing evidence that in TRPC6, and other channels, phosphoinositides can bind at, or close to, the CaM-binding site and regulate CaM binding, thus providing a mechanism to integrate these two important second messenger pathways (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In type 2 small conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>-activated potassium (SK2) channels, PIP<sub>2</sub> is a cofactor for Ca-CaM activation of these channels and binds at the interface between CaM and SK2 at a site that includes residues from both proteins (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The phosphorylation status of CaM itself may also be dynamically regulated by a signaling complex on the SK2 channel (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Phosphorylation of CaM results in a reduced affinity of PIP<sub>2</sub> for the CaM-SK2 complex, causing channel inhibition (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Recently, hEAG1 channels have also been shown to be regulated by PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In this case, PIP<sub>2</sub> inhibits hEAG1 channels through a mechanism that requires an intact CaM BD-N region (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Whether there is integration of CaM and PIP<sub>2</sub> signaling in hEAG1 channels via overlapping interactions with BD-N remains to be determined.</p>

            <title>What is the Physiological Importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-dependent Regulation of hEAG1?</title>
            <p>hEAG1 channels are expressed in presynaptic terminals of the CNS (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). mEAG1 knock-out mice exhibit increased levels of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> in response to sustained trains of high frequency APs compared with WT mice. This in turn leads to enhanced neurotransmitter release and faster rates of increase and larger amplitudes of excitatory post-sypaptic currents (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This, together with other findings, suggests that EAG channels become activated during bursts of presynaptic APs, shortening local APs at synaptic terminals and modulating synaptic plasticity. It seems reasonable to suggest that this function of EAG1 channels will be regulated not only in a firing frequency, but also in a Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>-dependent manner. Expression of hEAG1 is also dramatically increased in several types of cancer. Indeed, mutations at the interface of the eag domain-cNBHD complex have been linked to this disease (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A recent report suggests that the role of hEAG1 in tumorigenesis is the disassembly of the primary cilium, a microtubule-based structure and specialized calcium compartment that needs to be taken apart prior to mitosis (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Further studies are needed to determine what role the exquisite Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> sensitivity of these channels has in normal health as well as diseases such as cancer. However, understanding the molecular interactions that regulate hEAG1 channels could help in the design of novel therapies that mimic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM inhibition of hEAG1 to selectively target hEAG1-expressing cancer cells.</p>

            <p>Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis technique (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) on hEAG1 subcloned into pXOOM (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), a kind gift from Dr. Thomas Jespersen, University of Copenhagen (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Plasmid DNA was linearized with XbaI, and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription was performed using T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine, Ambion, Austin, TX). <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes were isolated, defolliculated, maintained in culture, and injected with wild-type or mutant cRNA (0.05 to 3 ng per oocyte) as described previously (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Whole cell currents were recorded in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Microelectrodes were filled with 3 <sc>m</sc> KCl, and the tips were broken to give resistances of 1.1â1.5 megohms. Recordings were made at room temperature 1â5 days after cRNA injection. Data were low pass filtered and sampled at 5 kHz and saved to a computer for off-line analysis using a Digidata 1320A data acquisition system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Oocytes were perfused with a low chloride, MES-based solution containing (in m<sc>m</sc>) Na-MES 96, K-MES 2, Ca-MES<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, HEPES 5, pH 7.6. The low chloride solution minimized endogenous outward calcium-activated chloride currents. We estimate <italic>E</italic><sub>Cl</sub> to be â¼+70 mV, based on extracellular Cl<sup>â</sup> of 2 m<sc>m</sc>, and reported intracellular concentrations of 40â45 m<sc>m</sc> (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Unless stated otherwise, cytoplasmic calcium was elevated by perfusing cells with supermaximal concentrations (5 Î¼<sc>m</sc>) of ionomycin and thapsigargin purchased from Sigma (United Kingdom) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). In some experiments, EGTA was injected into the oocytes during recordings to buffer Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> to low levels. 50 nl of 50 m<sc>m</sc> K<sub>4</sub>EGTA solution, pH 7.2, was injected using a Nanoliter 2000 microinjection device (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) to give an estimated final concentration of 5 m<sc>m</sc> based on the assumption that oocytes have a cytoplasmic volume of 500 nl.</p>

            <title>Voltage Protocols and Data Analysis</title>
            <p>The time- and voltage-dependent kinetics of hEAG1 were measured using an <italic>I-V</italic> protocol, which unless stated otherwise consisted of 2-s test pulses to potentials between â50 and +80 mV followed by a 500-ms pulse to â60 mV. Responses to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> were monitored by repetitively stepping to +60 or +40 mV for 2 s. In all experiments the holding potential was â90 mV, and pulses were applied at 10-s intervals.</p>
            <p>hEAG1 current amplitudes were measured using Clampfit software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Conductance (<italic>G</italic>) was calculated as the time-dependent current amplitude (or end-pulse current amplitude for Îeag and ÎPAS-cap) in response to a test pulse (<italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic>), divided by driving force (<italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> â <italic>E</italic><sub>K</sub>), where <italic>E</italic><sub>K</sub> is the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (â96 mV). For each oocyte, <italic>G</italic> was normalized to <italic>G</italic><sub>max</sub> (maximum conductance) plotted as a function of <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> and fitted to a Boltzmann function to determine the potential at which the current is half-maximally activated (<italic>V</italic><sub>0.5</sub>) and the slope (<italic>k</italic>) of the conductance-voltage relationship. For mutants that are strongly rectified (ÎeagD, ÎPAS-cap, and E600R cNBHD), the <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> at which activation was maximal could not be accurately determined, and thus <italic>V</italic><sub>0.5</sub> and <italic>k</italic> values are likely to be underestimated. The time-dependent kinetics of activation were measured from calculations of time from 10 to 80% activation (<italic>t</italic><sub>10â80%</sub>) using Tracan software (written in-house by Dr. Noel Davies). Data are presented as mean Â± S.E. (<italic>n</italic> = number of cells). Statistical comparisons were performed using paired or unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> tests where appropriate. Differences were considered significant at <italic>p</italic> â¤ 0.05. Figures and statistical analyses were prepared using Prizm software (GraphPad, San Diego).</p>

            <title>Oocyte Calcium Imaging</title>
            <p>For measurement of Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of 1 m<sc>m</sc> Oregon Green BAPTA-1 potassium salt (Invitrogen, United Kingdom) 1â3 h prior to fluorescence imaging on an Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus, United Kingdom) equipped with an FV1000 confocal scanning unit. The indicator (estimated final concentration of 50 Î¼<sc>m</sc>) was excited at 488 nm, and emission was collected at 500â600 nm via a 10 Ã 0.4 NA U-Plan-S-Apo lens. Images were acquired at a rate of 0.2 Hz with the confocal aperture set at maximum. To prevent cell movement during I and T application, a sealed blunt-ended glass micropipette was pressed gently on the top surface of the oocyte. The lens was focused 25â100 Î¼m above the coverslip to detect the signal from a cross-section of the oocyte that had unrestricted access to I and T added to the bath. Fluorescence signals (<italic>F</italic>) were quantified using ImageJ (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) as the average value from three different peripheral regions of interest per oocyte (each &gt;3500 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>) after background signal subtraction. <italic>F</italic> was expressed relative to the pre-stimulus level (<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>). Intracellular calibration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels reported by Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 proved unreliable. Instead, an extracellular calibration was carried out in a custom multiwell microchamber with a range of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels set with EGTA/CaCl<sub>2</sub>/HEPES mixtures (Maxchelator, maxchelator.stanford.edu). This calibration was then used to convert the <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> increase induced by I and T to an approximate increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> using a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 170 n<sc>m</sc> and resting Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> of 100 n<sc>m</sc>.</p>
