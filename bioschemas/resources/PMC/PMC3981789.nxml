      <abstract>
        <p>Nesprin-1-giant and nesprin-2-giant regulate nuclear positioning by the interaction of their C-terminal KASH domains with nuclear membrane SUN proteins and their N-terminal calponin-homology domains with cytoskeletal actin. A number of short isoforms lacking the actin-binding domains are produced by internal promotion. We have evaluated the significance of these shorter isoforms using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting with site-specific monoclonal antibodies. Within a complete map of nesprin isoforms, we describe two novel nesprin-2 epsilon isoforms for the first time. Epsilon isoforms are similar in size and structure to nesprin-1-alpha. Expression of nesprin isoforms was highly tissue-dependent. Nesprin-2-epsilon-1 was found in early embryonic cells, while nesprin-2-epsilon-2 was present in heart and other adult tissues, but not skeletal muscle. Some cell lines lack shorter isoforms and express only one of the two nesprin genes, suggesting that either of the giant nesprins is sufficient for basic cell functions. For the first time, localisation of endogenous nesprin away from the nuclear membrane was shown in cells where removal of the KASH domain by alternative splicing occurs. By distinguishing between degradation products and true isoforms on western blots, it was found that previously-described beta and gamma isoforms are expressed either at only low levels or with a limited tissue distribution. Two of the shortest alpha isoforms, nesprin-1-alpha-2 and nesprin-2-alpha-1, were found almost exclusively in cardiac and skeletal muscle and a highly conserved and alternatively-spliced exon, available in both nesprin genes, was always included in these tissues. These âmuscle-specificâ isoforms are thought to form a complex with emerin and lamin A/C at the inner nuclear membrane and mutations in all three proteins cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and/or inherited dilated cardiomyopathy, disorders in which only skeletal muscle and/or heart are affected.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Nesprins (nuclear envelope spectrin-repeat proteins) are intracellular linkers and scaffolds. The <italic>SYNE1</italic> gene for nesprin-1 was first identified in the mouse post-synaptic membrane <xref rid="pone.0094380-Apel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and in rat vascular smooth muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Two protein products were postulated, one of approximately 110 kD and another greater than 230 kD <xref rid="pone.0094380-Apel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Zhang et al., 2001 <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> named the equivalent human 110 kD protein, nesprin-1-alpha, and identified the larger product as 382 kD nesprin-1-beta. A related gene, <italic>SYNE2</italic>, was also identified <xref rid="pone.0094380-Apel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and shown to produce protein products of approximately 61 kD (nesprin-2-alpha), 87 kD (nesprin-2-beta) and 377 kD (nesprin-2-gamma) <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It was shown that these nesprins are short forms of larger proteins, nesprin-1-giant (1008 kD) and nesprin-2-giant (792 kD) <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. <italic>SYNE1</italic>, also known as <italic>MYNE1</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0094380-Mislow1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> or <italic>Enaptin</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0094380-Padmakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, is on human chromosome 6q25. <italic>SYNE2</italic>, also known as <italic>NUANCE</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, is on human chromosome 14q23.</p>
      <p>Structurally, nesprins have a central rod domain composed of spectrin repeats. Nesprin-1-giant and nesprin-2-giant have N-terminal CH (calponin homology) domains that bind the actin cytoskeleton and C-terminal transmembrane KASH (Klarsicht-ANC-Syne-homology) domains, which reside in the outer nuclear membrane and bind across the luminal space to the SUN (Sad1, UNC84) type II inner nuclear membrane proteins, SUN1 and SUN2 <xref rid="pone.0094380-Sosa1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These interactions form LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complexes, which form a physical link between the cytoskeleton and the nucleus (Reviewed: <xref rid="pone.0094380-Lombardi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Rajgor1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). Nesprins have multiple internal promoters which give rise to shorter isoforms with a common C-terminal region, but truncated at the N-terminus. Those short isoforms containing the transmembrane KASH domain are also able to interact with the SUN proteins. The LINC complex is further strengthened by SUN proteins interacting with lamin A/C on the nucleoplasmic side of the inner nuclear membrane. Additionally, the spectrin repeat-containing domain of nesprin-2-alpha ÎTM, which may be nucleoplasmic, has been shown to interact with a different domain of the SUN proteins, so that SUN may anchor nesprin isoforms on opposing faces of the nuclear envelope <xref rid="pone.0094380-Haque1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The nesprins can undergo alternative splicing to give rise to proteins lacking the KASH and transmembrane domains. These KASH-less isoforms are unable to form LINC complexes with SUN proteins, but can participate in the direct interactions of nesprins in the nucleoplasm. If the KASH transmembrane domains are absent, there may then be direct interactions between the C-terminal regions of nesprins 1 and 2 and their binding partners including emerin <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Mislow2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, muscle Aâkinase anchoring protein (encoded by gene <italic>AKAP6</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0094380-Pare1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, components of the nuclear lamina (Lamin A/C) <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Mislow1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Mislow2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase receptor (encoded by gene <italic>MuSK</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0094380-Apel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and chromatin <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The bioinformatics study of Simpson and Roberts <xref rid="pone.0094380-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> found good support for two additional nesprin-1 isoforms, with little known about their function, which are not included in this study because they contain only N-terminal sequences (CPG2â¶109 kD and GSRP-56â¶56 kD). The two additional members of the nesprin family (nesprin-3 and -4), which are not included in this study, both lack the N-terminal CH domain. Instead, the N-terminal of nesprin-3 contains a plectin-binding domain which interacts with intermediate filaments <xref rid="pone.0094380-Wilhelmsen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and nesprin-4 interacts with microtubules via kif5b and is involved in cell polarity <xref rid="pone.0094380-Roux1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>

Similarly, mutations in nesprin-binding partners, emerin (<italic>EMD</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0094380-Bione1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and lamin A/C (<italic>LMNA</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0094380-Bonne1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> are also associated with EDMD (reviewed: <xref rid="pone.0094380-Meinke1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>). Mutations in two other genes, four and a half LIM domains 1 (<italic>FHL1</italic>) and transmembrane protein 43 (<italic>TMEM43</italic>), may also cause EDMD <xref rid="pone.0094380-Gueneau1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. FHL1 proteins contain LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, Mec3) domains and the main isoform, FHL1A is expressed predominantly in striated muscle where it may have a role in sarcomere assembly <xref rid="pone.0094380-Gueneau1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. <italic>TMEM43</italic> encodes for LUMA, a structural protein of the inner nuclear membrane that interacts with lamins and emerin <xref rid="pone.0094380-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In around half of cases of EDMD, causative mutations have not been identified <xref rid="pone.0094380-Meinke1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The characteristic features of EDMD are weakness and wasting of specific muscles, early contractures and cardiac conduction defects <xref rid="pone.0094380-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, but the molecular mechanisms by which the mutations in emerin, lamins or nesprins lead to the clinical features of EDMD are still largely unknown.</p>
      <p>Studies of the short isoforms of nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 have often been inconclusive, because of the possibility that some bands seen on northern and western blots may be the result of degradation of endogenous mRNAs and proteins in tissue extracts, rather than the detection of true short isoforms. In the present study, taking as a starting point the bioinformatics data of Simpson and Roberts <xref rid="pone.0094380-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, we have defined more fully the ânesprinomeâ of different tissue types. We have re-evaluated the importance of previously-reported short isoforms of nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 that have a common C-terminal domain, by determining their expression levels relative to âhousekeepingâ proteins and to the giant, full-length nesprin proteins. We show that some short isoforms are expressed at very low, or barely-detectable, levels in most tissues, though, in some cases, they may be significant in certain specific cells or tissues. Examples of how degradation products of giant nesprins may have been mistaken for true isoforms are given. In contrast, we also show that the importance of two novel epsilon isoforms of nesprin-2 has been previously overlooked. Finally, the abundant expression of one specific alpha isoform of each nesprin in both cardiac and skeletal muscles suggests that these may be important for understanding the pathogenesis of EDMD.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g001">Figure 1</xref> is a pictorial representation of nesprin-1-giant and nesprin-2-giant with the N-terminal start points of the smaller isoforms, as defined by Simpson and Roberts <xref rid="pone.0094380-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. To determine isoform mRNA levels, we performed qPCR on total cDNA from a panel of 20 human tissues and 7 human cell lines and calculated a Relative Expression (RE) value against two endogenous âhouse-keepingâ controls, GAPDH and cytoskeletal beta-actin. The isoforms, isoform-specific primer sequences, product sizes and efficiencies of amplification are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094380.s001">Table S1 in File S1</xref>. Primer pair specificity was verified by sequencing the products from conventional PCR. Although a PCR product for sequencing was obtained for nesprin-1-alpha-1 (in spleen) and nesprin-2-beta-1 (in skeletal muscle), we were unable to determine an efficiency of qPCR with any tissue, even when several alternative primer pairs were tested. This suggests that nesprin-1-alpha-1 and nesprin-2-beta-1 were present at very low or undetectable levels in the 27 cells/tissues we have studied. Otherwise, the high PCR efficiencies show that qPCR is accurately reflecting the levels of each mRNA species, relative to the internal controls.</p>

        <title>Nesprin-2-epsilon-1 is Expressed in Early Embryonic Cells, While Nesprin-2-epsilon-2 is Produced in Several Adult Tissues, Including Heart</title>
        <p>We showed in an earlier study <xref rid="pone.0094380-Lamle1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> that nesprin-2-epsilon-1 mRNA and protein (122 kD) is expressed in Ntera-2 cells and ovary, but not in other tissues, and suggested that it might be an early embryonic isoform. In addition to Ntera-2 and ovary, we now show significant expression of epsilon-1 in ESC which supports the view that it may have a function in early development. Two nesprin-2-epsilon isoforms were predicted by bioinformatics studies <xref rid="pone.0094380-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and we now show that epsilon-2 mRNA is absent from Ntera-2 and ESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g003">Figs. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g004">4</xref>), but is expressed at significant levels in heart, brain, thymus, thyroid, prostate, testis and ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g003">Figs 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g004">4</xref>). The production of epsilon-2 protein (103 kD) by heart and brain is confirmed by western blot, which showed a lower Mr band than the epsilon-1 (122 kD) in ESC and Ntera-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Although low levels of nesprin-2-epsilon-2 mRNA were present in skeletal muscle (10% of brain levels), protein was not detected on western blots, possibly because of the sensitivity of the method. Ovarian tissue contains both epsilon-1 and epsilon-2 mRNAs but the total RNA preparation will contain mRNA from a number of âadultâ cell types, as well as âembryonicâ oocytes. Until specific antibodies to distinguish the two isoforms become available, it is not possible to investigate the exact cellular location of nesprin-2-epsilon-1 by immuno-localisation.</p>

        <title>The Short Alpha Isoforms of both Nesprins are Expressed Mainly in Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle, the two Affected Tissues in Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy</title>
        <p>Cardiac and skeletal muscles are unusual in expressing, in addition to both giant forms, significant amounts of mRNA for nesprin-1-beta-1, nesprin-1-alpha-2 and nesprin-2-alpha-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

        <p>In an earlier study <xref rid="pone.0094380-Randles1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, we suggested that skeletal muscle contains nesprin-2-gamma (377 kD) and nesprin-2-alpha-2 (47 kD), in addition to giant and nesprin-2-alpha-1 isoforms, and all four bands (plus a âghostâ band of myosin at 200 kD) can be seen clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g005">Fig. 5</xref>. However, mRNAs for gamma and nesprin-2-alpha-2 are barely detectable in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094380.s001">Table S4 in File S1</xref>), suggesting that giant (792 kD) and alpha-1 (60 kD) are the only significant isoforms of nesprin-2 produced by skeletal muscle and the two bands at ca. 400 kD and ca. 50 kD are likely degradation products of higher Mr isoforms. The alternative possibility that these lower Mr bands are due to cross-reactions of the antibody with non-nesprin proteins has been eliminated by the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against different epitopes in the C-terminal region <xref rid="pone.0094380-Randles1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

Heart does have a prominent band of nesprin-1-alpha-2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), as predicted from qPCR, but the triplet protein band in this region of the spleen blot is unlikely to be this isoform, since the mRNA for nesprin-1-alpha-2 is not expressed in spleen.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g008">Fig. 8A</xref> shows the 23-amino-acid sequence of DV23 in both nesprins. It is quite highly-conserved, even between the two human nesprin genes (57% identity). We produced a panel of 8 mAbs against the DV23 sequence of nesprin-2 using a peptide-conjugate as immunogen and mapped their epitopes using a phage-displayed random peptide library. All 8 mAbs recognised four peptides, which are shown aligned with each other and with the nesprin-2 DV23 sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g008">figure 8A</xref>. Common amino acids are shown in red and the mapped epitope is underlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>. PCR showed strong inclusion of the nesprin-2 DV23 exon in nesprin-2-giant and nesprin-2-alpha-1 in skeletal muscle, which was confirmed by western blot with one of these mAbs, N2-DV23 6B4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Six of the 10 amino-acids in the epitope of mAb N2-DV23 6B4 are identical in nesprins -1 and -2, so it was necessary to demonstrate specificity of the mAb for nesprin-2 experimentally. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g008">Fig. 8C</xref> shows that mAb N2-DV23 6B4 does not stain the nuclear membrane in vascular smooth muscle cells; VSMC do not have nesprin-2 although they do express high levels of nesprin-1 containing DV23, so confirming the specificity of this antibody for nesprin-2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g008">Fig. 8D-G</xref> shows that the same mAb (N2-DV23 6B4) stained the nuclear rim as strongly as mAbs against total nesprin-2 in tissues where DV23 is mainly included (heart and skeletal muscle), but shows much weaker nuclear staining in cells where nesprin-2 DV23 is largely excluded (ESC and Ntera-2). This confirms the mRNA results for DV23 at the protein level.</p>

            <p>(A) Alignment of the 23 amino acid sequences of the DV23 exon of nesprin-1 and nesprin-2. The nesprin-2 DV23 peptide was the immunogen for mAb production. The epitope of the mAbs was mapped to the sequence shown in red and underlined. Sequences of the four 15-mer peptides pulled out of the phage-display peptide library are shown aligned below the nesprin-2 DV23 sequence, with matching amino acids shown in red. (B) The mAb N2-DV23 6B4 recognised bands of nesprin-2-giant and nesprin-2-alpha-1 in western blot of skeletal muscle (the intermediate band is a likely degradation product of nesprin-2-giant). (C) The 6B4 mAb against nesprin-2 DV23 does not cross-react with nesprin-1 DV23. VSMC (which contain nesprin-1 with DV23 but no nesprin-2) showed nuclear staining for nesprin-1 with MANNES1A but not with 6B4. Immunofluorescent staining with mAbs MANNES2A and N2-DV23 6B4 was equally strong on both cardiac muscle nuclear rim (D) and skeletal muscle nuclear rim (E). However, MANNES2A was much stronger than N2-DV23 6B4 on both ESC (F) and Ntera-2 cells (G), since the DV23 exon is mainly excluded in these cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Furthermore, the MANNES1A mAb is largely nucleoplasmic in ESC, which may be because the nesprin-2 KASH domain is also largely excluded in this cell type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Nesprin-2 Lacking the KASH Domain Locates in the Nucleoplasm of Embryonic Stem Cells</title>
        <p>The nesprin-2 mAb (MANNES2A), showed only nuclear rim staining in heart and skeletal muscle sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g008">Fig. 8D, E</xref>). This mAb in ESC showed an intense nucleoplasmic speckle-like distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g008">Fig. 8F</xref>) and in Ntera-2 there was some cytoplasmic stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g008">Fig. 8G</xref>). PCR for nesprin-2 KASH indicated that most of the nesprin-2 mRNA in ESC, lacked the KASH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). Heart and skeletal muscle appeared to contain the highest levels of nesprin-2 KASH, with ovary and Ntera-2 also positive for KASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). These results in combination indicate that the nucleoplasmic, speckle-like distribution of nesprin-2 in ESC is attributable to absence of the KASH domain.</p>

        <p>This study differs from earlier studies, first of all in using qPCR with internal standards to determine the relative levels of all known KASH domain isoforms (and their KASH-less splice variants), of both nesprins-1 and -2, and secondly, in combining mRNA (qPCR) and protein (western blot) data to distinguish true isoforms from degradation products at the protein level. We have concluded that the main isoforms expressed from <italic>SYNE1</italic> are nesprin-1-giant (1008 kD), nesprin-1-alpha-2 (111 kD) and, at lower levels, two forms of nesprin-1-beta (383 kD and 370 kD), but nesprin-1-alpha-1 mRNA was barely detectable. The main isoforms from <italic>SYNE2</italic> were nesprin-2-giant (792 kD), two forms of nesprin-2-epsilon (103 kD and 122 kD) and two forms of nesprin-2-alpha (60 kD and 47 kD). Nesprin-2-gamma and nesprin-2-beta-2 were present at only very low levels, while nesprin-2-beta-1 was barely detectable. It is perhaps surprising that we were able to amplify nesprin-1-alpha-1 and nesprin-2-beta-1 by conventional PCR but were unable to determine efficiency of qPCR, using the same primer pairs. In this respect, it has been reported that conventional PCR and qPCR may perform differently and that conventional PCR may have greater analytical sensitivity compared with qPCR <xref rid="pone.0094380-Bastien1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The conclusions are in excellent agreement with the bioinformatics studies of Simpson and Roberts <xref rid="pone.0094380-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which found âevidence against a biological roleâ for both nesprin-1-alpha-1 and nesprin-2-beta-1 and âstrong support for the biological relevanceâ of nesprin-1-alpha-2, both nesprin-2-epsilons and both nesprin-2-alphas. They had insufficient sequence data to make reliable predictions about other beta and gamma isoforms <xref rid="pone.0094380-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It seems as though only the giant isoforms of nesprins are essential for basic cell functions, since some of the cell lines lack shorter isoforms. Similarly, some cell lines showed almost exclusive expression from only one of the two nesprin genes.</p>
        <p>The tissue distribution data on nesprin-2-giant mRNA agree broadly with the hybridization array data of Zhen et al. <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> with highest expression in kidney, liver and thyroid and low levels in brain, except that we found significant amounts in HeLa and other cell lines and only average levels in spleen. The unusually high levels of nesprin-1-beta-1 mRNA and protein in spleen are consistent with previous northern blot analysis <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and show the importance of avoiding generalisations about nesprins based on a limited range of cells or tissues. Relative to GAPDH and beta-actin, overall nesprin mRNA levels were high in kidney and thyroid, but low in brain, bladder, thymus and all seven cell lines. Tissues are not homogeneous and contain a variety of cell types, including vascular cells and blood/lymph cells. It is possible, therefore, that the high levels of nesprin-1-beta-1 mRNA and protein in spleen can be traceable to one particular cell type. Similarly, the expression of both nesprin-2-epsilon-1 and epsilon-2 in ovary may occur in different cell types in that tissue. Future availability of isoform-specific mAbs should enable us to answer this question in the long-term using immunolocalisation microscopy. The detection of nesprin-2-epsilon-1 only in cells of embryonic origin suggests that it may occur in germ cells of ovary, but this has not yet been confirmed. The question of whether cardiac nesprin-2-epsilon-2 expression is attributable to any particular cell type in the heart could also be answered with epsilon-2-specific mAbs.</p>

        <title>Validation of Western Blots by qPCR</title>
        <p>We have also been able, where possible, to reconcile the mRNA data with protein data from western blots, although available antibodies are only able to detect isoforms produced at reasonably high levels. The main problem in identifying bands on western blots as authentic short forms of nesprin is the possibility that lower Mr bands might be due to proteolysis of a larger isoform, such as the âgiantâ form. This is especially problematical when a larger isoform is present in great abundance. Large cytoskeletal proteins, like dystrophin and nesprins, are especially sensitive to proteolysis and even when precautionary extraction methods are used (see Methods), human tissues with no degradation are difficult to obtain. Although human extracts and ready-made blots covering a range of tissues are available commercially, we have found them too dilute for detection of nesprins with our mAbs, although they do work with antibodies against more abundant proteins, such as GAPDH (unpublished observations). True isoforms can in theory be identified using antibodies against isoform-specific amino-acid sequences (usually at the amino-terminus) but such antibodies are not yet available. The availability of qPCR data does throw some light on this problem. Protein levels normally reflect levels of the corresponding mRNA, though differences in protein stability or turnover may complicate the relationship. These considerations suggest that, in skeletal muscle, the only KASH domain proteins produced in significant amounts are the two giant forms plus nesprin-2-alpha-1 (60 kD) and nesprin-1-alpha-2 (111 kD). Very small amounts of nesprin-1-beta-1 and nesprin-2-epsilon-2 mRNA were also detected in skeletal muscle, but the putative nesprin-2-gamma (377 kD) and nesprin-2-alpha-2 (47 kD) proteins identified on western blots <xref rid="pone.0094380-Randles1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> are likely degradation products (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094380-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

        <title>âDV23â Splice Variants</title>
        <p>Although this study has clarified the major KASH-containing nesprin isoforms that are expressed, other studies have shown that alternative splicing can produce additional variants within this basic framework. We therefore studied splicing of the âDV23â exon, which has predicted functional importance <xref rid="pone.0094380-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and is located near the N-terminal of nesprin-2-alpha-1. DV23 was largely included in nesprin-2-giant mRNA from skeletal muscle, heart, brain and several other tissues, but largely excluded in liver, kidney and thymus. The DV23 exon was also included in nesprin-2-alpha-1 mRNA in cardiac and skeletal muscle, which was also seen in an earlier report of total nesprin-2 <xref rid="pone.0094380-Apel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Recently, many alternative start and termination sites throughout the nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 genes have been identified, giving the possibility of multiple short isoform variants <xref rid="pone.0094380-Rajgor2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Is Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy caused by Defects in a Specific Function of the Short Nesprin Isoforms in Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle?</title>
        <p>The observation, from qPCR and western blot, that the short alpha isoforms, nesprin-1-alpha-2 and nesprin-2-alpha-1, are expressed almost exclusively in cardiac and skeletal muscle is consistent with previous northern analysis <xref rid="pone.0094380-Apel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and RT-PCR <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and extends these earlier results to a wider range of tissues. Cardiac and skeletal muscles are also the only two tissues affected in EDMD. All the known mutations in nesprins that are associated with EDMD or dilated cardiomyopathy, lie within the alpha isoform sequences <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0094380-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The tissue-specific distribution of the alpha isoforms, and the location of pathogenic nesprin mutations within them, raises the possibility that alpha isoforms have some specific function that is not shared by the full-length âgiantâ forms. Loss of this function may then be responsible for the pathogenesis of EDMD and dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>
        <p>One current hypothesis is that short isoforms of nesprin locate to the inner nuclear membrane, where they can interact directly with emerin and lamin A/C, mutations in which also cause EDMD. The idea of loss of function of a complex of emerin, lamin A/C and nesprins as a unifying cause of EDMD is an attractive one, but no function requiring all three proteins has yet been identified. When they are localised at the outer nuclear membrane, giant nesprins can interact only indirectly with lamin A/C, via SUN proteins at the inner nuclear membrane. Although giant isoforms may locate to the inner membrane during assembly of the nuclear envelope after mitosis, such large proteins may be unable to cross the assembled nuclear envelope while still membrane-associated <xref rid="pone.0094380-Morris2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, nesprin isoforms without KASH and transmembrane domains have been described and these ânon-membraneâ proteins can enter the nucleus through the nuclear pores. When transfected, isoforms of nesprin-2 that lack a KASH domain have been shown to form nuclear complexes and colocalise with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) bodies <xref rid="pone.0094380-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In this respect, we have shown that most of the nesprin-2 in ESC lacks the KASH domain and is largely located in the nucleoplasm with a speckle-like appearance. Nesprin-2-giant has also been found with centromeric and heterochromatic sequences inside the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0094380-Rashmi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Immuno-gold EM studies using a keratinocyte cell line, showed nesprin-2-giant at both the outer and inner nuclear membranes <xref rid="pone.0094380-Libotte1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. One consequence of the presence of giant isoforms, with or without KASH domains, inside the nucleus is that formation of complexes with emerin/lamin A/C is not an exclusive function of short isoforms.</p>
        <p>Nearly all the pathogenic mutations in human nesprins known so far are autosomal dominant mutations in nesprin-1. Nesprin-1-giant does appear to have an essential function in myonuclear positioning. A mouse knockout of the nesprin-1 KASH domain had myonuclear localisation defects that were not shared by the corresponding nesprin-2 KASH knockout mouse and disruption of nesprin-1 KASH or nesprin-2 KASH did not affect viability or fertility <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang4" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Knockout of the actin-binding region of nesprin-2 generated a mouse model with complete loss of nesprin-2-giant <xref rid="pone.0094380-Lke1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These mice had an increased thickness of epidermis and showed defective wound healing, but were otherwise very similar to wild type mice and did not have an EDMD phenotype <xref rid="pone.0094380-Rashmi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094380-Lke1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Similarly, mice with a knockout of the C-terminal spectrin repeat region of nesprin-1 which resulted in ablation of most isoforms of nesprin-1 showed defects in positioning and anchorage of nuclei in skeletal muscle, but had normal heart function and did not display a phenotype similar to EDMD <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang5" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The bioinformatic study of Simpson and Roberts <xref rid="pone.0094380-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> found nesprin-2-alpha-1 only in human, but not in mouse, whereas nesprin-1-alpha-2 and both epsilon isoforms of nesprin-2 were present in human and mouse. Knockout of either <italic>Sun1</italic> alone or double-knockout of both <italic>Sun1</italic> and <italic>Sun2</italic> also caused defects in myonuclear positioning, rather than an EDMD-like phenotype <xref rid="pone.0094380-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. A mouse model in which the KASH domain of nesprin-1 was replaced with an unrelated sequence did have an EDMD-like phenotype <xref rid="pone.0094380-Puckelwartz2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, consistent with a dominant-negative effect of expression of a mutant protein. It would seem that some, but not all, functions of nesprins can be performed by either nesprin-1 or nesprin-2, since mice with a double-knockout of both nesprins have respiratory failure and die shortly after birth <xref rid="pone.0094380-Zhang4" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The two giant nesprins do not form obligatory complexes together, since nesprin-1-giant and nesprin-2-giant do not co-localise in EDMD skin fibroblasts without emerin <xref rid="pone.0094380-Randles1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. If giant isoforms of the two nesprins do not interact with each other, short isoforms are unlikely to form heterodimers either, although nesprin-1-alpha does form homodimers, which bind directly to emerin and lamin A <xref rid="pone.0094380-Mislow2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The presence of nesprin mutations that are likely to be pathogenic and the muscle-specific distribution of the alpha isoforms, raises the possibility that alpha isoforms have some specific function that is not shared by the full-length âgiantâ forms. Loss of this function may then be responsible for the pathogenesis of EDMD and dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>

        <p>The First Choice Human Total RNA Survey Panel (ABI Ambion, Austin, Texas) was used as a source of RNA from 20 adult human tissues. Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. Total RNA (2 Î¼g in a 20 Î¼L reaction) was reverse transcribed using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Applied Biosystems) and then diluted 1â¶12 with sterile water.</p>
        <p>Forward primers for specific short isoforms of nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 were each designed to recognise a unique sequence in the 5â² UTR of the isoform. Primer pairs for the giant isoforms were designed, to minimise amplification of shorter isoforms. Short isoforms containing the N-terminal CH domains have recently been described <xref rid="pone.0094380-Rajgor2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and we designed primers to avoid these. Primers for nesprin-1-giant span the N-terminal site of nesprin-1-beta-1 and primers for nesprin-2-giant span the N-terminal site of nesprin-2-epsilon-1. Primer sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094380.s001">Table S1 in File S1</xref>. Primer pairs were tested by conventional PCR (PCR Core Kit, Qiagen), and products confirmed by DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing and Services, University of Dundee).</p>
        <p>Relative quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR green detection in an ABI 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Reaction wells contained 10 Î¼L SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 1.5 Î¼L cDNA, 300 nM Forward and 300 nM Reverse primers in a final volume of 20 Î¼L.

Epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies was performed using phage-displayed random peptide libraries in filamentous phage as previously described <xref rid="pone.0094380-Pereboev1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, Briefly, monoclonal antibody mixtures were diluted 1â¶50 with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and immobilised onto sterile 35 mm Petri dishes coated directly with 1 ml of 1â¶200 dilution of rabbit-anti-[mouse Ig] in TBS (DAKOs, Denmark). Biopanning was performed using a 15-mer peptide library in phage f88-4, maintained in the K91Kan strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> (G.P. Smith, University of Missouri). Any remaining binding sites on the dishes were blocked using 4% BSA in sterile TBS. A sample of the phage library (10<sup>13</sup> virions) was pre-incubated in dishes coated with the rabbit anti-mouse antibodies alone to ensure any binding was specific for the target mAbs. Following the first round of biopanning, the bound phage were eluted and amplified by infection of K91Kan <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Two rounds of biopanning were performed. Individual colonies of the phage-infected cells after the second round were grown on nitrocellulose membrane (BA85) and screened by western blotting to reveal positive clones. Positive clones were subjected to western blotting with individual mAbs from the mixture used for biopanning. After blocking non-specific sites with 5% skimmed milk protein in TBS, membranes were incubated with mAb supernatant (1/100 dilution in TBS).
