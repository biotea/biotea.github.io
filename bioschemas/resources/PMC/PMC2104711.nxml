      <abstract>
        <p>The recently characterised 299-residue human XLF/Cernunnos protein plays a crucial role in DNA repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and interacts with the XRCC4âDNA Ligase IV complex. Here, we report the crystal structure of the XLF (1â233) homodimer at 2.3 Ã resolution, confirming the predicted structural similarity to XRCC4. The XLF coiled-coil, however, is shorter than that of XRCC4 and undergoes an unexpected reverse in direction giving rise to a short distorted four helical bundle and a C-terminal helical structure wedged between the coiled-coil and head domain. The existence of a dimer as the major species is confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, small-angle X-ray scattering and other biophysical methods. We show that the XLF structure is not easily compatible with a proposed XRCC4:XLF heterodimer. However, we demonstrate interactions between dimers of XLF and XRCC4 by surface plasmon resonance and analyse these in terms of surface properties, amino-acid conservation and mutations in immunodeficient patients. Our data are most consistent with head-to-head interactions in a 2:2:1 XRCC4:XLF:Ligase IV complex.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are extremely cytotoxic lesions that can be generated by ionising radiation, reactive oxygen species and exposure to toxic chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Khanna and Jackson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Wyman and Kanaar, 2006</xref>). Left unrepaired or incorrectly repaired, this damage can cause cell death and genome rearrangements, and these can in turn lead to cancer. Notably, DSBs also arise as intermediates during programmed genome rearrangement processes, such as site-specific V(D)J recombination that generates the antigen-binding repertoire of the mammalian adaptive immune system. Two pathways are mainly used to repair DSBs: homologous recombination that uses as the DNA repair template a homologous, undamaged DNA molecule such as the sister chromatid; and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a mechanism that can be used throughout the cell cycle but which is of particular importance in G1 and G0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">van Gent et al, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>To date, the best characterised NHEJ factors are the Ku heterodimer (consisting of Ku70 and Ku80), the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gottlieb and Jackson, 1993</xref>), the Artemis endonuclease, XRCC4 and DNA Ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Sekiguchi and Ferguson, 2006</xref>). While DNA Ligase IV, XRCC4, Ku70 and Ku80 are conserved throughout all eukaryotic species known, DNA-PKcs and Artemis are not present in simpler eukaryotes such as yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Critchlow and Jackson, 1998</xref>). Ku80/70 heterodimers bind to broken DNA ends to initiate the NHEJ process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Featherstone and Jackson, 1999</xref>), and DNA-PKcs serves to bridge the broken DNA ends and promote ligation by XRCC4âLigase IV. DNA-PKcs also mediates phosphorylation of Artemis, and it is thought that this allows Artemis to cleave off the damaged bases at the broken DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lieber et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">DeFazio et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Ma et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Rivera-Calzada et al, 2007</xref>). After the actions of other processing enzymes such as polynucleotide kinase and DNA polymerases, the resulting DNA ends are finally ligated by DNA Ligase IV, which is bound to XRCC4 homodimer as a cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Critchlow et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Grawunder et al, 1997</xref>). In addition to causing radio-sensitivity, inherited defects in NHEJ proteins cause severe-combined immune deficiency as a result of impaired V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Schwarz et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">O'Driscoll et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Rooney et al, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although the above proteins complete the main functions required for NHEJ, in 2003 it became apparent that there was at least one further NHEJ factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dai et al, 2003</xref>). Indeed, in 2006, two groups identified a previously uncharacterised 299-amino-acid residue protein, XLF/Cernunnos (henceforth called XLF) as being essential for NHEJ in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ahnesorg et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Buck et al, 2006</xref>). This new human NHEJ protein was named âXRCC4-like factor (XLF)' by one of the two groups based on an analysis with the Fugue alignment method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Shi et al, 2001</xref>) that gave 95% confidence for structural similarity between XLF and XRCC4 (<italic>Z</italic> score of 4.75), despite the low sequence identity (13.7%) between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ahnesorg et al, 2006</xref>). The tertiary structure of XRCC4 is a homodimer with N-terminal globular head domains and long extended Î±-helical coiled-coil regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Junop et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sibanda et al, 2001</xref>). Notably, homotypic interactions between XLF polypeptides have been established by pull-down experiments with two differently tagged versions of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ahnesorg et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Deshpande and Wilson, 2007</xref>). In line with there being a specific relationship between XLF and XRCC4, yeast two-hybrid results and pull-down experiments suggested the existence of a large complex containing XLF, XRCC4 and Ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ahnesorg et al, 2006</xref>). Further biochemical investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Lu et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Tsai et al, 2007</xref>) subsequently supported this contention and, furthermore, indicated that residues 1â128 of XLF bind to the head domain (residues 1â119) of XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Deshpande and Wilson, 2007</xref>). Moreover, in the presence of Ku, XLF has been shown to enhance DNA end-joining by XRCC4âLigase IV, and was reported to regulate DNA repair activity under conditions where base mismatches exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Tsai et al, 2007</xref>). Notably, XLF is evolutionary and functionally conserved in diverse eukaryotes, and belongs to a superfamily of proteins that also contains the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> NHEJ factors Lif1 and Nej1, which interact with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Callebaut et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hentges et al, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>While the suggested structural relationship between XLF and XRCC4 has led to speculation on how XLF functions in DSB repair, so far, it has not been clear whether and to what extent XRCC4 and XLF are structurally analogous, and little is known about precisely how XLF promotes NHEJ. To address these issues, we cloned, expressed and crystallised XLF, and herein describe its tertiary structure at 2.3-Ã resolution. The structure reveals both similarities to and differences from the known three-dimensional structure of XRCC4. It supports the identification of the interacting region between XLF and XRCC4 suggested by biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Deshpande and Wilson, 2007</xref>) and provides important clues as to how XLF functions in concert with the Ligase IV-XRCC4 complex to bring about NHEJ.</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p>Homologues of XLF identified in human, mouse, rat, frog, fish and yeast display conserved sequence features, revealing phylogenetic relationships between the respective proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Protease digestion of human full-length (299 residues) XLF revealed that it can be truncated at the C terminus to give a stable fragment of â¼27 kDa (data not shown). Results from secondary structure predictions using Jpred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Cuff et al, 1998</xref>), Coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lupas et al, 1991</xref>), DisPredict-EMBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Linding et al, 2003</xref>) and Foldingdex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Prilusky et al, 2005</xref>) indicate that residues after 245 in XLF may not have a defined structure (data not shown). In view of these results, we cloned, expressed, purified and crystallised the human XLF fragment containing residues 1â233, a region that is highly conserved among all XLF orthologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
      <p>XLF wild-type crystals diffracted to 2.9-Ã resolution, in space group C2, with two protomers in the asymmetric unit. Phase information was obtained with SeMet-substituted crystals by using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD). However, SeMet-substituted crystals belonged to P2<sub>1</sub> space group, with four XLF subunits in each asymmetric unit. As the SeMet-substituted crystals diffracted to a better resolution, 2.3 Ã, than the wild-type crystals, the data from these crystals were used for structure determination. The <italic>R</italic>-value of the refined structure is 18.2%, and the <italic>R</italic>-free is 23.9%. The wild-type crystal structure was later solved by molecular replacement (MR) by using the model generated from SeMet-substituted structure as the template (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the SeMet-substituted crystal structure, four protomers are organised as two dimers. In subunit A, residues 1â230 are clearly defined, while in subunits B, C and D residues 1â227, 1â227 and 1â229, respectively can be seen; interpretable electron density for residues 231â233 of all four subunits is absent, presumably due to disorder. Subunits A and B form a homodimer with a pseudo two-fold axis along the length of the molecule; a similar dimer is formed by subunits C and D. Each subunit has a globular head domain and a cone-shaped C-terminal part, comprised of a long Î±-helix, a reverse turn and two helices that wind their way around the dimeric coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2A</xref>). Structural features plotted against the sequence alignment of XLF orthologues are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>XLF has N-terminal globular head domains</title>
        <p>The globular head of the XLF protomer (residues 1â135) contains four Î±-helices (Î±A, Î±B Î±C and Î±D1) and two sets of antiparallel Î²-sheets (Î²1, 2, 3, 4, and Î²5, 6, 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), organised as two Î²-meanders followed by helical regions: thus, the motif encompassing Î²2, Î²3, Î²4 and Î±B is similar to that containing Î²5, Î²6, Î²7 and Î±D1, and the two motifs superpose well. Remarkably, W45 of Î²4 and W119 of Î²7 are structurally equivalent and both are fully conserved across XLF orthologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1A, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2C</xref>), suggesting that this structural similarity may result from an ancient gene duplication and fusion event. The two Î² meanders form a Î²-sandwich with strands lying at right angles to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Î±B and Î±C, which are connected by a loop, lie at one end of the sandwich between the Î²-sheets, whilst Î±D1, spanning residues 128â135, forms a similar structure at the other end of the Î²-sandwich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Î±D1 does not seem to be essential to the stability of the head domain as constructs omitting this short helix retain the ability to interact with XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Deshpande and Wilson, 2007</xref>). The head domain resembles that of XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Junop et al, 2000</xref>), but has not been identified elsewhere.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>XLF forms a homodimer via a coiled-coil region</title>
        <p>Dimerisation of XLF in solution is suggested by analytical gel-filtration chromatography and crosslinking experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). By using a calibrated Superdex-200 (16/60) column, tag-free XLF (1â233) eluted at 78 ml, between the elution volumes of bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, 75 ml) and bovine carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa, 85.5 ml; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). This indicates XLF forms a multimer, the estimated molecular weight of which is larger than that of a monomer (26.6 kDa), but smaller than that of a trimer (79.8 kDa). Further evidence of dimer formation came from bis[sulphosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS<sup>3</sup>) crosslinking experiments of XLF of the same sequence (1â233) but containing N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Two bands were found at the sizes expected for monomer and dimer, and when the mass ratio between BS<sup>3</sup> and XLF was raised, the amount of dimer increased and monomer decreased correspondingly. Furthermore, the calculated hydrodynamic radii (12 nm), diffusion coefficient (1.98 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s) and average molecular weight (52.4 kDa) of XLF from dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements are consistent with a protein dimer.</p>
        <p>The existence of a tightly structured XLF homodimer is confirmed by the crystal structure of both wild-type and SeMet-substituted crystal forms, which contain nearly identical homodimers. The dimer interaction interface between the two chains in the homodimer is extensive, burying â¼6100 Ã<sup>2</sup> of the molecule surface. The dimer is stabilised by interactions between the longest Î±-helix, Î±D, of each molecule through a coiled-coil structure. Î±D starts at P128 in all four chains, ends at S170, Y167, E169 and E169 in chains A, B, C and D, respectively and is kinked at residue L135 in each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>, left panel). The coiled-coil interface is highly hydrophobic and consists of 33 residues on each helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). In each of the two dimers, the coiled-coils are stabilised by a pair of salt bridges between side chains of K160 and D161. Hydrogen bonds between residues 129â137 in Î±D and residues 41â43 in the loop between Î²3 and Î²4 in the head domain of the other chain also contribute to the stability of the dimer. There is high evolutionary conservation of the interface residues across different species, indicating the functional relevance of the dimeric unit and strongly suggesting that the dimeric form will persist in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). These extensive interactions at the protomer interface in the dimer are consistent with the independence of the far-UV circular dichroism (CD) signal of XLF concentration between 40 and 600 Î¼g/ml and by highly cooperative thermal unfolding transition of XLF (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>=66.5Â°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>There are intriguing interactions between the two crystallographically independent SeMet XLF dimers packed in the asymmetric unit. Thus, subunits B and D are in contact through their head domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>), forming three hydrogen bonds and a pair of salt bridges. The surface charge of chain B at the interface is positive, while that of chain D is negative. A similar arrangement occurs in the wild-type crystals. These observations encouraged us to investigate further whether such tetramers might exist in solution by using the more sensitive methods of sedimentation velocity and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Sedimentation velocity experiments reveal that in solution XLF is mainly (92%) a dimer as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>. This is supported by SAXS intensity data, which give values of the radius of gyration (26.6Â±0.2 Ã) and the maximum particle size (100Â±0.6 Ã), consistent with the dimensions of an XLF dimer. The theoretical <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> value derived from the crystal structure of XLF using the program CRYSOL predicts an <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> of 26.3 Ã, which is very similar to the experimental value. The theoretical <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> values for the monomer and the tetramer are 23.2 and 36.2 Ã, respectively. Thus, there is no evidence that the âtetramer' in the crystal structure exists in solution, demonstrating that the interaction between the two head domains is weak and the tetramer is likely of crystallographic origin.</p>

        <title>XLF C-terminal helices encircle the coiled-coil and interact with the head domain</title>
        <p>In chain A, the coiled-coil region ends at S170 and is followed by a loop that reverses the direction of the chain towards the head domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). In this structure, the Y167 carbonyl group forms hydrogen bonds with S170 and A172, while the carbonyl of Q168 contacts G171. These bonds stabilise the conformations and relative orientations of the Î±-helix and the loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel). Chains B, C and D have a similar conformation at their equivalent regions.</p>
        <p>The loop regions following this until residue 185 differ in structure between the four protomers of the crystal asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>, left panel). In chain A, the loop is a continuous random coil, while in chains B, C and D, residues 177â179 form Î±-helices. In addition, residues 170â173 in chain B are disordered and cannot be modelled. Hydrogen bonds, made by residues in the loop and in Î±D of the partner subunit, appear to guide the following helices (Î±E and Î±F) as they encircle the other molecule to form a cone-shaped homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B(1) and (2)</xref>).</p>
        <p>Î±E comprises residues E186 to A201 in each chain, but a hydrogen bond between F193 and L198 gives rise to a kink in the helix allowing it to maintain its tendency to surround the coiled-coil. Two pairs of inter-chain salt bridges between K197 and E152 also help to stabilise this region. Residues following K208 in Î±F continue the encirclement of the coiled-coil and come close to the N terminus in the head domain. In a similar way to Î±E, a hydrogen bond between F210 and Q215 leads to a kink that reorients the helix. Q215 and Y218 interact with residues in the head domain to stabilise the structure through an intricate structure of three hydrogen bonds with W13, K26 and H134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B(1) and (3)</xref>).</p>
        <p>Notably, all the key structural residues identified above are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrate XLF proteins, suggesting that this C-terminal structure has been selected for in evolution and is of functional significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Similarities and differences between XLF and XRCC4</title>
        <p>The crystal structure of the XLF homodimer is very similar to that of the XRCC4 homodimer in the head domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>), the main difference being that XLF has an extra Î±-helix (Î±A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>) at its N terminus. However, the remainder of the structure differs in unexpected ways. These differences begin in the orientation of the Î±-helical stalks and the head domains, defined here as the angle between Î²4 and Î±D. This angle is about 130Â° in XLF, but it is about 85Â° in XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, in the XRCC4 homodimer, the head domains interact with the stalks through van der Waals contacts and salt bridges between R3 and E125, whereas Î±A and Î±F of XLF act as wedges to position the head domains away from the Î±-helical stalks. Compared to the long stem-like coiled-coil region of XRCC4 (more than 120 Ã), XLF has a much shorter coiled-coil of about 12 turns; and moreover, in XLF but not in XRCC4, the following sequence reverses direction to meet the N terminus. The folding of cone-shaped XLF homodimer is not similar to any known structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

        <title>The XLF complex with XRCC4âLigase IV</title>
        <p>To gain insights into possible interactions between XLF and XRCC4, binding studies were performed using surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcore apparatus (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Kinetic data, evaluated using a 1:1 interaction model and obtained by exposing different concentrations of XRCC4 to XLF bound to the sensor chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>), showed that XLF and XRCC4 interact with an affinity of 7.8 Î¼M.</p>
        <p>We have gained further insights into the nature of the interactions between XLF and XRCC4 by analysing the conserved surface regions among XLF and XRCC4 orthologues and by calculating the optimal docking area (ODA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fernandez-Recio et al, 2005</xref>). ODA predicts three potential binding regions in the XRCC4 homodimer: one spans residues D154 to R161 in the coiled-coil, while others are in the second set of Î² strands in each head domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). ODA also predicts that XLF is likely to mediate interactions via both its head-domain and coiled-coil areas. The region surrounding the conserved K160 of XLF coiled-coil region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>) is unlikely to be a DNA-binding region as there are also negatively charged residues in the vicinity and it is also unlikely to be a ligase-binding site, but it could be a conserved site of post-translational modification, such as ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). On the other hand, the region predicted to be a binding site in the head region, especially the first and third Î±-helices (Î±A and Î±C) of XLF, might be involved in interacting with the XRCC4 head region, which is complementary in charge. Consistent with such a model, interactions mediated through head domains of XLF and XRCC4 have been recently indicated by yeast two-hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Deshpande and Wilson, 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>In view of the head-to-head model of XLFâXRCC4 interaction, there are two possible modes of interaction between XLF, Ligase IV and XRCC4, and these are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D(1) and (2)</xref>.</p>
        <p>First, we must consider whether XLF could adopt a similar binding mode to Ligase IV as observed in the complex of Ligase IV with XRCC4. The XRCC4 coiled-coil includes a binding region with DNA Ligase IV spanning residues 173â195 in both chains of the XRCC4 dimer that binds with the inter-BRCT domain linker region of Ligase IV through an intricate arrangement of non-polar interactions and well-defined, often charged hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sibanda et al, 2001</xref>). Although the structure of XLF described here is well packed and identical in both SeMet-substituted and wild-type structures, there remains the possibility that this can unravel in the presence of Ligase IV and adopt a more extended coiled-coil. A radical conformational change would be consistent with the nature of the interactions between the N and C termini within one protomer chain. Whereas the residues mediating the interactions are conserved, implying a structural or functional role of the observed structure selected for in the evolution of the orthologues, the interactions involve many polar residues of the sort often observed in non-obligate complexes. As such, they would likely be fairly stable also in an unfolded form. This hypothetical model of XLF binding to Ligase IV is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D(2)</xref>.</p>
        <p>Even if a radical conformational rearrangement of XLF were to open up a coiled-coil binding site similar to that in XRCC4, the potential binding of XLF to Ligase IV would likely be weak as there is no sequence of residues in XLF that would easily be compatible with the interactions observed between XRCC4 and Ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sibanda et al, 2001</xref>). In view of these issues, we consider it unlikely that XLF directly interacts with the inter-BRCT domain linker region of Ligase IV. Thus, one possible model of the XLFâXRCC4âLigase IV complex involves XLF remaining in its cone-shaped âfolded' form and is bridged to the DNA Ligase IV linker region by XRCC4. In this scenario, the stoichiometry of XLF, XRCC4 and Ligase IV in the complex is 2:2:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D(1)</xref>). We also note, however, that a variation on this model is that XLF also directly binds to a region of Ligase IV that is distinct from the Ligase IV inter-BRCT linker region. In such a model, one or two Ligase IV molecules could be associated with the XLFâXRCC4 complex.</p>
        <p>A final potential scenario for the XLFâXRCC4âLigase IV complex, which does not envision interactions between XLF and XRCC4 homodimers, involves the possibility that XLF forms a heterodimer with XRCC4, and that such a heterodimer mediates contacts with Ligase IV together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D(3)</xref>). In our opinion, the hybrid coiled-coil proposed by such a structure is also not very likely to occur, because the sequence identity between the coiled-coil regions in the two proteins is very low. Furthermore, heterotypic interactions between human XLF and XRCC4 have been found to be weak and to have poor salt tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Deshpande and Wilson, 2007</xref>).</p>

        <title>Disease mutations of human XLF</title>
        <p>Two point mutations, R57G and C123R, have been identified in immunodeficient patients with microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Buck et al, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, these residues are fully conserved among XLF homologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). We have mapped these mutations onto the XLF structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>) and predicted their structural effects using the program SDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Topham et al, 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table II</xref>).</p>
        <p>R57, which is located in the helix Î±B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>), forms hydrogen bonds through its guanidinium group to the side chain of E47 (Î²4) and the main chain of N120 (Î²7). These hydrogen bonds hold the two Î²-meanders together, so stabilising the head domain. Loss of the arginine would be expected to destabilise the structure of the head domain and this is confirmed by a very high negative ÎÎ<italic>G</italic> value predicted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table II</xref>). In a similar way, C123 which is near the end of Î²7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>) has its side chain buried in the hydrophobic core, and this would likely be severely disrupted by the substitution of arginine, again consistent with the prediction of SDM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table II</xref>). These observations underline the importance of the head domains to XLF function.</p>
        <p>A mutant, R178X, in which the polypeptide chain is deleted beyond R178 in the loop region between Î±D and Î±E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>), has also been observed in immunodeficient patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Buck et al, 2006</xref>). This deletion must disrupt the C-terminal interactions with the head domain, giving rise to serious misfunction of XLF. Our structure indicates that a further mutant lacking A25âR57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Buck et al, 2006</xref>) would also not be folded in the absence of residues spanning from Î²2 to Î±B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>We have established that the XLF dimer adopts a similar overall structure to that of the XRCC4 dimer, supporting the contention that these two factors are related in function and have arisen from a common evolutionary ancestor. Nevertheless, there are important structural differences between XLF and XRCC4, suggesting strongly that the two proteins have distinct and non-overlapping functions in the NHEJ process. Our analyses also suggest that XRCC4 and XLF are unlikely to act as a heterodimer but, instead, probably associate with one another as homodimers in the complex with Ligase IV. It will now be of great interest to use the structural information at our disposal to differentiate further between the various potential models for the XLFâXRCC4âLigase IV complex to ascertain the precise biochemical attributes of these proteins and to explore in more detail how they function in DNA repair by non-homologous end-joining.</p>

        <p>A stable XLF fragment containing the coding sequence for the TEV cleavage site and amino-acid residues 1â233 of human XLF was generated by PCR cloning into Gatewayâ¢ Destination Vectors (EMBL). The resulting plasmids included N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-MBP tag and His<sub>6</sub> tag, and were named as XLF441 and XLF410, respectively.</p>
        <p>XLF441 was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Rosetta2 cells (Novagen). Thus, an overnight culture of 20 ml was grown at 37Â°C and diluted into two 1-l cultures to grow at 37Â°C till OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.6. Each culture was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-Î²-<sc>D</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 20Â°C overnight. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, protease inhibitor (EDTA-free, Completeâ¢; Roche). Cells were lysed by running through Emulsiflex at 2000 p.s.i. After centrifuging at 15 000 r.p.m. for 45 min, the supernatant was loaded onto 5 ml Ni-NTA beads. Imidazole (10 mM) was applied to the beads to wash away nonspecifically bound materials, and XLF was eluted with 100 mM imidazole. Eluate was dialysed in an imidazole-free buffer and treated with 400 U of TEV protease per milligram fusion protein to cleave off the N-terminal tags. Both tags in solution were removed by 5 ml Ni-NTA beads, and cleaved protein was loaded onto a Superdex-200 (16/60) column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Peak fractions were concentrated to 10 mg/ml for crystallisation.</p>
        <p>XLF410 was expressed and initially purified with Ni-NTA beads in the same way as XLF441. Its elution was loaded directly onto a Superdex-200 column without cleavage. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated for the downstream experiments.</p>
        <p>SeMet-substituted XLF441 was expressed by using a modified protocol. Thus, 20 ml culture was used as seed, 1 ml of these cells was diluted into 250 ml of M9 broth (containing 4.2 g/l Fe<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 ml of 40% <sc>L</sc>-glucose and 100 Î¼l of 0.5% thiamine per litre culture as supplementary) to grow at 37Â°C until OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.3. Then <sc>L</sc>-lysine, <sc>L</sc>-threonine and <sc>L</sc>-phenylalanine (100 mg/ml each) and <sc>L</sc>-leucine, <sc>L</sc>-isoleucine, <sc>L</sc>-valine and <sc>L</sc>-selenomethionine (50 mg/ml each) were added into the cultures. Methionine synthesis was inhibited after 20 min at 37Â°C, and the cultures were induced with 1 mM IPTG and left shaking at 220 r.p.m. in 20Â°C overnight. SeMet-substituted XLF441 was purified in the same way as the native protein. After the last step, SeMet-XLF441 was concentrated to 5 mg/ml for crystallisation.</p>
        <p>A stable XRCC4 construct containing 1â213 residues and an N-terminal His6 tag was expressed and purified using the same procedure as XLF410.</p>

Each sample was exposed for 25 min in 30 s frames. Frames at the beginning and the end of each data collection were compared to exclude the possibility of protein aggregation and/or radiation damage.

Crystals were soaked in the cryoprotectant for a few seconds then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p>
        <p>Diffraction data of native and SeMet-substituted crystals were collected at ID29 beam line of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. All data sets were processed by using HKL processing suite.</p>

        <title>Structure determination and refinement</title>
        <p>The structure was solved using SAD with SeMet-substituted crystals. Phase information was calculated by PHENIX, and 36 Se atoms were found. An initial structure was auto-built also with PHENIX, in which 60% of total amount of residues were built. The <italic>R</italic>-value was 27%, and <italic>R</italic>-free value was 31%. More residues were traced during refinements by CNS and Refmac. After six cycles of refinement and rebuilding, 903 residues and 235 water molecules were included. Because of the lack of electron density, sequence difference remains between the crystal structure and the protein sequence, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table III</xref>.</p>
        <p>The coordinates of XLF have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The accession code is 2QM4.</p>

        <title>Computational approaches to protein sequences and structures</title>
        <p>Protein sequences used for alignments were obtained from the proteomics server ExPASy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gasteiger et al, 2003</xref>). Sequences were initially aligned by ClustalW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Fukami-Kobayashi and Saito, 2002</xref>) and manually adjusted using BioEdit software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html">http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html</ext-link>). Conserved and identical residues in the sequence alignments were highlighted using analysis of multiply aligned sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Livingstone and Barton, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">1996</xref>). Secondary structure prediction was carried out using JPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Cuff et al, 1998</xref>) and FoldIndex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Prilusky et al, 2005</xref>). Sequences adopting coiled-coil conformation was calculated by COILS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lupas et al, 1991</xref>). Disordered regions were predicted by DisPredict-EMBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Linding et al, 2003</xref>). Data files of crystal structures were retrieved from the PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Berman et al, 2007</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of XLF orthologues and mapping the evolutionary trace to XLF structure were done by Evolutionary Trace Server (TraceSuite II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Innis et al, 2000</xref>). Protein surface accessibility was calculated by ODA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fernandez-Recio et al, 2005</xref>). Superposition of protein tertiary structures are generated using COOT v1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>), and cartoon images are drawn in PyMOL v0.99rc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">DeLano, 2002</xref>). Effect prediction of disease mutations to XLF was performed by SDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Topham et al, 1997</xref>) with substitution tables updated by Catherine L Worth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p>

XRCC4 probably interacts with other molecules through the head domains and the coiled-coil region. XLF head domains are likely to interact with other factors but also a region surrounding the conserved, K160 residue, is highlighted. (<bold>D</bold>) Possible modes of interaction between XRCC4, XLF and Ligase IV. XRCC4 molecules are shown in green, XLF is in red and Ligase IV BRCR-linker region is in magenta. (1) Linker region between Ligase IV BRCT domains binds to XRCC4's coiled-coil, folded XLF/Cernunnos contacts XRCC4 via the head domains. (2) The C termini of XLF molecules are unfolded and bind to Ligase IV in a similar way to XRCC4. Thus, there are two Ligase IV molecules in this large complex. (3) XLF and XRCC4 form a heterodimer and bind to Ligase IV in the composite coiled-coil region.</p>
