      <abstract>
        <p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbial pathogens and trigger innate immune responses. Among TLR family members, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 induce interferon (IFN)-Î± in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). This induction requires the formation of a complex consisting of the adaptor MyD88, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7. Here we show an essential role of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 in TLR7- and TLR9-mediated IRF7 signaling pathway. IRAK-1 directly bound and phosphorylated IRF7 in vitro. The kinase activity of IRAK-1 was necessary for transcriptional activation of IRF7. TLR7- and TLR9-mediated IFN-Î± production was abolished in <italic>Irak</italic>-<italic>1</italic>âdeficient mice, whereas inflammatory cytokine production was not impaired. Despite normal activation of NF-ÎºB and mitogen-activated protein kinases, IRF7 was not activated by a TLR9 ligand in <italic>Irak-1</italic>âdeficient pDCs. These results indicated that IRAK-1 is a specific regulator for TLR7- and TLR9-mediated IFN-Î± induction in pDCs.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in innate immune responses in mammals (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). So far, 11 members of the TLR family (TLR1â11) have been identified (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Among these members, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 have closely related molecular structures and exert similar immune responses by recognizing nucleic acid ligands (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). TLR7 and TLR8 recognize single-stranded (ss) RNA and imidazoquinolines, and TLR9 recognizes CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) as well as certain microbial DNA (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Upon binding of their ligands, TLR7 and TLR9 recruit a TollâIL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor MyD88. Then, MyD88 associates with IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family members through the homophilic interaction between their death domains. TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is also recruited and NF-ÎºB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are finally activated. These events result in induction of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î², and IL-12 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This is a common pathway for TLR signaling, which is called the MyD88-dependent pathway (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
    <p>There are four IRAK family members including IRAK-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-M, and IRAK-4 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Among them, only IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 possess intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). IRAK-1 was reported as a kinase critically involved in IL-1R signaling in vitro (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). IL-1âmediated IL-6 production as well as activation of MAPKs and NF-ÎºB were reduced in <italic>Irak-1</italic>

<sup>â</sup> embryonic fibroblasts (EFs; 14, 18). However, macrophages from <italic>Irak-1</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/</sup></italic>
<sup>â</sup> mice showed only partial impairment of cytokine production as well as NF-ÎºB activation in response to TLR ligand (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Irak-4</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/</sup></italic>
<sup>â</sup> mice exhibited severe impairment in response to IL-1, IL-18, or ligands of various TLRs (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This phenotype is quite similar to that of <italic>Myd88</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/</sup></italic>
<sup>â</sup> mice. Thus, IRAK-4 is thought to be essential for the MyD88-dependent pathway. In vitro experiments showed that IRAK-1 is phosphorylated and activated by IRAK-4 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, the relationship between IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 and the requirement of the kinase activity of IRAKs in various signaling events are still unclear (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
    <p>In addition to production of inflammatory cytokines, ligand stimulation of TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 can induce IFN-Î± in a special subset of DCs, pDCs (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This unique subset of DCs is known for their ability to produce a large amount of type I IFNs upon viral infection (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). IFN-Î± induction in response to these TLR ligands is abolished in <italic>MyD88</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/</sup></italic>
<sup>â</sup> pDCs (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), suggesting that TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 have a unique mechanism that activates the genes encoding IFN-Î± in a MyD88-dependent manner in pDCs. Our recent study showed that TLR7- and TLR9-mediated IFN-Î± induction requires the formation of a complex consisting of MyD88, TRAF6, and IRF7 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Activated IRF7 in the complex translocates into the nucleus, and induce transcription of type I IFN genes. More recently, Honda et al. reported that IFN-Î± production by TLR7 and TLR9 ligands was abolished in splenic pDCs derived from <italic>Irak-4</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/</sup></italic>
<sup>â</sup> mice (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Although IRAK-1 has been considered to work downstream of MyD88, the role of IRAK-1 in the TLR7- and TLR9-mediated IFN-Î± production remains to be seen.</p>
    <p>Here we examined a role of IRAK-1 in TLR7- and TLR9-mediated signaling pathways. IRAK-1 associated with and phosphorylated IRF7 in vitro, indicating that IRAK-1 was also involved in the complex composed of MyD88 and TRAF6. Severely impaired production of IFN-Î± in response to TLR7 and TLR9 ligands was observed in <italic>Irak-1</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/Y</sup></italic> mice. On the other hand, production of inflammatory cytokines by TLR7 and TLR9 ligands was not impaired. IRF7 failed to translocate to the nucleus in response to TLR9 ligand in <italic>Irak-1</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/Y</sup></italic> pDCs, indicating that IRAK-1 is prerequisite for the activation of IRF7. Taken together, IRAK-1 is a molecule specifically involved in the induction of IFN-Î± by TLR7 and TLR9 ligands.</p>

        <title>IRAK-1 associates with IRF7</title>
        <p>In a previous study, we showed that IRF7 forms a complex with MyD88 and TRAF6 to induce IFN-Î± (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Because IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 were shown to associate with MyD88, we investigated whether IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 were involved in IRF7 complex. We first analyzed the interaction of IRF7 with IRAK-1 or IRAK-4 by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. When human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged IRF7 along with Myc-tagged IRAK-1 or IRAK-4, FLAGâIRF7 was coprecipitated with anti-Myc in cells expressing MycâIRAK-1 but not MycâIRAK-4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). This indicates that IRAK-1 but not IRAK-4 interacts with IRF7. We further analyzed the physical interaction of IRAKs and IRF7 in live cells. We transfected HEK293 cells with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-labeled IRF7 and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)âlabeled IRAK-1 or CFP-labeled IRAK-4, and then visualized these by inverted fluorescence microscopy. IRF7âYFP was diffusely expressed in the cytoplasm when coexpressed with IRAK-4âCFP. On the contrary, when coexpressed with IRAK-1âCFP, IRF7âYFP was expressed as a condensed form with IRAK-1âYFP in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). When we analyzed these cells for physical interaction between IRF7-YFP and IRAK-1âCFP or IRAK-4âCFP, we detected a strong fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal from IRF7 in the area merged with IRAK-1 but not IRAK-4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). We also found identical colocalization and physical interaction when we transfected cells with IRF7-CFP and IRAK-1âYFP (unpublished data). We further confirmed this observation by measuring FRET by using flow cytometry (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). When HEK293 cells were transfected with IRF7âYFP and IRAK-1âCFP or IRAK-4âCFP, only cells that expressing IRF7 with IRAK-1 but not IRAK-4 showed a strong FRET signal, suggesting that IRF7 interacts directly with IRAK-1 but not IRAK-4 in the cytoplasm in live cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Reciprocally, a similar result was obtained when cells were introduced with IRF7âCFP and IRAK-1âYFP (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>We next examined which portion of IRF7 is responsible for interaction with IRAK-1. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with MycâIRAK-1 together with FLAGâIRF7 or deletion mutants of FLAGâIRF7 encoding amino acids 1â285 or 1â237. FLAGâIRF7 and FLAGâIRF7 1â285 expressed in HEK293 cells were coprecipitated with anti-Myc, showing that the region between amino acids 238 and 285 of IRF7 is required for interaction with IRAK-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). This portion of IRF7 was shown previously to be required for the interaction with both MyD88 and TRAF6, suggesting that IRAK-1 is involved in the complex through the interaction with this portion (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>

        <title>Kinase activity of IRAK-1</title>
        <p>IRF7 has been shown to be activated during viral infection by phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal serine residues and translocates into nucleus where it regulates the expression of target genes including IFN-Î± (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether the kinase activity of IRAK-1 is necessary for IRF7 activation. HEK293 cells were transfected with FlAGâIRF7 along with MycâIRAK-1 or Mycâkinase negative (KN) mutant of IRAK-1 (MycâIRAK-1 KN). FLAGâIRF7 was then coprecipitated with anti-Myc in cells expressing both IRAK-1 and IRAK-1 KN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). We detected slowly migrating forms of FLAGâIRF7 in cells expressing MycâIRAK-1 but not in cells coexpressing IRAK-1 KN, suggesting that IRAK-1 induces IRF7 phosphorylation through its kinase activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). To determine whether IRAK-1 could phosphorylate the COOH terminus of IRF7, we performed in vitro kinase assay using bacterially expressed GSTâIRF7 as a substrate. IRAK-1, IRAK-1 KN, IRAK-4, and IRAK-4 KN were expressed in HEK293 cells and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FlAG. Phosphorylation of GSTâIRF7 was found in immunoprecipitates of IRAK-1 but not IRAK-4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). These data indicate that IRAK-1, but not IRAK-4, phosphorylates IRF7 in vitro. We next tested whether the kinase activity of IRAK-1 is necessary for the transcriptional activity of IRF7. In previous work, we showed synergistic activation of IFN-Î± promoters by coexpression of IRF7 and MyD88 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, overexpression of neither IRAK-1 nor IRAK-4 in combination with IRF7 resulted in any synergistic activation of IFN-Î± promoter in HEK293 cells (unpublished data). Therefore, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with a combination of IRF7, MyD88 and various amounts of IRAK-1 KN along with a reporter plasmid carrying the IFN-Î±4 promoter. IRAK-1 KN inhibited the activation of the IFN-Î±4 promoter induced by coexpression of MyD88 and IRF7 in a dose dependent manner, whereas IRAK-1 KN did not inhibit the NF-ÎºB activation by MyD88. Such effects of IRAK-1 KN was in sharp contrast to a truncated mutant of TRAF6 containing only the COOH-terminal TRAF domain (TRAF6C), which acts as dominant negative mutant and interfered the activation of both IFN-Î±4 and NF-ÎºB promoters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). These data suggest that IRAK-1 can phosphorylate IRF-7 in vitro and the kinase activity of IRAK-1 is necessary for the transcriptional activity of IRF7 but not of NF-ÎºB.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>IRAK-1 was originally identified as a kinase recruited to the IL-1R complex after IL-1 treatment (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In vitro studies demonstrated that IRAK-1 participates in NF-ÎºB activation of IL-1RâTLR signals (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In vivo studies using <italic>Irak-1</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/</sup></italic>
<sup>â</sup> EFs confirmed that IRAK-1 is essential for IL-1âmediated IL-6 production as well as activation of MAPKs and NF-ÎºB (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, cytokine production as well as NF-ÎºB activation in response to TLR4 ligand, LPS was only partially impaired in <italic>Irak-1</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/</sup></italic>
<sup>â</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), suggesting that IRAK-1 is redundant in the response of certain cell types to TLR ligands. In this report, we found a novel function of IRAK-1 in pDCs. IRAK-1 is a regulator essential for IRF7 activation in TLR7 and TLR9 signaling pathways. IRAK-1 was dispensable for TLR9-mediated NF-ÎºB and MAP kinase activation as well as proinflammatory cytokine production in pDCs. IRAK-1 acts as a gateway for the activation of IRF7 pathway to induce IFN-Î± production (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C).</p>
      <p>Based on studies in IL-1R signaling pathways, an elaborate model explaining the mechanism of IRAK-1 activation has been established (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Upon ligand stimulation, IRAK-1 is recruited to IL-1R and forms a complex with MyD88, IRAK-4 and TRAF6. It is suggested that IRAK-4 locates upstream of IRAK-1 and phosphorylates IRAK-1 in the IL-1R complex. The phosphorylation triggers the induction of kinase activity of IRAK-1 itself, which results in multiple phosphorylation events and increasing its affinity for TRAF6 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Because the kinase activity of IRAK-1 is reported to be dispensable for downstream NF-ÎºB activation (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), the precise role of the kinase activity was still unclear. In TLR7 and TLR9 signaling pathways in pDCs, it is assumed that a similar receptor complex is formed upon ligand stimulation. Genetic studies showed that MyD88 and IRAK-4 are essential for both IFN-Î± and inflammatory cytokine induction (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), indicating that these molecules do not determine the specificity of the signaling. Furthermore, IRAK-4 does not bind IRF7 directly, suggesting that IRAK-4 acts upstream of IRAK-1 in the signaling. Taken together, IRAK-4 may participate in the IRF7 pathway through the phosphorylation of IRAK-1.</p>
      <p>It is believed that activation of IRF7 is also regulated by its phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). A previous study demonstrates that two IKK-related kinases, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inducible IKK (IKK<italic>i</italic>) are involved in phosphorylation of IRF7 as well as IRF3 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). <italic>TBK1</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/</sup></italic>
<sup>â</sup> cells failed to produce type I IFNs in response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimuli (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>â<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Nevertheless, we found that IFN-Î± production in response to CpG ODN in pDCs derived from mice deficient in TBK1 or IKK<italic>i</italic> was not impaired compared with that of wild-type cells (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Although further studies using mice lacking both TBK1 and IKK<italic>i</italic> will be required to exclude the possibility of redundancy (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), it is more plausible to believe that other kinases are involved in TLR7 and TLR9 signaling. On the other hand, it is reported that IRF7 is activated by the MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4)âc-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in response to UV and chemotherapeutic agents, which induce DNA damage (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). These observations imply that activation of IRF7 can occur downstream of MAPK cascades in response to some stimuli. However, the MAPK activation in response to TLR9 ligands was not impaired in <italic>Irak-1</italic>
<sup>â</sup>
<italic><sup>/Y</sup></italic> pDC, suggesting that another pathways are responsible for the activation of IRF7.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we showed that IRAK-1 phosphorylated IRF7 in vitro and the expression of IRAK-1 KN suppressed the activation of the IFN-Î±4 promoter induced by coexpression of MyD88 and IRF7. These data suggest that IRAK-1 might serve as a kinase for IRF7. However, we could not show endogenous phosphorylation of IRF7 by IRAK-1 because these experiments were technically difficult for small amounts of IRF7 expression and stimulus-dependent degradation of IRAK-1. Moreover, previous studies have suggested that introduction of IRAK-1 KN into IRAK-1âdeficient 293 cells can reconstitute responsibilities to IL-1 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Therefore, the possibility that the kinase activity of IRAK-1 is dispensable for IRF7 activation cannot be ruled out. Further studies will be required to clarify whether the kinase activity of IRAK-1 is necessary and sufficient for its function using IRAK-1 KNâexpressing pDCs.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our present study showed that IRAK-1 is a key regulator for TLR7- and TLR9-mediated IFN-Î± production in pDCs. These results provide possibilities that IRAK-1 would be an interesting therapeutic target for specific regulation of IFN-Î± production, which leads to the treatment of viral infection and autoimmune diseases.</p>

        <p>For flow cytometric analysis of FRET, HEK293 cells transfected with CFP and/or YFP fusion proteins as described above were resuspended in 293 expression media (Invitrogen) and measured YFP (excitation: 488 nm; emission: 530 nm), CFP (excitation: 407 nm; emission: 510 nm), FRET (excitation: 407 nm; emission: 535 nm) by using FAC aria (Becton Dickinson) and BD FACSDiVa software. FRET is shown as YFP emission obtained by CFP excitation divided by CFP emission by CFP excitation.</p>

        <title>Luciferase reporter assay</title>
        <p>HEK293 cells seeded on 24-well plates (10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were transiently transfected with 100 ng of the luciferase reporter plasmid together with a total of 900 ng of various expression vectors. Then, 36 h later, the luciferase activity in the total cell lysates was measured with Dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Renilla luciferase reporter gene (50 ng) was simultaneously transfected as an internal control.</p>

        <title>ELISA</title>
        <p>Flt3-BMDCs (10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) were stimulated for 24 h with various concentration of CpG oligonucleotide D35 and ODN1668. Concentrations of TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-12 p40, and IFN-Î± in the culture supernatant were measured by ELISA according to manufacturer's instructions (Genzyme for TNF-Î± and IL-12 p40, R&amp;D for IL-6 and PBL Bio Lab for IFN-Î±). Serum cytokine concentrations of IFN-Î± and IL-12 p40 were also determined by ELISA.</p>

        <title>In vitro kinase assay</title>
        <p>Two million HEK-293 cells were seeded on a 60-mm-diam dish. 24 h later, cells were transiently transfected with a total of 5.0 Î¼g of empty or the indicated plasmids (2.0 Î¼g of pFLAG-CMV2 IRAK-1 or IRAK-1, 4.0 Î¼g of pFLAG-CMV2 IRAK-4 or IRAK-4 KN), using Lipofectamine 2000 as specified by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, lysed, and then immunoprecipitated with protein GâSepharose together with 1.0 Î¼g of anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma-Aldrich) for 12 h by rotation. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and another three times with kinase assay buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM Î²-glycerophosphate). The immunoprecipitants were incubated with 2.0 Î¼g GST-IRF7 and 10 mCi [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (Amersham Biosciences) at 30Â°C for 30 min. Kinase reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and were separated on a 4 to 20% poly acrylamide gradient gel. Gel was detained, dried, and exposed to X-ray film.</p>

        <title>Flow cytometry</title>
        <p>For intracellular IFN-Î± and IL-12p40 staining, Flt3L-DCs were treated with 3 Î¼M D35 and cultured for 5 h. Golgi stop (BD Biosciences) was added for an additional 3 h and cells were collected and fixed in paraformaldehyde. Staining for IFN-Î± was performed in saponin-containing buffer using a mixture of rat antiâmouse IFN-Î± (clone F18, Hycult Biotechnology b.v., and clone RMMA-1; PBL Biomedical Laboratories), followed by biotinylated mouse antiârat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and Streptavidin-APC (BD Biosciences; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Staining for IL-12 was performed in saponin-containing buffer using antiâIL-12âPE (BD Biosciences). Cells were subsequently stained with anti-CD11c-FITC (clone HL3) and anti-B220âcychrome (clone RA3-6B2), and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).</p>
