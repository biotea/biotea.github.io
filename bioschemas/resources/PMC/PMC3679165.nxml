        <p>WD40-repeat proteins (WD40s), as one of the largest protein families in eukaryotes, play vital roles in assembling protein-protein/DNA/RNA complexes. WD40s fold into similar Î²-propeller structures despite diversified sequences. A program <bold>WDSP</bold> (<underline>WD</underline>40 repeat protein <underline>S</underline>tructure <underline>P</underline>redictor) has been developed to accurately identify WD40 repeats and predict their secondary structures. The method is designed specifically for WD40 proteins by incorporating both local residue information and non-local family-specific structural features. It overcomes the problem of highly diversified protein sequences and variable loops. In addition, WDSP achieves a better prediction in identifying multiple WD40-domain proteins by taking the global combination of repeats into consideration. In secondary structure prediction, the average Q3 accuracy of WDSP in jack-knife test reaches 93.7%. A disease related protein LRRK2 was used as a representive example to demonstrate the structure prediction.</p>

      <p>A WD40 repeat usually contains 40â60 residues with conserved GH (Gly-His) near its N-terminus and conserved WD (Trp-Asp) at its C-terminus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g001">
<bold>Figure 1A</bold>
</xref>, each such repeat folds into a 4-strand Î²-sheet. Sequentially, a WD40 repeat is composed of strands d(S<sub>d</sub>), a(S<sub>a</sub>), b(S<sub>b</sub>) and c(S<sub>c</sub>) in order but structurally S<sub>a</sub>, S<sub>b</sub>, S<sub>c</sub> and S<sub>d</sub>, are aligned from inside to outside. Loops connecting the sequential strands are called loop ab (L<sub>ab</sub>), loop bc (L<sub>bc</sub>), loop cd (L<sub>cd</sub>) and loop da (L<sub>da</sub>) in the text. Typically, each WD40 domain contains 7 (the most common) to 8 repeats, which fold into an encircled 7/8-bladed Î²-propeller structure. In few cases, WD40 domains only contain 6 repeats. The 7<sup>th</sup> repeat is provided by another protein to form an enclosed Î²-propeller, such as SEC13 <xref rid="pone.0065705-Hsia1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> or SEH1 <xref rid="pone.0065705-Brohawn1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Some WD40-repeat proteins (WD40s) have as many as 14 repeats. Examples are SRO7 <xref rid="pone.0065705-Hattendorf1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and AIP1 <xref rid="pone.0065705-Mohri1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which fold into two enclosed Î²-propellers.</p>

      <p>Due to their vital functions, a number of methods are available for detecting WD40 repeats from primary sequences. In 1994, Neer <italic>et al</italic> provided a regular expression for WD40 repeat identification <xref rid="pone.0065705-Neer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, which was successfully applied to annotate 29 WD40s. In 2000, 32 functional subfamilies were further identified to contain WD40 repeats <xref rid="pone.0065705-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Currently, the most widely used methods, PROSITE <xref rid="pone.0065705-Sigrist1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, Pfam <xref rid="pone.0065705-Coggill1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, SMART <xref rid="pone.0065705-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and REP <xref rid="pone.0065705-Andrade1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, are all providing annotation for WD40 repeats. Particularly, REP <xref rid="pone.0065705-Andrade1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> is one of the default annotation methods used in UniProt Database.</p>
      <p>However, the sequence diversity makes the identification of WD40 repeats difficult <xref rid="pone.0065705-Neer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Stirnimann1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Fulop1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In the Superfamily database <xref rid="pone.0065705-Gough1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 1222 proteins in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> have been annotated to contain 1305 WD40 domains. Their average pairwise sequence identity is only about 21%. The low sequence identity restricts the current methods from identifying the WD40 repeats completely. Even in reproducing WD40 domains with crystal structures, the average WD40 repeat number per domain ranges from 3.4 to 5.9. For example, DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2) is a 7-repeat WD40 protein with solved crystal structure (PDB code: 3EI4) <xref rid="pone.0065705-Scrima1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, only 5 repeats are identified by UniProt, REP and SMART and 3 repeats are detected by PROSITE and Pfam. Moreover, the detected WD40 repeats are normally shorter than they really are in its crystal structure. The missed parts of sequence impede the accurate slicing of WD40 domain. In addition, these repeat detection methods cannot provide domain topology information without knowing the secondary structure in the repeat.</p>
      <p>The topology of a WD40 domain can be established when its secondary structure is accurately predicted as well. Through over 50 years of development, the state-of-art secondary structure predicting methods have been improved dramatically <xref rid="pone.0065705-Pirovano1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The widely used methods, for example, GOR4 <xref rid="pone.0065705-Gibrat1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, PHD <xref rid="pone.0065705-Rost1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, PROF <xref rid="pone.0065705-Ouali1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, SSpro <xref rid="pone.0065705-Baldi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and PSIPRED <xref rid="pone.0065705-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, are able to provide reasonably good predictions. Especially for PSIPRED, the overall three-state accuracy (Q3) has reached 81.4% (Â±0.6%) <xref rid="pone.0065705-Buchan1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, accurate prediction of Î²-sheets remains a challenge compared with Î±-helixes, because Î²-sheets require hydrogen bonds between linearly distant residues. Some defects in the secondary structure prediction are usually observed in Î²-strand. The predicted Î²-strands are sometimes shorter, longer or shifted by several residues as compared with crystal structures. These defects lead to incorrect topology predictions, three-dimensional structure modeling and functional residue interpretation.</p>
      <p>The low sequence identity does not impede WD40s on folding into the similar structure, Î²-propeller. According the previous studies, one possibility is that they share some vital structural features. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g001">
<bold>Figure 1C</bold>
</xref>, the conserved hydrogen-bonded DHSW tetrad, formed by Asp-His-Ser/Thr-Trp <xref rid="pone.0065705-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and Î²-bulges <xref rid="pone.0065705-Wu3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> are indispensable for maintaining protein stability <xref rid="pone.0065705-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and provide binding ability <xref rid="pone.0065705-Wu3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Here, we present a fast, robust and accurate method, <underline>WD</underline>40-repeat protein <underline>S</underline>tructure <underline>P</underline>redictor (<bold>WDSP</bold>), which incorporates local residue propensities, nonlocal information of structural features and repeat number preference to enhance the prediction.</p>
      <p>Using this method, we are able to identify new WD40 repeats and domains from protein sequences. Over 2000 known WD40 repeats are identified in the Swiss-Prot database. In addition, the method also detects 76 novel WD40s in the database. For example, Tau 91 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was not detected to be a WD40 protein by the currently available methods, even though the crystal structure is available (PDB code 2J04). Finally, one disease related WD40 protein, LRRK2 <xref rid="pone.0065705-Mata1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Mata2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Webber1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, is used to demonstrate the capability of WD40 repeat annotation and secondary structure prediction.</p>

        <p>The WDSP method consists of three independent parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g002">

</xref>). The first part includes three scoring functions, which are used to comprehensively estimate the quality of predicted strands, repeats and domains. The second part is composed of multiple engines, which are able to remove the repeats with low scores and further combine optimal WD40 repeats into closure WD40 domains according to the scoring functions. The third part is the criteria that support the judgment of WD40 strands, repeats and domain.</p>

        <p>The first step of scoring function development is to establish a database of WD40 proteins with known crystal structures, which are classified by both CATH/SCOP and assignments from the literature. Every currently known WD40 protein has at least one DHSW tetrad H-bond network. By calculating their WD40 domain pairwise sequence identities, 33 WD40 proteins were selected in the training set (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065705.s005">Table S1</xref></bold>). These proteins have no more than 32% pairwise sequence identities in the WD40 domains. 239 WD40 repeats in 33 proteins have average 16% pairwise sequence identity (93.3% of repeats have less than 30% pairwise sequence identity). This ensures a statistically unbiased training set.</p>

        <title>Assignment of Secondary Structure Elements</title>
        <p>The second step is to assign four strands (S<sub>a</sub>, S<sub>b</sub>, S<sub>c</sub> and S<sub>d</sub>) and align the sequences according to their secondary structures. To avoid secondary structure assignment variation among different methods <xref rid="pone.0065705-Rost2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, we assign 239 WD40 repeats by using the structural features as âlandmarksâ. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g003">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>, the R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> of the WD<sub>bâa</sub> Î²-bulge were assigned as the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> residues of S<sub>a</sub>. The Ser/Thr residues in the tetrad and the X position in WD<sub>bâa</sub> were the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> residues of S<sub>b</sub>. The X positions of WD<sub>câd</sub> and Trp residue in the tetrad were assigned as the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> residues of S<sub>c</sub>. The 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> residues of S<sub>d</sub> are the R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> residues of WD<sub>câd</sub>. As usual, the length of each strand is kept to be six residues <xref rid="pone.0065705-Neer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Stirnimann1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus, the remaining residues in the Î²-strands can be assigned according to these landmarks.

        <title>The Generation of WD40 Repeat Sequence Logo</title>
        <p>In the secondary structure assignment, all six-residue Î²-strands were preferentially and exactly aligned. The left loop regions were aligned using the BLOSUM62 score matrix. For the loop region, we discard loops that are longer than 15 residues (less than 4% of the dataset). The remaining loops are then aligned by normal multiple sequence alignment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows the sequence logo of the WD40 repeat derived from these alignments.

        <p>In order to establish a reliable sequence logo, the potential fluctuation of amino acid frequencies needs to be excluded because the number of WD40 repeats with available crystal structures is limited. The consistency of the residue frequencies has been analyzed by dividing the dataset into two groups. One group contains 119 randomly chosen WD40 repeats and the remaining 120 WD40 repeats belong to the other group. Two sequence logos have been developed from each of the two groups. The similarity between two logos is then compared (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065705.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). This process was repeated 10 times with ten independent divisions of 239 WD40 repeats. The similarity coefficients of the ten pairs of logos are calculated. The similarity coefficient <italic>S</italic> between two distributions Xâ=â{<italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>}, Yâ=â{<italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic>} is calculated as:<disp-formula id="pone.0065705.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0065705.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>

        <p>S<sub>XY</sub> can be regarded as the value of cos(Î±). Î± is the angle between two 42Ã20 dimensional vectors X and Y (the sequence logo is composed of 42 residues in length with each of the 20 amino acids possible at every position), which represent two tested frequency logos. When and only when two distributions are the same after normalization, the similarity coefficient is S<sub>XY</sub>â=â1.</p>
        <p>According to our structural-feature-based assignment, the average S value is <bold>0.89</bold>. The self-consistent test indicates the sequence logo is reliable for developing the scoring function.</p>

        <title>The Scoring Functions in WDSP</title>
        <p>The scoring functions are applied to evaluate the probability of a sequence fragment to be a WD40 strand, a repeat or a domain. The score of a single WD40 repeat is composed of four terms: (a) the propensities of individual residues (<italic>S<sub>aa</sub></italic>) at the different positions on every strand and one WD40 repeat; (b) the preferences for different loop lengths (<italic>S<sub>loop_len</sub></italic>), (c) the existence of cooperative H-bonds within the DHSW tetrads (<italic>S<sub>corr</sub></italic>) and (d) the secondary structure score as given by PSIPRED:<disp-formula id="pone.0065705.e002"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0065705.e002.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>
</p>
        <p>
<italic>S<sub>aa</sub></italic> is the weighted sum of the amino acid propensities(on a logarithmic scale) at the 31 positions within a WD40 repeat, which include the 6Ã4 positions in the well aligned strands and some relatively conserved position in the loops.

<italic>P</italic>(<italic>l</italic>) is the probability of loop length <italic>l</italic>. The raw <italic>P</italic>(<italic>l</italic>) is smoothed and the logarithmic curve is fitted to an analytical function <bold>S1</bold> (marked by superscript â*â). For the same reason, a pseudo-count of 0.01 was added to all the frequencies of the loop length. Because long loops in crystal structures are very rare, the accurate statistical estimation of the distribution of long loops is difficult to obtain. To penalize long loops that have almost no appearances in the crystal structures, an empirical linear penalty function was added to the loop score <italic>S</italic>(<italic>l</italic>). The term <italic>t</italic>
<sub>0</sub> is selected to smooth the transition between the fitted function and the linear function. The intercept <italic>l</italic>
<sub>0</sub> is the loop length when the score in the fitted curve is lower than 1. And the slope <italic>t</italic> is adjusted according to the feedback of the secondary structure prediction result. The detailed values of <italic>S</italic>(<italic>l</italic>) are listed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065705.s006">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065705.s007">TableS3</xref></bold>.

<italic>S<sub>corr</sub></italic> is added to the scoring function if there is pentad, tetrad or triad in a repeat: <disp-formula id="pone.0065705.e007"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0065705.e007.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>
</p>
        <p>In equation (7), <italic>P<sub>SDHSW</sub></italic> is the probability of Ser/Thr, Asp, His, Ser/Thr and Trp existing simultaneously at five certain positions, obtained from the training set. Here, the subscript <italic>S</italic> represents both amino acids Ser and Thr. The five positions for SDHSW pentads are Sc1, Lcd2, Lda3, Sb4 and Sc5, respectively.</p>
        <p>For each position in the strands, <italic>S<sub>PSIPRED</sub></italic> is calculated as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0065705.e008">equation (8</xref>).<disp-formula id="pone.0065705.e008"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0065705.e008.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>
</p>
        <p>The result of PSIPRED is mainly used for the prediction of strand d in the repeat. In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0065705.e008">equation (8</xref>), the PSIPREDâs confidence value (<italic>conf</italic>) and predicted state (E: sheet, C: coil, H: helix) of each position are used in the predicted strands. The scaling parameters were manually adjusted to accept that <italic>S<sub>PSIPRED</sub></italic> mainly affects strand d prediction. Because the sequence of strand d is much less conserved, the sequence logo is unable to identify strand d as efficient as other strands. Without <italic>S<sub>PSIPRED</sub></italic>, WDSP can still predict over 90% of Sa, Sb and Sc correctly, but drops to 60% for Sd. In comparison, PSIPRED can predict all strands with similar accuracy. Thus, our purpose is to determine Sd with the use of <italic>S<sub>PSIPRED</sub></italic>. The contribution of <italic>S<sub>PSIPRED</sub></italic> is well balanced by applying the current coefficients (0.1, â0.025, â0.1) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0065705.e008">equation 8</xref>. It contributes â¼65% for the score of Sd, but only 26.6% for the score of Sa, Sb and Sc and 16% of <italic>S<sub>repeat</sub></italic>. As a result, it enhances the Q3 accuracy by 1.5% of WDSP in the prediction of secondary structures.</p>
        <p>The scoring function for an entire WD40 domain contains the scores <italic>S</italic>

</p>
        <p>The additional term <italic>R</italic>(<italic>N<sub>rep</sub></italic>) serves as a regulator for the repeat combination in the genetic algorithm to treat complete domains with regular 7-fold numbers of repeats. This term does not affect the score of generated repeats. A majority of WD40 domains are composed of 7 repeats, but 6 and 8 repeats are also possible. Because there are not enough available crystal structures for the reasonable statistics of WD40 domains with six and eight repeats, and no PDB structures for other repeat numbers, an accurate statistical analysis is not possible. For the consideration of multiple WD40 domains in one protein, we chose 5 overlapping Gaussian functions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0065705.e010.jpg"/></inline-formula>to give the original guess of the <italic>R</italic>(<italic>N<sub>rep</sub></italic>) (blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g005">
<bold>Figure 5</bold>
</xref>). Then, we manually modified these values to get better repeat detection for the training set. This term is added to make the genetic algorithm engine more efficient in the repeat combination. And in the final step, <italic>R(N<sub>rep</sub>)</italic> was removed. As a result, only 3 out of 239 repeats are missed by WDSP by incorporating the modified curve (red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g005">

        </fig>
        <p>The second step is to generate all the possible WD40 repeats with <italic>S</italic>
<sub>repeat</sub>&gt;10. 10 is a fairly conservative value because the scores of true WD40 repeats in the PDB structures normally ranges from 30 to 150 (101 on average). Some repeats are discarded as they overlap with the other repeats with a score higher than 35. By these steps, there are normally 500â2000 repeats left in the library.</p>
        <p>The third step is a preliminary exclusion of non-WD40 proteins. If the highest score of all generated repeats is less than 45, the sequence is defined not to be a WD40 protein. Otherwise, the combination of repeats will start.</p>
        <p>To limit the size of the repeats pool for more efficient domain optimization, the generated repeats are further filtered by a threshold T:<disp-formula id="pone.0065705.e011"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0065705.e011.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>S<sub>max</sub></italic> is the maximum score of all repeats in the library and <italic>N</italic> is the total number of repeats. The repeats are discarded as their scores are less than T. Usually, more than half of repeats are discarded in this procedure.</p>
        <p>The genetic algorithm (GA) <xref rid="pone.0065705-Goldberg1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> was utilized to combine the remaining repeats into domains. In the GA process, each repeat is an individual in the first generation. Mutation, crossover and elongation operators are used to combine multiple repeats into one individual. Thus, the repeat number in individuals grows in the evolution process. If the best ten individuals in a generation converge to be identical one, the GA procedure converges. If the optimized domain has less than 7 repeats and the threshold T is larger than 10, the T value will be re-set to 10 and the GA process restarts. Finally, a sequence is determined to contain a WD40 domain(s) if the prediction fulfills two criteria: 1. it has more than 6 repeats; 2. the average score of repeats (<italic>S<sub>corr</sub></italic> is not included) is not less than 48 or at least one DHSW tetrad is found.</p>
        <p>The threshold number 48 is determined based on the discrimination power between the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). All proteins with crystal structures in the PDB database ranging from 250 to 2000 residues under a 95% sequence identity cutoff are used for the test. Totally, there are 13007 unique proteins in this group. The average value of <italic>S<sub>repeat</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0065705.e001">equation (1</xref>), without counting the <italic>S<sub>corr</sub></italic>, is used to discriminate the True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g007">
<bold>Figure 7</bold>

        <title>Validation of WD40 Repeats Detection</title>
        <p>In order to test the capability of WDSP in identifying WD40 repeats, a jack-knife test has been carried out to predict repeats composed of 33 WD40s in our training set. The results are further compared with currently well-accepted methods; UniProt, SMART, Pfam and PROSITE. Both loose and tight criteria are applied for the evaluation. In the loose criterion, a WD40 repeat is considered successfully identified if S<sub>a</sub>, S<sub>b</sub> and S<sub>c</sub> are found in the sequence. In the tight criterion, a predicted WD40 repeat is required to contain S<sub>a</sub>, S<sub>b</sub>, S<sub>c</sub> and S<sub>d</sub>.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g008">
<bold>Figure 8</bold>
</xref>, WDSP has higher accuracy than UniProt and SMART, although their performances are much better than those PROSITE and Pfam. Under the loose criterion, WDSP is able to identify 234 out of 239 repeats (97.9% accuracy). In comparison, UniProt and SMART have 89.1% and 80.8% accuracy, respectively. For the tight criterion, the advantage of WDSP is further demonstrated. WDSP correctly identified 207 out of 239 repeats (86.6%). In comparison, SMART and UniProt only have 72.4% and 32.2% accuracy, respectively. The remarkable reduction indicates that these methods have defects on determining the strand d in WD40 repeat. Although UniProt can identify most of WD40 repeats in the loose criterion, a majority of them are shorter than their lengths in reality. The detailed results are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065705.s009">Table S5</xref></bold>. As a result, WDSP has a better performance in WD40 repeat identification, especially by the tight criterion.</p>

        <title>Validation of Secondary Structure Prediction</title>
        <p>The accuracy of secondary structure prediction was compared with five well-known secondary structure prediction methods, GOR4, PHD, PROF, SSpro and PSIPRED. Q3 criterion <xref rid="pone.0065705-Rost1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> was used to evaluate the secondary structure prediction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g009">
<bold>Figure 9</bold>
</xref> shows the Q3 values achieved by the different methods. For a comprehensive comparison, DSSP, STRIDE and structural-feature-based secondary structure assignments were applied to evaluate the predictions. As expected, WDSP has the highest accuracy (Q3â=â94.6%) using the structural-feature-based assignment. As the secondary structure is assigned by DSSP or STRIDE, only PSIPRED performs slightly better than WDSP. Thus, WDSP is excellent in predicting the secondary structure for the WD40 domain. Interestingly, although all these methods except for WDSP were trained based on DSSP or STRIDE, they all got better performance under the structural feature-based secondary assignment. It suggests that the structural-feature-based assignment may provide more representative secondary structures of WD40s than DSSP and STRIDE.</p>

<bold>Figure 9</bold>
</xref> also shows most of methods have good performance for the secondary structure prediction for the WD40 domain. PSIPRED and WDSP have almost reached the general upper limit of the prediction accuracy of 88% <xref rid="pone.0065705-Rost3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. This is because WD40 domains only contain two types of secondary structures, Î²-strands and loops. The upper limit should be higher than the normal value. Another possibility is that all the above methods have utilized their crystal structures in the training set. Therefore, the accuracy would be the reproduction rate.</p>
        <p>The ASr can be further used to estimate the secondary structure accuracy. A good correlation (R<sup>2</sup>â=â0.64) has been found between the ASr and their Q3 accuracy of 33 WD40 proteins in the training set (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065705.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>).

        <title>The Jack-knife Test of Secondary Structure Prediction</title>
        <p>To exclude the overestimation of accuracy by reproduction, a jack-knife test has been carried out. The test utilizes 32 WD40s as the training set and the left out one WD40 as the test set. This procedure has been repeated 33 times until every protein is predicted once. The resultant secondary structures are compared with the reproductive prediction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g010">
<bold>Figure 10</bold>
</xref>, the x and y-axis show the reproductive rate and the jack-knife result, respectively.

The accuracy is almost identical to the average reproduction accuracy of 94.6% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g009">

        <p>The good performance in the jack-knife tests can be rationalized by two reasons. 1. Although the selected proteins in our dataset are highly diversified in sequence, the residue frequencies are relatively stable on the basis of structural-feature-based alignment. Thus, the scoring function would be invariant. 2. The structural features, such as tetrads, Î²-bulges and total number of blades, are fairly conserved across the family. Thus, their preferences can be derived from limited protein structures. Both are the major components of <italic>S<sub>repeat</sub></italic> in scoring function (1).</p>

        <title>The Prediction of WD40 Domains in the Swiss-Prot Database by WDSP</title>
        <p>Besides the accurate prediction of WD40 repeats and secondary structures, one of our goals is to identify the missing/new WD40 repeats in the known/unknown WD40 proteins.</p>
        <p>Before we tested its capability in identifying WD40 proteins from the UniProt protein database, an estimation of prediction accuracy was carried out. Two datasets were prepared for tests. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0065705-t001">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>, the positive dataset contains 1402 proteins, which are composed of WD40 domains with a sequence identity cutoff of 50%. Only 16 WD40 proteins are not identified by WDSP, the False Positive rate is around 1.14%. In the negative dataset, itâs composed of 2496 all-Î² proteins and 4669 all-Î±, Î±+Î², Î±/Î² proteins. The homologues are deleted with the sequence identities of more than 30%. Only 4 proteins with all-Î² sheets are predicted to be WD40s. None of proteins with Î±-helix are falsely predicted to be WD40s. Thus, the false positive and the false negative are controlled at a very low level.</p>

Apparently, the number of WD40 repeats is considerably underestimated in a WD40 domain by these methods. As a matter of fact, SMART and UniProt have a better performance than PROSITE and Pfam in identifying WD40 repeats. However, 30% and 39% WD40 proteins are predicted to have less than six repeats by SMART and UniProt, respectively.</p>

        <p>More significantly, WDSP predicts a large number of proteins with multiple WD40 domains. According to prediction, 280 proteins have two WD40 domains, 12 proteins have three WD40 domains and three proteins have four WD40 domains.

Although the majority of WD40 proteins are commonly identified, 351, 182 and 81 WD40 domains failed in being identified by Pfam, SMART and UniProt, respectively.

None of four methods has classified it to be a WD40 protein. Undoubtedly, tau91 is quite different from the typical WD40 proteins in the sequence. But it shares some WD40 conserved structure features in common. Although Tau91 is short of a DHSW tetrad, a hydrogen-bounded triad is formed by D488-H463-T484 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g013">
<bold>Figure 13</bold>
</xref>. In the typical WD40 proteins, F494 is usually replaced by W or Y to form the D488-H463-T484-W/Y494 tetrad. According to the previous results, D488-H463-T484 is able to provide remarkable stability <xref rid="pone.0065705-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Meanwhile, X and R<sub>2</sub> of WD<sub>b-a</sub> Î²-bulges have the similar residue preferences. Some R<sub>1</sub> residues, such as W367 and L468, are protruded to the surface and readily for protein-protein interaction. By incorporating non-local information of structural features, WDSP overcomes the sequence diversity and classifies tau91 as a WD40 domain (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065705.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>).</p>
        <p>Since we have tested the general performance of WDSP in predicting Swiss-Prot proteins, we used a WD40 protein LRRK2 as an example to show how WDSP performs in predicting difficult targets. LRRK2 is a multi-domain protein whose mutations are frequently found in familial and sporadic Parkinsonâs disease <xref rid="pone.0065705-Mata1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065705-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Thus, LRRK2 could be a potential therapeutic target for drug design <xref rid="pone.0065705-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Currently, the crystal structure of LRRK2 WD40 domain is not available. Although LRRK2 is known for years to contain a WD40 domain, until now no existing method has given a high quality prediction of the WD40 repeats and its detailed topology.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g014">
<bold>Figure 14</bold>
</xref> shows the secondary structure prediction and repeat detection results of LRRK2 protein by different existing methods. The different methods give very variable predictions. Some positions predicted to be a Î²-strand by one method are predicted to be a Î±-helix by another method. Almost all predicted Î²-strands by WDSP are supported by one or more other methods, which indicate that its prediction is likely to be reliable. Among the existing WD40 repeat detection methods, PROSITE, Pfam, SMART, REP and UniProt, only SMART has identified one WD40 repeat (the 3<sup>rd</sup> repeat). However, WDSP identified all 7 repeats in LRRK2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065705-g015">

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Protein structure is the basis to understand the interaction of WD40-repeat proteins. Accurate secondary structure prediction is a bridge to 3D structure prediction. A number of methods are available to predict either WD40 repeats or secondary structures, which provide the preliminary information for biological studies and structure prediction. The currently available methods usually have defects in identifying comprehensive repeats/sequences for the WD40 domains because these domains have extremely diversified sequences due to their variable binding capabilities. In addition, the predictions are unable to provide biofunctional/structural information directly. Here, a method, WDSP, has been developed to identify WD40 repeats and predict its secondary structure simultaneously. By incorporating the specific structure/function-sequence information, WDSP is able to overcome the problem of diversified sequences, variable loop lengths and even identify atypical WD40 domains. Thus, WDSP provides a useful tool for structure/function prediction of WD40 domains. The method also provides a novel solution for specific protein families, especially for that composed of repeated motifs. As long as the structure-sequence correlation can be correctly recognized, the repeats and secondary structure can be predicted accurately.</p>
