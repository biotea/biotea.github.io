        <p id="P3">Discovery of most autosomal recessive disease genes has involved analysis of large, often consanguineous, multiplex families or small cohorts of unrelated individuals with a well-defined clinical condition. Discovery of novel dominant causes of rare, genetically heterogenous developmental disorders has been revolutionized by exome analysis of large cohorts of phenotypically diverse parent-offspring trios <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Here we analysed 4,125 families with diverse, rare, genetically heterogeneous developmental disorders and identified four novel autosomal recessive disorders. These four disorders were identified by integrating Mendelian filtering (identifying probands with rare biallelic putatively damaging variants in the same gene) with statistical assessments of (i) the likelihood of sampling the observed genotypes from the general population, and (ii) the phenotypic similarity of patients with the same recessive candidate gene. This new paradigm promises to catalyse discovery of novel recessive disorders, especially those with less consistent or nonspecific clinical presentations, and those caused predominantly by compound heterozygous genotypes.</p>

    <p id="P4">We previously noted an exome-wide excess of inherited loss-of-function (LOF) variants in 1,133 individuals with undiagnosed rare developmental disorders (DD)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> but recessive DDs were typically only observed in a single family <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. This N=1 problem for recessive disorders has been well-recognised <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. We hypothesized that by increasing sample size we would observe recurrent instances of both known and novel recessive disorders.</p>
    <p id="P5">Here we describe an exome analysis of 4,125 mainly simplex families with severe DDs recruited through Clinical Genetics services in the UK and Ireland. Clinical phenotype was systematically recorded using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. 1,053 of these families had plausibly causative <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in known disease genes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>). To identify candidate recessive genes in the remaining 3,072 families all rare (minor allele frequency, MAF, less than 1%) biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) protein-altering variants were identified in each proband. We observed 74 candidate recessive genes where at least one allele was predicted to be LOF in two or more families.</p>

Furthermore, we identified (<italic>DEPDC5</italic>) or confirmed (<italic>COL9A3</italic>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) apparently recessive forms of dominant disorders. This phenomenon of rare recessive forms of dominant disorders has been described previously <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P7">To rigorously assess the evidence supporting each candidate recessive gene, we developed a statistical approach that integrates the probabilities of sampling the observed genotypes and phenotypes by chance (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">We classified protein-altering variants (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) into two groups of predicted functional consequences: LOF and âfunctionalâ (i.e. protein-altering but not likely LOF, e.g. missense). The probability of drawing N unrelated families with similar biallelic genotypes by chance from the general population, was estimated as the probability of sampling two rare alleles by chance N times from 3,072 random draws using Hardy-Weinberg rules for estimating expected genotype frequencies from allele frequencies (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>). We estimated this probability separately for two classes of recessive genotype: biallelic LOF and compound heterozygous LOF/functional. First we calculated the cumulative frequency of rare LOF and missense variants using the Exome Aggregation Consortium dataset. The gene-specific cumulative allele frequencies from the ExAC dataset (European, non-Finnish, ancestry) were highly concordant with the frequencies from unaffected parents (of European ancestry) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), showing that the datasets are comparable. Our method corrects for gene-specific levels of autozygosity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) and takes account of population structure by matching each proband within the DDD cohort to one of four continental populations within the ExAC dataset (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>). We demonstrated that our method is well-calibrated by showing that the number of biallelic rare synonymous genotypes observed in probands closely follows the null distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">We estimated the probability of sampling N probands from unrelated families with the observed clinical phenotypic similarity using the sum of the maximum Information Content (maxIC) among pairwise comparisons between probandsâ HPO terms as a summary metric and compared to a null distribution of N probands sampled randomly from among the 4,295 probands studied here (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>). We demonstrated that this metric is informative by comparing probands sharing protein-altering <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in the same gene to permuted data in which the proband-gene relationship is scrambled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">We integrated the p values obtained from the genotypic and phenotypic assessments described above using Fisherâs method (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In effect, these analyses are testing each and every gene in the genome we can annotate (N=17,370), under two models (biallelic LOF and LOF/functional compound heterozygote), and so we set a conservative threshold for genome-wide significance of 1.44e-6 (0.05/17,370/2). At this threshold, we identified two genes exceeding genome-wide significance, <italic>HACE1</italic> and <italic>KIAA0586</italic>, neither of which had previously been implicated in Mendelian disease in humans.</p>
    <p id="P11">We identified eight individuals in six families with compound heterozygosity for two apparent LOF variants (N=7) or a LOF and missense variant (N=1) in <italic>KIAA0586</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Five out of the six families had a suspected diagnosis of Joubert syndrome (MIM 213300) with a typical molar tooth sign on brain MR images present in all but one of the affected individuals. Ataxia, hypotonia and Duane anomaly were reported features in several of the affected individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12"><italic>KIAA0586</italic> encodes TALPID3, which is a centrosomal protein required for ciliogenesis and sonic hedgehog signaling <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Other genes associated with Joubert syndrome are similarly critical for cilia function <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Mouse homozygous for a null mutation in the gene encoding Talpid3 lack cilia and are embryonic lethal, dying during organogenesis with randomized left-right patterning; typical characteristics of a ciliopathy <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. All patients were compound heterozygous, sharing the same LOF variant, p.(Arg143Lysfs*4). This variant was observed at a MAF of 0.4% (383/96534) in ExAC, more frequent than the cumulative MAF of other LOF variants in KIAA0586. Therefore we hypothesise that homozygosity for this allele is likely embryonic lethal and that our patients are compound heterozygous for a null allele and a hypomorphic allele.</p>
    <p id="P13">We identified three individuals from three families with biallelic rare LOF variants in <italic>HACE1</italic>, and an additional family with a homozygous inframe deletion of a single codon in three affected siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). These variants were associated with intellectual disability and significant abnormality in resting muscle tone; five of the six affected individuals had a combination of hypotonia, dystonia and spasticity. Only one (281381) of the six affected individuals was ambulant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Brain MR images show brain atrophy and variable hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>)</p>
    <p id="P14"><italic>HACE1</italic> encodes a HECT domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, expressed in brain. Notably other brain expressed HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligases have also been associated with intellectual disability <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. HACE1 regulates Rac1, a small GTPase with diverse roles in signaling. A homozygous knock-out mouse model of <italic>HACE1</italic> has been described <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which has almost complete pre-weaning lethality, of unknown mechanism.</p>
    <p id="P15">We also identified four genes (<italic>MMP21</italic>, <italic>PRMT7</italic>, <italic>CSTB</italic> and <italic>COL9A3</italic>) with suggestive initial evidence (p&lt;1e-4) but not meeting genome-wide significance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), two of which were previously implicated recessive causes of DDs (<italic>CSTB</italic> and <italic>COL9A3</italic>). We further evaluated <italic>MMP21</italic> and <italic>PRMT7</italic> with co-segregation studies, deeper clinical assessment and animal models, and found compelling evidence for recessive causation.</p>
    <p id="P16">We identified two individuals and one fetus from two families compound heterozygous for different LOF and missense variants in <italic>MMP21,</italic> which encodes a matrix metalloproteinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Both affected individuals and the affected fetus presented with visceral heterotaxy (situs ambiguous; MIM 306955), including complex heart malformations. The missense mutations lie in close proximity in the conserved zinc-binding site, both predicted to have a major impact on enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Biallelic damaging variants in <italic>MMP21</italic> have been identified in heterotaxy patients in an independent study (Chris Gordon pers comm).</p>
    <p id="P17">MMP21 has been suggested to function during embryogenesis, and as a matrix metalloproteinase, may modulate cell proliferation and migration through regulating extracellular matrix remodeling <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Two heterotaxy mutant mouse models, Miri and Koli, were recovered from a phenotype-based mutagenesis screen with pathogenic <italic>Mmp21</italic> missense mutations in the zinc binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Mutants exhibit visceral heterotaxy with heart defects commonly associated with heterotaxy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). While heterotaxy can arise from motile cilia defects, videomicroscopy of the embryonic node showed normal cilia motility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Movie</xref>), suggesting Mmp21 acts downstream of motile cilia.</p>
    <p id="P18">We identified six affected individuals from three families with compound heterozygous LOF/LOF or LOF/functional variants in <italic>PRMT7.</italic> The associated clinical phenotype is a phenocopy of pseudohypoparathyroidism [PHP; MIM 103580, also known as Albright Hereditary Osteodystrophy, AHO]. Mild intellectual disability with obesity and symmetrical shortening of the digits and posterior metacarpals and metatarsals were observed, similar to the acrodysostosis seen in PHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Two families shared the same variant at the last base of the first coding exon, which may induce aberrant splicing rather than a missense change (Arg32Thr). <italic>PRMT7</italic> encodes an arginine methyltransferase with several histone substrates <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Protein modeling indicates that all the observed missense variants are likely to be damaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Shortly after birth (at P10), PRMT7 knock-out mice display significantly reduced body size, reduced weight (-48%), and shortened 5th metatarsal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). These mice are subviable with only about 45% the expected number of <italic>Prmt7<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> pups found at P14. The surviving adult <italic>Prmt7<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice exhibit increased fat mass, reduced length and limb bone anomalies, concordant with the human phenotypes. In addition, reduced bone mineral content and density was observed in <italic>Prmt7<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice, and early onset osteoporosis is observed in AHO. All six affected individuals are female and notably the mouse model exhibits markedly sexually dimorphic phenotypes including bone mineral content, density and 5<sup>th</sup> metacarpal length changes only significant in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Moreover, a strong female bias has been observed in other AHO-like disorders<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P19">Discovering rare autosomal recessive disorders is challenging, especially for genetically heterogeneous disorders in outbred populations with small families. Only a small fraction of the predicted &gt;1,000 autosomal recessive intellectual disability disorders have yet been discovered <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. New strategies for discovering novel recessive disorders are required. We have proposed the combined use of large-scale ascertainment of small families with diverse clinical presentations, exome sequencing and integrated probabilistic analysis of genotypic enrichment and phenotypic similarity. Integrating genotype and phenotype matching increased power to detect novel recessive disorders while not overly penalizing discovery of new disorders that result in variable or nonspecific clinical presentations (e.g. <italic>HACE1</italic>). Most (10/19) of the families we described here with one of the six recessive disorders shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> had a single affected child, nonetheless, these families were enriched for affected siblings compared to the entire cohort (p=6.3e-5, Poisson test), suggesting that including families with affected siblings within our cohort boosts power to detect recessive disorders.</p>
    <p id="P20">Our method for identifying novel recessive disorders requires systematic genotype and phenotype data on a known number of families, and cannot be applied when collating only partial genotypic or phenotypic data on selected families. Phenotypic diversity among families is fundamental for estimating the significance of phenotypic similarity for a given candidate gene. The power of this approach is maximal when recording of phenotype terms is complete and consistent. For example, the statistical significance of phenotypic similarity for <italic>PRMT7</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) is based on the initial HPO terms associated with individual 270360, which did not include annotation of the hand anomalies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Adding the HPO term âshort metacarpalâ post-hoc increases the significance of the phenotypic similarity p value considerably from 1.49E-03 to 7.00E-05, and consequently the combined genotypic and phenotypic p value for <italic>PRMT7</italic> becomes genome-wide significant (p=1.97E-07). Unbiased clinical re-evaluation of probands sharing the same candidate gene will likely remain valuable.</p>
    <p id="P21">Recruiting clinicians also recorded whether affected individuals were reminiscent of a recognized genetic syndrome, and for three of the recessive disorders described above, the same suspected syndrome was annotated recurrently (<italic>KIAA0586</italic> â Joubert; <italic>COL9A3</italic> â Stickler; <italic>PRMT7</italic> â Albrights Hereditary Osteodystropy). The statistical significance (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>) of shared syndrome annotation (<italic>KIAA0586</italic> â 1e-5 ; <italic>COL9A3</italic> â 4.2e-4; <italic>PRMT7</italic> â 8.2e-4) was greater than for HPO phenotype similarity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that computational phenotype analysis does not yet capture all of the âgestaltâ information utilized by experienced clinicians.</p>
    <p id="P22">Mouse mutants provided additional support for all four novel recessive disorders described above. In principle, similarity between HPO terms and mouse mutant phenotypes <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> could be incorporated into combinatorial genotypic and phenotypic significance testing <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. However, the current lack of consistent phenotyping data on all mouse mutants and the incomplete and biased gene coverage of mouse mutants could lead to significant biases.</p>
    <p id="P23">Comprehensive discovery of all autosomal recessive causes of DDs will require much larger datasets. Inevitably this will necessitate international collaboration and harmonizing of phenotypic data. The adoption of standard, interoperable phenotype ontologies, such as HPO, and, crucially, ensuring they are applied consistently, will be essential.</p>

Each pool was hybridised to SureSelect RNA baits (6541 samples with Agilent Human All Exon V3 Plus with custom ELID # C0338371, and 5903 samples with Agilent Human All Exon V5 Plus) with custom ELID # C0338371) and sequence targets were captured and amplified in accordance with manufacturerâs recommendations.

PCR and optically duplicated reads were marked using Picard (version 1.98) MarkDuplicates. Lanelets were spatially filtered to account for bubble artifacts and quality controlled (passing thresholds on percentage of reads mapped; percentage of duplicate reads marked; various statistics measuring INDEL distribution against read cycle and an insert size overlap percentage). Lanelets were then merged into BAMs corresponding to sampleâs libraries and duplicates were marked again with Picard after which they were then merged into BAMs for each sample.

        <p id="P37">We tested all genes (coordinates from GENCODE release 19) for enrichment of rare (minor allele frequency &lt; 1%), recessive LoF and functional (see above) genotypes in unrelated families. Because allele frequency can vary by population, and this affects the probability of randomly observing recessive genotypes, we calculated the cumulative frequency of rare alleles in each gene from the ExAC dataset version 0.3 (accessed 2015-02) in four ancestral populations: European (excluding Finns) - NFE; African - AFR; East Asian - EAS and South Asian - SAS. Different alternate alleles at multiallelic sites were examined separately, using the most severe consequence relating to each allele. We classified each undiagnosed DDD proband into one of these four ancestral populations by projecting them onto a principal component analysis of 1000 Genomes populations (using SNPRelate): AFR (N=109), EAS (N=15), NFE (N=2799) and SAS (N=297).</p>
        <p id="P38">Because rare recessive genotypes are much more likely to be observed in autozygous segments (inheriting DNA from a recent common ancestor from both parents, e.g. in the case of consanguinity), we used bcftools roh (version 1.0) to call autozygous segments across the entire exome, and determined the number of probands autozygous across each gene of interest. We then adjusted the probability of sampling two rare LoF alleles for the number of probands autozygous across each gene.</p>
        <p id="P39">The probability of drawing N unrelated families with recessive genotypes in the same gene by chance was estimated as the binomial probability (including autozygosity) of sampling two rare alleles of a specified functional category N or more times from random draws matched to our ancestral populations (i.e. 109 AFR, 15 EAS, 2799 NFE, 297 SAS). We determined the entire set of combinations by which N or more families could be distributed across the four ancestral populations, and the probability of observing each combination using population-specific frequencies. We summed these probabilities across all possible combinations to obtain an aggregate probability for sampling N or more families by chance.</p>

          <title>HPO phenotype similarity</title>
          <p id="P41">Clinical geneticists referring each proband into the DDD study systematically recorded phenotypes using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. These terms were used to assess the probability that probands sharing the same candidate recessive share more similar clinical phenotypes than expected by chance. Similarity testing used the Human Phenotype Ontology version 2013-11-30.</p>
          <p id="P42">The similarity of HPO terms between two individuals was estimated as the maximum information content (maxIC) from pairwise comparisons of the HPO terms for the two individuals. For each pairwise comparison of two HPO terms we determined the information content for the most informative common ancestor of the two terms. The information content is calculated as the negative logarithm of the probability of the termsâ usage (or any of its descendant terms) within the population of all 4,295 probands in the DDD study.</p>
          <p id="P43">The summary phenotype similarity score for a set of N probands was estimated as the sum of all the pairwise maxIC scores. The null distribution of this summary phenotype similarity score was simulated by randomly sampling sets of N probands and calculating summary scores as above. The p-value was calculated as the proportion of simulated scores greater than or equal to the observed score.</p>
          <p id="P44">We demonstrated that this summary phenotype similarity score is both informative and well-calibrated by comparing probands sharing protein-altering de novo mutations in the same gene to permuted data in which the proband-gene relationship is scrambled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). The permuted data closely follows the expected null distribution.</p>

          <p id="P46">In addition to HPO annotation, recruiting clinicians also annotated whether affected individuals were reminiscent of a recognized phenotypically-defined syndrome. These suspected syndrome annotations were initially standardised to correct, for example, misspellings and abbreviated syndrome names.</p>
          <p id="P47">The similarity of suspected syndrome terms between two probands was calculated as the negative logarithm of the observed probability of selecting the rarest matched syndrome term between the probands. The observed probability of selecting each term was calculated as the frequency with which the term was used in the probands with at least one suspected syndrome. We compared the similarity of the probands for each candidate recessive gene to a null distribution constructed by simulating 100000 permutations of randomly sampling probands from the set of probands with at least one suspected syndrome.</p>

        <title>Combining genotype-phenotype assessment p values</title>
        <p id="P48">For each gene, we integrated the p-values obtained from the genotypic and phenotypic assessments described above using Fisherâs method. For the genotypic tests, we had performed tests for two models (biallelic LoF and LoF/functional compound heterozygote). We selected the more significant genotypic test for each gene, since some genes had only biallelic LoF probands, while other genes only had LoF/missense compound heterozygotes. These analyses effectively are testing each and every gene in the genome, under the two models, and so we set a conservative threshold for declaring genome-wide significance of 1.44 x 10<sup>-6</sup> (0.05/(17,370*2)).</p>

Where no hits with a high sequence homology were found, only the relevant domains were used for searching and the sequences of the matches recorded. For modeling PRMT7, a mouse structure with high sequence identity was found for the whole sequence (PDB ID: 4C4A). For MMP21 and HACE1 HECT domain, multiple template sequences were selected for modeling since the sequence identity was borderline for modeling (~30-40%).</p>

The white dashed box and white lines indicate the expanded region of the same image illustrating the âmolar toothâ shape of the brainstem that is considered characteristic of Joubert syndrome in Families 1, 2, 4 and 5. In family 6 the brainstem shape is atypical for Joubert syndrome. The DECIPHER ID is indicated in all images. Informed consent was obtained to publish photographs. <bold>B.</bold> A cartoon depicting the protein domain structure of KIAA0586 (1533 aa) encompassing TALPID3 chain (100-1,343; in blue), which includes a highly conserved Region (467 â 554 aa; in orange) required for centrosomal localization and two coiled-coil (182-232 &amp; 467-501 aa; in yellow) domains. A red asterix (coding region variant) or dashed line (essential splice site) is used to indicate the position of each pathogenic mutations identified in the families above.</p>

        <p><bold>A.</bold> Family structures and genotypes of four families. The DECIPHER ID is given for each recruited affected individual. NT indicates an individual who has not been tested from the family mutations in <italic>HACE1</italic>. Where available an anterio-posterior (AP) facial photographs and a transverse section from the brain MR is given below the family tree. The elder sibling in Family 4 is also recruited to DDD but on recruitment was considered to have a different disorder from his brother, primary microcephaly. Where available photographs of the face, hands and feet are presented. Saggital and transverse sections from the brain MR is given below the family tree. The saggital images show hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and the transverse images show an apparently reduced brain volume due to paucity of white matter. Informed consent was obtained to publish photographs.</p>
        <p><bold>B.</bold> Protein domain structure of HACE1 (909 aa) encompassing 6 Ankyrin repeats (in orange) and 1 HECT (E6AP-type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase) domain (574 â 909 aa; in blue). A red asterix indicates the position of each pathogenic mutation.</p>
        <p><bold>C.</bold> Prediction of mutation consequence on tertiary protein structure based on PDB IDs: 4bbn and 3tug. The HECT domain is highly conserved and all models share the same fold. The deletion of Leu 832 has significant effect on the fold of the protein. This mutation disrupts the helix by perturbing the hydrophobic core of the domain. This suggests that the mutated protein (ÎLeu832) is unlikely to have the same fold.</p>

The Ile285Thr mutation causes loss of hydrophobicity and weaker interactions with neighbouring non-polar amino acids (green) and should cause movements of surrounding residues potentially leading to conformational shifts that affect Zn2+ binding.</p>
        <p><bold>C.</bold> Protein structure (569aa) encompassing signal peptide (1-24 aa; in orange), propeptide (25- 144 aa; in grey) and matrix metalloproteinase-21 chain (145 â 569 aa; in blue) that includes 4 Hemopexin repeats, with the positions of the human mutations shown above, and positions of ENU-induced mutations in mice shown below.</p>
        <p><bold>D.</bold> Necropsy picture of a <italic>Miri</italic> mutant with dextrocardia with anterior positioning of the aorta (Ao), indicating transposition of the great arteries (TGA), right lung isomerism, inverted liver lobation (1-3), and dextrogastria (Stm). Confocal episcopic microscopy showed: <italic>Miri</italic> mutant exhibiting dextrocardia with TGA (<bold>E</bold>) and atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) (<bold>F</bold>), <italic>Koli</italic> mutant with double outlet right ventricle (<bold>G</bold>), <italic>Miri</italic> mutant with dextrocardia with TGA and hypoplastic right ventricle (<bold>H</bold>), mutant with anomalous right subclavian artery from pulmonary trunk (<bold>I</bold>), and mutant with duplicated inferior vena cava (IVC) draining into bilaterally symmetric right atria, indicating right atrial isomerism (<bold>J</bold>).</p>

        <p><bold>A.</bold> Pedigrees and genotypes of three families. The DECIPHER ID is given for each recruited affected individual. The father in Family 3 had a cleft lip which is thought to be coincidental. AP facial photographs of the affected individuals are given below the pedigrees. In Family 2 and 3 pictures of the foot show shortened posterior metatarsals. In Family 3 a photo of the hand of an affected individual shows brachydactyly with short metacarpals. Informed consent was obtained to publish photographs.</p>
        <p><bold>B.</bold> Protein domain structure of PRMT7 (692 aa) encompassing two active S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (SAM or AdoMet-MTase) PRMT-type domains (14 â 345 aa; in blue &amp; 358 â 684 aa; in orange). Red asterixes indicate the positions of pathogenic mutations.</p>
        <p><bold>C.</bold> Data derived from mice homozygous for a targeted inactivation of <italic>Prmt7</italic> (null; <italic>Prmt7<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic>). DEXA scanning at 14 weeks of age indicates: female null mice have a reduced bone mineral content (top left graph), both male and female null mice have elevated fat mass (as a percentage of total body mass; top right graph) and reduced body length as determined by distance from nose to the base of the tail (bottom right graph). X-Ray images from 14 week old mice show that the length of the 5<sup>th</sup> metacarpal was reduced in female null mice only. Box-and-whiskers plots show min-mean-max values. P-values presented are either global adjusted p-values for genotype, or (for sexual dimorphism) the p-value for the interaction between sex and genotype.</p>
