<italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) catalyzes the conversion of AcCoA and L-glutamate to CoA and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-L-glutamate (NAG), an obligate cofactor for carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) in the urea cycle. NAGS deficiency results in elevated levels of plasma ammonia which is neurotoxic. We report herein the first crystal structure of human NAGS, that of the catalytic <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (hNAT) domain with <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-L-glutamate bound at 2.1 Ã resolution. Functional studies indicate that the hNAT domain retains catalytic activity in the absence of the amino acid kinase (AAK) domain. Instead, the major functions of the AAK domain appear to be providing a binding site for the allosteric activator, L-arginine, and an <italic>N</italic>-terminal proline-rich motif that is likely to function in signal transduction to CPS1. Crystalline hNAT forms a dimer similar to the NAT-NAT dimers that form in crystals of bifunctional <italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamate synthase/kinase (NAGS/K) from <italic>Maricaulis maris</italic> and also exists as a dimer in solution. The structure of the NAG binding site, in combination with mutagenesis studies, provide insights into the catalytic mechanism. We also show that native NAGS from human and mouse exists in tetrameric form, similar to those of bifunctional NAGS/K.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
<italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS, EC 2.3.1.1) catalyzes the conversion of AcCoA and glutamate to CoA and <italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamate (NAG). In microorganisms and plants, NAG is further converted to NAG phosphate by NAG kinase (NAGK, EC 2.7.2.8) to continue the L-arginine biosynthetic pathway <xref rid="pone.0070369-Slocum1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070369-Cunin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, in mammals, NAG has an entirely different role as the essential cofactor for carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) in the urea cycle <xref rid="pone.0070369-Haskins1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Perhaps because NAG plays different roles in lower organisms and mammals, L-arginine has opposing regulatory effects on their NAGS enzymes. In bacteria, particularly those that use the linear pathway for L-arginine biosynthesis, NAGS is feedback inhibited by the end product, L-arginine. Conversely, in mammals, L-arginine enhances the NAGS activity <xref rid="pone.0070369-Haskins1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Phylogenetic analysis of NAGS protein sequences classifies them into two distinct types: bacteria-like, classic NAGS and vertebrate-like NAGS <xref rid="pone.0070369-Qu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Most bacterial and plant NAGS belong to the former, with high sequence similarity to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> NAGS. The second type includes not only vertebrate NAGS, but also fungal NAGS and NAGK, and bacterial bifunctional NAGS/K. Nevertheless, in spite of structural similarities of the second type NAGS of various species, it is still inhibited by L-arginine in microorganisms that utilize it.</p>
      <p>Previously, we determined the structure of NAGS from <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (ngNAGS<italic>)</italic> and showed that this type of NAGS has a hexameric quaternary structure and that each subunit has two distinct domains: an <italic>N</italic>-terminal amino acid kinase (AAK) domain and a <italic>C</italic>-terminal <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (NAT) domain <xref rid="pone.0070369-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The AAK domain has a structure similar to those of various <italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamate kinases (NAGK), but it is devoid of NAGK activity. It also has an L-arginine binding site similar to those in L-arginine sensitive NAGK structures <xref rid="pone.0070369-RamonMaiques1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The NAT domain has a typical GCN5-related NAT fold and a site that catalyzes NAG synthesis which is located &gt;25 Ã away from the L-arginine binding site <xref rid="pone.0070369-Min1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We have also previously determined the structures of bifunctional NAGS/K from <italic>Maricaulis maris</italic> (mmNAGS/K) and <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> (xcNAGS/K) <xref rid="pone.0070369-Shi2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Surprisingly, bifunctional NAGS/K oligomerizes to form a novel tetramer. Although the subunits of NAGS/K have similar structures to ngNAGS subunits with two distinct domains, their domain-domain linkers and relative domain orientations are different from those of ngNAGS. Inhibition by L-arginine of NAGS/K was proposed to result from changes in the relative orientations of AAK and NAT domains that close the AcCoA binding site.</p>
      <p>Even though extensive efforts have been made to determine the mammalian NAGS structure, it has proven challenging because the complete protein is unstable in solution. We succeeded in obtaining stable and functional human NAGS NAT domain (hNAT) (residues 377â534) with NAG bound at 2.1 Ã resolution. This structure and related mutagenesis experiments allowed us to define the catalytic mechanism. We have also confirmed by cross-linking and gel-filtration experiments that both human and mouse NAGS have tetrameric oligomeric structures similar to bifunctional NAGS/K. Therefore, the mechanisms that L-arginine uses to activate mammalian NAGS and inhibit bifunctional NAGS/K may be similar despite its disparate effects on the catalytic function.</p>

        <p>hNAT has detectable NAGS activity with a <italic>V</italic>

AcCoA and L-glutamate titration experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g001">Figure 1</xref>) indicate that the absence of the AAK domain affects AcCoA binding affinity so that hNAT has a slightly higher apparent <italic>K</italic>

AcCoA binding for hNAT shows significantly cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 1.9Â±0.2, in contrast to the complete hNAGS which shows no cooperativity <xref rid="pone.0070369-Caldovic1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Oligomerization State in Solution</title>
        <p>To determine the states of oligomerization of both complete NAGS and the NAT domain in solution, cross-linking and analytic gel filtration experiments were performed. Cross-linking experiments using dimethyl suberimidate or suberic acid bis(3-sulfo-<italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide ester) sodium salt showed at least four bands on SDS-PAGE gels for both human and mouse complete NAGS, with molecular weights corresponding to oligomers of 1, 2, 3 and 4 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Gel filtration experiments also demonstrated that complete hNAGS and mNAGS exist primarily as tetramers in solution. The molecular weights of mNAGS and hNAGS calculated from the standard curve are 199.2 and 220.1 KDa, respectively, consistent with tetramer molecular weights of 195.8 and 202.4 KDa for mNAGS and hNAGS, respectively. Molecular weights of mNAT and hNAT calculated from the standard curve are 36.2 and 36.1 kDa, respectively, implying they exist as dimers in solution since molecular weights of mNAT and hNAT dimers calculated based on the expected amino acid sequenced are 36.1 kDa matching the observed weight. The results are consistent with those for bifunctional mmNAGS/K and xcNAGS/K and imply that the hNAGS and mNAGS have similar tetrameric architectures to mmNAGS/K and xcNAGS/K in solution.</p>

        <title>NAG Binding Site</title>
        <p>The electron density map was readily interpretable with NAG visible at the enzyme active site. NAG binds in a cavity surrounded by the central Î²-sheet (strands Î²16 and Î²17), the loop connecting helices Î±11 and Î±12, and the <italic>C</italic>-terminal segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The side-chains of five residues, Lys444 from the strand Î²16, Arg474 and Arg476 from strand Î²17, Asn479 from the loop connecting Î²17 and Î±14 and Lys401 from the loop connecting helices Î±11 and Î±12 are involved in hydrogen bonding to NAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0070369-t003">Table 3</xref>). The main-chain O of Asp443 and Arg473 and the main-chain N of Phe445 and Arg476 are also involved in positioning NAG by anchoring different functional groups of NAG. The side-chains of Phe399, Leu442, Trp498 and Phe525 form hydrophobic interactions with the side-chain of NAG holding the side-chain in place. These extensive hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions place NAG or L-glutamate in the right position and orientation to facilitate the catalytic reaction and define the specificity of hNAGS. All these residues are either invariant (Phe399, Leu442, Asp443, Lys444, Phe445, Arg474, Arg476, Asn479, Trp498 and) or conservatively substituted (Lys401 and Phe525) in vertebrate-like NAGS. However, in contrast to bacterial-like NAGS such as <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> NAGS <xref rid="pone.0070369-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, hNAGS uses different residues to bind NAG, supporting the hypothesis that the NAT domains of vertebrate-like and bacterial-like NAGS evolved from different ancestors.</p>

        <title>CoA Binding Site</title>
        <p>Even though 10 mM CoA was present in the crystallization solution, no continuous electron density corresponding to CoA was observed in the â<italic>V</italic>-shapedâ groove where the pantetheine moiety of CoA usually binds, probably due to suboptimal conditions for CoA binding. However, the unambiguous identification of NAG in the expected site suggests that CoA is likely to bind in a site similar to those found in other GCN5-related acetyltransferases. Structural comparison of hNAT with the NAT domain of ngNAGS, which has both substrates bound, allows identification of the CoA binding site and development of a model of the catalytic mechanism. Superimposition of the hNAT with the NAT domain of ngNAGS clearly indicates that the pantetheine moiety of CoA interacts with the protein through hydrogen bonds with the main-chain nitrogen of Phe445 and the main-chain oxygen of Val447 from Î²16, in a way similar to an anti-parallel Î²-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The thiol sulfur is oriented in a position within hydrogen bonding range of the side-chains of Tyr495 and Ser475. One water molecule (w37) was identified occupying the thiol sulfur position in the present structure, 3.4 Ã away from the acetyl carbon and perpendicular to the acetyl group plane of NAG. The structure is consistent with hNAGS using a one-step direct attack catalytic mechanism to transfer the acetyl group from AcCoA to the amino group of L-glutamate, as is the case for most members of the GCN5-related NAT family. The pyrophosphate moiety appears to be in proximity to the sequence Gln452âGly453âGln454âGly455âSer456âGly457âGln458, which conforms to (Arg/Gln)-Xaa-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-(Gly/Ala) motif for AcCoA recognition and binding in known GCN5-related <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferases <xref rid="pone.0070369-Neuwald1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Because of the absence of AcCoA or CoA binding, this part of structure varied significantly among different subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Upon AcCoA or CoA binding, the structure needs to adjust in order to bind the pyrophosphate moiety. The side-chains of Gln454 and Gln458 of this motif, as well as Trp484, seem to be involved in positioning CoA. The adenosine moiety of CoA is located on the surface of the protein, as seen in other GCN5-related NAT structures <xref rid="pone.0070369-Dyda1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Comparison of the NAT Domain Structures of Human NAGS and mmNAGS/K</title>
        <p>The overall hNAT structure is similar to that of mmNAGS/K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0070369-t002">Table 2</xref>) and can be aligned with an RMS deviation of â¼1.0 Ã, even though different subunits in mmNAGS/K have different relative orientations of the AAK and NAT domains <xref rid="pone.0070369-Shi2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The major structural differences occur in the loop regions (Î±12âÎ²14, Î²16âÎ±13, Î²15âÎ²16 and Î²19âÎ±15 loops). The significant conformational changes in the pyrophosphate moiety binding motif in the loop connecting Î²16 and Î±13 demonstrate the high flexibility in this region in the absence of AcCoA binding, as shown in the variation among different subunits. The conformational changes of the side-chain position of Arg476 may be functionally significant. In all mmNAGS/K subunits, the side-chain of Arg388 (the equivalent residue of Arg476) points outwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g006">Figure 6</xref>) whereas in the NAG bound hNAT structure, this side-chain moves towards the substrate binding site to anchor the Î³-carboxyl group of NAG. Another interesting difference is in the Î±12âÎ²14 loop in which two more residues are present in hNAT compared to mmNAGS/K. The side-chain of Arg414 of this loop swings towards the NAG binding site to form a hydrogen bond with the side-chains of Asp433 and Asp443. At least 8 nearby water molecules link the amino nitrogen of NAG to the side-chains of Tyr441, Asp443, Lys444, Ser524, Arg414 and Ser410 in a string that extends to the protein surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). As proposed for serotonin <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase <xref rid="pone.0070369-Hickman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, this chain of water molecules may be a âproton wireâ to ferry away a proton from the substrate and facilitate a nucleophilic attack on AcCoA.</p>

        <p>Since the Î±-amino group of L-glutamate has a pKa value that is close to 10, it seems clear that amine deprotonation must precede the acetyl group transfer. The highly conserved Tyr441 located in the water channel that connects to the Î±-amino group (see previous section), is positioned to play a role as the catalytic base in proton removal. The lower activity of Y441F mutant is consistent with this catalytic role of this tyrosine. The 7 fold lower activity for N479A mutant confirmed that it is a key residue to bind L-glutamate as found in the present structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

        <title>Mechanism of L-arginine Regulation</title>
        <p>Since hNAGS and mNAGS have similar oligomeric structures (tetramers), as demonstrated in our cross-linking and gel-filtration experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g002">Figure 2</xref>), and the dimer architecture of hNAT is similar to the NAT-NAT domain interface in mmNAGS/K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070369-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), the quaternary structure of hNAGS and mNAGS is likely to be similar to that of bifunctional mmNAGS/K. L-arginine binding may also cause rotation of the NAT domain towards to the AAK domain in mammalian NAGS, but to a lesser degree than in mmNAGS/K to allow AcCoA to bind to the active site, because the domain linkers of mammalian NAGS and bacterial bifunctional NAGS/K consist of different amino acids. The enhancement of NAGS activity by arginine in mammalian NAGS may be caused by increasing the AcCoA binding affinity via favorable hydrogen bonding interactions of residues in the AAK domain, facilitated by the conformational changes induced upon arginine binding.</p>

        <title>Roles for the AAK Domain</title>
        <p>The major role of NAGS in the urea cycle is to produce the essential cofactor, NAG, to activate CPSI. Among the three mitochondrial enzymes of the urea cycle, NAGS is the least abundant by far, thousands fold lower than CPSI and OTCase. Since the NAT domain alone has catalytic activity and is stable, an interesting question arises: why has the AAK domain remained intact through evolution? Even though activity assays demonstrate that the AAK domain enhances NAGS activity 6 to 12 fold, this may not be the major reason since an increase in enzyme abundance could compensate for lower activity. A more probable explanation is a regulatory role of the AAK domain in urea cycle flux. Complete hNAGS has two extra features relative to hNAT that may play a role in regulating urea cycle flux. First, the binding of L-arginine enhances NAGS activity and the arginine-binding site that is located in the AAK domain is conserved in NAGS across phyla <xref rid="pone.0070369-Qu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In microorganisms, arginine biosynthesis is regulated via this arginine binding site because bound L-arginine is an allosteric inhibitor of NAGS activity <xref rid="pone.0070369-Min1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is therefore reasonable to assume that in mammals, urea cycle flux can be rapidly enhanced via increased NAGS activity by L-arginine binding at this site. Our <italic>N</italic>-carbamylglutamate (NCG) clinical trial experiments demonstrated that NCG could enhance urea cycle flux even in healthy individuals <xref rid="pone.0070369-AhMew1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, implying that under normal conditions, CPSI is not fully saturated with NAG. Increasing NAG production will therefore increase urea production by activating additional CPSI molecules. Second, the presence of a proline-rich region in the <italic>N</italic>-terminal sequence of mammalian NAGS (AAK domain) may be important in interacting with CPSI to facilitate NAG translocation from NAGS to CPSI. Proline-rich motifs often serve as targets for protein recognition and interaction since they are recognized by many proteins, including important signaling proteins such as Src homology 3 <xref rid="pone.0070369-Kaieda1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, the WW domain of a kinase-associated protein <xref rid="pone.0070369-Macias1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, Enabled/VASP (EVH1) <xref rid="pone.0070369-Prehoda1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and ubiquitin-E2-like variant (UEV) domain of the tumor maintenance protein Tsg101 <xref rid="pone.0070369-Schlundt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Crystal structures of these motifs demonstrate that they are usually exposed to solvent and have a collagen-like polyproline type II (PPII) extended conformations. Most of these PPII motifs are involved in protein-protein interactions that seem important for signal transduction and metabolic regulation <xref rid="pone.0070369-Adzhubei1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Clinical Implications</title>
        <p>This study demonstrates that hNAT is stable and has catalytic activity. The results are consistent with previous observations about potential effects of hNAGS missense mutations in patients. Missense mutations in the AAK domain are usually âmilderâ than mutations in the NAT domain and are usually associated with âlate-onsetâ clinical presentation <xref rid="pone.0070369-Caldovic2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. All missense mutations associated with neonatal-onset, severe manifestations identified so far are located in the NAT domain. While the NAT domain plays a key role in NAGS activity and is mainly encoded by the last three exons of the human gene, the mitochondrial peptide signal and the proline-rich variable segment are encoded by the first exon of the gene <xref rid="pone.0070369-Caldovic3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus, a putative nonsense and out of frame mutations in the AAK domain (exons 2â4) might be rescued by exon skipping therapy that could restore the correct reading frame for encoding the NAT domain.</p>
