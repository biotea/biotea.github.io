        <p>Mitochondrial diseases collectively represent one of the most heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders. Symptoms can manifest at any age, presenting with isolated or multiple-organ involvement. Advances in next-generation sequencing strategies have greatly enhanced the diagnosis of patients with mitochondrial disease, particularly where a mitochondrial aetiology is strongly suspected yet OXPHOS activities in biopsied tissue samples appear normal. We used whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify the molecular basis of an early-onset mitochondrial syndromeâpathogenic biallelic variants in the <italic>HTRA2</italic> gene, encoding a mitochondria-localised serine proteaseâin five subjects from two unrelated families characterised by seizures, neutropenia, hypotonia and cardio-respiratory problems. A unifying feature in all affected children was 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA-uria), a common biochemical marker observed in some patients with mitochondrial dysfunction. Although functional studies of HTRA2 subjectsâ fibroblasts and skeletal muscle homogenates showed severely decreased levels of mutant HTRA2 protein, the structural subunits and complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain appeared normal. We did detect a profound defect in OPA1 processing in HTRA2-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting a role for HTRA2 in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and OPA1 proteolysis. In addition, investigated subject fibroblasts were more susceptible to apoptotic insults. Our data support recent studies that described important functions for HTRA2 in programmed cell death and confirm that patients with genetically-unresolved 3-MGA-uria should be screened by WES with pathogenic variants in the <italic>HTRA2</italic> gene prioritised for further analysis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitochondrial disorders can arise at any stage of life, often presenting with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Genetically and phenotypically, mitochondrial diseases collectively represent one of the most heterogeneous and common inherited groups of metabolic disorders. Due to the challenges of assessing and definitively assigning genotype-phenotype correlations in individuals, strategies to clinically and molecularly characterise patients are continually developing to provide a comprehensive molecular portfolio of bona fide variants causing mitochondrial disease. In recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have proven remarkably successful in identifying mutations in genes causing primary mitochondrial disorders, with more than 250 nuclear-encoded genes associated with mitochondrial syndromes identified to date (Mayr et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>). However, given the size of the human mitochondrial proteomeâcomprising â¼1300 gene products necessary to maintain mitochondrial functionâmany pathogenic candidate genes remain uncharacterised. This is highlighted by the many patients with mitochondrial disease still requiring a diagnosis, where the defective gene has not yet been established.</p>
      <p>3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA-uria) is a biochemical marker of mitochondrial dysfunction in the presence of suggestive clinical features (Wortmann et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">b</xref>). Isolated 3-MGA-uria represents a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders. Based on the pathological mechanism, 3-MGA-uria syndromes have been classified into two groups, âprimary 3-MGA-uriaâ associated with defects in leucine catabolism and âsecondary 3-MGA-uria(s)â that are not related to leucine degradation pathways (Wortmann et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">b</xref>). The secondary 3-MGA-uria syndromes may be distinguished into three different subtypes based on the underlying pathomechanism: (1) defective phospholipid synthesis and remodelling (SERAC1 defect or MEGDEL syndrome, TAZ defect or Barth syndrome and AGK defect or Sengers syndrome) (Barth et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>; Kelley et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1991</xref>; Mayr et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>; Wortmann et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2012</xref>); (2) mitochondrial membrane associated diseases (OPA3 defect or Costeff syndrome, DNAJC19 defect or DCMA syndrome and TMEM70 defect) (Anikster et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2001</xref>; Davey et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>; Cizkova et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>; Magner et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>) and (3) other mitochondrial proteins with unknown pathomechanism (CLPB defect) (Kanabus et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>; Wortmann et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2015</xref>)</p>
      <p>Recently, Mandel and colleagues (Mandel et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>) identified the first case of recessive variants in the <italic>HTRA2</italic> gene in four infants from two unrelated families. <italic>HTRA2</italic> encodes a mitochondrial-localised serine protease and its absence has been associated with 3-MGA-uria, infantile neurodegeneration, abnormal mitochondria and increased sensitivity to apoptosis (Mandel et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). The HTRA2 defect represents a novel cause of inborn error of metabolism with 3-MGA-uria as a discriminative feature with an unknown pathomechanism. Here we report two additional unrelated, consanguineous families in which the affected children carried novel bi-allelic pathogenic variants in the <italic>HTRA2</italic> gene, leading to 3-MGA-uria, seizures, hypotonia, neutropenia and cardio-respiratory difficulties.</p>

        <p>The proband subject 1 (hereafter S1) was the second (male) child of first cousin Pakistani parents who also have a healthy daughter (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). He was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy. Hypoglycaemia on day 2 resolved once feeding was established and he did not require any further investigations. He was discharged aged 6Â days but readmitted after 1Â week with poor feeding, apneas and excessive weight loss. He was treated with anti-reflux medication and discharged, but returned 2Â weeks later with recurrent apneas that progressed to central respiratory failure. On examination at 3Â weeks of age, he had bilateral cataracts, hypotonia, dysphagia and dystonic limb movements. Echocardiogram showed poor cardiac contractility. The child had a respiratory arrest at 2Â months of age and could not be resuscitated. In the family history, there are at least two other individuals who died in early infancy with similar medical problems as S1 but the details are not available.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Molecular genetics and biochemical studies of <italic>HTRA2</italic> variants. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Pedigrees of the two affected families with variants in the <italic>HTRA2</italic> gene.

</p>
        <p>Investigations showed normal liver function tests, ammonia 39 umol/L (normal range, 0â50 umol/L), CK 93Â IU/L (normal range, 0â229Â IU/L), LDH 379Â IU/L (normal range, 240â480Â IU/L) and a normal plasma amino acid profile. The urine organic acid profile showed increased excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid (levels not quantified) with normal excretion of 3-hydroxyisovalerate on three separate occasions. The child had a persistent neutropenia (1.1Ã10<sup>9</sup>; normal range, 2.0â6.0 Ã10<sup>9</sup>). Urine reducing substances was negative and GAL-1-PUT activity was normal. Lactate levels in the serum (1.1Â mmol/L; normal range, 0.7â2.1Â mmol/L) and CSF lactate (1.93Â mmol/L; normal range, &lt;2.0Â mmol/L) were normal. Cranial MRI at 3Â weeks of age was normal with appropriate myelination for a neonate and no abnormalities of the basal ganglia were detected.</p>
        <p>His male sibling was born a year later at term following a normal pregnancy. He developed breathing difficulties at 3Â days of age and similar feeding problems. He was fed via a nasogastric tube initially, but discontinued as the respiratory difficulties increased. He followed a similar clinical course to his brother and the parents declined further investigations and aggressive intensive care. He passed away at 3Â weeks of age.</p>

        <p>The proband, subject 2 (hereafter S2) was a male infant born to first cousin Mexican parents at 41Â weeks gestation following a normal pregnancy. Mother had two healthy children from a previous relationship (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). He was a large baby weighing 4360Â g at the 97.6 percentile line. Vaginal vertex delivery was complicated by shoulder dystocia resulting in a left Erbâs palsy and passage of fresh meconium, some of which was aspirated. Apgar scores were poor 1<sup>1</sup>, 1<sup>5</sup>, 2<sup>10</sup> and blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.14. Respiratory effort was weak, requiring intubation and artificial ventilation before transfer to a neonatal intensive care unit. Extubation on day 3 was unsuccessful due to hypercarbia and he required continued ventilator support for central hypopnea. He was unable to tolerate gastric feeds and received nutrition via a nasojejunal tube. Seizures began on day 5 and continued despite anticonvulsant medication. Cranial MRI revealed a widespread immaturity of cortical development with elevated lactate and lipid peaks on MRS. Skeletal muscle biopsy, performed at 2Â weeks, showed muscle denervation and atrophy. Echocardiogram demonstrated a large patent ductus arteriosus. Supportive care was withdrawn after 3Â months when he continued to demonstrate respiratory insufficiency and he died soon thereafter. Post mortem examination was declined. Metabolic investigation revealed persistent elevation of 3-methylglutaric and 3-methylglutaconic acids in urine. Additional metabolic studies showing normal results included plasma and urinary creatine and guanidinoacetate and plasma thymidine. Diagnostic genetic studies showed no known deleterious variants in <italic>TAZ</italic>, <italic>TMEM70</italic>, <italic>POLG</italic>, <italic>SUCLA2</italic>, <italic>SUCLG1</italic> or in mtDNA.</p>
        <p>The second affected infant in this family, subject 3 (S3), is the sister of the index case who was born by vaginal delivery at term weighing 3829Â g with Apgar scores of 1<sup>1</sup>, 1<sup>5</sup> and 8<sup>10</sup>. Although attempts at breast and bottle-feeding were noted to be poor she was discharged from hospital on day 3, only to be readmitted on day 7 with jaundice that required 2Â days of treatment. She was admitted again on day 27 with poor feeding, weight loss and suspected seizures. Respiratory function rapidly deteriorated on admission requiring intubation and artificial ventilation for a period of 2Â months, after which time she was discharged, only to be readmitted 2Â days later with seizure-like activity and respiratory failure. Palliative therapy was offered at home and she died 2Â days later aged 4Â months. A post mortem was declined. Urine organic acid analysis showed elevated 3-methylglutaric acid and 3-methylglutaconic acid.</p>
        <p>The third affected child in this family, subject 4 (S4), was a male born at 39Â weeks gestation by elective caesarean section for breech presentation. Apgar scores were good (7, 9) and the immediate postnatal period uneventful. However, on day 2, he developed profound bradycardia, tremors and clonus of both lower extremities. Urine organic acid analysis confirmed 3-methylglutaric and 3-methylglutaconic acids and he was rapidly transitioned to a palliative care pathway without further investigation. He died at home at the age of 3Â months. Post mortem was not performed.</p>

PicoGreen was used to visualise mitochondrial nucleoids and TMRM dye that is sequestered by active mitochondria allowed the visualisation of the mitochondrial network. Cells were washed in standard growth media containing 5nM TMRM and images captured using a 63x magnification oil immersion objective on an inverted point scanning confocal microscope (Nikon A1R). Z-stack images were processed and analysed by ImageJ. Images were binarised allowing the automatic quantification of mitochondrial morphological characteristics shown as the aspect ratio (AR) measuring mitochondrial length, perimeter and area.

        <title>Whole exome sequencing analysis identifies <italic>HTRA2</italic> variants</title>
        <p>DNA from S1 (family 1) was subjected to WES, with bioinformatic filtering of the raw data undertaken in a step-wise process to prioritise genes encoding proteins with a known or predicted mitochondrial localisation harbouring rare, recessively-inherited (compound heterozygous or homozygous) variants. This facilitated the identification of pathogenic <italic>HTRA2</italic> variants. S1 was homozygous for a c.906â+â1G &gt; C splice site variant, which disrupts the consensus donor splice site of intron 3 and leads to a complex, aberrant splicing pattern of <italic>HTRA2</italic> RNA transcripts (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>). Two abnormal splice products were observed following RT-PCR: one shorter product resulting from the activation of a cryptic splice site in exon 3 (removing nucleotides r.781_906 from this transcript) and a longer product resulting from complete retention of intron 3 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>). The predicted effects of these splicing patterns at the protein level are an in-frame deletion of 42 amino acids (p.Gly261_Asp302del) in the shorter transcript and translational read-through of intron 3 resulting in the inclusion of 34 amino acids until a termination codon is encountered at position 35 (p.Asp302_Phe303ins*35) in the longer transcript. There was no detectable evidence of a wild type transcript using this method. Testing of parental samples confirmed carrier status. A molecular diagnosis was made in the family whilst the mother was carrying her 6th pregnancy; prenatal testing (CVB biopsy) at 12Â weeks of gestation confirmed the absence of the c.[906â+â1G &gt; C];[906â+â1G &gt; C] <italic>HTRA2</italic> variant, and following a normal delivery this male child continues to develop well.</p>
        <p>In S4 (family 2), clinical WES identified a variant in <italic>HTRA2</italic> c.728_730delinsCAT; p.Leu243_Pro244delinsProSer in an apparently homozygous state. Parental samples were not available for segregation analysis, but affected sibling, S2 (family 2), was shown by Sanger sequencing to be homozygous for this variant consistent with a shared clinical phenotype. Both residues, p.Leu243 and p.Pro244, show evidence of being evolutionarily constrained with PhyloP scores above 2.0, and are situated within a highly conserved peptidase domain, whilst the mutation in this family does not appear to give rise to a frameshift or nonsense allele, thereby providing a trigger for nonsense-mediated decay.</p>

The loss of HTRA2 did not significantly affect the steady-state levels of investigated OXPHOS subunits (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a and b</xref>). Protein lysates from S1 fibroblasts and skeletal muscle revealed a marginal decrease in the levels of the complex I subunit NDUFB8 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In addition, a slight decrease was detected in the levels of the mitochondrial-encoded COXII component of complex IV subunit in S1 skeletal muscle (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Investigation of mitochondrial extracts from skeletal muscle tissue available from S2 revealed a slight decrease in the steady-state levels of COXI subunit of complex IV (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The levels of other investigated complexes (I, II, III and V) were normal in S2 skeletal muscle (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

        <title>Differential OPA1 proteolysis in <italic>HTRA2</italic> subjects</title>
        <p>Mitochondrial dynamics are regulated by a number of well-characterised, inner mitochondrial membrane proteins that facilitate continuous fission and fusion of mitochondria. A key player in this process is OPA1, a dynamin-related GTPase that regulates mitochondrial fusion, cristae structure and apoptosis (Olichon et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>; Frezza et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>). The balance between the levels of long-OPA1 (L-OPA1) and short-OPA1 (S-OPA1) cleavage products plays an important role in the fusion and fission processes, and previous studies have reported a physical interaction between HTRA2 and OPA1 in mammals (Kieper et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). Here, we examined the levels of OPA1 in the HTRA2-deficient tissues and found differential proteolytic processing of OPA1. In both, skin fibroblasts and skeletal muscle derived from S1, we detected increased amounts of S-OPA1 cleavage products (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The increased proteolytic processing of the L-OPA1 forms into S-OPA1 products in the subject samples suggest that HTRA2 may affect mitochondrial fusion and OPA1 proteolysis.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Analysis of mitochondrial morphogenesis and apoptosis. <bold>a</bold> The effects of loss of HTRA on OPA1 protein levels in control (C1, C2) and subject (S1) fibroblasts and skeletal muscle were analysed by SDS-PAGE (7Â %) and immunoblotting against the mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1.

        <title>Investigation of apoptosis in <italic>HTRA2</italic> subject fibroblasts</title>
        <p>HTRA2 has been reported to play an important role in the regulation of programmed cell death (Suzuki et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2001</xref>; Hegde et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2002</xref>; Martins et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2002</xref>; Kang et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2013</xref>; Mandel et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). The release of HTRA2 into the cytosol has been linked with both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent activation of apoptosis (Vande Walle et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>). To investigate the effect of loss of HTRA2 on apoptosis, studied subject fibroblasts (S1) were treated in the presence of an apoptosis-inducing agent, staurosporine. Following 8Â h treatment in the presence of 0.3Â Î¼M staurosporine, the cellular morphology of both, control and subject fibroblasts was altered compared to cells treated with vehicle alone DMSO. Staurosporine exposure induced cellular shrinkage and spherical cell bodies with thin stellate-like projections, whilst cells treated with DMSO alone had a typical flattened appearance (data not shown). Quantitative flow cytometry analysis of apoptotic cells in the absence of staurosporine did not show any significant increase in apoptosis in both control and subject fibroblasts (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>). Conversely, staurosporine treatment increased the sensitivity of HTRA2 deficient fibroblasts to apoptotic insults (2.5 fold) compared to control cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>). These data suggest that in the absence of HTRA2, cells are more susceptible to apoptosis, thus further supporting the purported role of HTRA2 in the regulation of apoptotic pathways.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Using WES, we identified the molecular basis of increased 3-MGA-uria in five individuals from two unrelated families presenting with a variety of phenotypes including neutropenia, hypotonia, dystonia, seizures, bilateral cataracts, central apneas, feeding difficulties and cardio-respiratory symptoms. The underlying genetic defect in both families was due to homozygous variants in the <italic>HTRA2</italic> gene, c.906â+â1G &gt; C; p.(Gly261_Asp302del,Asp302_Phe303ins*35) and c.728_730delinsCAT; p.(Leu243_Pro244delinsProSer), respectively.</p>
      <p>In adults, variants in <italic>HTRA2</italic> have been associated with development of tremor and Parkinsonâs disease (PD) (Unal Gulsuner et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>; Tzoulis et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>). Despite the identification of a large number of patients carrying PD <italic>HTRA2</italic> variants, the exact role of HTRA2 in PD still remains controversial (Kruger et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>). Recent studies have identified the first case of recessively-inherited pathogenic variants in the <italic>HTRA2</italic> gene [c.1211Â G &gt; A; p.(Arg404Gln) and c.1312_1316del; p.(Ala438fs)] in four infants from two unrelated families (Mandel et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). In many aspects, the clinical features of the individuals reported here very closely resemble those in the recent publication (Mandel et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). For example, affected children presented with dysphagia and recurrent apnea, hypotonia, bradycardia and seizures, whilst increased 3-MGA-uria was a prominent feature in all four subjects.</p>
      <p>
<italic>HTRA2</italic> encodes an ATP-independent serine protease that resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it acts in a protein quality control system. To date a number of mitochondrial disease causing genes involved in mitochondrial protein quality control have been identified. Among these are the heat shock protein/chaperonin CLPB (Kanabus et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>; Wortmann, Zietkiewicz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2015</xref>), the mitochondrial matrix peptidase CLPP (Jenkinson et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2013</xref>), subunits of the mitochondrial matrix m-AAA protease AFG3L2 and SPG7 (Cagnoli et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>; Pfeffer et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>) and the conserved heat shock protein 60 HSPD1 (Hansen et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>). Interestingly, patients harbouring variants in CLPB protease are characterised by increased 3-MGA-uria, neutropenia, epilepsy, cataracts and movement disorders, which are some of the prominent features found in the individuals presented here (Kanabus et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>; Wortmann et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2015</xref>). It is possible that the protease activity of HTRA2 could contribute to certain post-transcriptional modifications of proteins that are directly associated with inborn errors of metabolism with 3-MGA-uria as discriminative feature.</p>
      <p>The primary function of HTRA2 in mitochondria is to maintain mitochondrial protein homeostasis. However, studies have also reported that upon apoptotic stimuli, HTRA2 is recruited to the cytosol where it activates apoptotic caspases (Quiros et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>). Indeed, our results suggest that complete loss of HTRA2 in the studied subject (S1) fibroblasts leads to increased sensitivity to apoptosis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>). These findings are in agreement with recent studies showing increased apoptotic susceptibility in patients carrying recessive variants in <italic>HTRA2</italic> (Mandel et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>) and a mouse model lacking neuronal <italic>HTRA2</italic> (Kang et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>Human <italic>HTRA2</italic> variants had a mild, or no effect, on the steady state levels and assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in the fibroblasts and skeletal muscle homogenates studied here. Our findings show that loss of HTRA2 influences the proteolytic processing of the mitochondrial dynamics regulator OPA1. The ubiquitously expressed OPA1 is processed into L- and S-OPA1 protein products, each of which have a distinct role in the control of mitochondrial fission and fusion processes, cristae morphology and apoptosis (MacVicar and Langer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>). Mutated HTRA2 caused differential proteolytic cleavage of OPA1 resulting in a marked increase of S-OPA1 forms that have been associated with fragmented mitochondria. Despite the increased amounts of S-OPA1 cleavage products detected in <italic>HTRA2</italic> subjectsâ fibroblasts, we did not observe any significant changes in the mitochondrial network or ultrastructure. Although the exact role of HTRA2 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology is not clear and it requires further investigation, it can be hypothesised that HTRA2 indirectly mediates OPA1 cleavage, initiating a different mode of mitochondrial fission-fusion represented by transient fusion that is influenced by differentially expressed OPA1 levels (Liu et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>). During transient fusion events mitochondria rapidly exchange soluble contents whilst maintaining normal mitochondrial network (Liu et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>)âa mode observed in the fibroblasts derived from the individual carrying deleterious <italic>HTRA2</italic> variants.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we report the identification of deleterious, biallelic variants in the <italic>HTRA2</italic> gene encoding a mitochondria-localised serine protease. <italic>HTRA2</italic> variants represent a novel and significant cause of rapidly progressing, neonatal onset mitochondrial disease associated with 3-MGA-uria, hypotonia, dystonia, seizures and cardio-respiratory difficulties. WES is proving to be a powerful tool for investigating the genetic cause of mitochondrial syndromes in individuals with clinical evidence of mitochondrial disease, but no other supportive biochemical or genetic findings. Our findings confirm <italic>HTRA2</italic> to be an important candidate disease gene that should either be directly screened in patients with increased levels of 3-MGA, or variants in this gene identified by WES prioritised for further analysis.</p>
