      <abstract>
        <p>Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by occlusive lesions of the circle of Willis. To date, both environmental and genetic factors have been implicated for pathogenesis of MMD. Allelic variations in <italic>RNF213</italic> are known to confer the risk of MMD; however, functional roles of RNF213 remain to be largely elusive. We herein report that pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFNG and TNFA, synergistically activated transcription of <italic>RNF213</italic> both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using various chemical inhibitors, we found that AKT and PKR pathways contributed to the transcriptional activation of <italic>RNF213</italic>. Transcriptome-wide analysis and subsequent validation with quantitative PCR supported that endogenous expression of cell cycle-promoting genes were significantly decreased with knockdown of <italic>RNF213</italic> in cultured endothelial cells. Consistently, these cells showed less proliferative and less angiogenic profiles. Chemical inhibitors for AKT (LY294002) and PKR (C16) disrupted their angiogenic potentials, suggesting that RNF213 and its upstream pathways cooperatively organize the process of angiogenesis. Furthermore, RNF213 down-regulated expressions of matrix metalloproteases in endothelial cells, but not in fibroblasts or other cell types. Altogether, our data illustrate that RNF213 plays unique roles in endothelial cells for proper gene expressions in response to inflammatory signals from environments.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Moyamoya disease (MMD) represents a specific intracranial vascular disorder characterized by progressive, occlusive lesions of internal carotid arteries and branches in the circle of Willis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. To compensate the decreased blood flow in the affected brain area, the fine vascular network of <italic>Moyamoya</italic>, a Japanese word meaning âpuffs of smokeâ, develops as arterial stenosis progress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Earlier studies demonstrated that environmental factors including varicella zoster virus infection contributed to the development of MMD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. On the other hand, population-based studies pointed to the higher incidence of MMD in oriental populations than those in Caucasians, suggesting that certain genetic backgrounds may also confer the risk for the development of the vascular lesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
    <p>Genetic studies for MMD patients have been conducted to identify candidate disease susceptibility loci<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Notably, several groups have demonstrated that single nucleotide variations in the <italic>RNF213</italic> gene had a strong association with the onset of MMD in both familial and sporadic cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The human <italic>RNF213</italic> gene encompasses a 137,922-bp region at chromosome 17q25.3 (chr17:78,234,660â78,372,581) and consists of 68 exons with 67 protein-coding exons. The encoded 596-kDa protein, RNF213, harbors AAA-type ATPase, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and ring finger domains from its amino to carboxyl terminus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Because of the presence of ring finger domain(s), RNF213 is considered a member of E3 ubiquitin ligase protein family. Recently, RNF213 has been reported to be associated with angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>; however, little is known about its endogenous functions or its pathogenic roles in MMD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p>
    <p>To uncover the functional roles of RNF213 and pathogenic processes underlying MMD, we took advantage of bioinformatics approaches to analyze hundreds of transcriptomic data publicly available at open databases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The bioinformatics data predicted that RNF213 might act cooperatively with other molecules under inflammatory signals. Based on this unbiased prediction, we investigated whether RNF213 might respond to pro-inflammatory stresses. Through a series of functional studies, we herein propose that RNF213 links the gap between environmental risk factors for the onset of MMD and endogenous signaling that is essential for angiogenesis.</p>

        <title>RNF213 is associated with immune response</title>
        <p>We reasoned that identifying endogenous functions of RNF213 would facilitate our work towards unraveling the pathogenic mechanisms of MMD. To this end, we hypothesized that co-expression analysis can drive the prediction of functional pathways that RNF213 might regulate or be involved in. We took a bioinformatics approach to perform an unbiased analysis on the expression profile of <italic>RNF213</italic> in a large collection of human tissues and experimental conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the genes that showed highly correlated in expressions with <italic>RNF213</italic> was then performed to infer putative pathways where RNF213 might play a functional role (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We found that the GO categories of âimmune responseâ, âresponse to virusâ, âdefense responseâ, âinflammatory responseâ, and âinnate immune responseâ were significantly enriched and were consistently ranked at the top list of GO categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1</xref>). These data suggested that <italic>RNF213</italic> may be functionally associated with immune systems and/or virus defense. It was also noted that the GO term of âprotein kinase cascadeâ was significantly enriched in the co-expression analysis. <italic>RNF213</italic> was therefore likely co-regulated with other genes under stressed conditions, such as inflammation or infections.</p>

        <title>Pro-inflammatory cytokines activate the transcription of <italic>RNF213</italic>.</title>
        <p>Based on the bioinformatic prediction above, we next explored the exogenous ligands that may affect the endogenous expression of <italic>RNF213</italic> in cultured endothelial cells. We first stimulated HUVECs with various ligands for innate immunity or cytokines, including polyI:C, LPS, PMA/ionomycin, IFNA, IFNG, TNFA, TGFB, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-6, IL-18, and rapamycin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. We found that <italic>RNF213</italic> mRNA in HUVECs was significantly up-regulated when the cells were treated with IFNA or IFNG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Because TNFA was known to promote angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, we additionally examined <italic>RNF213</italic> mRNA level with co-stimulation of the cells with TNFA and IFNG. The result showed that TNFA and IFNG combination further enhanced the expression level of <italic>RNF213</italic>, supporting the synergistic effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on endothelial gene responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Similar results were also obtained in HCAECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The stimulatory effect of IFNG on the expression of <italic>RNF213</italic> in endothelial cells was verified at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We also tested whether the genes that were predicted to be co-regulated with <italic>RNF213</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were also up-regulated with such cytokine treatments. We randomly selected 15 genes (25.4%) from those listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, and appended <italic>IL-6</italic> as a positive control for the IFNG treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. We ensured that IL-6 expression was increased 1.6-fold to the basal level, and that all of the 15 genes were robustly induced by the IFNG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We also verified that the increase of <italic>RNF213</italic> mRNA was the result of transcriptional activation, rather than increased stability of mRNA, because a low-dose treatment with the RNA polymerase inhibitor, actinomycin D (500âÎ¼g/ml), efficiently blocked the acute increase in the amount of <italic>RNF213</italic> transcripts upon cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). We therefore concluded that the expression of <italic>RNF213</italic> was up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines in a transcription-dependent manner in cultured endothelial cells.</p>
        <p>We then investigated the relevance of these data to physiological and stressed conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>. In wild-type, 4-week-old female mice (C57BL/6), <italic>Rnf213</italic> proved to be expressed in various tissues, including brain, heart, great vessels, mononuclear cells and spleen. We verified that the heart was the organ with the highest expression of <italic>Rnf213</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). When we treated these mice with an intra-peritoneal injection of murine IFNG and TNFA, the mRNA level of <italic>Rnf213</italic> was significantly elevated at 6âhr after injection and rapidly declined within 24âhr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Intriguingly, the IFNG and TNFA injection activated the expression of <italic>Rnf213</italic> most prominently in heart and great vessels among other tissues. Together, these results demonstrate that <italic>RNF213</italic> is activated by inflammatory signals from the environment both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>AKT and PKR pathways up-regulate the transcription of <italic>RNF213</italic></title>
        <p>To identify the upstream pathway(s) that controlled the transcriptional activation of <italic>RNF213</italic> in response to cytokines, we treated HUVECs with various protein kinase inhibitors. These included LY294002 for PI3K-AKT, C16 for PKR, U0126 monoethanolate for MEK-ERK, AG490 for JAK-STAT, and SP600125 for JNK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Among them, LY294002 and C16 significantly suppressed the transcriptional activation of <italic>RNF213</italic> in endothelial cells upon IFNG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), and their inhibitory effects were dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). These data indicate that PI3K-AKT and PKR are two major upstream regulators of <italic>RNF213</italic> expression in endothelial cells, although it remains to be determined whether other unknown cascades might contribute to the transcriptional activation of <italic>RNF213</italic>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>RNF213 promotes endothelial cell proliferation</title>
        <p>We next investigated the biological impacts of RNF213 depletion in endothelial cells. To identify downstream events, we tested whether siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>RNF213</italic> may lead to aberrant expressions of endogenously expressed genes in endothelial cells. Administration of siRNAs to <italic>RNF213</italic> (siRNF213#1 and #2) for 48 hr resulted in profound decrease in RNA (13â46%) and encoded protein (0%), indicating the efficient and rapid degradation of <italic>RNF213</italic> transcripts in the host cells within the time window (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). We next performed transcriptome analysis of HCAECs upon treatment with siRNF213#1 or with a control siRNA. Overall, a total of 217 genes were up-regulated (&gt;2.0-fold change in expression), while 499 genes were down-regulated (&lt;0.5-fold change in expression), in the siRNF213#1-treated cells when compared to the control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The clustered gene matrix showed that differentially expressed genes between the test and control samples exhibited similar expression profiles within each group, indicating the high-confidence data of our transcriptome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>
        <p>To our surprise, a GO analysis highlighted the overrepresentation of cell cycle-associated genes among those aberrantly expressed in siRNA-treated HCAECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Specifically, âcell cycle processâ, âcell divisionâ, and âDNA replicationâ were listed among the top 5 GO categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). A KEGG pathway analysis also predicted that such gene expression changes might be linked to deregulation of cell cycle and its associated molecular pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Knowing that RNF213 might play an important role for cell-cycle progression in endothelial cells, we carried out the following three experiments to address this issue: First, quantitative (q) PCR assays successfully reproduced the microarray data. The expressions of <italic>CCNA2</italic>, <italic>CCNB1</italic> and <italic>CCNE1</italic> were decreased to 5.1% (pâ=â0.0002), 9.0% (pâ=â0.0038) and 28.1% (pâ=â0.0006) of control, respectively, when we knocked down <italic>RNF213</italic> in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Second, flow cytometry analyses for BrdU- and 7-AAD-labeled cells revealed that knockdown of <italic>RNF213</italic> caused remarkable decline in the proportion of cells in S-phase (9.3âÂ±â0.2%), when compared to control cells (14.5âÂ±â0.4%, pâ&lt;â0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In contrast, cells in static phases (G1 and G2+M) were significantly increased. The proportion of cells in Sub-G1 phase was decreased, indicating that apoptotic cells were not increased. Third, the MTS assays showed that <italic>RNF213</italic> knockdown led to a decrease in cell growth to 76.9âÂ±â5.9% of control in HCAECs (pâ&lt;â0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In contrast, cell growths were not disturbed with siRNA treatments of non-endothelial cells, such as HeLa, HCASMCs or fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
        <p>These data collectively provided evidence that RNF213 promotes cell proliferation through regulating its downstream pathways, and that endothelial cells are more susceptible to the functional loss of <italic>RNF213</italic> for cell growth than cells from other tissues. In agreement with these data, knockdown of <italic>RNF213</italic> was shown to decrease phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) in HUVECs and HCAECs, indicating lower activity of PI3K-AKT signal in endothelium. On the other hand, such difference was not observed in non-endothelial cells, HeLa, HCASMCs and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>).</p>

        <title>RNF213 is an upstream regulator of the matrix metalloproteinases</title>
        <p>Cell growth-promoting signals, including the PI3K-AKT pathway, are reportedly associated with the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This fact may support the cell-autonomous models of MMD, where functional deficits in endothelial RNF213 may lead to angiopathy as a consequence of persistently low PI3K-AKT activity. However, knowing that the endothelial AKT signals were not activated with the IFNG treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>), we hypothesized that RNF213 might mediate angiogenic responses of endothelial cells through PI3K-AKT-dependent and -independent mechanisms under inflammatory stresses. We therefore inspected minor changes in the microarray data searching for the genes that appeared to be independent of cell cycle and PI3K-AKT pathways.</p>
        <p>We found, among aberrantly expressed genes and GO categories, that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes were significantly up-regulated when <italic>RNF213</italic> was knocked down in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). We therefore examined the expression changes of <italic>MMPs</italic> (<italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>8</italic>, <italic>10</italic>, <italic>11</italic>, <italic>14</italic>, <italic>15</italic> and <italic>17</italic>) and of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (<italic>TIMP1</italic> and <italic>TIMP2</italic>) upon knockdown of <italic>RNF213</italic> in HUVECs. A qPCR assays confirmed that all <italic>MMPs</italic> herein tested were elevated following <italic>RNF213</italic> silencing. We primarily focused on MMP1 because <italic>MMP1</italic> was the most prominently up-regulated gene among other <italic>MMPs</italic> with siRNA treatments to <italic>RNF213</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This result was confirmed at the protein level when MMP1 protein level in the culture medium was measured by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Noticeably, such increase in <italic>MMP1</italic> expression was attenuated to 38.7% and 57.2% of control at the protein and RNA level, respectively, by pre-treatment with IFNG (pâ&lt;â0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). These results indicated that RNF213 controls the expressions of MMPs as an upstream regulator, and that RNF213 might play a potential role in angiogenesis through these effects on MMPs.</p>

        <title><italic>RNF213</italic> and <italic>MMP1</italic> expressions in fibroblasts from MMD patients</title>
        <p>To determine the relevance of above-described results to the pathogenic mechanisms of MMD, we asked whether the variant <italic>RNF213</italic> might have the properties of a hypomorphic allele. We used 4 fibroblasts from healthy volunteers and 2 from MMD patients. The 2 MMD fibroblast lines, but not the 4 controls, were heterozygous with the high-risk allele of <italic>RNF213</italic> (c.14756G&gt;A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In these lines, we confirmed that <italic>RNF213</italic> was similarly induced at mRNA level with IFNG treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The basal expression levels of <italic>RNF213</italic> as well as its response to the IFNG treatment did not differ between MMD and control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next compared the expressions of <italic>MMP1</italic> mRNA and protein in fibroblasts from MMD patients and healthy individuals. Surprisingly, one of fibroblasts from an MMD patient expressed higher amount of <italic>MMP1</italic> mRNA than controls (pâ&lt;â0.001), while the other fibroblast did not show significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Consequently, we obtained only a marginal difference in the <italic>MMP1</italic> expression between the MMD and control groups (pâ=â0.052, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). We observed the same trend for MMP1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>). These data appeared to support that <italic>MMP1</italic> expression varies in individual fibroblasts regardless of the <italic>RNF213</italic> genotypes. Alternatively, however, it might be also possible that the variant <italic>RNF213</italic> allele could affect only minimally the gene expressions in fibroblasts and other non-endothelial cells. In fact, indispensable functions of RNF213 were observed only in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>).</p>
        <p>We therefore suspected that <italic>RNF213</italic> might function as a dispensable molecule for regulating the <italic>MMP1</italic> expression in non-endothelial cells. To address this issue, we examined whether silencing of <italic>RNF213</italic> in fibroblasts might cause aberrant expressions of <italic>MMP1</italic>. As expected, <italic>MMP1</italic> mRNA expression was not altered with knockdown of <italic>RNF213</italic> in the fibroblasts from a healthy control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). We further confirmed that IFNG treatment did not result in deregulation of <italic>MMP1</italic> expression in fibroblast in the presence of siRNA for <italic>RNF213</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). These results were substantially identical in independent assays using fibroblasts from other healthy controls and MMD patients (data not shown). Knockdown of <italic>RNF213</italic> did not alter the expressions of <italic>MMP1</italic> in HeLa or HCASMCs, either (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>).</p>

        <title>Endothelial RNF213 controls angiogenesis through regulating the expression of <italic>MMP1</italic>.</title>
        <p>Although <italic>RNF213</italic> have been shown to be essential for normal vascular development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, it still remains unknown whether the angiogenic functions of RNF213 is associated with inflammatory signals. As previously reported, the matrigel system showed rapid morphological changes of HUVECs and HCAECs into vascular structures within 8âhr after inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Based on the previous data in this study, we predicted that functional loss of RNF213 or its upstream pathways might lead to deficits in such angiogenic responses. Indeed, we found that chemical inhibition of both PI3K-AKT and PKR pathwaysâthe two upstream regulators of RNF213âefficiently disrupted angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S11 and Supplementary Fig. S12</xref>). Moreover, we found that angiogenic potentials of HUVECs and HCAECs were nearly completely ablated by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>RNF213</italic> both in presence and absence of IFNG pre-treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>).</p>
        <p>Lastly, we determined if up-regulated MMPs might contribute to exaggerating the poor angiogenesis of HUVECs when <italic>RNF213</italic> was knocked down. To address this issue, we pretreated the cells for 48âhr with siRNA to knockdown the endogenous <italic>RNF213</italic>, and inoculated them onto the matrigels in the presence or absence of the MMP inhibitor, GM6001. We did find that the MMP inhibitor successfully restored the attenuated angiogenesis of HUVECs due to <italic>RNF213</italic> knockdown (0%) to 68.4% of control (pâ=â0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that disrupted angiogenesis of HUVECs by PKR and PI3K inhibitors were nearly completely restored by GM6001 (pâ&lt;â0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). Therefore, RNF213 promoted angiogenesis of endothelial cells through both cell cycle-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Among cell cycle-independent mechanisms, we identified MMP1 as one of the downstream effectors of RNF213 in endothelial cells for their angiogenic responses.</p>
        <p>Taken together, we concluded that <italic>RNF213</italic> was inducible by cytokine-mediated signals in both endothelial and non-endothelial cells. By contrast, the key gene expression changes for angiogenic responses were specific to endothelial cells, but not common with non-endothelial cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><italic>RNF213</italic> has been recently identified as an MMD susceptibility gene, but the pathogenic mechanism and the functional implications of the variant allele encoding the R4810K-mutant protein remain unresolved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In this study, we began by collating the expression profiles of <italic>RNF213</italic> from a massive set of transcriptomic data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The unbiased, genome-wide approach successfully detected extremely high signals of co-expression profiles for <italic>RNF213</italic> in conjunction with other genes that were previously associated with inflammatory responses, pointing out <italic>RNF213</italic> as a candidate gene that plays a role in pathways such as âinnate immune response (GO:0045087)â, âpositive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade (GO:0043123)â and âpositive regulation of defense response to virus by host (GO:0002230)â.</p>
      <p>We thus explored to validate such bioinformatic predictions through biological experiments: First, we found that acute administrations of TNFA and co-stimulations with other pro-inflammatory cytokines dramatically induced transcription of <italic>RNF213</italic> both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. These data were particularly important in that RNF213 might potentially connect previously known environmental factors of MMD to cell-intrinsic models for the disease onset. Experiments with chemical inhibitors for both PKR and PI3K-AKT pathways efficiently blocked the transcriptional activation of <italic>RNF213</italic> after the cytokine treatment, indicating epistatic regulation of <italic>RNF213</italic> by these pathways. We therefore tested whether <italic>RNF213</italic> and these molecular signals might interplay reciprocally in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>RNF213</italic> in endothelial cells did not affect PKR or PI3K expression in response to TNFA and IFNG co-stimulations. On the other hand, <italic>RNF213</italic> knockdown led to remarkable decrease in phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) signals, as previously suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. These data clarified the following two points: 1) RNF213 is a downstream target, and not an upstream regulator, of cytokine-mediated PKR pathway; and 2) RNF213 and PI3K-AKT pathway reciprocally interact with or without cytokine stimulations.</p>
      <p>Both PKR and PI3K-AKT pathways are major drivers of new protein synthesis, cell growth and autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Interestingly, endothelial autophagy is known to be essential for protecting endothelial cells from vascular insults and senescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In the present study, however, we were unable to obtain experimental data supporting the functional role of RNF213 in vascular autophagy (data not shown). Nonetheless, we anticipate that future experiments using <italic>Rnf213</italic>-knockout or its R4810K knock-in mice will provide robust evidence for these issues. The transcriptomic analysis on cultured endothelial cells in this study disclosed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous <italic>RNF213</italic> disturbed DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. These data supported an established concept that the cell-cycle progression of endothelial cells is correlated with their angiogenic properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Similarly, as the PI3K-AKT is a well-known pathway for cell growth, tumorigenesis and cancer-related angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, it is not surprising that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 hampered the angiogenic phenotypes of endothelial cells in this study. Notably, we found that the PKR inhibitor also prevented <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenesis. This finding recapitulated the modifying effects of PKR on angiogenesis through eIF2Î± phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. We further found that the PKR inhibitor did not suppress the cell-cycle associated genes (data not shown). Together, it was suggested that RNF213 functions as a common downstream effector of PKR and PI3K-AKT pathways in endothelial angiogenesis through exerting its angiogenic effects through distinct molecular mechanisms in each pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p>
      <p>Based on an assumption that cell-cycle-independent mechanisms also contributed to the angiogenic defects as a consequence of RNF213 deficiency in endothelium, we closely inspected the minor findings in our microarray data. We found that several matrix metalloproteinase genes, including <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>8</italic>, <italic>10</italic>, <italic>11</italic>, <italic>14</italic>, <italic>and 15</italic>, were significantly increased in their expressions. Excessive MMPs are known to cause epithelial to mesenchymal transition, thereby leading to deleterious effects on endothelial cells in maintenance of vascular structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The MMP inhibitor, GM6001, restored abnormal phenotypes caused by siRNA-mediated <italic>RNF213</italic> silencing, indicating that the loss of <italic>RNF213</italic> was associated with active vascular remodeling through up-regulation of MMPs. These data indicated that RNF213 promoted angiogenesis through cell-cycle-dependent and independent mechanisms.</p>
      <p>The knockdown experiments using fibroblasts did not recapitulate the data for over-expression of <italic>MMP1</italic> or downward regulation of PI3K-AKT that were observed for endothelial cells in this study. This discrepancy can be interpreted by hypothesizing that RNF213 promotes cell proliferation in endothelial cells, but not in other cells or tissues, through positive regulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. From a more general perspective, these results may reflect differential roles of RNF213 in endothelial cells and other tissues including smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. This perspective might be coherent with the fact that GO terms for co-expressed genes in the bioinformatic dataset did not necessarily overlap with those of our microarray data using endothelial cells.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we also asked whether endothelial cell-autonomous models might fit better to the pathogenic processes of MMD than non-cell-autonomous models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The elevated expressions of <italic>MMP</italic> mRNAs and proteins with reduced expression of <italic>RNF213</italic> in endothelial cells were likely to support the former, endothelial cell-autonomous model. We were unable to obtain direct evidence for higher expression of <italic>MMP1</italic> in vascular tissues from MMD patients. Alternative experiments applying combined methods of induced pluripotent stem cells with <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of endothelial cells will offer more clues for pathogenic responses of the cells from MMD patients to environmental signals. Considering previous studies that associated higher levels of plasma MMPs with increased risk of MMD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and increased vascular MMP-9 in mice lacking RNF213<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, we speculate that individuals with the R4810K mutation may have a tendency to produce higher amounts of MMPs from endothelial cells upon systemic inflammation.</p>
      <p>A recent study identified <italic>GUCY1A3</italic>, which encodes the Î±1 subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), the major receptor for nitric oxide (NO), as the gene mutated in a syndromic form of MMD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. This discovery implicated that alterations of NO-sGC pathway might lead to an abnormal vascular-remodeling process in sensitive vascular areas, such as internal carotid artery bifurcations. We surmised that this concept could be also valid with sporadic, non-syndromic forms of MMD. In line with this concept, it would be reasonable to test whether activated NO synthase under inflammatory stress may require RNF213 to down-regulate the production of MMPs.</p>
      <p>One of remaining issues to discuss in this study was how the R4810K variant allele of <italic>RNF213</italic> could affect the biochemical function of RNF213âby a loss of function, gain-of function, or dominant mechanism? Since we were unable to observe differential MMP syntheses in fibroblasts from MMD patients when compared to those in healthy controls, we cannot safely conclude that the R4810K variant of RNF213 results in functional loss of the protein. Nonetheless, markedly elevated MMP production upon silencing of <italic>RNF213</italic> in endothelial cells led to deleterious effects on their angiogenic responses. In this scenario, disease-susceptibility amino acid change (R4810K) is more likely linked to the functional deficiency of RNF213 than its gain of function.</p>
      <p>Clinical implications of this study will be further strengthened by analyzing the functional roles of RNF213 in the context of vascular insults by virus and other pathogens. Knowing that the variant allele of <italic>RNF213</italic> appeared more frequently in individuals with syndromic forms of MMD than in the control group (our unpublished data), we assume that functional loss of RNF213 may contribute to the development of MMD even in the presence of other genetic causes or environmental risk factors, such as varicella zoster virus infection. Another aspect of clinical implications may include the potential therapeutic targets for MMD with MMP inhibitors. Also, given the active angiogenesis in malignant tissues and inhibitory effects of some MMPs on cancer proliferation, RNF213 could be considered as a target molecule for future cancer treatments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study provides new insight into the convergent functions of RNF213 among various genetic and environmental risk factors for the onset of MMD. We will use mouse models to further explore this issue and identify gene-environment interactions of the two main pathways related to RNF213 (PKR and PI3K-AKT) with vascular inflammation.</p>
