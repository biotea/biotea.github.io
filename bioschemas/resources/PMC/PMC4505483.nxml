      <abstract>
        <p>To further our aim of synthesizing aldehyde-tagged proteins for research and biotechnology applications, we developed methods for recombinant production of aerobic formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) in good yield. We then optimized the FGE biocatalytic reaction conditions for conversion of cysteine to formylglycine in aldehyde tags on intact monoclonal antibodies. During the development of these conditions, we discovered that pretreating FGE with copper(II) is required for high turnover rates and yields. After further investigation, we confirmed that both aerobic prokaryotic (<italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>) and eukaryotic (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) FGEs contain a copper cofactor. The complete kinetic parameters for both forms of FGE are described, along with a proposed mechanism for FGE catalysis that accounts for the copper-dependent activity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The aerobic class of formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1"><sup>2</sup></xref> (sulfatase-modifying factor 1, SUMF1, E.C. 1.8.99.-) is an oxidase that catalyzes the conversion of cysteine to formylglycine (fGly) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). FGE recognizes a five-amino acid consensus sequence (C<italic>X</italic>P<italic>X</italic>R), and converts Cys within that sequence to fGly (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In nature, FGE is required for the endogenous activation of sulfatases (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Sulfatases contain an active site fGly that participates in sulfate ester hydrolysis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Inhibitory mutations to FGE in humans result in a debilitating condition known as multiple sulfatase deficiency (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). FGE is expressed broadly across cell types and organisms, and the FGE consensus sequence is highly conserved across all taxonomic kingdoms, including eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Although the sequence determinants for fGly formation are understood (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), the mechanism through which Cys is converted to fGly remains unclear (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">â</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>Beyond its role in the active site of sulfatases, the aldehyde functional group in fGly is a particularly useful site for protein bioconjugation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">â</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It is an electrophilic carbonyl, which is not found among the 20 proteogenic amino acids, and aldehydes rarely occur as post-translational modifications; oxidized glycans are a notable exception (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Accordingly, fGly stands out as an optimal choice for bioorthogonal conjugation. A variety of bioconjugation reactions are available to target carbonyls (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It is possible to use hydrazines and alkoxyamines to form hydrazones and oximes, but these are susceptible to hydrolysis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Newer methods anchor payloads with stable chemistries that form C-C bonds, including Pictet-Spengler (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">â</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and trapped-Knoevenagel (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) ligations.</p>
      <p>To leverage these exquisitely selective reactions for synthetic purposes, fGly must be installed into the protein backbone. Fortunately, the method for its incorporation requires only genetic encoding of the consensus sequence (dubbed the aldehyde tag). During translation of the substrate protein in the ER, FGE converts Cys to fGly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>a</italic>). In previous work, we described methods for the overexpression of FGE with substrate proteins modified with the aldehyde tag (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This approach endows the resulting protein with fGly during production in cell culture.</p>

<italic>a</italic>, FGE recognizes the five-amino acid consensus sequence C<italic>X</italic>P<italic>X</italic>R. It catalyzes the oxidation of the Cys thiol to an aldehyde to generate fGly. In eukaryotes, conversion occurs in the ER. <italic>b</italic>, in this work, we demonstrate that FGE is also an efficient biocatalyst <italic>in vitro</italic>. Treatment of an aldehyde-tagged substrate protein with FGE and a reducing agent generates fGly on folded proteins in high yield.</p>

      <p>In parallel work described here, we explored the value of performing conversion of Cys to fGly <italic>in vitro</italic> with purified recombinant FGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>b</italic>). This goal requires an efficient enzyme that is stable during the course of a biocatalytic reaction. It was not known whether FGE would meet these requirements, and so our first priority was to optimize FGE <italic>in vitro</italic> conversion efficiency and protein stability. Our initial experiments employed a 14-amino acid peptide substrate, with which we determined the optimal conditions for <italic>in vitro</italic> conversion. This model system also allowed us to explore the mechanism through which FGE converts Cys to fGly.</p>
      <p>Researchers currently propose a mechanism for FGE that does not require an exogenous cofactor for oxygen activation or catalysis. In a variety of experiments to date, x-ray crystallography (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and biochemical investigations (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) have only revealed the need for the addition of calcium for structural support of protein folding. Mechanistically, it is suggested that Cys<sup>336</sup> directly activates molecular oxygen to form a transiently oxidized form of Cys, which is thought to perform substrate oxidation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). If true, this mechanism of catalysis would be unique in all of biology.</p>
      <p>However, during the process of optimizing FGE reaction conditions, we discovered that both the <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (<italic>Sc</italic>-FGE) and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<italic>Hs</italic>-FGE) forms of FGE are many times more active when they contain a copper cofactor. This result is in clear contrast to the existing hypothesis, and yet copper-centered oxygen activation is a common mechanism in biology; many enzymes use copper to lower the high activation barrier of the spin-forbidden reaction with ground-state triplet O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). From the results detailed here, we now propose that aerobic FGEs are oxygen-activating copper oxidases. Furthermore, using copper-loaded FGE, we demonstrate efficient <italic>in vitro</italic> conversion of Cys to fGly on an intact monoclonal antibody (mAb).</p>
      <p>FGE is found across a wide range of organisms, including prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Revealing that copper is a required cofactor for FGE catalysis explains how the enzyme is active in both the reducing cytosol (prokaryotes) and the oxidizing endoplasmic reticulum (eukaryotes); turnover requires copper and oxygen, and not an active site disulfide. In addition, by defining a biocatalytic protocol for <italic>in vitro</italic> conversion of Cys to fGly, we enable a straightforward, reliable way to install a site-specific, bioorthogonal functional group on any folded protein. These abilities mutually reinforce the unique utility of FGE for aldehyde production <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

            <p>Recombinant expression and purification of N terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged FGE from <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> (<italic>Sc-</italic>FGE, UniProt Q9F3C7) was carried out by modifying a previous method (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Two significant changes were employed. First, residual DNA was removed from lysed cells using 1% (w/v) streptomycin sulfate for 15 min at 4 Â°C; then, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 relative centrifugal force for 25 min. Second, the enzyme purification and storage buffer included triethanolamine in place of Tris. The primary amine of Tris buffer was found to react with the aldehyde product of FGE catalysis. Additionally, it is worth noting that high ionic strength buffers (<italic>e.g.</italic> phosphate and sulfonate-containing Good's buffers) caused unactivated <italic>Sc</italic>-FGE to precipitate, and should be avoided.</p>
            <p>After DNA precipitation, the cell lysate was loaded onto Ni-NTA Superflow (Qiagen) by gravity flow. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (25 m<sc>m</sc> triethanolamine (TEAM), 250 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 5 m<sc>m</sc> calcium acetate, 10 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, pH 8). The enzyme was then removed from the column with elution buffer (25 m<sc>m</sc> TEAM, 5 m<sc>m</sc> calcium acetate, 300 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, pH 8). Fractions containing protein as determined by a protein assay (Bio-Rad) were pooled and loaded onto a SephadexÂ® G-25 column equilibrated with storage buffer (25 m<sc>m</sc> TEAM, 8% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4). Then, the protein was eluted with storage buffer, concentrated with a 10-kDa AmiconÂ® ultrafiltration membrane (Merck KGaA), and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The typical yield of isolated enzyme was 50â75 mg/liter of media. Purified enzyme was characterized by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, reversed-phase HPLC, LC/MS of the intact protein, tryptic digestion followed by LC-MS/MS, absorption spectroscopy, and specific activity (as described below).</p>

            <p><italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE baculovirus was transfected into Hi5 cells (Invitrogen) at an multiplicity of infection of 0.1. After 72 h in culture, the conditioned media was clarified by centrifugation and filtration (0.45 Î¼m), and loaded by FPLC onto HisTrapÂ® Excel resin (GE Healthcare) at 5 ml/min. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (25 m<sc>m</sc> TEAM, 250 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 5 m<sc>m</sc> calcium acetate, 10 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, pH 8). The enzyme was then removed from the column with elution buffer (25 m<sc>m</sc> TEAM, 5 m<sc>m</sc> calcium acetate, 300 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, pH 8). Fractions containing protein (as determined by UV detection of the FPLC elution) were pooled and loaded onto a SephadexÂ® G-25 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with storage buffer (25 m<sc>m</sc> TEAM, 8% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4). Then, the protein was eluted with storage buffer, concentrated with a 10-kDa AmiconÂ® ultrafiltration membrane, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The typical yield of isolated enzyme was 10â20 mg/liter of media. Purified enzyme was characterized by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, reversed-phase HPLC, LC/MS of the intact protein, tryptic digestion followed by LC-MS/MS, absorption spectroscopy, and specific activity (as described below).</p>

            <title>Assay of FGE Catalytic Activity</title>
            <p>The specific activity of FGE was measured using a discontinuous enzymatic activity assay (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The substrate for FGE was an unmodified 14-amino acid peptide, ALCTPSRGSLFTGR, was derived from the wild-type sequence contained in a bacterial sulfatase (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The rate of reaction was determined by integrating the peak areas at 215 nm of the substrate cysteine (C<sub>sub</sub>) and product (fGly) peptides on reversed-phase HPLC. The identities of product (and side product) peaks were determined by RP-HPLC MS/MS (see below). Each aqueous reaction solution (120 Î¼l) contained C<sub>sub</sub> (100 Î¼<sc>m</sc>), FGE (0.1â1 Î¼<sc>m</sc>), DTT (1 m<sc>m</sc>), and buffer (25 m<sc>m</sc> TEAM, pH 9). A single time course consisted of 5 data points collected at evenly spaced intervals. The reaction was initiated upon addition of FGE stock solution and vortexing for 3 s. The reaction vial was vortexed at 1500 rpm and 25 Â°C in a thermomixer R (Eppendorf). Time points were hand quenched by adding 20 Î¼l of reaction mixture to 2 Î¼l of 1 <sc>m</sc> HCl. After completion of the reaction, each time point was analyzed by RP-HPLC (see below).</p>

            <p>To determine the oxidation state of thiol residues on either <italic>Sc</italic>-FGE or <italic>Hs</italic>-FGE, a procedure was developed for mapping thiols and disulfides by LC-MRM/MS using sequential labeling, digestion, and orthogonal labeling. Step 1 was initial labeling and tryptic digestion: the reaction mixture was composed of FGE (7.5 Î¼g), NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (50 m<sc>m</sc>), iodoacetamide (20 m<sc>m</sc>), and trypsin (0.75 Î¼g) in a total volume of 30 Î¼l. The tube containing the sample was incubated at 37 Â°C for 16 h. Step 2 was quenching: water (6 Î¼l) and DTT (4.8 Î¼l of 0.5 <sc>m</sc>, 50 m<sc>m</sc> final concentration) were added to the reaction mixture from step 1. The tube containing the sample was incubated at 37 Â°C and 1500 rpm for 1 h. Step 3 was a second labeling, <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide (7.2 Î¼l of 0.5 <sc>m</sc>, 150 m<sc>m</sc> final concentration) was added to the reaction mixture from step 2. The tube containing the sample was then incubated at 37 Â°C and 1500 rpm for 1 h. After step 3, the reaction mixture was quenched with HCl (4.8 Î¼l of 1 <sc>m</sc>, 100 m<sc>m</sc> final concentration). Digested peptides were separated with a gradient of 0â50% MeCN in water with 0.1% formic acid over 15 min. Cysteine-containing peptides were detected by MRM/MS monitoring iodoacetamide, <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide, and oxidative modifications of Cys residues.</p>

The protein was purified from the reaction mixture by buffer exchange into 25 m<sc>m</sc> TEAM, pH 7.4, 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl using SephadexÂ® G-25 resin. Then, the specific activity of FGE was measured using the activity assay described above. Proteins containing a His<sub>6</sub> tag were prone to aggregate during activation. Addition of 10 molar eq of EDTA after activation reversed this aggregation without removing copper from the enzyme. Alternatively, TEV protease was used to remove the tag before activation, which resulted in homogenous reaction solutions.</p>

DTT (20 m<sc>m</sc>) was added to a solution of mAb (20 Î¼g) in buffered aqueous solution (25 m<sc>m</sc> NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>) to a final volume of 20 Î¼l. The tube containing the sample was incubated at 37 Â°C for 15 min at 1500 rpm. Then, HCl (50 m<sc>m</sc>) was added to the solution and the tube was vortexed until mixed. Next, ammonium bicarbonate (100 m<sc>m</sc>) was added to the solution and the tube was vortexed until mixed. Trypsin (1 Î¼g) and iodoacetamide (50 m<sc>m</sc>) were added, and the tube was incubated at 37 Â°C and 1500 rpm for 60 min in the dark. Finally, sodium citrate (150 m<sc>m</sc>, pH 5.5) and methoxylamine (100 m<sc>m</sc>) were added to the solution, and the tube was incubated at 37 Â°C for 16 h. The processed sample was then analyzed by LC-MRM/MS. The MRM transitions included modifications of the Cys-containing peptide including: cysteine, cysteine modified with iodoacetamide, formylglycine, formylglycine hydrate (including loss of water in the collision cell), and formylglycine methyl oxime. The abundance of each species was defined by its 5 most intense precursor/product ion pairs, which were integrated to give the total signal and relative fractions of each component. In the optimized digestion and capping procedure described above, we did not detect unreacted Cys, fGly, or fGly-hydrate above background, observing only carboxyacetamidomethyl-Cys (CAM) and the methyl oxime of fGly (MeOx).</p>

Next, biotin-tagged antigen (100 Î¼l of 10 ng/ml) was added to all of the wells. Finally, the mixture of competitor and biotin-tagged antigen was transferred to the coated ELISA plate (100 Î¼l/well), which was incubated at room temperature for 1â2 h with shaking. The final concentration of biotin-tagged antigen was 5 ng/ml and the highest concentration of the competitor was 10 Î¼g/ml.

            <title>Sc-FGE and Hs-cFGE Have Modest Catalytic Activity as Isolated from Cell Culture</title>
            <p>To develop a highly efficient, soluble form of FGE for use as a reagent in a biocatalytic reaction, we first developed reliable methods for its recombinant expression. FGEs from two species, <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, were selected for study because they had been previously characterized to some extent (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">â</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and because they represented both prokaryotic and eukaryotic forms of the enzyme. In eukaryotes, FGE resides in the ER, an oxidizing environment; in prokaryotes, it resides in the cytosol, a reducing environment. These two forms of the enzyme are highly homologous in primary sequence and structure. We hoped to determine how highly similar FGEs are active in both of these different redox environments.</p>
            <p><italic>Sc</italic>-FGE was prepared in a similar manner to previous reports, by transformation of <italic>E. coli</italic> and purification from clarified cell lysates. <italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE was prepared in high purity and good yield by viral transduction of insect cells. We elected to produce the human form in insect cells because it expressed poorly in <italic>E. coli</italic>, perhaps because it bears both structural disulfides and an <italic>N</italic>-linked glycan.</p>
            <p>Initial results indicated that FGEs from both species were prone to precipitation depending on buffer conditions. We eventually optimized the buffer to minimize this problem. However, with respect to the human enzyme, we also removed a noncatalytic portion of the enzyme that appeared to worsen precipitation (described in detail later). With soluble enzyme in hand, we proceeded to evaluate the activity of FGEs as produced from cell culture, and the reaction conditions required for catalysis.</p>
            <p>To measure the specific activity of FGE, we sought to develop an assay that could continuously read out product formation during turnover. We tested a variety of detection methods hoping to find an assay to monitor the quantity of substrate(s) and/or product(s). Notably, we attempted secondary conjugation to fGly, but found that the rate of turnover far exceeded the rate of any carbonyl condensation reaction. In addition, fluorescence detection of H<sub>2</sub>S (the hypothesized sulfurous leaving group) was unsuccessful because none of the sensors attempted (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) were selective for H<sub>2</sub>S in the presence of other thiol reducing agents, which are, by necessity, added to the FGE reaction mixture.</p>
            <p>In the end, a discontinuous assay was the most reliable and informative. We adapted a previously reported method that used MALDI-MS to quantify the starting material and product of quenched reaction mixtures (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In our assay, reversed-phase HPLC was used to separate the Cys and fGly forms of a peptide containing the FGE consensus sequence, which were detected by optical absorbance. The 14-amino acid peptide ALCTPSRGSLFTGR (derived from a bacterial sulfatase sequence) was used as a substrate for both the <italic>Sc-</italic> and <italic>Hs-</italic> forms of the enzyme.</p>
            <p>Individual FGE reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing FGE into a premixed buffered solution of C<sub>sub</sub> and reducing agent. It was assumed that all buffered solutions contained oxygen at â¼270 Î¼<sc>m</sc> at 25 Â°C (based upon Henry's law). Time points were chemically quenched by hand with HCl. The integrated peak areas of substrate and product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>a</italic>) were used to calculate the initial velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>b</italic>) of FGE using the method described by Boeker (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The identities of both the Cys- and fGly-containing peptides were confirmed by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic>). As will be described below, the specific activity of FGE can vary dramatically as a function of the chemical state of its active site, and so enzyme concentrations in this assay spanned the range of 0.1â10 Î¼<sc>m</sc> (0.1â10 mol %) enzyme.</p>

            <p>The conversion of Cys to fGly requires a 2 H<sup>+</sup>/2 <italic>e</italic><sup>â</sup> oxidation of the substrate Cys thiol as well as exchange of sulfur for oxygen. Current data support a mechanism in which molecular oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, because O<sub>2</sub> is a 4 H<sup>+</sup>/4 <italic>e</italic><sup>â</sup> acceptor, a reducing agent is required to provide a second equivalent of 2 H<sup>+</sup> and 2 <italic>e</italic><sup>â</sup>, completing the reduction from O<sub>2</sub> to 2 mol of H<sub>2</sub>O. We hypothesized that one might be able to bypass the requirement for a reductant by adding a 2 H<sup>+</sup>/2 <italic>e</italic><sup>â</sup> oxidant directly to the <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction. Unfortunately, we found that addition of the oxidant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> served only to dimerize the substrate by generating a disulfide (C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>a</italic>), which halted the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>b</italic> and c).

We now had the ability to produce active FGEs in good yield and high purity from both species, and we turned to developing methods that would enhance the activity of FGE. To do so, we investigated the mechanism by which FGE performs catalysis.</p>

            <title>The Activity of FGE Depends Upon the Presence of a Copper Cofactor, and Not the Redox State of Active Site Cysteine Residues</title>
            <p><italic>Hs</italic>-FGE contains three primary domains: a signal peptide, an N-terminal extension (NTE), and a core that binds substrate and performs turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>a</italic>). After transport to the ER and proteolytic removal of the signal peptide, the âfull-lengthâ wild-type enzyme (<italic>Hs</italic>-FGE) contains both the NTE and core. Previous reports provide evidence that the NTE is required for ER retention through disulfide bond formation between Cys<sup>50</sup> and/or Cys<sup>52</sup> with ERp44 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The border between the NTE and the core is a proteolytic cleavage site for proprotein convertases such as furin and PACE (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). When FGE encounters these enzymes in the secretory pathway, the NTE is removed and the truncated core can be secreted. We discovered that <italic>in vitro</italic>, the full-length FGE had a propensity to aggregate at high concentrations, which led us to prepare the truncated core (cFGE). We were unsure whether this approach would be successful because previous results showed that the NTE is required for FGE activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In our hands, the specific activity of <italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE (1,143 pkatal mg<sup>â1</sup>, 33.3 kDa) was similar to <italic>Hs</italic>-FGE that contained the NTE (850 pkatal mg<sup>â1</sup>, 36.9 kDa). In addition, we found that <italic>Sc</italic>-FGE expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> had a significantly lower specific activity (214 pkatal mg<sup>â1</sup>), relative to the human enzyme expressed in insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>b</italic>).</p>

            <p>Our analysis of FGE catalysis then turned to testing the previously reported hypotheses of its mechanism. Foremost among these is that the enzyme requires the presence of an active site disulfide residue (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Therefore, we prepared reduced and oxidized forms of FGE and measured their specific activities. Formation of the reduced active site Cys residues was accomplished by pretreatment of <italic>Sc</italic>-FGE with an excess (100 molar eq) of a strong reducing agent (DTT) for 1 h at 25 Â°C, after which the reagent was removed by gel filtration. Formation of the oxidized active site was accomplished by pretreatment of the enzyme either with an excess (100 molar eq) of <sc>l</sc>-dehydroascorbic acid or CuSO<sub>4</sub> for 1 h at 25 Â°C, followed by removal of the reagents by gel filtration. <sc>l</sc>-Dehydroascorbic acid can form disulfides stoichiometrically (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and Cu<sup>2+</sup> can rapidly, and cleanly, catalyze disulfide formation with dissolved oxygen (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). After these treatments, the specific activities of each enzyme were measured using the standard kinetic assay. Only pretreatment with CuSO<sub>4</sub> resulted in any significant change in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>c</italic>). We were surprised by this result, because a previous report showed that addition of copper to FGE isolated from HT1080 cells <italic>inhibited</italic> activity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
            <p>Because pretreatment and removal of copper led to more active FGE, we next investigated the quantity of copper required to activate <italic>Sc</italic>-FGE. We hypothesized that copper might generate active enzyme by forming the active site disulfide, priming the enzyme for turnover, and thus might only be required in catalytic amounts. However, treatment of FGE with 0.01, 0.1, or 1 molar eq of CuSO<sub>4</sub> demonstrated that generating a highly active enzyme requires stoichiometric amounts of copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>d</italic>). Any amount less than 1 molar eq resulted in proportionally lower activity, an observation that is inconsistent with the <italic>catalytic</italic> activation of active site thiols.</p>
            <p>After optimization, we found that both <italic>Sc-</italic>FGE and <italic>Hs-</italic>cFGE could be efficiently activated with 5 molar eq of CuSO<sub>4</sub> for 1 h at 25 Â°C followed by removal of excess copper. The specific activity of <italic>Sc</italic>-FGE increased by more than an order of magnitude, from 214 Â± 34 pkatal mg<sup>â1</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 9) to 3579 Â± 215 pkatal mg<sup>â1</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 7); <italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE specific activity increased by a factor of 3, from 1,143 Â± 84 pkatal mg<sup>â1</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 10) to 3,050 Â± 115 pkatal mg<sup>â1</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>e</italic>). Next, we tested whether FGE that was treated with copper contained the metal after purification. To answer this question, we measured the quantities of copper and calcium in both the unactivated and the activated FGE samples using inductively coupled plasmon mass spectrometry. The <italic>Sc</italic>-FGE produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> contained almost no copper above the level of the noise of the measurement. By contrast, <italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE, as isolated from insect cells, contained 0.35 mol of copper per mol of FGE. Most strikingly, both the copper-treated âactivatedâ forms of FGE contained just above 1 mol of copper/FGE. Furthermore, the specific activity of each of these enzyme preparations correlated with the ratio of copper/FGE, suggesting that copper is an integral component of the active form of FGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>e</italic> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). All of the FGE preparations also contained â¼1â2 calcium atoms per FGE.</p>

            <p>To confirm that catalytic activity in the activated form of FGE does not depend upon an active site disulfide, we tested whether addition of strong reducing agents to the <italic>activated</italic> enzyme would decrease the specific activity of the resulting material. If the integrity of the active site disulfide is indeed important for turnover, then strong reducing agents should have decreased FGE turnover rates. <italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE has the potential to form the active site disulfide (Cys<sup>336</sup>-Cys<sup>341</sup>) as well as two structural disulfides (Cys<sup>346</sup>-Cys<sup>235</sup> and Cys<sup>365</sup>-Cys<sup>218</sup>) elsewhere in the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>a</italic>). Treatment of <italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE with 20 m<sc>m</sc> DTT (or 20 m<sc>m</sc> TCEP, not shown) produced an FGE with unchanged specific activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>b</italic>). To confirm that the relevant Cys residues changed redox state as a result of this treatment, we developed an LC-MRM/MS assay to detect solution-accessible Cys residues in the active site. With this method, we successfully monitored both the Cys<sup>341</sup>- and Cys<sup>235</sup>-containing peptides. As expected, treatment with DTT increased the proportion of accessible active site Cys<sup>341</sup> from 28 to 93%. Notably, Cys<sup>235</sup>, which participates in a buried structural disulfide, was inaccessible, and thus, in a disulfide independent of DTT treatment. Taken together, these data confirm that reductive treatment generated almost quantitatively reduced active site thiols, did not perturb other structural disulfides, but had no effect on the catalytic activity of FGE.</p>

            <p>After observing that FGE contained â¼1 copper atom/enzyme, we made an effort to remove the metal from the protein to demonstrate its requirement for catalytic activity. Cyanide is known to be an inhibitor of copper-containing oxidases (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">â</xref><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Attempting to extract copper through pretreatment with 5 molar eq of KCN did decrease the activity of <italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE (but not <italic>Sc</italic>-FGE) by a modest amount, suggesting that it could gain access to the bound copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>a</italic>). We next tested whether FGE turnover could be inhibited competitively by cyanide. Indeed, we observed a concentration-dependent inhibition of activity on both <italic>Sc</italic>-FGE (IC<sub>50</sub> = 480 Î¼<sc>m</sc>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>b</italic>) and <italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE (88 Î¼<sc>m</sc>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>c</italic>). In the case of copper amine oxidases, researchers had success generating apoenzyme by extracting copper with KCN from enzyme that was pre-reduced with sodium dithionite (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In a similar manner, this approach was also successful for FGE. Activity decreased significantly upon treatment (1 h, 37 Â°C) with both a reductant and chelator (15 m<sc>m</sc> TCEP and EDTA), but not with each component individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>d</italic>).</p>

            <p>In total, our data demonstrate that the modestly active forms of FGE isolated from cell culture are a mixture of the apoenzyme, lacking the copper cofactor, and the holoenzyme, which is highly active and efficiently converts Cys to fGly on model peptide substrates. We then began developing robust conditions for using the FGE holoenzyme in biocatalytic reactions on folded protein substrates.</p>

            <title>FGE Is an Efficient Biocatalyst for in Vitro Conversion of Cys to fGly on Folded Proteins</title>
            <p>To use <italic>in vitro</italic> conversion for the production of aldehyde-tagged mAbs, we needed to modify the reaction conditions from those used for the kinetic assay. For most substrates, 5â10 molar eq of DTT was sufficient to achieve complete conversion. We found that turnover was also possible with TCEP, lipoic acid, and bis(2-mercaptoethyl)sulfone. However, the presence of even 1 molar eq of a strong reducing agent (<italic>e.g.</italic> DTT, TCEP, lipoic acid, or bis(2-mercaptoethyl)sulfone) can cleave disulfides that are present in a mAb substrate (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). To avoid substrate disulfide cleavage, we selected an alternate reducing agent for the reaction. We found that weaker reducing agents, <italic>e.g.</italic> Î²ME or GSH, were tolerated by antibody substrates, and also enabled FGE catalysis. As it was most cost effective, we elected to move forward with Î²ME for our antibody conversion reactions. However, we found that changing from a cyclizing (DTT) to a non-cyclizing reducing agent (Î²ME) resulted in side products that had not previously been observed (discussed below). To reduce this side product formation and increase product yield, we further considered the role(s) of the reducing agent in product formation.</p>
            <p>X-ray crystallography of FGE (what we now understand to be the apoenzyme) bound to a substrate peptide shows Cys<sup>341</sup> and C<sub>sub</sub> covalently linked by a disulfide in the active site (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). If the substrate is indeed anchored by this Cys<sup>341</sup>-C<sub>sub</sub> disulfide during turnover, an exogenous thiol might be able to react with the enzyme-substrate complex (<italic>E</italic>Â·S) by thiol-disulfide exchange to release substrate in the form of a thiol-C<sub>sub</sub> disulfide. Indeed, we observed two off-pathway products formed by FGE during turnover. First, when reducing agent was not added to the reaction, we observed C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub> dimer formation. Second, when we added a monothiol as the reductant (<italic>e.g.</italic> Î²ME), we observed rapid production of the C<sub>sub</sub>-Î²ME disulfide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>a</italic>).

            <p>To limit the formation of C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub> and C<sub>sub</sub>-Î²ME, we monitored their formation as a function of reaction conditions. First, we varied the concentration of reducing agent in the reaction, and quenched the reactions when they were half-complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>b</italic>). At low [Î²ME] <italic>versus</italic> [C<sub>sub</sub>], the C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub> predominated. Increasing [Î²ME] resulted in a concurrent decrease in C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub>, and an increase in C<sub>sub</sub>-Î²ME. Importantly, increasing [Î²ME] also resulted in a higher yield of fGly.</p>
            <p>Second, we investigated the effect of [Î²ME] as the reaction evolved over time. As mentioned above, in the absence of exogenous reducing agent product <italic>did</italic> form, but a significant proportion of C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub> was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>c</italic>), suggesting that C<sub>sub</sub> can act in place of the reducing agent during turnover, but at the expense of product yield. At low [Î²ME] (0.25 m<sc>m</sc>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>d</italic>), the C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub> initially grew in at a rate competitive with product formation, but as the reaction proceeded, it reached a maximum, and then decayed away slowly. At this [Î²ME], the C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub> was consumed, but the C<sub>sub</sub>-Î²ME reached a plateau of 13% of total peptide, where it remained, thereby limiting product yield. In a subsequent reaction with higher [Î²ME] (10 m<sc>m</sc>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>e</italic>), C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub> was almost undetectable. Moreover, C<sub>sub</sub>-Î²ME rose to 10% of the total substrate, but it was consumed concomitant with product formation. In all cases, the consumption of both C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub> and C<sub>sub</sub>-Î²ME correlated with a higher yield of product formation.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Î²ME, when we used DTT as the stoichiometric reductant neither the intermediate C<sub>sub</sub>-C<sub>sub</sub> nor the C<sub>sub</sub>-DTT disulfides were observed. This is likely because DTT can cyclize to form an intramolecular disulfide and release substrate. However, we found that the rates of product formation in reaction using Î²ME or DTT were not the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>f</italic>). Specifically, the rates of product formation were 5.07 or 3.27 min<sup>â1</sup> in the presence of Î²ME or DTT, respectively. Because reducing agent was present in large excess <italic>versus</italic> both the substrate and enzyme, it must be involved in limiting the rate of turnover.</p>
            <p>If the reductants are acting by a 1-electron mechanism, their relative reaction rates should depend directly upon their reduction potentials: <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub>â²(Î²ME) = â207 mV and <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub>â²(DTT) = â323 mV (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). If instead, the reductants are acting by thiol-disulfide exchange, their reaction rate should correlate with their thiol-disulfide exchange rate constants: <italic>k</italic><sub>Î²ME</sub> = 1 and <italic>k</italic><sub>DTT</sub> = 6 Ã 10<sup>5</sup>, as measured <italic>versus</italic> glutathione disulfide (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Both of these scenarios predict that reactions performed in the presence of DTT should have a faster rate than those performed in the presence of Î²ME. By contrast, we observed that reactions performed with DTT were <italic>slower</italic> than those with Î²ME, and so the role of the thiol in the reaction cannot be explained by the reaction rate of the thiol alone.</p>
            <p>The covalent disulfide in <italic>E</italic>Â·S that was previously observed by crystallography is likely the source of the discrepancy just described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). From this state, <italic>E</italic>Â·S can either proceed to product with a rate constant of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, or it can react with an exogenous thiol to form a disulfide with a rate constant of <italic>k</italic><sub>DS</sub>. For any given reducing agent, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> is likely the same based upon the mechanisms of analogous copper-dependent oxidases, in which active site redox chemistry is not rate-determining (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). However, <italic>k</italic><sub>DS</sub> will depend directly upon the identity of the reducing agent in solution and its reaction rate constant. Said another way, if <italic>E</italic>Â·S involves a disulfide, it should dissociate faster in the presence of a stronger reducing agent, in competition with product formation. If the substrate is released as a disulfide that does not decay quickly (as with Î²ME-DS), it could react with the enzyme again to regenerate <italic>E</italic>Â·S. Therefore, stronger reductants should slow turnover by dissociating the <italic>E</italic>Â·S complex, as observed for DTT and Î²ME.</p>

            <p>The predominance of C<sub>sub</sub>-Î²ME also confirms that the reducing agents are reacting with <italic>E</italic>Â·S by thiol/disulfide exchange: 1-electron reduction would regenerate free substrate thiol, and not a significant proportion of a substrate disulfide. Interestingly, this aspect of the cycle also explains the faster turnover rate observed at pH 9 relative to pH 7, thiol/disulfide exchange is faster under basic conditions because more of the nucleophilic thiolate is present.</p>
            <p>After determining this dual role of reducing agent during catalysis, we were able to finalize reaction conditions that smoothly translated to protein substrates. As we have previously described, the aldehyde tag can be introduced at the N or C terminus or at any solvent accessible internal sequence (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Here, Cys was converted to fGly in high yield by <italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE in three independent regions of a mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>a</italic>) and across a wide range of reaction scales (from 0.8 to 200 mg) on three independent mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>, <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Formylglycine-generating enzyme was produced by recombinant expression for the generation of aldehyde-tagged proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>. We successfully developed a discontinuous HPLC assay to measure the kinetic parameters of both FGEs. In contrast to previous work, these results indicate that the N-terminal extension of <italic>Hs</italic>-FGE is not required for catalytic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Surprisingly, when purified from insect cell culture, the human enzyme was much more active than the bacterial form of FGE from <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> that was produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
      <p>We also designed experiments to explore the mechanism of FGE turnover. The existing mechanistic hypotheses focus on the redox state of the FGE active site cysteine residues as revealed by crystallography. When <italic>Hs</italic>-cFGE was isolated previously, Cys<sup>336</sup> (Cys<sup>272</sup> in <italic>Sc</italic>-FGE) and Cys<sup>341</sup> (Cys<sup>277</sup>) were present in the enzyme in a mixture of reduced and oxidized forms (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The oxidation state of Cys<sup>336</sup> and Cys<sup>341</sup> can be manipulated using chemical reagents in solution, either to form the Cys<sup>336</sup>-Cys<sup>341</sup> disulfide, or with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> over a longer period of time, to form a sulfonic acid at both positions. In addition, a C336S mutation enables the âtrappingâ of C<sub>sub</sub> as an intermolecular disulfide with Cys<sup>341</sup> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This convincing set of evidence prompted the hypothesis that FGE uses a thiol-disulfide interchange to anchor C<sub>sub</sub> and activate Cys<sup>336</sup>. This residue would then perform the activation of molecular oxygen to form a higher oxidation state Cys residue (either sulfenic acid or cysteine peroxide) and subsequently oxidize the substrate.</p>
      <p>In this work, we demonstrated that the presence of a disulfide of the active site cysteines does not correlate with enzyme activity. Instead, we made the fortuitous discovery that FGE incorporates copper as a cofactor for catalysis. Our results indicate that recombinant expression of FGE most often results in the apoenzyme, which can be reconstituted as the holoenzyme by the addition of copper(II) sulfate at pH 7. This reconstitution was ineffective with other metal ions commonly found in enzymes, including Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, the only previous characterization of FGE metal content identified 0.09 copper/human FGE as produced in the mammalian HT1080 cell line (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We observed that the catalytic rates of both human and bacterial FGE were significantly increased upon activation with stoichiometric amounts of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and that turnover was inhibited by the addition of cyanide to FGE reaction mixtures. Previous reports have shown that the inhibition of aerobic copper oxidases by CN<sup>â</sup> results from ligation of CN<sup>â</sup> at the metal center (in the reduced state of Cu<sup>1+</sup>), which prevents oxygen binding and substrate activation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Furthermore, FGE activity was extinguished completely after treating the enzyme with a combination of a chelator and a reductant, reinforcing the highly specific and tight binding interaction between FGE and Cu<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
      <p>Taken together, we hypothesize that FGE resides in the well studied class of copper oxidases that perform 2 H<sup>+</sup>/2 <italic>e</italic>â oxidation, activate molecular oxygen, and require exogenous reductants to complete a catalytic cycle. This also helps explain how FGEs that reside in subcellular compartments with varying redox environments can still perform catalysis, turnover depends upon copper and oxygen, and not the presence of an intact disulfide.</p>
      <p>More specifically, FGE most closely parallels the structure and reactivity of the Cu<sub>M</sub> site in enzymes like peptidylglycine Î±-hydroxylating monooxygenase, which hydroxylates a C terminally extended peptide (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In peptidylglycine Î±-hydroxylating monooxygenase (and other related enzymes), the Cu<sub>M</sub> is the location of oxygen activation, consumption of a molar eq of reducing agent, and 2 H<sup>+</sup>/2 <italic>e</italic><sup>â</sup> substrate oxidation.</p>
      <p>Despite these similarities to existing mononuclear copper oxidases, FGE remains unique. In Cu<sub>M</sub>, His and Met bind the copper atom, but not a Cys (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The mononuclear copper-binding motif in FGE is likely a combination of the ligands that are highly conserved, and those whose mutation results in decreased or eliminated activity. Specifically, the residues whose mutations are known to change FGE activity are Cys<sup>336</sup>, Cys<sup>341</sup>, Ser<sup>333</sup>, His<sup>337</sup>, and Tyr<sup>340</sup>.</p>
      <p>With respect to cysteine, other enzymes in which isolated copper centers are ligated by thiols (<italic>e.g.</italic> blue copper proteins), the copper center typically performs 1-electron redox chemistry, and not oxygen activation or substrate oxidation (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In addition, the ligand-to-metal charge transfer of the Cys results in a strong absorption band in the visible spectrum of the enzyme. However, reconstituted FGE holoenzyme does not have any absorption bands above 280 nm, and so it is unlikely to contain a type I copper center. Despite this, mutation of Cys<sup>336</sup> and Cys<sup>341</sup> have a significant effect on FGE activity. Their role in the copper active site is unclear.</p>
      <p>What we now believe is the FGE apoenzyme is well characterized by x-ray crystallography (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). With respect to other FGE residues, His<sup>337</sup> seems to be a likely candidate for copper ligation because of the prevalence of His in copper active sites, its proximity to the active site, and the decrease in activity that accompanies its removal. In addition, the highly conserved Tyr<sup>340</sup> may also participate in the FGE active site, as it does in other oxygen-activating copper oxygenases (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In galactose oxidase, tyrosine is both a copper ligand (Tyr<sup>495</sup>) and also a redox-active participant (cross-linked Cys-Tyr<sup>272</sup>) in catalysis (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In the family of copper amine oxidases, the active site contains a TPQ cofactor (a post-translationally modified form of Tyr) that participates in catalysis (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p>
      <p>From the data described above, we propose a mechanism by which FGE converts Cys to fGly that accounts for the copper cofactor. As demonstrated above, the formation of side products confirms that <italic>E</italic>Â·S involves a covalent Cys<sup>341</sup>-C<sub>sub</sub> (<italic>H. sapiens</italic> numbering) disulfide bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref><italic>a</italic>). Reducing agent would serve to generate the Cu(I) state of the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref><italic>b</italic>), which is a well studied (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) intermediate for binding of molecular oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref><italic>c</italic>) as the cupric superoxo Cu(II)âO<sub>2</sub><sup>â</sup> that is poised for substrate oxidation. A C-H bond on the C<sub>sub</sub> side chain could then react by proton-coupled electron transfer (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) with the Cu(II)âO<sub>2</sub><sup>â</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref><italic>d</italic>). After oxidation, the radical on the C<sub>sub</sub> side chain would almost certainly collapse to the thioaldehyde and a Cys<sup>341</sup> thiyl radical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref><italic>e</italic>). A second equivalent of 1 H<sup>+</sup>/1 <italic>e</italic><sup>â</sup> would regenerate the thiol on Cys<sup>341</sup>, and as previously proposed, the thioaldehyde would hydrolyze to the product fGly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>, <italic>f</italic> and <italic>g</italic>) and H<sub>2</sub>S. Formally, the oxidation reaction could be complete simply by displacing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a reaction product, but the cupric peroxide Cu(II)âOOH might also undergo further reduction to generate only H<sub>2</sub>O as a byproduct. We would predict that the resting state ligand on copper is a hydroxide, although we cannot rule out direct involvement of Cys<sup>341</sup> through an alternative mechanism. These scenarios will serve as a guide, but it is clear that developing a comprehensive catalytic cycle for FGE will require additional structural and paramagnetic spectroscopic studies of the enzyme.</p>

      <p>With the mechanistic knowledge described above, we optimized the reaction conditions for efficient production of fGly without disrupting existing intramolecular disulfides in the substrate protein. Interestingly, we found that FGE was able to catalyze the formation of disulfides at the substrate Cys when monothiol reducing agents were present in solution. Furthermore, when dithiol reagents such as DTT are used, the rate of product formation decreased, suggesting that any intermolecular disulfide is quickly abolished by DTT cyclization. This indicates that FGE binds C<sub>sub</sub> in a disulfide, and that when <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> is slower than the rate of reaction with reducing agent in solution, C<sub>sub</sub> can be released as a disulfide. These data confirm the existing proposal that substrate is anchored during turnover, and optimal turnover requires balancing the type and amount of reductant in solution with product formation.</p>
      <p>We have further demonstrated that FGE can be produced in good yield and used as an excellent biocatalyst for the production of aldehyde-tagged proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>. Reactions with FGE can scale across at least 3 orders of magnitude in mass with no decrease in yield, and proceed without perturbing existing disulfides or modifying residues that are important for mAb performance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
