      <abstract>
        <p>Somatic mutations in the <italic>isocitrate dehydrogenase</italic> (<italic>IDH)1/2</italic> genes endow encoding proteins with neomorphic activity to produce the potential oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which induces the hypermethylation of histones and DNA. The incidence of IDH1/2 mutations in cartilaginous tumors was previously shown to be the highest among various types of tumors, except for those in the central nervous system. Mutations have been detected in both benign (enchondromas) and malignant (chondrosarcomas) types of cartilaginous tumors, whereas they have rarely been found in other mesenchymal tumors such as osteosarcomas. To address this unique tumor specificity, we herein examined the effects of IDH1 R132C, which is the most prevalent mutant in cartilaginous tumors, on the differentiation properties of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The induction of the <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C gene into MSCs markedly increased the amount of 2-HG and up-regulated global histone methylation. The induction of IDH1 R132C promoted the chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs by enhancing the expression of <italic>SOX9</italic> and <italic>COL2A1</italic> genes in association with an increase in the active mark (H3K4me3), but disrupted cartilage matrix formation. On the other hand, IDH1 R132C inhibited expression of the <italic>ALPL</italic> gene in association with an increase in the repressive mark (H3K9me3), and subsequently inhibited the osteogenic properties of hMSCs and human osteosarcoma cells. Since osteogenic properties are an indispensable feature for the diagnosis of osteosarcoma, the inhibitory effects of IDH1 R132C on osteogenic properties may contribute to the lack of osteosarcomas with the <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C mutation. These results suggested that IDH1 R132C contributed to the formation of cartilaginous tumors by dysregulating the chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs via gene-specific histone modulation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) are metabolic enzymes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±-KG), and consist of a gene family with three members: IDH1, IDH2 and IDH3, the first of which localizes in the cytoplasm while the latter two localize in mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Somatic heterozygous <italic>IDH1</italic> or <italic>IDH2</italic> mutations have frequently been detected in glioma/glioblastomas by genome wide mutation searches [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Subsequent studies revealed that <italic>IDH</italic> mutations were extremely rare in primary (<italic>de novo</italic>) glioblastomas, but were common in recurrent glioblastomas developing secondary to low-grade tumors, which also frequently have IDH mutations [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These findings suggested that <italic>IDH</italic> mutations are an early event in gliomagenesis and persist during progression to recurrent glioblastomas.</p>
      <p>
<italic>IDH1</italic> mutations typically result in substitutions at codon R132, whereas <italic>IDH2</italic> mutations affect codon R172 or R140 [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although a number of different mutants have been identified to date, the most common and important feature of mutant proteins is their neomorphic enzyme activity, which converts Î±-KG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since 2-HG and Î±-KG are structurally identical, except that the C2 carbonyl group in Î±-KG is replaced by a hydroxyl group in 2-HG, 2-HG competes with Î±-KG and inhibits various Î±-KG-dependent enzymes including Jumonji-C domain-containing histone demethylase [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHD) [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These inhibitory effects induce aberrant DNA and histone methylation [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and stabilize hypoxia inducible factor-1Î±, which then induces angiogenesis by up-regulating the VEGF gene [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Due to this pleiotropic function for dysregulating biological events, 2-HG is regarded as an oncometabolite that exerts tumor-inducing actions, and searches for <italic>IDH</italic> gene mutations have been performed in various types of malignancies [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. <italic>IDH1/2</italic> mutations have consequently been detected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and myelodysplastic disorders [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but rarely in thyroid [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], prostate, B cell lymphoma, and colorectal carcinomas [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>In 2011, cartilaginous tumors were added to the list of tumors with <italic>IDH1</italic> mutations [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as tumors with the highest frequency <italic>IDH</italic> mutations, except for central nervous system tumors [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Cartilaginous tumors have been defined as tumors that produce cartilage-like tissues and consist of benign (such as enchondroma) and malignant (including conventional chondrosarcoma) tumors [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. <italic>IDH</italic> mutations were found in both tumors with equal frequency [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], suggesting the role of <italic>IDH</italic> mutants in the initial step of transformation; however, the precise role of these mutants currently remains unknown. Most cartilaginous tumors, either benign or malignant, develop from the intramedullary region, and tumor cells have a chondrocyte-like morphology [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These clinical findings suggest that cells in bone marrow that have the ability to differentiate into chondrogenic cells are precursors of this type of tumor. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are defined as cells with differentiation properties for osteo-, adipo-, and chondrogenic lineages, and reside among bone marrow stromal cells [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which are, therefore, reasonable candidates as the precursor cells of cartilaginous tumors.</p>
      <p>We herein investigated the role of mutant IDH1 in the development of cartilaginous tumors using MSCs. We found that IDH1 mutants modified the differentiation properties of MSCs as well as the histone methylation of cartilage- and bone-related genes in a gene-specific manner. These results provide a novel insight into the role of IDH mutants in the development of cartilaginous tumors.</p>

        <title>2-HG produced by <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C induced histone methylation in hMSCs</title>
        <p>Since the R132C mutant of <italic>IDH1</italic> was the most prevalent mutant in cartilaginous tumors, we decided to investigate its effects on the differentiation properties of hMSCs. Lentiviral expression vectors containing the wild type or <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C gene were introduced into each of three primary hMSCs. No significant difference was observed in the growth properties of transfected hMSC between wild-type IDH1 and IDH1 R132C, whereas both significantly affected the growth properties of hMSCs (<xref rid="pone.0131998.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).

Similar results were obtained in the other two hMSCs (data not shown), and hMSCs expressing <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C produced markedly larger amounts of 2-HG than cells expressing the exogenous wild-type <italic>IDH1</italic> gene, in which the relative amount of 2-HG was equal to that in parental or cells infected with the empty vector (<xref rid="pone.0131998.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To confirm the effects of 2-HG produced by <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C, global histone methylation was analyzed by western blotting using antibodies against each type of methylated histone (<xref rid="pone.0131998.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The amounts of active (H3K4me3) and repressive marks (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) were increased in cells expressing <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C, whereas no significant differences were observed in cells expressing wild-type exogenous <italic>IDH1</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0131998.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).

<italic>IDH1</italic> R132C differently regulated the expression of chondrocyte- and osteocyte-related genes by diverse histone modification</title>
        <p>To investigate whether these effects of <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C on differentiation were related to its effects on histone methylation, histone modifications in the promoter regions of <italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>COL2A1</italic>, and <italic>ALPL</italic> genes were investigated. Histones associated with the promoter region of the <italic>SOX9</italic> gene in parental hMSCs were mainly modified with the active mark (H3K4me3) and less with the repressive marks (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3). The induction of <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C markedly increased the amount of H3K4me3; however, the effects on H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 were hardly detected (<xref rid="pone.0131998.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Similar results were observed for the promoter region of the <italic>COL2A1</italic> gene (<xref rid="pone.0131998.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>), in which both active and repressive (H3K27me3) marks was observed in parental cells. Although the induction of <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C increased the amount of both marks, a significant difference was only observed for the active mark. The results for the enhancer region of the <italic>COL2A1</italic> gene also showed the preferential up-regulation of the active mark (<xref rid="pone.0131998.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). The up-regulation of the <italic>COL2A1</italic> gene remained unchanged even when the expression of the <italic>SOX9</italic> gene, its major regulator, was inhibited by siRNA (<xref rid="pone.0131998.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>), suggesting that epigenetic modifications contributed significantly to its expression. In contrast, the effects of <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C on the <italic>ALPL</italic> gene were completely different. Although both active and repressive marks were detected in the promoter region of the <italic>ALPL</italic> gene in parental cells, only the repressed mark (H3K9me3) was increased by the expression of <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C (<xref rid="pone.0131998.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Certain metabolites have critical roles as regulators and co-factors of important enzymes in various biological pathways, and recent cancer research disclosed that metabolic alterations contributed to the initiation and development of malignant cells. 2-HG produced by mutant IDH proteins is a prototype of these oncometabolites, and a number of studies have disclosed the role of 2-HG in malignant transformation [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>One interesting and still unanswered question regarding <italic>IDH</italic> mutations in cancer is their tumor-type-specific prevalence. Mutations in <italic>IDH</italic> genes are the most frequent genetic abnormality in central nervous system (CNS) tumors, but are extremely rare in other types of cancers such as prostate and colorectal cancers [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cartilaginous tumors frequently share mutations in <italic>IDH</italic> genes with these in CNS tumors [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], even though these two tumor types are histologically and developmentally different. This incidence may be related to many factors, one of which may be their effects on differentiation through epigenetic modifications. Impaired differentiation by mutant <italic>IDH</italic> has been reported in CNS, hematopoietic, and hepatocholangial differentiation processes [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, we herein examined the effects of <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C on the differentiation properties of hMSCs, which presumably are precursors of cartilaginous tumors. hMSCs with <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C began to express the early (<italic>SOX9</italic>) and late (<italic>COL2A1</italic> and <italic>COL10A1</italic>) chondrogenic markers (<xref rid="pone.0131998.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). After chondrogenic induction, however, cells expressing <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C failed to make cartilage-like pellets (<xref rid="pone.0131998.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The hydroxylation of proline residues is an important step for collagen maturation, which reinforces its helical structure and promotes its thermal stability [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This reaction was catalyzed by prolyl-4-hydroxylases, which are regulated by Î±-KG and, therefore, inhibited by 2-HG [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A previous study demonstrated that the maturation of type IV collagen was inhibited in IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, resulting in fragile basement membranes [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which may be relevant to our results on the cartilage matrix. Mutations in the <italic>COL2A1</italic> gene itself have been identified in approximately one third of chondrosarcomas [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which may also impair the maturation of type II collagen. The down-regulated expression of the <italic>ACAN</italic> gene, another important ECM protein, by <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C may also have contributed to the fragile structure of cell pellets (<xref rid="pone.0131998.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Therefore, although cartilaginous tumors are defined as tumors that produce cartilage-like tissues, the matrix produced may be immature, which may help tumor cells to proliferate and invade surrounding tissues.</p>
      <p>The introduction of an <italic>IDH2</italic> R172K mutation, the main <italic>IDH2</italic> mutation in gliomas, into C3H10T1/2 was previously shown to reduce the expression of the <italic>COL2A1</italic> gene and gave rise to poorly differentiated sarcomas in xenograft models [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We currently cannot explain the reason for this discrepancy. In order to determine whether this was caused by differences in donor cells, we introduced <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C into C3HT101/2 cells, and found that <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C up-regulated the expression of the Col2a1 gene in mouse cells (data not shown). Therefore, this difference may be related to the type of mutation (<italic>IDH1</italic> R132C versus <italic>IDH2</italic> R172K), which may affect enzymatic activity, as reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
      <p>The specific occurrence of <italic>IDH</italic> mutations in cartilaginous tumors among mesenchymal tumors is another issue that needs to be clarified [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although osteosarcomas are the most frequent primary malignant bone tumors, no patients with <italic>IDH1</italic> mutations have been described in previous and current studies on osteosarcomas. Osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas share some clinical phenotypes: both develop from bone marrow in most cases and are diagnosed by the presence of a specific extracellular matrix. They also share some genetic abnormalities such as chromosomal aneuploidy and alteration in the Rb and p53 pathways [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, the incidence of <italic>IDH</italic> mutations clearly differs.</p>
      <p>We demonstrated that <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C induced the expression of early markers, the <italic>RUNX2</italic> and <italic>OSX</italic> genes, whereas that of the <italic>ALPL</italic> gene was markedly inhibited, and is the key enzyme initiating ECM mineralization. Osteogenic properties are one of most important diagnostic features of osteosarcomas [<xref rid="pone.0131998.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and, therefore, the inhibitory effect of <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C on osteogenic differentiation may interfere tumor cells to be diagnosed as osteosarcoma.</p>
      <p>The gene-specific effects of <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C was an interesting finding. <italic>IDH1</italic> R132C increased histone methylation in both cartilage- and bone-related genes as well as global histone methylation. However, target modifications, either active or repressive, markedly differed in a gene-specific manner, and ultimately had different effects on the expression of each gene. We currently have no data to explain the mechanism underlying this gene-specific regulation, but consider this an important issue for understanding the effects of <italic>IDH</italic> mutations on the differentiation of various types of cancers.</p>
