      <abstract>
        <p id="P2">Although there has been much success in identifying genetic variants associated with common diseases using genome-wide association studies (GWAS)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, it has been difficult to demonstrate which variants are causal and what role they play in disease. Moreover, the modest contribution these variants make to disease risk has raised questions regarding their medical relevance<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. We have investigated a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the <italic>TNFRSF1A</italic> gene, that encodes TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), which was discovered through GWAS to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, but not with other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, psoriasis<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and Crohnâs disease<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. By analyzing MS GWAS<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> data in conjunction with the 1000 Genomes Project data<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> we provide genetic evidence that strongly implicates this SNP, rs1800693, as the causal variant in the <italic>TNFRSF1A</italic> region. We further substantiate this through functional studies showing that the MS risk allele directs expression of a novel, soluble form of TNFR1 that can block TNF. Importantly, TNF blocking drugs can promote onset or exacerbation of MS<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, but they have proven highly efficacious in the treatment of autoimmune diseases for which there is no association with rs1800693. This indicates that the clinical experience with these drugs parallels the disease association of rs1800693, and that the MS-associated TNFR1 variant mimics the effect of TNF blocking drugs. Hence, our study demonstrates that clinical practice can be informed by comparing GWAS across common autoimmune diseases and by investigating the functional consequences of the disease-associated genetic variation.</p>

    <p id="P3">The largest MS GWAS<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> reports rs1800693 as the most associated SNP in the <italic>TNFRSF1A</italic> region by over two orders of magnitude (odds ratio for risk allele = 1.12 (1.11-1.14); <italic>P</italic> = 4.1Ã10<sup>â14</sup>). To assess whether this SNP is mainly driving the association we examined the haplotype structure across the region in 379 individuals of European ancestry using whole genome sequence from the 1000 Genomes Project<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and we performed statistical imputation into a UK cohort of 1,853 MS patients and 5,174 controls<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Among genotyped SNPs the strongest signal is seen at rs1800693 and the variants in strongest association with this SNP were also genotyped in the study. Statistical imputation<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> revealed no other variant with stronger association to MS within the region, including the previously reported<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> nonsynonymous SNP rs4149584 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), and analysis of association after controlling for the effect of rs1800693 removed almost all of the signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These observations all support variation at rs1800693 as being primarily responsible for the MS association in the <italic>TNFRSF1A</italic> region.</p>
    <p id="P4">To further substantiate the causality of rs1800693, we next sought to investigate the functional consequences of the variation at this SNP. As rs1800693 is proximal to the <italic>TNFRSF1A</italic> exon 6/intron 6 boundary, we hypothesized that this it may influence splicing of TNFR1 exon 6<sup>Ref<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> minigene splicing assay, only the risk â<italic>G</italic>â allele resulted in skipping of exon 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In primary human immune cells we found that the presence of the risk allele correlated with increased expression of transcripts lacking exon 6, with the gene dosage effect observed being consistent with the genetic effect on disease risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Moreover, these transcripts are translated in the primary immune cells, as binding of polysomes to these transcripts demonstrated active translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). As full-length (FL-) TNFR1 expression did not vary in a genotype-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5</xref>), this indicates that the effect of rs1800693 may be specifically mediated by its influence on the generation of a functional protein isoform lacking exon 6 (Î6-TNFR1), and we therefore investigated the properties of this molecule.</p>
    <p id="P5">TNFR1 exon 6 skipping results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon, which translates into a protein comprising only the N-terminal 183 amino acids of FL-TNFR1, followed by a novel 45 amino acid sequence, as confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Consequently, Î6-TNFR1 lacks the extracellular C-terminal portion of the fourth cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FL-TNFR1, the transmembrane domain, and the intracellular region that is essential for appropriate subcellular localization<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. While FL-TNFR1 localizes to the Golgi apparatus, Î6-TNFR1 demonstrated a more diffuse intracellular distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), consistent with the absence of the Golgi-retention motif. Nevertheless, we observed partial subcellular colocalization of FL- and Î6-TNFR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), suggesting the potential for an interaction between the two isoforms. As Î6-TNFR1 retains the pre-ligand assembly domain (PLAD/CRD1), required for TNFR1 trimerization at the cell surface<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, it could exert a functional effect on FL-TNFR1 by associating with it to form heteromers that would therefore have modified properties. To investigate the existence of such an interaction, we used FL- and Î6-TNFR1 proteins fused at their C-termini with fluorescent or luciferase proteins in fluorescence and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (FRET and BRET, respectively). This demonstrated that Î6-TNFR1 associates neither with the full-length protein nor with itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Consistent with this and with the lack of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, Î6-TNFR1 was not observed at the surface of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Hence, as Î6-TNFR1 cannot interact with FL-TNFR1, it is unlikely to have a direct impact on the latter, intracellularly or at the cell surface.</p>
    <p id="P6">To assess whether Î6-TNFR1 has some intracellular function, regardless of its inability to associate with FL-TNFR1, we investigated TNFR1-mediated signaling in Î6-TNFR1-transfected cells. As predicted by the absence of a death domain, which is necessary for both NF-ÎºB-mediated signal transduction and apoptosis<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, no significant spontaneous NF-ÎºB signaling or TNFR1-mediated apoptosis were observed upon Î6-TNFR1 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9 and 10</xref>). However, Î6-TNFR1 could potentially retain some intracellular activity by accumulating in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and evoking a stress response<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, there was no evidence for increased ER-localization of Î6-TNFR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b</xref>), or induction of the unfolded protein response in Î6-compared with FL-TNFR1-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">Given that no intracellular Î6-TNFR1 activity was observed, and that this isoform has no transmembrane region and does not associate with FL-TNFR1, we hypothesized that Î6-TNFR1 could exist as a soluble, functional molecule. Soluble TNFR1 generation has been previously described through exosomal release of full-length receptor and through metalloprotease-dependent cleavage of the FL-TNFR1 extracellular domain. Here, we demonstrate that skipping of exon 6 constitutes a novel mechanism of stable, soluble TNFR1 production: a higher level of soluble protein was found in supernatants of Î6-compared to FL-TNFR1-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). Given the importance of determining the presence of Î6-TNFR1 protein in primary human samples, an ELISA for this molecule was established. This required the generation of an anti-Î6-TNFR1-specific monoclonal antibody, using a human combinatorial antibody library in conjunction with phage display, as commercially available anti-TNFR1 antibodies are not specific for the splice isoform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). This ELISA allowed the detection of Î6-TNFR1 in the sera of both healthy individuals (range = &lt;1.25-14.8 ng/ml; <italic>n</italic> = 12) and MS patients (range = &lt;1.25-37.3 ng/ml; <italic>n</italic> = 13) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Furthermore, soluble Î6-TNFR1 can bind to TNF, as shown in TNF pull-down assays using TNFR1-F<sub>c</sub> and Î6-TNFR1-F<sub>c</sub> fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Using surface plasmon resonance the TNF binding ability of Î6-TNFR1-F<sub>c</sub> was determined to be in the nanomolar range (K<sub>d</sub> = 15.6 nM), indicating that the isoform has a high affinity for TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Critically, Î6-TNFR1-F<sub>c</sub> proved to have a TNF antagonistic function as it can bind and neutralize the ability of TNF to signal through membrane-bound TNFR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), with the neutralization capacity of Î6-TNFR1-F<sub>c</sub> being consistent with the surface plasmon resonance data.</p>
    <p id="P8">Our combined genetic and functional analyses strongly implicate rs1800693 as the causal SNP in the MS-associated <italic>TNFRSF1A</italic> region, with the risk allele directing an increased expression of Î6-TNFR1. Since Î6-TNFR1 protein is soluble and is capable of TNF antagonism, our evidence is consistent with the reported worsening of MS upon anti-TNF therapy<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. TNF antagonists were originally used in MS patients partly because increased levels of TNF were detected in both active lesions and cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and partly because of reports on animal models of MS where blockade of TNF prevented or delayed disease onset<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. However, opposing findings have also been obtained from animal studies<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and the paradoxical outcomes from these pre-clinical models, as well as the precise mechanism of TNF antagonist action, are unexplained but remain an active area of research<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P9">TNF antagonists are largely beneficial in the treatment of other autoimmune conditions, including RA, psoriasis, Crohnâs disease, and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In accordance with this, common genetic variants in the <italic>TNFRSF1A</italic> region have not been identified for these conditions<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> with the exception of AS<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, that has a distinct association signal compared to MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>), indicating that Î6-TNFR1 is unlikely to influence the pathology of these conditions. Notably, the MS-associated rs1800693 SNP is also associated with primary biliary cirrhosis<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, but there is no controlled clinical study of TNF antagonists in this disease. Interestingly, side effects associated with the use of TNF antagonists in treating non-MS autoimmune diseases include clinical onset of MS and isolated demyelinating diseases, such as optic neuritis, which is often an early manifestation of MS<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. These side effects are relatively rare, indicating that they may only arise in individuals with a propensity for demyelinating disease that is unmasked upon treatment.</p>
    <p id="P10">We have identified a disease-associated genetic variant that directs increased expression of a molecule that is analogous to drugs whose adverse effects can promote or exacerbate disease. This finding has broader implications. A criticism against the potential clinical value of GWAS findings has been the modest effect on disease risk conferred by most associated genetic variants<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. However, this notion does not consider that drugs targeting the same pathways as the genetic variants are likely to have a larger functional impact and thus may be clinically relevant<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. We show that naturally-occurring variation and therapeutic agents can have the same target, but their effect differs in magnitude: Î6-TNFR1 and a TNF antagonist both neutralized TNF, but the antagonist had a greater ability to do so. Therefore, our result suggests that a signal of disease association for rs1800693 could be predictive of an adverse effect of TNF antagonist treatment. In conclusion, our study shows that, through genetic and functional follow-up investigations, GWAS can serve to directly inform therapeutic choice in the treatment of a common disease.</p>

Association analysis with a logistic model accounting for uncertainty in genotype imputation, including gender as a covariate, was carried out using SNPTEST<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, on SNPs with MAF&gt;0.01 that had an imputation information score greater than 0.9. We used a Bayesian, additive test with the score method to measure evidence for association and we report the Bayes factor comparing the models of association and no association. We assumed the default priors of SNPTEST for the analysis, namely the standard normal for the intercept and a normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 0.2 for the genotypes (which were coded as 0, 1 or 2 for the minor homozygous, heterozygous and major homozygous sites respectively). Gender had a normal prior as well, with mean = 0 and variance = 1000. Under the assumption of a single associated variant in the region, the Bayes factor for a variant is a proportional (under weak assumptions) to the posterior probability that it is driving the association. The conditional analysis was performed in the same way, including the genotype at rs1800693 as an additional covariate (with an additive effect).</p>
