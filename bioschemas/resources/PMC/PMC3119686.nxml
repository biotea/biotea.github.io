      <abstract>
        <p>Circadian clocks coordinate the timing of important biological processes. Interconnected transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops based on a set of clock genes generate and maintain these rhythms with a period of about 24 hours. Many clock proteins undergo circadian cycles of post-translational modifications. Among these modifications, protein phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating activity, stability and intracellular localization of clock components. Several protein kinases were characterized as regulators of the circadian clock. However, the function of protein phosphatases, which balance phosphorylation events, in the mammalian clock mechanism is less well understood. Here, we identify protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) as regulator of period and light-induced resetting of the mammalian circadian clock. Down-regulation of PP1 activity in cells by RNA interference and <italic>in vivo</italic> by expression of a specific inhibitor in the brain of mice tended to lengthen circadian period. Moreover, reduction of PP1 activity in the brain altered light-mediated clock resetting behavior in mice, enhancing the phase shifts in either direction. At the molecular level, diminished PP1 activity increased nuclear accumulation of the clock component PER2 in neurons. Hence, PP1, may reduce PER2 phosphorylation thereby influencing nuclear localization of this protein. This may at least partially influence period and phase shifting properties of the mammalian circadian clock.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Many behavioral, physiological and metabolic functions are temporally organized and show daily rhythms, even in the absence of external timing cues. Temporal coordination of biological processes separates biochemically incompatible reactions, optimizes an organism's energy expenditure, and may improve overall performance. Circadian (â=ââabout a dayâ) oscillations are based on an autonomous clock mechanism that is phase-controlled and synchronized with the environment by external time cues, such as light or food. In mammals, the central circadian pacemaker is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a structure in the ventral hypothalamus. Light, which serves as strong timing cue or Zeitgeber, directly impinges on the cellular oscillators of SCN neurons via the retinohypothalamic tract. The SCN can integrate this temporal information and coordinate all body clocks to establish and maintain adequate phase-relationships between different tissue clocks (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0021325-Bass1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The cell-autonomous clockwork that generates circadian oscillations is composed of interlocked transcriptional-posttranslational feedback loops <xref rid="pone.0021325-Ko1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These loops control the rhythmic expression of transcriptional activators and repressors whose interplay generates rhythms of approximately 24 hours. In the essential core feedback loop of the mammalian clock, two transcriptional activators, BMAL1 <xref rid="pone.0021325-Bunger1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Hogenesch1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and CLOCK (or NPAS2 in the brain) <xref rid="pone.0021325-DeBruyne1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-King1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Reick1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, drive the expression of the <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per1-3</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0021325-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Zheng2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and <italic>Cryptochrome (Cry1-2)</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0021325-vanderHorst1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> genes via binding to E-boxes on the promoters of these genes. PER and CRY proteins form complexes and re-enter the nucleus, where they inhibit their own transcription <xref rid="pone.0021325-Gekakis1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Griffin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Kume1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This core loop can directly be influenced by environmental resetting signals via cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated induction of <italic>Per</italic> gene expression <xref rid="pone.0021325-Motzkus1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-TravnickovaBendova1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This induction of the <italic>Per</italic> genes is involved in the light-mediated readjustment of the mammalian circadian oscillator to environmental time <xref rid="pone.0021325-Akiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Albrecht1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Tischkau1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Wakamatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Post-translational modifications of several clock components are required to adjust the period length of the feedback loops to 24 hours and to allow proper phase adjustments of the clock. Among these modifications, protein phosphorylation plays a critical role. Most clock proteins can be phosphorylated at multiple sites to determine their stability, activity and subcellular localization (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0021325-Gallego1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Vanselow1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>). The clock component PER2 appears to be highly regulated by phosphorylation. PER2 has at least 21 phosphorylated residues <xref rid="pone.0021325-Vanselow2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and several kinases were described as regulators of PER2 <xref rid="pone.0021325-Jakubcakova1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Maier1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. A mutation found in the human <italic>Per2</italic> gene causes familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS) <xref rid="pone.0021325-Toh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Interestingly, mutation of the FASPS site (S662) of an hPER2 transgene affects the period of the circadian oscillator in mice in opposite directions depending on whether the mutation mimics hypo- or hyperphosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0021325-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This suggests that the balance of protein kinase and phosphatase activity that controls the net phosphorylation state of every phosphorylated substrate is critical to allow optimal clock functioning. Protein serine/threonine phosphatases have been implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms in dinoflagellates <xref rid="pone.0021325-Comolli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, neurospora <xref rid="pone.0021325-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and the fruit fly <xref rid="pone.0021325-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Sathyanarayanan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In mammals, phosphatases were shown to affect the expression of the clock component PER2 in cell culture <xref rid="pone.0021325-Eide1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Gallego2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, indicating evolutionary conserved mechanisms. However, their precise function in the mammalian circadian mechanism has not been investigated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>Here, we examined the impact of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) on circadian rhythmicity and photic entrainment of the mammalian circadian clock. PP1 is one of the major and most abundant eukaryotic protein serine/threonine phosphatases and has been implicated in various biological processes such as cell division, metabolism, synaptic plasticity, transcription and translation (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0021325-Ceulemans1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>). Activity, substrate specificity and intracellular localization of this enzyme are tightly regulated by the interaction with over 50 established or putative targeting and regulatory subunits <xref rid="pone.0021325-Ceulemans1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. To study the function of PP1, PP1 activity was modulated in cells and in the brain of transgenic mice by inducible expression of the regulatory protein inhibitor-1 (I-1) or Nuclear Inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1). Our results indicate that PP1 influences the period length of the mammalian circadian oscillator and is involved in mediating the response of the oscillator to entraining light information. At the cellular level, PP1 appears to be implicated in the regulation of the subcellular localization of the PER2 protein. Hence, PP1 is an important opponent of kinases within the mammalian circadian clock.</p>

        <p>To get insights in the function of PP1 in the mammalian clock mechanism, we reduced the expression of various catalytic subunits of PP1 in human osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells by RNA interference.

<xref rid="pone.0021325-Maier1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In mammals, three genes encode the PP1 catalytic subunits PPP1CA, PPP1CB, and PPP1CC <xref rid="pone.0021325-Ceulemans1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. These subunits are ubiquitously expressed and are targeted to varying but distinct intracellular locations by the interaction with regulatory proteins. The expression of PPP1CA, PPP1CB or PPP1CC was reduced by lentiviral infection of U-2 OS reporter cells with RNAi constructs specific for the respective subunits with more than 75% knock-down efficiency at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Cells were synchronized with dexamethasone and the rhythmic bioluminescence was continuously monitored for several days. As a result, knock-down of PPP1CA, PPP1CB or PPP1CC provoked lengthening of the circadian period of U-2 OS cells of up to two hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s001">S1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>In a second approach we wanted to interfere with PP1 activity in a biochemical manner. We used NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts that express a constitutively active form of inhibitor-1 (I-1), an endogenous inhibitor of PP1 <xref rid="pone.0021325-Foulkes1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The constitutively active form corresponds to a short form of I-1 (amino acids 9 to 54), in which the threonine residue that is normally phosphorylated by protein kinase A is substituted by a phosphomimicking aspartic acid residue <xref rid="pone.0021325-Alberts1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This constitutively active form of I-1 is designated I-1*. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with a <italic>Bmal1 luciferase</italic> reporter together with either empty expression vector or increasing amounts of an expression vector for HA-tagged I-1*. Similar to the knock-down experiments, the expression of HA-I-1* lengthened the period of the <italic>Bmal1 luc</italic> oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This lengthening was dose-dependent for two concentrations of HA-I-1* expression vector (0.1 Âµg and 0.2 Âµg) and appeared to reach saturation at a concentration of 0.4 Âµg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). I-1* expression led to periods that were up to 50 minutes longer than the period of control cells. Altogether, these results indicate that PP1 is involved in the determination of the circadian period length in mammalian cells.</p>

        <title>I-1* mutant mice tend to have a longer free-running period</title>
        <p>To assess the importance of PP1 on circadian behavior, PP1 activity was reversibly reduced specifically in the brain of transgenic mice (and not in other tissues). Mutant mice expressed inducibly the constitutively active form of inhibitor 1 (I-1*) <xref rid="pone.0021325-Genoux1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Expression of I-1* was regulated by a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA2 transgene) system under the control of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase alpha (<italic>CaMKIIalpha</italic>) promoter <xref rid="pone.0021325-Michalon1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> that is also active in the SCN <xref rid="pone.0021325-AlvarezSaavedra1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Double transgenic mice (I-1* mutant mice; rtTA2<sup>+</sup>/I-1*<sup>+</sup>) were treated with doxycycline in order to induce I-1* mRNA expression in the forebrain and hence leading to a reduction of PP1 activity. Control mice were animals having either one of the transgenes or no transgene (rtTA2<sup>â</sup>/I-1*<sup>â</sup>; rtTA2<sup>â</sup>/I-1*<sup>+</sup>; rtTA2<sup>+</sup>/I-1*<sup>â</sup>). They underwent the same treatment as indicated for double transgenic mice.</p>
        <p>We analyzed the wheel running locomotor activity before the doxycycline treatment (off dox), during the doxycycline treatment (on dox) and after the doxycycline treatment (on/off dox). Control and I-1* mutant mice entrained similarly to a 12-h light/12-h darkness cycle (LD 12â¶12 h cycle) under on dox conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>) and displayed stable free-running activity rhythms when maintained in constant darkness (DD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>). Similar to the lengthening of the period in cells expressing I-1*, I-1* expression in the brain appears to provoke a longer free-running period compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, on dox). This phenotype was not present under uninduced conditions (mutant off dox). Of note is the fact that doxycycline appears to shorten the period length in all genotypes as revealed by repeated measures 2-way ANOVA and paired t-test analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s008">Table S2</xref>). The genotype as well as the treatment affected the results (Fâ=â17.73, DFnâ=â1, DFdâ=â42, pâ=â0.0004; Fâ=â32.74, DFnâ=â2, DFdâ=â42, p&lt;0.0001, respectively) and the matching was effective (Fâ=â2.65, DFnâ=â21, DFdâ=â42, pâ=â0.0035). However, interaction between genotype and treatment appears to be significant (Fâ=â3.79, DFnâ=â2, DFdâ=â42, pâ=â0.03) indicating that the p values are difficult to interpret since the shortening effect of doxycycline is different depending on the genotype. In contrast to cells expressing I-1*, we observed only a trend towards a longer period in mice expressing I-1*. This is probably due to a less efficient reduction of PP1 activity in our mice compared to the knock-down in cells. To confirm I-1* expression and consequent reduction of PP1 activity in the SCN, we measured PP1 activity in the SCN of control and I-1* mutant mice under on dox conditions. PP1 activity was significantly reduced by 20% in I-1* mutant mice compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Protein phosphatase 1 is involved in light-induced clock resetting</title>
        <p>In addition to the importance of phosphorylation events for steady state oscillator functions, protein phosphorylation is an important mediator of light-induced resetting of the clock (for review see <xref rid="pone.0021325-Hirota1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>). Thus, we analyzed the ability of I-1* mutant mice to reset the clock in response to light presented during the subjective night. We performed light pulses using an Aschoff type I protocol <xref rid="pone.0021325-Jud1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> under induced (on dox) and uninduced conditions (off dox and on/off dox). Animals were maintained in constant darkness and 15-min light pulses of 400 lx were administered. The light pulses corresponded to a pulse at circadian time (CT) 10 which is during the subjective day and should not have an effect on the oscillator, and light pulses at CT14 and CT22, which should provoke a phase delay and phase advance of the oscillator, respectively. Both, control and I-1* mutant mice, did not phase shift their locomotor behavior in response to light presented at CT10 under uninduced or induced conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly after a light pulse administered at CT14, I-1* mutant mice displayed phase delays of â148.8Â±5.5 min (mean Â± SEM) that were approximately 40 min greater than the phase delays of control animals (â107.9Â±5.5 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This phenotype was due to I-1* expression and reduction of PP1 activity as it was fully reversed by suppressing transgene expression (on/off dox condition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar to the more pronounced phase delays, I-1* mutant mice also showed larger phase advances compared to control mice after a light pulse presented at late subjective night (CT22; 78.46Â±8.4 min for I-1* mutant and 38.34Â±4.45 for controls, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Again, phase advances were similar in control and I-1* mutant mice before doxycycline induction (off dox) or when transgene expression was suppressed (on/off dox) indicating that PP1 activity is involved in the observed resetting phenotypes.</p>

        <p>The action of PP1 in determining the period length of the mammalian clock and in modulating the response of the oscillator towards light may be via dephosphorylation events in the cytoplasm, in the nucleus, or both. To investigate the role of PP1 specifically in the nucleus, we measured circadian parameters in mice expressing a fragment of the Nuclear Inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1). This fragment contains the PP1 inhibition domain and the nuclear localization domain of NIPP1 and is constitutively active in the nucleus of cells (NIPP1*; <xref rid="pone.0021325-Koshibu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>). NIPP1* was expressed in an inducible manner using the doxycycline-dependent rtTA2 and the <italic>CaMKIIalpha</italic> promoter in a similar manner as in the I-1* animals. NIPP1* mice had robust free-running rhythms in DD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s002">Figure S2A, S2B</xref>) with a trend towards a slightly longer period under on dox conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Similar to I-1* mutant mice, NIPP1* mutants showed significantly larger phase delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, on dox) and phase advances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, on dox) after light pulses at CT14 and CT22, and this could be fully reversed after dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g003">Figure 3D, 3E</xref>, on/off dox).</p>
        <p>Altogether, these results suggest that PP1 is involved in the mechanism that mediates resetting of the clock in the brain in response to the Zeitgeber light. Our results further indicate that this process is most probably influenced by nuclear PP1 activity.</p>

        <title>PP1 affects PER1 and PER2 accumulation</title>
        <p>Light-induced resetting of the circadian clock involves activation of several signaling cascades and phospho-CREB mediated induction of the <italic>Per</italic> genes in the SCN <xref rid="pone.0021325-Motzkus1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-TravnickovaBendova1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Gau1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Ginty1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.

        <p>To test whether PP1 impinges on <italic>Per</italic> gene induction, we measured light-mediated <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> induction in the SCN in control and I-1* mutant mice at the beginning or the end of the subjective night.

We observed altered accumulation patterns of PER1 and PER2 in brain nuclear extracts from I-1* mutant mice compared to nuclear extracts from control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). I-1* mutant animals displayed higher levels of nuclear PER1 and PER2 at ZT2 and ZT20. To a lower extent this appears also to be the case for BMAL1.

Moreover, expression patterns of PER1, PER2, BMAL1 and CLOCK were comparable in liver extracts from the same animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) indicating that the observed effect was due to the brain-specific expression of I-1*.</p>

        <p>Altered PER protein accumulation observed in brain nuclear extracts might be due to changes in the overall amount of PER proteins or changes in their intracellular localization. To get insights on this, we analyzed PER2 expression in the SCN of I-1* mice by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical stainings comparing the expression of PER2 in the SCN of control and I-1* mice revealed PER2 to be rhythmically expressed in the SCN of both genotypes, with the higher amount of antiPER2-immunoreactive nuclei present at ZT14 and ZT20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). No apparent differences regarding phase and magnitude of PER2 expression were found between control and I-1* mutant mice under induced conditions.

        <p>In order to confirm our observations in SCN tissue we investigated the effects of I-1* expression on the localization of the PER2 protein in cultured cells. To this end we analyzed the expression and subcellular localization of a GFP-tagged version of PER2 in NG108-15 neuroblastoma cells, since this cell line is of neuronal and glial origin. GFP-PER2 was expressed either with empty expression vector or expression vectors for I-1* or CRY1.

Co-expression of the clock component CRY1 promoted nuclear localization of the PER2 protein (3.4%Â±6.2 nuclear localization in control cells versus 83.5%Â±11.4 in CRY1-expressing cells; p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Post-translational modifications of clock components such as ubiquitination, acetylation and phosphorylation have critical functions in the mammalian circadian clock <xref rid="pone.0021325-Vanselow1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. A basic transcriptional-translational feedback loop alone would operate only in a range of a few hours <xref rid="pone.0021325-Ripperger1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Post-translational regulation is an elegant way to add delays of several hours between activation and repression of transcription and consequently to adjust the period of the circadian clock to the 24-hour day. By regulating clock protein stability, activity, and/or subcellular localization, protein phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the 24-hour rhythm. Several clock components are subject to phosphorylation (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0021325-Vanselow1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>). Among the mammalian clock proteins, phosphorylation of the PER proteins appears to have a special importance for the dynamics of the circadian cycle.</p>
      <p>Kinases of the casein kinase (CK) 1 and 2 family have been shown to determine the period of the circadian system by targeting the PER proteins <xref rid="pone.0021325-Maier1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Camacho1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Vielhaber1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Furthermore, specific phosphorylated residues in the PER proteins affect the period length of the oscillator. The FASPS mutation of hPER2 (S662G) results in PER2 being hypophosphorylated by CK1 <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0021325-Toh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Interestingly, mice carrying this mutation display a shorter period length in DD <xref rid="pone.0021325-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. By contrast, the mutation of the FASPS site of hPER2 to a phosphomimicking aspartate residue leads to a significantly longer period. This result highlights that phosphorylation events at specific residues are dynamic but are highly balanced to maintain circadian cycles of about 24 hours. Reversibility is achieved by the interplay of protein kinases and phosphatases.</p>
      <p>Studies in several organisms suggested functions of protein serine/threonine phosphatases in regulating circadian rhythmicity <xref rid="pone.0021325-Comolli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Sathyanarayanan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, we were interested to see, whether PP1 has important functions in the mammalian clock mechanism. We provide evidence that this enzyme influences the dynamics of the mammalian circadian timing system. Down-regulation of the catalytic subunits of PP1 by RNAi and of PP1 activity by over-expression of a constitutively active inhibitor I-1* lengthened the period of luciferase rhythms in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, mice expressing constitutively active PP1 inhibitors in the brain displayed behavioral rhythms with a longer period length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) than control mice, suggesting a function of PP1 in regulating the period of the circadian oscillator <italic>in vivo</italic>. This phenotype is similar to the phenotype observed in fruit flies having reduced PP1 activity <xref rid="pone.0021325-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Flies over-expressing NIPP1 in clock neurons exhibited a significantly lengthened circadian period. Interestingly, these flies also showed high amplitude light-induced resetting. The same phenotype was observed in I-1* as well as NIPP1* mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Hence, the role of PP1 in controlling clock parameters may be evolutionarily conserved at least between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals.</p>
      <p>PP1 is an ubiquitous protein serine/threonine phosphatase that has been implicated in various biological processes <xref rid="pone.0021325-Ceulemans1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. By the specific interaction of the PP1 catalytic subunits with various regulatory and targeting proteins, activity and substrate specificity are highly regulated. In a previous study, PP1 was shown to coimmunoprecipitate with, dephosphorylate and stabilize the PER2 protein in HEK293 cells <xref rid="pone.0021325-Gallego2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In our study, we found only a minor effect of PP1 on the stability of PER2 in the brain and of overexpressed full-length PER2 in NG 108-15 neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s004">Figure S4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s006">S6</xref>). In particular, expression of PP1 inhibitors (HA-I-1* or HA-NIPP1*) did not affect the half-life of V5-tagged full-length PER2 in NG 108-15 cells treated with cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to tissue-specific differences in PP1 action on PER2 that may involve different regulatory components. However, comparing protein expression patterns in brain nuclear extracts, we found differences in the nuclear accumulation of PER1 and PER2 between control and I-1* mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, a larger fraction of PER2-GFP was located in the nucleus of neuroblastoma cells expressing I-1* or NIPP1* compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s005">S5</xref>). From these results, we conclude that PP1 influences the subcellular localization of PER2 by tipping the PER2 cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio towards the cytoplasmic fraction. Taken together, our and previous studies suggest PER2 as a molecular target of PP1. Timing of nuclear entry and the dynamics of nuclear accumulation of the components of the repressor complexes containing PER2 influence the period of the circadian oscillator <xref rid="pone.0021325-Vanselow2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-Maier1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Hence, we can speculate that PP1 impacts on the period partially via the PER2 protein. However, a slight effect of PP1 inhibition was observed for BMAL1, indicating that PP1 may not act on PER protein accumulation only, but may also affect BMAL1 levels possibly via epigenetic modifications on the transcriptional machinery <xref rid="pone.0021325-Koshibu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to affecting oscillator function under constant conditions, we show that PP1 is involved in the mechanisms in the SCN that mediate the response of the oscillator to entraining light input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021325-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Entrainment of the clock employs several signal transduction cascades that depend on protein phosphorylation (for review see <xref rid="pone.0021325-Hirota1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>). A recent study shows that the pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1), which counteracts Akt, protein kinase C (PKC), and ERK1/2 signaling, impacts on resetting by modifying the period length after a light stimulus <xref rid="pone.0021325-Masubuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This further highlights the importance of balanced activities between protein kinases and phosphatases in the entrainment mechanism of the circadian clock system.</p>
      <p>The signaling pathways mediating light input to the clock involve phospho-CREB induced <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> expression in the SCN <xref rid="pone.0021325-Motzkus1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0021325-TravnickovaBendova1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Our data indicate that PP1 does not significantly affect the immediate early signaling cascades in the SCN that ultimately lead to <italic>Per</italic> gene induction. <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> induction after light pulses at CT14 or CT22 was similar in control and I-1* mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021325.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Hence, PP1 may not influence resetting of the clock via CRE-mediated mechanisms inducing <italic>Per</italic> gene expression in the SCN. Instead, PP1 may influence resetting of the molecular oscillator in the SCN by acting on the phosphorylation status of the PER proteins. Similarly, PKC has been shown to influence phase shifting properties of the circadian clock by affecting stability and subcellular distribution of PER2 in response to light input <xref rid="pone.0021325-Jakubcakova1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition to the function of PP1 in the resetting mechanisms of the SCN, this phosphatase appears also to be involved in retinal transmission of light to the SCN specifically at early subjective night <xref rid="pone.0021325-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Altogether, our experiments suggest that PP1 is a post-translational regulator of the mammalian circadian clock <italic>in vivo</italic>. This phosphatase modulates the period of the circadian oscillator and serves as a negative regulator in the light-induced resetting mechanisms in the SCN. We hypothesize that PP1 fulfills these functions (at least in part) by influencing the dynamics of PER2 nuclear accumulation.</p>

<bold>Cycloheximide treatment.</bold> (A) NG-108-15 cells transiently expressing Per2-V5 either alone or together with HA-I-1* or HA-NIPP1* were treated for up to 4 hours with 25 Âµg/ml cycloheximide. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. (B) Two individual experiments were quantified using the Quantity One 1-D analysis software (Biorad). For each time point, the amount of PER2-V5 was normalized to actin. For each experiment, the normalized amount of PER2-V5 at time point 0 was set to 100%.</p>
