      <abstract>
        <p>Paralogs for several proteins implicated in neurodegenerative disorders have been identified and explored to further facilitate the identification of molecular mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis. For the disease-causing protein in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, ataxin-2, a paralog of unknown function, termed ataxin-2-like, has been described. We discovered that ataxin-2-like associates with known interaction partners of ataxin-2, the RNA helicase DDX6 and the poly(A)-binding protein, and with ataxin-2 itself. Furthermore, we found that ataxin-2-like is a component of stress granules. Interestingly, sole ataxin-2-like overexpression led to the induction of stress granules, while a reduction of stress granules was detected in case of a low ataxin-2-like level. Finally, we observed that overexpression of ataxin-2-like as well as its reduction has an impact on the presence of microscopically visible processing bodies. Thus, our results imply a functional overlap between ataxin-2-like and ataxin-2, and further indicate a role for ataxin-2-like in the regulation of stress granules and processing bodies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Late-onset neurodegenerative disorders have been intensively studied over the last two decades. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for their pathologies remain to be elucidated. Of note, some knowledge was gained by exploring the physiological function of paralogous proteins identified for several disease proteins. Regarding the family of polyglutamine disorders, which includes Huntingtonâs disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 &amp; 17 <xref rid="pone.0050134-Truant1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Reddy1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Zoghbi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Orr1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, a gene duplication of ataxin-1-like (ATXN1L)/Brother of ataxin-1 (Boat), the respective paralog of the disease-causing protein ataxin-1 (ATXN1), ameliorated the observed neurotoxicity in a SCA1 mouse model, indicating overlapping functionality between paralog and disease protein <xref rid="pone.0050134-Bowman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The search for the gene causing SCA2 led to the isolation of the <italic>SCA2</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0050134-Sanpei1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Pulst1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Imbert1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which comprises an intrinsic CAG repeat that is interrupted by 1â3 CAA triplets in healthy individuals, while a continuous CAG repeat of more than 34 repeats has been observed in affected individuals <xref rid="pone.0050134-Sanpei1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Imbert1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Geschwind1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The expansion on the genetic level is causal for an extended polyglutamine domain in the <italic>SCA2</italic> gene product ataxin-2 (ATXN2). Interestingly, these efforts also resulted in the isolation of a partial cDNA sequence on chromosome 16 that showed high homology to the <italic>SCA2</italic> gene sequence <xref rid="pone.0050134-Pulst1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The encoded protein showed high homology with ATXN2 and was therefore named ataxin-2-related protein (A2RP) <xref rid="pone.0050134-Figueroa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Independently from these studies, Meunier and colleagues reported the identification of a gene at the same chromosome locus and named the respective gene product ataxin-2 domain protein (A2D) <xref rid="pone.0050134-Meunier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Proteins of the A2RP or A2D family, which we refer to as ataxin-2-like (ATXN2L), are widely expressed in human tissues and orthologs are present in other species <xref rid="pone.0050134-Figueroa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Comparison of the derived amino acid sequences of ATXN2 and ATXN2L showed that several motifs are conserved such as the N-terminal acidic domain containing the mRNA-binding motifs Sm1 and Sm2, putative caspase-3 cleavage sites, a clathrin-mediated trans-Golgi signal, and an endoplasmic reticulum exit signal. Furthermore, both proteins comprise the binding motif for the PABC domain of the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), termed PAM2 <xref rid="pone.0050134-Figueroa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Kozlov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Despite these shared motifs, the polyglutamine tract is not conserved between ATXN2 and ATXN2L <xref rid="pone.0050134-Figueroa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Considering the high degree of structural similarity between ATXN2 and ATXN2L, a functional overlap between these paralogs is likely. Regarding the cellular function of ATXN2L, which remains to be understood, an association with the erythropoietin receptor has been reported suggesting a function in cytokine signaling <xref rid="pone.0050134-Meunier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. To this point, a role of ATXN2 in endocytic processes and RNA-processing pathways was demonstrated <xref rid="pone.0050134-LastresBecker1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Ralser1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Nonhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Ralser2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-vandeLoo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Concerning its function in the cellular RNA metabolism, ATXN2 is found in association with PABP, further being a dosage-dependent regulator of this protein <xref rid="pone.0050134-Ralser1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Nonhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Moreover, direct interactions of ATXN2 with RNA splicing factors and RNA-binding proteins have been described <xref rid="pone.0050134-Welzel1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Finally, an association of ATXN2 with polyribosomes and direct binding of ATXN2 to RNA was demonstrated <xref rid="pone.0050134-Satterfield1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and ATXN2 has been identified as a component of stress granules (SGs) <xref rid="pone.0050134-Ralser1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Nonhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These are dynamic cellular structures assembling in mammalian cells in response to diverse cellular stresses representing sites of mRNA regulation. SGs contain untranslated mRNAs, eukaryotic initiation factors, small ribosomal subunits, various RNA-binding proteins, and proteins implicated in cell signaling <xref rid="pone.0050134-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Anderson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Buchan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, there is a dynamic interplay between SGs and processing bodies (P-bodies), sites of mRNA degradation that comprise components of microRNA or RNAi pathways as well as the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway <xref rid="pone.0050134-Eulalio1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we considered a potential functional overlap between ATXN2L and ATXN2 with regard to RNA metabolism. We discovered that ATXN2L associates with known ATXN2 interaction partners such as the RNA helicase DDX6 and PABP, and with ATXN2 itself. Furthermore, we observed that ATXN2L is a <italic>bona fide</italic> component of SGs. Finally, we report that ATXN2L overexpression as well as its reduction has a regulatory effect on SGs and P-bodies.</p>

        <title>ATXN2L Associates with PABP, DDX6, and ATXN2</title>
        <p>Since ATXN2L and ATXN2 share most functional motifs and domains as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0050134-Figueroa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, both proteins likely act in related pathways. Our earlier work demonstrated that ATXN2 interacts with PABP and with the RNA helicase DDX6/Rck <xref rid="pone.0050134-Ralser1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Nonhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In this regard, the PAM2 motif, a binding motif found in proteins interacting with the PABC domain of PABP <xref rid="pone.0050134-Kozlov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, is also present in ATXN2L. Moreover, the acidic domain, which comprises the LSm domain and the LSm-associated domain (LSmAD), represents the interaction surface between ATXN2 and DDX6, and is 69% identical (80% sequence similarity) in both proteins <xref rid="pone.0050134-Figueroa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Nonhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Albrecht1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Accordingly, we set out to analyze whether ATXN2L is also found in association with PABP and DDX6. For this, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell lysates prepared from HEK293T and HeLa cells. After incubation of cell lysates with an antibody directed against ATXN2L, precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, we were able to precipitate endogenous PABP (left panel) and DDX6 (middle panel) with an ATXN2L-specific antibody from both cell lysates. Due to this finding, we additionally investigated whether ATXN2L and ATXN2 are found in association as well. Again, cell lysates were prepared from these two cell lines and processed as described. We observed that endogenous ATXN2 was precipitated with the ATXN2L-specific antibody as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g001">Fig. 1B, right panel</xref>).

        <p>Next we investigated the intracellular localization of endogenous ATXN2L by confocal microscopy as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. This analysis revealed that ATXN2L is primarily cytoplasmic but also present in nuclear structures that co-localize with SR proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, upper panel). These represent markers of nuclear splicing speckles <xref rid="pone.0050134-Misteli1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, which belong to a family of splicing regulators with a characteristic domain rich in arginine and serine residues <xref rid="pone.0050134-Long1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thus, ATXN2L is a component of splicing speckles. Since a nuclear localization was also reported for ATXN2 <xref rid="pone.0050134-Hallen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, we further analyzed whether endogenous ATXN2 is part of these structures as well. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> (lower panel), nuclear ATXN2 did not co-localize with SR-positive structures in HeLa cells under the chosen conditions.

        <title>ATXN2L is a Component of SGs</title>

To induce the formation of SGs, HeLa cells were first treated with sodium arsenite or heat-shocked. Then, cells were fixed and stained with ATXN2- and ATXN2L-specific antibodies, and the localization of both proteins was analyzed by confocal microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, ATXN2L localizes in distinct cytoplasmic foci in arsenite- and heat-treated cells, which were also positive for ATXN2. We also included the core SG marker proteins T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1-related protein (TIAR) and PABP in this analysis, and detected a co-localization of ATXN2L-positive foci with TIAR- and PABP-positive foci in arsenite- and heat-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050134.s001">Fig. S1B, S1C</xref>). Since the composition of SGs can vary under different stress conditions <xref rid="pone.0050134-Anderson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Buchan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, we investigated the localization of ATXN2L under additional stresses, such as osmotic stress induced by sorbitol <xref rid="pone.0050134-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, ER stress induced by dithiothreitol (DTT) <xref rid="pone.0050134-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and oxidative stress induced by sodium selenite or hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) <xref rid="pone.0050134-Fujimura1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Emara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Also under these conditions ATXN2L formed cytoplasmic foci that co-localize with ATXN2-positive foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Moreover, we performed stress experiments in the presence of cycloheximide, a setting preventing SG assembly <xref rid="pone.0050134-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. For this, HeLa cells were treated with arsenite in the presence of cycloheximide, fixed, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. We observed that ATXN2L and ATXN2 retained their cytoplasmic distribution in HeLa cells with concurrent cycloheximide treatment, whereas in arsenite-treated control cells both proteins are localized to SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). We also performed this experiment with heat-treated cells and made the same observations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050134.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the localization of ATXN2L under conditions in which SGs disassemble <xref rid="pone.0050134-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Subsequent to arsenite treatment, HeLa cells were incubated for additional 90â180 min under normal growth conditions, fixed, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, ATXN2L-positive as well as ATXN2-positive foci dispersed in arsenite-treated cells after 180 min recovery and both proteins were diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Again, similar findings were obtained under heat stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050134.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>).

        <p>Next we addressed the question whether ATXN2L overexpression may possibly induce SGs as the SG marker protein G3BP does <xref rid="pone.0050134-Tourriere1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We transfected HeLa cells with the respective plasmids for overexpressing ATXN2L, ATXN2, or G3BP, and analyzed their impact on SG induction using the SG marker protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma (eIF4G) in our confocal microscopy analysis. Of note, we observed that cells with ATXN2L overexpression exhibited eIF4G-positive foci, while eIF4G remained evenly distributed in non-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, upper panel). SG formation was not detected in ATXN2 overexpressing cells using eIF4G staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, middle panel). As expected, we observed that overexpressed G3BP co-localized with eIF4G-positive foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, lower panel). Thus, overexpression of ATXN2L induces SG formation.</p>
        <p>In this regard, we showed earlier that reduction of the intracellular ATXN2 level has an impact on SG formation <xref rid="pone.0050134-Nonhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Consequently, we analyzed the influence of a reduced ATXN2L level on SG formation as well. First we verified the ATXN2L or ATXN2 knock down by immunoblotting and microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050134.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Then, we transfected HeLa cells with specific siRNA molecules targeting ATXN2L or ATXN2 transcripts, with unspecific non-targeting (NT) siRNA molecules, or left cells untreated (mock), and exposed cells to arsenite stress 72 h after transfection. After fixation the SG marker proteins eIF4G and TIAR were stained and analyzed by confocal microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, cells with reduced ATXN2L or ATXN2 level exhibited fewer and smaller eIF4G-positive foci compared to control cells (mock and siNT). To further corroborate and quantify these findings, we additionally performed an automated microscopy approach based on a Cellomics ArrayScan VTI high-content screening platform. This system automatically acquires images of stained cells in multi-well plates. Cells are identified by nuclear staining and fixed object selection parameters, and SGs are quantified within a circular area extending the nuclear region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050134.s004">Fig. S4</xref>; for details please see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). First, we excluded that transfection of siRNA molecules has an impact on cell survival or the nuclear size representing a basic morphological parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Of note, we observed that in cells with a lowered ATXN2L level the number of eIF4G- and TIAR-positive SGs was significantly reduced to 34Â±4% or 46Â±5% compared to the non-targeting control (p&lt;0.001, nâ=â5 replicate wells/condition, Â± SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g005">Fig. 5C and S</xref>4). As expected, cells with a reduced ATXN2 level also exhibited fewer eIF4G- and TIAR-positive SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g005">Fig. 5C and S</xref>4). In addition, the size of SGs was considerably smaller in cells with reduced ATXN2L or ATXN2 level compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050134-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Similar results were obtained if G3BP was used as SG marker protein (data not shown). Thus, our findings demonstrate that ATXN2L is important for SG formation.</p>

For this, HeLa cells were transfected with specific siRNA molecules for ATXN2L or ATXN2 or with unspecific non-targeting siRNA molecules, and P-body formation was analyzed by confocal and automated high-content screening microscopy.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we revealed a functional overlap between ATXN2L and ATXN2 with regard to RNA metabolism, since ATXN2L associates with known interaction partners of ATXN2, the RNA helicase DDX6 and PABP <xref rid="pone.0050134-Ralser1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Nonhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and with ATXN2 itself. Moreover, we discovered that ATXN2L is a <italic>bona fide</italic> component of SGs in mammalian cells under different stress conditions. Most importantly, we identified ATXN2L as a regulator of SGs, since ATXN2L overexpression caused induction of SGs, whereas a low ATXN2L level reduced the number and size of SGs. The overexpression or reduction of several proteins have been reported to affect SG formation or SG composition <xref rid="pone.0050134-Ohn1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, possibly at different steps, since the process of SG formation has been categorized in different stages <xref rid="pone.0050134-Anderson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The first stage begins with stalled initiation and ribosome runoff marking ribonucleoprotein complexes as sites where SGs assemble. This stage is followed by the primary aggregation or SG nucleation step initiated by RNA-binding proteins with aggregation-prone properties, such as T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) and G3BP <xref rid="pone.0050134-Anderson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Tourriere1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Gilks1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, followed by the secondary aggregation step. Finally, proteins are recruited through protein-protein interactions <xref rid="pone.0050134-Anderson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Of note, we observed an association between G3BP and ATXN2L in HeLa cells that has been originally described in a high-throughput analysis <xref rid="pone.0050134-Sowa1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, suggesting that ATXN2L could be important for the nucleation step as G3BP is. Interestingly, we also detected an association between ATXN2 and G3BP in this study. Even so, we observed that ATNX2 overexpression has no effect on SG induction in HeLa cells under the chosen experimental settings, whereas a reduced ATXN2 level also affects number and size of SGs, consistent with our earlier study using HEK293T cells <xref rid="pone.0050134-Nonhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Evidence has been provided that posttranslational modifications of proteins are important in the complex dynamic process of SG assembly. Many RNA-binding proteins implicated in the primary nucleation step contain methylatable domains <xref rid="pone.0050134-Blackwell1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. For the fragile Ã mental retardation protein (FMRP), the methylation of its RRG rich domain is important for its function as inducer of SGs <xref rid="pone.0050134-Dolzhanskaya1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Remarkably, an arginine methylation site at position 361 in the ATXN2L protein has been identified to be methylated, whereas this amino acid position is not conserved in the ATXN2 protein <xref rid="pone.0050134-Ong1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Interestingly, the overexpression of a phosphomimetic G3BP mutant failed to assemble SGs, while overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable G3BP mutant caused SG formation <xref rid="pone.0050134-Tourriere1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, it can be speculated that differences in posttranslational modifications between ATXN2L and ATXN2 are accountable for the observed results regarding SG formation, a task that will be addressed in the future.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, we discovered that ATXN2L is a regulator of P-bodies as well, since ATXN2L overexpression and reduction decreases the number and size of P-bodies in HeLa cells, whereas only ATXN2 overexpression had a noticeable effect on P-bodies as reported earlier <xref rid="pone.0050134-Nonhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Analogous to the assembly of SGs, P-body formation is also affected by the overexpression and reduction of various P-body components <xref rid="pone.0050134-Eulalio1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Interestingly, depletion of DDX6 results in the loss of microscopically visible P-bodies <xref rid="pone.0050134-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. We speculated in our earlier study that the observed mis-localization of DDX6 and loss of microscopically visible P-bodies in cells overexpressing ATXN2 might be based on abnormal protein interactions attributable to the increase in the interaction surface, the LSm/LSmAD domain of ATXN2 <xref rid="pone.0050134-Nonhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Since this domain is conserved in the ATXN2L protein <xref rid="pone.0050134-Figueroa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, such a recruitment mechanism is likely to explain the observed effect as well. Regarding the effect on P-body number and size observed in cells with a reduced ATXN2L concentration, it might be of interest that ATXN2L comprises a sequence in the C-terminal region that shows homology to the Pat1 protein family, which is absent in the ATXN2 protein. The Pat1 protein family is conserved in eukaryotes and two Pat1 proteins, PatL2/Pat1a and PatL1/Pat1b, exist in humans <xref rid="pone.0050134-Scheller1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Ozgur1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. PatL1/Pat1b is a P-body component and the expression of PatL1/Pat1b protein lacking certain domains or its depletion results in loss of microscopically visible P-bodies, whereas PatL1/Pat1b overexpression induces P-body formation <xref rid="pone.0050134-Ozgur1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Braun1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Moreover, PatL1/Pat1b shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, and nuclear PatL1/Pat1b localizes to splicing speckles, indicating that it is implicated in RNA-related processes in both cellular compartments <xref rid="pone.0050134-Marnef1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In this light, it is interesting that we observed a co-localization of ATXN2L and nuclear splicing speckles, suggesting that ATXN2L may function in splicing processes as well. On the other hand, localization of splicing factors is regulated by protein arginine methylation, which also modulates associations between SR-like proteins and splicing factors <xref rid="pone.0050134-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050134-Sinha1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Nonetheless, lysine acetylation is another posttranslational modification that controls the localization and association of proteins involved in various cellular processes including amongst others gene transcription, translation or splicing <xref rid="pone.0050134-Spange1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. A high-resolution mass spectrometry approach identified ATXN2L as target for lysine acetylation, while ATXN2 was not detected <xref rid="pone.0050134-Choudhary1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Again, such a difference could be responsible for the observed effects on P-body formation as well.</p>
      <p>Further studies are necessary to dissect and define the function of ATXN2L in the cellular mRNA metabolism. Moreover, it will be interesting to further explore the functional interplay between ATXN2L and ATNX2. As mentioned before, functional studies of ATXN1L/Boat, the paralog of the disease-causing protein ATXN1, revealed a suppressive activity in SCA1 disease pathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0050134-Bowman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Utilizing a SCA1 <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, Mizutani and colleagues showed that an eye defect, caused by mutant ATXN1, was suppressed by ATXN1L overexpression due to the association of both proteins <xref rid="pone.0050134-Mizutani1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Moreover, evidence was provided that the activity of mutant ATXN1 causative for the observed neurotoxic events in a SCA1 knock-in mouse model can be ameliorated by duplication of <italic>ATXN1L</italic> modifying incorporation of mutant ATXN1 into native protein complexes <xref rid="pone.0050134-Bowman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Consequently, it will be interesting to explore whether gene dosage compensation or antagonistic behavior between ATXN2L and ATXN2 might occur in SCA2 transgenic animal models and whether and how this impacts SCA2 pathogenesis.</p>
