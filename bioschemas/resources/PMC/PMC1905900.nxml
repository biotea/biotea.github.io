      <abstract>
        <p>Chromosomal DNA replication is strictly regulated through a sequence of steps that involve many macromolecular protein complexes. One of these is the GINS complex, which is required for initiation and elongation phases in eukaryotic DNA replication. The GINS complex consists of four paralogous subunits. At the G1/S transition, GINS is recruited to the origins of replication where it assembles with cell-division cycle protein (Cdc)45 and the minichromosome maintenance mutant (MCM)2â7 to form the Cdc45/Mcm2â7/GINS (CMG) complex, the presumed replicative helicase. We isolated the human GINS complex and have shown that it can bind to DNA. By using single-particle electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction, we obtained a medium-resolution volume of the human GINS complex, which shows a horseshoe shape. Analysis of the protein interactions using mass spectrometry and monoclonal antibody mapping shows the subunit organization within the GINS complex. The structure and DNA-binding data suggest how GINS could interact with DNA and also its possible role in the CMG helicase complex.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In the last few years, there have been significant findings that have helped to understand the molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic DNA replication; however, the identity of the complex that unwinds DNA has remained elusive. Several lines of evidence provide support for the idea that the minichromosome maintenance mutant (MCM)2â7 hexamer constitutes part of the replicative helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Labib <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Pacek <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the purified MCM2â7 complex does not show helicase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas a subcomplex of Mcm4, Mcm6 and Mcm7 presents modest activity with low processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Ishimi, 1997</xref>). Therefore, it seems that other factors have important roles in the initiation and elongation processes of DNA replication, working as replicative helicase cofactors.</p>
      <p>Cell-division cycle protein (Cdc)45 is one of these crucial factors that participates in both initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Zou <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aparicio <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Cdc45 interacts with several DNA replication proteins, including origin recognition complex subunit 2 (Orc2), MCM2â7, Replication Protein A (RPA), DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Saha <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Zou &amp; Stillman, 2000</xref>), synthetic lethality with dpb11-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Kamimura <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) and Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Christensen &amp; Tye, 2003</xref>). In addition, antibodies against Cdc45 disrupt DNA unwinding in a replication assay carried out in cell-free extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Pacek &amp; Walter, 2004</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that phosphorylation of Mcm4 by the S-phase promoting kinase Cdc7-Dbf4 (Dumb bell former 4) facilitates the formation of a stable Cdc45âMCM complex at the origins of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Sheu &amp; Stillman, 2006</xref>). The interaction between MCM2â7 and Cdc45 is maintained at the DNA replication forks by means of the four-subunit GINS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Gambus <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Moyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>GINS was first described in yeast as a result of genetic analyses aimed at the discovery of proteins that interact with DNA polymerase B possible subunit 11 (Dpb11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Takayama <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). The complex is comprised of four conserved proteinsâSld5, Psf1 (Partner of Sld5), Psf2 and Psf3âeach distantly related to each other and with no known folding motifs. Three of them were discovered independently by a functional proteomics approach on the basis of induced proteolysis <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Kanemaki <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). The GINS complex is essential for initiation of DNA replication and the normal progression of the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Kanemaki <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kubota <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Takayama <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Previous electron microscopy images of rotary-shadowed <italic>Xenopus</italic> GINS complex suggested ring-like or C-shaped structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kubota <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>In budding yeast, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have shown that GINS is recruited at the paused replication fork together with Mediator of replication checkpoint 1 (Mrc1), Topoisomerase interacting factor 1 (Tof1), polymerases Î± and É, Cdc45 and the MCM2â7 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Calzada <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). GINS, Cdc45 and the MCM2â7 could form the core of a large complex known as the âreplisome progression complex' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Gambus <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). So far, the physiological role and the biochemical features of the GINS complex are poorly understood. A suggestion comes from the recent purification of a stable high-molecular-weight complex formed by Cdc45/MCM2â7/GINS (CMG) from <italic>Drosophila</italic> that shows helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Moyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Conversely, the <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction of the human GINS complex with DNA polymerase Î±-primase seems to stimulate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">De Falco <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we have characterized the three-dimensional structure and DNA binding of a recombinant human GINS complex. By using single-particle electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction, we have obtained a medium-resolution volume of the human GINS complex showing its horseshoe shape. The arrangement of the subunits in the structure was shown using a combination of mass spectrometry of the intact complex and subcomplexes generated in solution or gas phases, and monoclonal antibody mapping using electron microscopy. The DNA-binding preferences of GINS have been also studied. The three-dimensional structure, in conjunction with DNA-binding experiments, suggests the possible role of GINS in the CMG helicase complex.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Human GINS is a heterotetramer and binds to DNA</title>
        <p>The open reading frames of the Sld5, Psf1, Psf2 and Psf3 proteins were cloned in a T7 promoter polycistronic vector. The recombinant protein complex was isolated in three steps by using affinity, anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography (see the Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information</xref> online). SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified recombinant human GINS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1A</xref>) showed four bands identified as its subunits by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Analytical ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information Fig 1</xref> online) and nano-flow mass spectrometry of the intact complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1B</xref>) showed that human GINS is a heterotetramer with 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry. The molecular mass of the intact complex, measured by mass spectrometry, showed a mass of 98,373Â±12.7 Da, which is in close agreement with the theoretical value (98,122.0 Da) of the complex, with a Tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site and a His-tag.</p>
        <p>To address the binding of the purified human GINS complex to DNA, different DNA probes resembling several replicative structures were analysed by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1C,D</xref>). Human GINS showed a clear preference for the probes consisting exclusively of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or containing stretches of ssDNA (âssDNA', â3â² end', â5â² end' and âbubble') than for a probe consisting of only double-stranded DNA (dsDNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1C,D</xref>). Remarkably, a supershift was observed with the âbubble' probe. This could be caused by the loading of more than one human GINS complex on each ssDNA region. These results represent the first experimental evidence that human GINS can associate directly with DNA and indicate its role within the CMG helicase (see below).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Three-dimensional reconstruction of the GINS complex</title>
        <p>The human GINS complex was applied to carbon-coated grids and negatively stained with uranyl acetate. Despite the low molecular mass of human GINS complex for electron microscopy analysis, a clean distribution of single particles was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2A,B</xref>; for details, see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information</xref> online). The refined volume of the human GINS complex at 33 Ã resolution shows a horseshoe shape. The approximate molecule dimensions are 130 Ã 60 Ã 80 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2DâF</xref>). The complex shows a central hole of 30â35 Ã in diameter, which is large enough to accommodate either dsDNA or ssDNA. The upper part of the three-dimensional volume is wide open, whereas the opposite side of the central hole is narrower. Hence, the central hole is arranged in a manner similar to a funnel with an upper diameter of approximately 70 Ã and a bottom diameter of approximately 25 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary movie</xref> online), indicating the possibility of different functions for each side of the complex. Although the human GINS three-dimensional structure forms an open ring, the shape of the volume resembles the structure of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)âan essential processivity factor for DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig 3</xref> online). The different human GINS subunits could not be identified in the electron microscopy three-dimensional structure owing to the limited resolution, therefore a combined approach of mass spectrometry and monoclonal Fab labelling was used to show the subunit organization.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Architecture of the GINS complex</title>
        <p>Mass spectrometry of the intact human GINS complex showed the heterotetrameric oligomerization state of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the Psf2 subunit readily dissociated on activation and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), indicating that Psf2 has fewer intersubunit contacts and is likely to locate at one end of the horseshoe-shaped structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1B</xref>, inset). Interactions between the subunits in the human GINS heterotetramer were determined by generating subcomplexes using in-solution perturbation and gas-phase dissociation of the resulting complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Hernandez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). After the addition of 42% methanol, two additional charge state series were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig 3A,B</xref>). The measured masses (47,758 and 70,895 Da) indicate that the two series correspond to the Psf2âSld5 heterodimer and a Psf2âSld5âPsf1 heterotrimer, respectively. As Psf2 is located at one end and it interacts with Sld5, the Psf1 subunit should be located on the opposite site of the Psf1/Sld5/Psf2 heterotrimer. Thus, a model of the subunit organization in the complex comprises a central core formed by Sld5 and Psf1, and Psf2 and Psf3 are located at the tips of the horseshoe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig 3C</xref>). This arrangement is in agreement with the network of interactions of the GINS subunits proposed in yeast using genetic and two-hybrid methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Takayama <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>On the basis of the interactions observed by mass spectrometry and the restrictions imposed by the subunit organization inside the three-dimensional structure, our model of the human GINS architecture could be confirmed by localizing Psf2 within the complex. Thus, the human GINS complex was incubated with a monoclonal Fab fragment that recognizes Psf2, and the human GINSâFab complex was purified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig 4AâE</xref> online). To obtain the three-dimensional structure of the human GINSâFab, the purified complex was negatively stained and analysed by using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4A,B</xref>). A total of 2,000 images were selected and processed similarly to the volume representing the human GINS complex alone (without Fab). The resultant three-dimensional volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4C,D</xref>) resembles the human GINS structure and shows an additional mass on one tip of the horseshoe-shaped human GINS structure, which corresponds to the size and shape of a Fab molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4E,F</xref>). This result confirms the localization of Psf2 at one end of the structure and, combined with the mass spectrometry data, supports the proposed model of the organization of human GINS subunits within the complex.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Possible roles of the GINS complex in the replication fork</title>
        <p>A certain parallel could be drawn between the structures of human GINS and PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Krishna <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>). Indeed, it has been proposed recently that GINS binds to and enhances the activity of DNA polymerase Î±-primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">De Falco <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, we believe that the structural similarities are not sufficient to indicate that GINS, as PCNA, has the characteristics of a DNA processivity factor. First, the dimensions of PCNA (90 Ã 40 Ã 90 Ã) are smaller than the human GINS complex (see previous section), according to the number of components and their molecular weight. Second, the PCNA structure is a closed ring, whereas human GINS is an open ring. Third, although the internal diameter of the central hole has similar dimensions of around 30â35 Ã in both, the PCNA internal channel does not show an internal funnel-like shape similar to that observed in human GINS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2DâE</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig 3</xref> online). Furthermore, the EMSA assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1C,D</xref>) indicate that human GINS does not show preferential binding to dsDNA, which is the molecule bound by PCNA during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Johnson &amp; O'Donnell, 2005</xref>). Finally, PCNA possibly does not change its overall conformation on DNA binding. This might not be the case for human GINS and a conformational change induced by DNA binding could occur. The structure suggests that DNA binding might promote a more compact complex to embrace the nucleic acid.</p>
        <p>An attractive idea is that the biochemical function of GINS resides within the recently described CMG complex consisting of Cdc45, GINS and the MCM2â7 hexamer. All the components of the CMG are present at DNA unwinding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Calzada <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Gambus <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), and a purified CMG complex from <italic>Drosophila</italic> shows ATP-dependent helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Moyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The association of the MCM2â7 hexamer with these two cofactors seems to stimulate DNA unwinding and strand displacement activities, which have been predicted and experimentally sought for the MCM2â7 hexamer for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aparicio <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The need for essential activators of the helicase activity represents a change in the model about the mode of action of eukaryotic replicative helicases and could help to explain the delay between the assembly of the MCM2â7 complexes on the chromatin during late telophase/early G1 and the initiation of DNA replication several hours later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Mendez &amp; Stillman, 2000</xref>).</p>
        <p>Previous models on the eukaryotic replicative helicase function, based on steric exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Lee &amp; Hurwitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kaplan <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) or rotary pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Laskey &amp; Madine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Mendez &amp; Stillman, 2003</xref>), were focused on the MCM2â7 complex as the unique assembly responsible for the unwinding and strand displacement activities.</p>
        <p>On the basis of the described association of GINS with the MCM2â7 complex and Cdc45 to form a molecular machine that unwinds DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Moyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), and on our observation that purified human GINS shows preferential binding for DNA structures containing ssDNA, it is tempting to speculate about the possible role of GINS after its association with the other components of the CMG complex. We foresee two main possibilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5</xref>). In both cases, the MCM2â7 complex would work as an engine to unwind the dsDNA coupled to ATP hydrolysis and GINS as a crucial structural element required for the successful separation of the two DNA strands. In the first model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5A</xref>), MCM2â7 pumps dsDNA through its inner channel by helical rotation, destabilizing the double helix. Hence, the GINS complex would function as a strand displacement blade, or âploughshare' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), located where unwound DNA exits from the MCM hexamer, preventing re-annealing and providing room for the activity of the polymerases. In the second model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5B</xref>), GINS would be located in front of the MCM2â7 complex and would have a more active role in DNA unwinding. The main difference is that, in this case, only one strand of DNA goes through the MCM2â7 inner channel. This model would share more structural features with the recently proposed mode of action of the MCM4â6â7 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kaplan <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and the viral E1 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Enemark &amp; Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>). The two hypothetical models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5</xref> represent two alternatives of cooperation between a motor engine formed by MCM2â7 and a âstrand displacement unit' provided by GINS, but other variations could also be envisioned. So far, no structural information on Cdc45 is available and its position between GINS and MCM2â7 is speculative. However, it is worth noting that an immunoprecipitation with anti-Cdc45 was the original method to isolate the CMG complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Moyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our study is a first step to unravel the architecture of human GINS, and further structural work regarding the association of GINS with DNA and other components of the CMG will be crucial to understand fully the molecular mechanisms involved in DNA unwinding during eukaryotic DNA replication.</p>

      <p><bold>Human GINS expression and purification.</bold> The complementary DNAs of the human GINS subunits were cloned in a polycistronic vector and expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). Transformed cells were grown in lactose broth medium supplemented with ampicillin (at 100 Î¼g/ml) and chloramphenicol (at 34 Î¼g/ml). The cells were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-Î²-<sc>D</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 16Â°C. The recombinant human GINS complex was isolated using nickel affinity, anion exchange and gel filtration chromatographic steps. Fractions containing human GINS after the gel filtration were pooled, concentrated and stored at â80Â°C in small aliquots.</p>
      <p><bold>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays.</bold> Different DNA structures were obtained by hybridization of the <sup>32</sup>P-labelled 60-mer oligonucleotide. ProteinâDNA binding reactions were carried out by incubating recombinant GINS complex (1â10 pmol) with 150 fmol of each probe in buffer B (50 mM TrisâHCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and 1 mM dithiothreitol) at 25Â°C for 30 min; protein was always added last. After incubation, the mixtures were resolved by in 5% polyacrylamideâTBE non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and exposed to autoradiography.</p>
      <p><bold>Electron microscopy.</bold> For negative staining, a few microlitres of purified human GINS complex and its anti-Psf2-Fab bound complex were diluted to an appoximate concentration of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/ml, respectively. Samples were applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated copperârhodium grids, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate (w/v) and observed in a JEOL 1230 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The human GINS complex images were recorded under a low-dose condition at a nominal magnification of Ã 60,000, and images of a human GINSâFab complex were taken at Ã 25,000. Good micrographs were digitized in a Dimage Scan Multi Pro scanner (Minolta, Osaka, Japan) at 2,400 d.p.i. and averaged to a final 3.56 Ã/pixel at the specimen for human GINS complex and 4.2 Ã/pixel at the specimen for human GINSâFab complex.</p>
      <p><bold>Mass spectrometry.</bold> Mass spectra collected for the intact protein complexes were recorded on a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (MDS Sciex, Concord, Canada) modified for high-mass detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Sobott <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The human GINS complex (1 Î¼g/Î¼l) was exchanged into 300 mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.5) by using microbiospin-6 columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), and 2 Î¼l aliquots were introduced by gold-coated nanoflow capillaries prepared in-house. The conditions within the mass spectrometer were adjusted to preserve noncovalent interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Hernandez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The mass spectrometer was operated at a capillary voltage of 1,200 V and a declustering potential of 40 V. An MS/MS spectrum of the intact human GINS complex was obtained by MS/MS of an isolation at 4,685 <italic>m/z</italic> with collision energy of 100 V. The intact human GINS complex was disrupted through the stepwise addition of methanol up to 42% (v/v) and MS/MS of the resulting subcomplex was carried out at collision energy of 80 V.</p>
      <p><bold>Accession code.</bold> The structure of this complex has been deposited at the European Bioinformatics Institute, with the unique accession code EMD-1355.</p>
      <p><bold>Supplementary information</bold> is available at <italic>EMBO reports</italic> online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emboreports.org">http://www.emboreports.org</ext-link>).</p>
      <p><bold>Note added in the proof.</bold> Following the submission of this paper, the crystallographic structure of a truncated mutant of the human GINS complex has been published (Kamada K <italic>et al</italic> (2007) <italic>Nat Struct Mol Biol</italic> <bold>14</bold>: 388â396). It is interesting to note that although the intersubunit interactions are similar in both studies, the overall conformation described by Kamada <italic>et al</italic> is different from our structure.</p>

        <p>The human GINS complex is a heterotetramer that binds to DNA. (<bold>A</bold>) SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified recombinant human GINS (hGINS) complex shows four bands and their identity as human GINS subunits was confirmed by using mass spectrometry. (<bold>B</bold>) Nanoelectrospray mass spectrometric analysis of the intact human GINS complex shows a well-resolved charge state series (labelled 23+ to 18+), which is consistent with the presence of the four subunits in stoichiometric amounts. Inset: gas-phase acceleration of the isolation at approximately 4.700 <italic>m/z</italic> (21+ charge state) and tandem mass spectrometry clearly showed the dissociation of the subunit Psf2 from the intact complex.

Increasing amounts of the human GINS complex were used, whereas the probe concentration was constant. EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays.</p>

Spectrum from (<bold>A</bold>) mass spectrometry and (<bold>B</bold>) tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the human GINS complex after disruption of the complex using 42% methanol. Two charge state series were observed in the <italic>m/z</italic> region 2,800â4,250 (<bold>A</bold>, inset). The measured masses (47,758 Da, light green squares; 70,895 Da, magenta stars) indicate that the two series correspond to the Psf2 and Sld5 dimer, and the heterotrimer composed of Psf1, Psf2 and Sld5.
