      <abstract>
        <p>Although TrkA postendocytic sorting significantly influences neuronal cell survival and differentiation, the molecular mechanism underlying TrkA receptor sorting in the recycling or degradation pathways remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that Golgi-localized, Î³ adaptin-earâcontaining ADP ribosylation factor-binding protein 3 (GGA3) interacts directly with the TrkA cytoplasmic tail through an internal DXXLL motif and mediates the functional recycling of TrkA to the plasma membrane. We find that GGA3 depletion by siRNA delays TrkA recycling, accelerates TrkA degradation, attenuates sustained NGF-induced Akt activation, and reduces cell survival. We also show that GGA3âs effect on TrkA recycling is dependent on the activation of Arf6. This work identifies GGA3 as a key player in a novel DXXLL-mediated endosomal sorting machinery that targets TrkA to the plasma membrane, where it prolongs the activation of Akt signaling and survival responses.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays critical roles in the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system. NGF promotes neuronal survival and differentiation via binding to TrkA, which initiates receptor phosphorylation and activates downstream signal transduction cascades, including the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and phospholipase CÎ³/protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Klesse <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Pierchala <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zweifel <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005</xref>). NGF also induces the ubiquitination and subsequent internalization of TrkA into endocytic vesicles (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Geetha and Wooten, 2008</xref>). Once internalized into early endosomes, TrkA may either be recycled back to the plasma membrane (PM), leading to functional resensitization and prolongation of cell surfaceâspecific signaling events, or sorted to the lysosomes for degradation, producing a prolonged attenuation of cellular signaling (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Different biological responses to NGF are controlled by signaling from different intracellular locations. Neuronal differentiation is promoted by active TrkA localized to endosomes, whereas survival is accomplished by TrkA signaling at the cell surface (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Thus the process that directs the sorting of TrkA to diverse pathways has a significant effect on TrkA-mediated biological functions, and its alteration may lead to human diseases.</p><p>Endocytic trafficking of TrkA to degradative or recycling pathways is a complex and highly regulated process. A role for ubiquitin chains, proteasomes, and small GTPase Rab7 activity is critical in regulating TrkA delivery to lysosomes (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Saxena <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005a</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Geetha and Wooten, 2008</xref>). In contrast, TrkA recycling to the cell surface requires a specific sequence located in the juxtamembrane region and the activity of the small GTPase Rab11 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2013</xref>). However, in contrast to other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the molecular mechanisms of TrkA endosomal sorting remain largely uncharacterized.</p><p>The Golgi-localized, Î³ adaptin-earâcontaining ADP ribosylation factorâbinding proteins (GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3) are a family of monomeric adaptors associated with the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes that function in the intracellular trafficking of receptors (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino, 2004</xref>). GGA proteins consist of four segments: a VHS domain that binds the acidic dileucine sorting signals (DXXLL, X = any amino acid) present in the cytoplasmic tail of various transmembrane proteins, such as mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR); a GAT domain, which interacts with the GTP-bound form of Arfs and ubiquitin; an unstructured hinge region, which binds clathrin; and a GAE domain, which interacts with a number of accessory factors (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino, 2004</xref>). The GGAs are recruited from the cytosol to membranes by Arf GTPase to promote the polymerization of clathrin for the sorting of cargo proteins (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino, 2004</xref>). GGAs are mainly localized at the TGN and are involved in the sorting and transport of receptors from the TGN to the endosome (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2001a</xref>). However, an additional pool of GGAs has also been localized on endosomes and is involved in endocytic sorting to the lysosome or PM. Indeed, GGA3 has been shown to be crucial for the sorting of EGFR and Î²-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) to lysosomes through interactions with ubiquitin (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano and Bonifacino, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>) and for the recycling of the Met receptor to the PM through an interaction with the adaptor protein Crk (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Parachoniak <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of GGAs in TrkA trafficking and signaling. We determined that GGA3 interacts directly with the TrkA cytoplasmic tail through an internal DXXLL motif and mediates TrkA functional recycling to the PM, sustained NGF-induced Akt activation, and cell survival. NGF/TrkA stimulation upregulates Arf6 activity via Src activation, which recruits GGA3 on endosomes to mediate TrkA recycling. These results identify a novel key role for GGA3 in TrkA recycling and signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>GGA3 interacts and colocalizes with TrkA on endosomes</title><p>GGAs are found on endosomes and participate in the endocytic sorting of various tyrosine kinase receptors. To investigate the relevance of GGAs to TrkA trafficking, we first examined whether GGAs interact with TrkA using coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) assays of HEK293 cells expressing TrkA together with Myc-GGA1, Myc-GGA2, or Myc-GGA3. Among the three GGA proteins, GGA3 showed the strongest interaction with TrkA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The binding capacity of TrkA with endogenous GGA3 was then confirmed by coIP experiments using the PC12 (615) cells stably expressing TrkA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hempstead <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 1992</xref>). Using confocal microscopy, we next examined whether GGA3 and TrkA colocalized on endosomes. Serum-starved PC12 (615) cells were incubated at 4Â°C with anti-TrkA antibody (5C3) and then shifted to 37Â°C for different periods of time (0â45 min) to initiate endocytosis. 5C3 binds specifically to the ectodomain of TrkA and mimics NGF, inducing TrkA internalization and signaling (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">LeSauteur <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 1996</xref>). Little colocalization was observed between GGA3 and TrkA in unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, in cells shifted to 37Â°C, colocalization in punctate patterns typical of early endosomes was observed between internalized TrkA and GGA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Maximal colocalization was induced by 15 min of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), further suggesting that the codistribution of internalized TrkA with GGA3 occurs in early endosomes. Indeed, TrkA is present in EEA1- and transferrin-positive endosomes after 15 min of internalization (Supplemental Figure S1). Furthermore, a 1.9-fold increase in localization of GGA3 to early endosome was observed after 15 min of NGF stimulation (Supplemental Figure S2). To identify more precisely the sorting compartment in which TrkA and GGA3 colocalize, we compared their distribution with that of early endosome marker Rab5. After 15 min of internalization, cell surfaceâlabeled TrkA (5C3) partially localized with GGA3 to rab5-labeled endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), consistent with the recruitment of GGA3 to TrkA internalized in sorting endosomes. Taken together, these results support a possible role for GGA3 as an endocytic adaptor for TrkA.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>GGA3 interacts and colocalizes with TrkA on endosomes.

We first compared the kinetics of TrkA degradation in PC12 (615) cells transfected with control or GGA3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) using the biotinylation assay schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>. After cell-surface biotinylation, cells were treated with NGF for 0, 1, 2, or 4 h, lysed, pulled down with streptavidin beads, and immunoblotted for TrkA, allowing the assessment of proteolysis of endocytosed biotin-labeled TrkA receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, A and B</xref>). A stronger reduction of the amount of biotin-labeled TrkA was detected in GGA3-depleted cells compared with control cells after 2 and 4 h of NGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Quantitative analysis indicated that the turnover of biotinylated TrkA increased by 33% in GGA3-depleted cells (<italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub> â 93 min vs. <italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub> â 138 min in control cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results support the enhanced entry of TrkA into the degradative pathway in the absence of GGA3. This increase in TrkA degradation rate is not due to a lower initial amount of cell-surface TrkA, because quantitative analysis indicated that cell-surface TrkA levels under unstimulated conditions (NGF 0) were not significantly different in GGA3-depleted versus control cells (Supplemental Figure S3), suggesting that GGA3 depletion did not alter TrkA biosynthesis or constitutive trafficking of newly synthesized TrkA to the cell surface. In concordance, confocal microscopy analysis of cycloheximide chase experiments did not indicate any difference in TrkA intracellular distribution in control and GGA3-depleted cells (unpublished data), arguing against a role for GGA3 in TrkA transport from the TGN to the PM.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>GGA3 knockdown alters TrkA degradation but not its internalization.

Using a cleavable biotinylation assay, we first compared the internalization rate of TrkA in control and GGA3-depleted PC12 (615) cells. As outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, cells were surface labeled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin at 4Â°C, and internalization was initiated by incubating cells with NGF for 7 and 15 min at 37Â°C. The cells were next treated with glutathione, which cleaves biotin from proteins at the PM, allowing selective isolation of internalized biotinylated receptors that remained protected from cleavage. No obvious changes in the TrkA internalization ratio were observed in GGA3-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, E and F</xref>), suggesting that GGA3 does not regulate the internalization rate of TrkA in response to NGF.</p><p>To assess whether GGA3 participated in the postendocytic recycling of TrkA, we performed a cleavable biotinylation assay (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) in which the biotin-labeled cell surface receptors were internalized after 7 min of NGF treatment, followed by stripping with glutathione. The cells were then returned to 37Â°C for 7 or 45 min to allow for recycling, and any reappearing cell surfaceâbiotinylated receptors were stripped again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The TrkA signal lost in the second stripping procedure was considered the fraction of receptors that had been recycled. In GGA3-depleted cells, only 31% of TrkA had returned to the PM by 45 min, whereas in control cells, &gt;60% had returned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, B and C</xref>). However, GGA3 knockdown did not significantly alter the TrkA recycling ratio at 7 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), a time point representing rapid recycling (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Goh and Sorkin, 2013</xref>). Thus these biotinylation data indicate that GGA3 knockdown leads to slower recycling of TrkA, suggesting that in the absence of GGA3, TrkA traverses the endosomal sorting pathway to lysosomes.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3:</label><caption><p>GGA3 is required for TrkA recycling.

We thus investigated whether these three Arf proteins participate in TrkA recycling, using specific siRNA depletion of Arf1, Arf3, and Arf6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Arf6 depletion decreased TrkA recycling by 29%. In contrast, Arf1 and Arf3 depletion did not significantly alter TrkA recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). The specific involvement of Arf6 activity in postendocytic TrkA recycling was confirmed using synthetic N-terminal Arf peptides that have been reported to block Arf activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). The myristoylated peptides MyrArf1 and MyrArf6 are cell permeant and have been shown to inhibit the activation of Arf1 and Arf6, respectively (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kahn <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Caumont <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Choi <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>).

The concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of the MyrArf6 peptide on Arf6 activation (Arf6-GTP) was confirmed (Supplemental Figure S5). In summary, MyrArf6 not only confirmed the role of Arf6 in TrkA recycling, as shown using Arf6 siRNA, but also revealed the importance of Arf6 activation in TrkA recycling. Furthermore, supporting a role for Arf6 in TrkA recycling, cell surfaceâlabeled TrkA did not colocalize with Arf1 or Arf3 (Supplemental Figure S6) but colocalized with both Arf6 and GGA3 after 15 min of internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>Arf6 activity can be regulated after the stimulation of cell surface receptors (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Palacios and DâSouza-Schorey, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2012</xref>).

Therefore, the alteration of TrkA recycling by GGA3 knockdown may affect its downstream signaling. We thus examined its effect on the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt in response to NGF as readouts for MAPK and PI3K pathway activation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). GGA3 depletion attenuated the NGF signaling of both Akt and Erk1/2, with a stronger effect on Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). Quantification indicated a 22% reduction of Erk1/2 activation and a 61% reduction of Akt activation in GGA3-knockdown cells compared with control cells after 60 min of stimulation with NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). These results suggest that GGA3 depletion may affect the sustained activation of TrkA-mediated signaling, which was confirmed by testing the levels of phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2 using an established paradigm of prolonged 24-h stimulation with NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). In GGA3-knockdown cells, the level of phosphorylated Akt after 24 h of NGF stimulation was fourfold lower than that in control cells, whereas no significant difference in the level of phosphorylated Erk was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>), indicating that GGA3 is involved in sustained Akt signaling downstream of TrkA. Because sustained Akt signaling is a prerequisite for NGF-induced cell survival, we next examined the effect of GGA3 depletion on the survival of PC12 (615) cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were used to assess the proportions of apoptotic cells in nontransfected cells and cells treated with control siRNA or GGA3 siRNA after 24 h of incubation in the absence or presence of NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref> and Supplemental Figure S7). Although NGF treatment reduced the level of apoptosis in control cells by 60%, it did not prevent apoptosis of GGA3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref>). These data indicate that GGA3 activity is involved in NGF-dependent survival. Furthermore, the cell-surface TrkA levels were lower in GGA3-depleted cells then in control cells after 24 h of NGF stimulation (Supplemental Figure S8), which is consistent with previous findings showing that TrkA receptors that are localized at the cell surface after prolonged neurotrophin treatment elicit survival signaling (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005</xref>).

Our work demonstrates a key role for GGA3 in TrkA receptor recycling and signaling that promotes cell survival. We found that GGA3 depletion delays TrkA recycling and accelerates TrkA degradation. We also showed that GGA3 interacts directly with an internal DXXLL motif in the cytoplasmic tail of TrkA and colocalizes with TrkA and Arf6 in sorting endosomes. Furthermore, we observed that Arf6 is required for GGA3-mediated TrkA recycling and that Arf6 is activated by Src, a downstream effector of NGF-activated TrkA. On the basis of these findings, we propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>) for the function of GGA3 in TrkA endosomal recycling. After NGF stimulation, TrkA is internalized in early endosomes. In parallel, Arf6 is activated by TrkA through the Src kinase and recruits GGA3 to the endosomal membrane, where GGA3 directly binds to the DXXLL motif in TrkA. This interaction promotes the sorting of TrkA into the recycling pathway while decreasing its entry into the degradative pathway. The GGA3-dependent delivery of TrkA to the PM would then promote the cellular response to NGF, leading to sustained Akt activation and increased neuronal survival.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9:</label><caption><p>Model for the GGA3-mediated recycling of TrkA.

This interaction promotes the sorting of TrkA to the recycling pathway, leading to sustained activation of Akt and cell survival.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="4412fig9"/></fig><p>GGA3 was first described as an adaptor protein that was localized at the TGN and involved in the sorting and transport of receptors, such as MPR, from the TGN to endosomes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">DellâAngelica <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2000</xref>). However, consistent with our results, accumulating evidence indicates an additional pool of GGAs that is localized to endosomes and involved in endocytic sorting of receptors either to the lysosome or the PM. GGA3 has been shown to be present on early endosomes and involved in EGFR degradation (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano and Bonifacino, 2004</xref>). GGA3 has also been localized to Rab4-enriched endosomes, where it promotes the fast recycling of the Met receptor (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Parachoniak <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>). We observed a significant overlap of GGA3 with EEA1- or transferrin-labeled endosomes, consistent with its assignment as a recycling adaptor for TrkA. In contrast with Met GGA3âdependent recycling, our quantification data indicated that GGA3 is involved in the slow-recycling pathway of TrkA, which supports the fact that Trk receptors traffic through the slow Rab11-dependent endosomal recycling pathways in PC12 cells and neurons (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The participation of GGA3 in both slow and rapid recycling of receptors may be due to the different methods by which GGA3 interacts with these receptors (direct/indirect interactions) or the involvement of other factors.</p><p>GGA3 controls postendocytic trafficking of transmembrane proteins through multiple mechanisms. GGA3 was found to interact with ubiquitin and be involved in the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated receptors, such as EGFR and BACE1, to lysosomes (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano and Bonifacino, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>). It was also involved in the endosomal sorting of Met to the recycling pathway through an interaction with Crk (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Parachoniak <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Here we demonstrate that the direct interaction of GGA3 with a DXXLL motif in the cytoplasmic tail of TrkA controls the endosomal recycling of TrkA. Although the DXXLL GGA-binding motif is traditionally involved in anterograde transport from the TGN to the endosome, some studies reported its potential involvement in endosome-to-TGN retrograde transport (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wahle <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boucher <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2008</xref>). However, this work is the first evidence that DXXLL GGA-binding motifs may serve as recycling sorting signals. Of interest, the DXXLL motif found in TrkA is conserved among TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, all of which can interact, with different affinity, with GGA3 (Supplemental Figure S9). Given that Trk receptors are known to recycle at different levels (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005</xref>), the DXXLL GGA3-binding motif in their cytoplasmic domains may serve as a common recycling sorting signal, whereas other mechanisms, such as the previously identified TrkA juxtamembrane recycling motif (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005</xref>), may regulate their recycling efficiency. In summary, even if the association of GGA3 with TrkA differs from its association with Met, this interaction supports a novel, GGA3-dependent step in receptor endosomal sorting to the recycling pathway.</p><p>DXXLL-type GGA sorting motifs were originally identified as situated one or two residues from the carboxy termini of transmembrane cargo proteins (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino, 2004</xref>). However, subsequent studies revealed that internal DXXLL sorting motifs also occur within the N- or C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of cargo molecules. Indeed, functional DXXLL sorting motifs were found situated 24 and 87 residues from the C-termini of LRP9 and LRP12 transmembrane receptors, as well as in the hinge regions of GGA1 and GGA3, which serve to autoregulate GGA function (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boucher <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Doray <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2012</xref>). In this study, we identified two potential internal DXXLL motifs in the TrkA cytoplasmic tail, one situated 260 residues upstream of the extreme end of the cytoplasmic tail (DXXLL-540), and the other situated 190 residues upstream of the tail (DXXLL-610). However, substitution of LL with AA in these two DXXLL motifs indicated that only the DXXLL-540 motif was a functional site for GGA3 binding to TrkA. On analysis of the predicted 3D structure of TrkA cytoplasmic tail, both DXXLL motifs are exposed at the surface of the cytoplasmic domain of TrkA and could theoretically engage interaction with GGA3, but the aspartate of the DXXLL-610 motif seems slightly less accessible for interaction. Furthermore, the nature of the amino acids surrounding the internal DXXLL motif might also influence whether TrkA interacts with GGAs. Indeed, the importance of acidic residues immediately upstream of the DXXLL motif has been documented (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2001a</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kato <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Doray <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Of interest, an acidic residue (Asp-538; conserved in several species; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) is found two residues upstream of DXXLL-540, but no acidic residue is observed upstream of DXXLL-610. Hence, although DXXLL-610 is accessible for interaction in the TrkA-TK2 fragment, the absence of interaction of this motif when located in the complete TrkA cytoplasmic tail might be explained by its reduced accessibility or the lack of appropriate surrounding residues. Of interest, we also noted that the cytoplasmic tail of TrkA preferentially binds GGA3 rather than GGA1 or GGA2. Significant differences in the relative affinity of DXXLL motifs for different GGAs have also been previously reported (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2001a</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boucher <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2008</xref>). It has been suggested that residues immediately upstream and downstream from the DXXLL motif, as well as the XX residues of this motif, may significantly affect the specificity of the interaction of GGA proteins with these motifs (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2001a</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Doray <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). The level of autoinhibition of GGA1 and GGA3 in rat PC12 cells could also impair their binding to TrkA. Thus our findings not only identify a novel example of an internal DXXLL motif that specifically binds GGA3, they also reveal for the first time the presence of a functional DXXLL sorting motif in a RTK. Investigation of the importance of the residues surrounding the DXXLL-540 motif should provide new insights into the selectivity of specific interactions with GGA proteins and trafficking mechanisms associated with DXXLL-mediated sorting signals.</p><p>GGA3 can bind both ubiquitin and DXXLL motifs and can sort endosomal proteins into both degradation and recycling pathways. Given that TrkA is ubiquitinated after ligand binding, one can wonder how GGA3 preferentially uses the DXXLL motif to target TrkA to the recycling pathway. Phosphorylation has been shown to be a key factor in the regulation of GGA function toward different sorting pathways. For instance, phosphorylation of serine residues adjacent to or within the DXXLL signals of the MPRs and BACE1 increases the affinity of these signals for the VHS domain of the GGAs (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kato <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of GGAs themselves can regulate their function. GGA3 has been reported to be phosphorylated at S368 of the hinge region after EGFR stimulation, resulting in impaired interaction with ubiquitin without changes in its capacity to bind the DXXLL motif (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kametaka <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Because there is no serine near the DXXLL-540 motif, it would be appropriate to examine whether NGF stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of GGA3 and changes its binding capacity to ubiquitin or the DXXLL-540 motif. The latter is less plausible because NGF stimulation did not alter GGA3âTrkA interactions. At first glance, this observation seems inconsistent with our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). By using IP assays, we observed that TrkA signaling activity was dispensable for the interaction with GGA3. In fact, we showed that TrkA interacted directly with GGA3 via an internal DXXLL motif. This observation would explain why the activation and subsequent phosphorylation/ubiquitination of TrkA were not needed for GGA3 association. Indeed, the solubilization of the proteins for the IP assay would allow the interaction of GGA3 with the DXXLL motif present on unstimulated/stimulated TrkA. Nevertheless, in the IF assay, the colocalization between TrkA and GGA3 was mainly observed in the endosomal compartment, suggesting that the interaction between GGA3 and internalized TrkA mainly occurs in this compartment in intact cells. According to the current sorting model for GGA proteins (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano and Bonifacino, 2004</xref>), membrane-tethered Arf-GTP binds to the GAT domain of GGAs, which results in the recruitment of GGA to the membrane. The VHS domain of GGA binds DXXLL-type signals in the tails of receptors and other transmembrane cargo. However, the order of these steps has not been established. Of interest, we determined that the effect of GGA3 on TrkA sorting in the recycling pathway was dependent on Arf6. Arf6 is localized on endosomes and was previously associated with GGA3-dependent recycling of Met (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Parachoniak <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>). We showed that NGF/TrkA stimulation activates Arf6 through Src activity. In addition, Arf6 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kobayashi and Fukuda, 2013</xref>) and GGA3 are recruited to recycling endosomes in response to NGF stimulation in PC12 cells. Relatedly, Arf6 depletion (siRNA) and inactivation (Myr-Arf6), as well as the uncoupling of GGA3 from Arf (N194A), impaired TrkA recycling to the PM. On the basis of these data, we thus proposed a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>) in which the activation of Arf6 by TrkA recruits GGA3 to the endosomal membrane. Once on endosomes, GGA3 would directly bind to the DXXLL motif in TrkA and promote sorting into the recycling pathway. Alternatively, we cannot exclude that Arf6 could also aid in recruiting and sorting GGA3-TrkA complex formed earlier during TrkA transport to endosomes. Therefore these data support a model by which activation of Arf6 by RTKs such as Met or TrkA may aid in retaining and sorting GGA3-RTK complexes in endosomal-recycled membranes or serve to recruit other factors required for mediating RTK recycling.</p><p>Our study revealed that NGF/TrkA stimulation actives Arf6 through Src activity. The activation of Arf6 by Src was reported in other studies (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Palacios <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Heckel <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>). However, the mechanism by which Src leads to Arf6 activation is poorly understood. Previous studies showed that Src down-regulated Arf6 activity via the ARF GTPase-activating protein GIT2 in osteoclasts (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Heckel <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Various Arf-GAPs interact with and are phosphorylated by Src (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brown <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</xref>). Given that we observed that Src kinase inhibitor inhibited Arf6 activity after NGF stimulation, we suggest that Src could regulate the activity or localization of Arf6-GAP or even Arf6-GEF in PC12 cells. This potential mechanism needs to be assessed in future studies.</p><p>Postendocytic sorting of TrkA has significant effects on TrkA downstream signaling and on the physiological responses to NGF. Neuronal survival is maximally regulated by TrkA receptors localized at the PM via prolonged activation of the Akt signaling pathway, whereas neuronal differentiation is stimulated by sustained Erk activation by catalytically active TrkA in endosomes (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Our results show that GGA3 knockdown strongly attenuates the level of cell-surface TrkA, Akt sustained activation, and cell survival but has no significant effect on sustained Erk signaling. This supports a role for GGA3 in the endosomal sorting of TrkA to the recycling pathway, allowing TrkA delivery to the PM and prolonged Akt signaling, thereby leading to increased neuronal survival. Of interest, NGF and TrkA signaling have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimerâs disease (AD). A major neuroanatomical feature of AD is the selective degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), which express TrkA and whose normal function and survival require NGF trophic support. TrkA is reduced in BFCNs in AD, and failure of NGF-TrkA signaling has been considered the major cause of BFCN degeneration (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mufson <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Of interest, the level of expression of GGA3 has also been reported to be reduced in the brains of AD patients (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Tesco <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Based on our findings, a reduced level of GGA3 may impair TrkA recycling and signaling, leading to a deficient trophic response and contributing to the pathogenesis of AD.</p><p>In conclusion, the results presented here identify GGA3 as a key player in a novel DXXLL-mediated endosomal sorting machinery that targets TrkA back to the PM. Consequently an alteration in GGA3 expression or activity may affect the proper recycling and signaling of TrkA and thereby contribute to the impaired neuronal survival that leads to pathologies such as AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies, reagents, and plasmid constructions</title><p>Anti-Trk (c-14) polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) and Arf6 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-actin mAbs, tubulin mAbs, and anti-Flag M2 mAbs from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO); anti-EEA1 mAbs, GGA3 mAbs, Arf3 mAbs, and anti-Akt mAbs from BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ); antiâphospho-Akt (Ser-473) pAbs, antiâp44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) pAbs, antiâphospho-p44/42 MAPK (pErk1/2; Thr-202/Tyr-204) mAbs, and GGA3pAbs from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAbs from Covance (Emeryville, CA); anti-Myc pAbs from Upstate (Temecula, CA); and anti-Arf1 goat pAbs from Abcam (Toronto, Canada).

Briefly, serum-starved cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min with 0.3 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin at 4Â°C to biotinylate surface proteins. Unreacted biotin was quenched with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and then the cells were incubated at 37Â°C in DMEM containing 10 ng/ml NGF for 0â4 h to allow the biotinylated receptors to become internalized and degraded. Subsequently cells were washed and lysed with 50 mM TrisâHCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA (TNE) buffer. Biotinylated proteins were pulled down with streptavidin-conjugated Sepharose beads, washed, and subjected to SDSâPAGE and immunoblotted using TrkA antibodies. This assay detected surface-labeled TrkA receptors at different time points that had not been degraded, regardless of whether the proteins had been internalized or returned to the plasma membrane. These experiments were repeated at least three independent times.</p></sec><sec><title>Internalization assay</title><p>For TrkA internalization assays, serum-starved cells were incubated with the recycling inhibitor monensin (20 Î¼M) and the protease inhibitors leupeptin (100 Î¼g/ml), pepstatin A (100 Î¼M), E64 (20 Î¼g/ml), and MG132 (50 Î¼M) for 30 min at 37Â°C. Cell-surface proteins were then subjected to biotinylation with sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin (0.3 mg/ml), followed by free biotin quenching with TBS, as described for the degradation assay. Cells were then incubated at 37Â°C in DMEM with or without 10 ng/ml NGF for 7 or 15 min to induce internalization of biotinylated surface proteins. Afterward, the remaining cell-surface biotin was cleaved by glutathione treatment (50 mM glutathione, 75 mM NaCl, 75 mM NaOH, 0.01 g/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mM EDTA) for 15 min at 4Â°C to assess only the internalized proteins. One sample of cell incubated without NGF was not treated with stripping solution in order to assess the initial pool of surface- biotinylated TrkA. Cells were washed and lysed with TNE buffer. Biotinylated proteins were pulled down with streptavidin-conjugated Sepharose beads, washed, and subjected to SDSâPAGE and immunoblotted using TrkA antibodies.

These inhibitors were included in all subsequent steps to inhibit proteolysis. Cell-surface proteins were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin and quenched with TBS, as described for the degradation assay, followed by incubation with 10 ng/ml NGF for 7 min at 37Â°C to induce internalization of biotinylated cell-surface TrkA. Afterward, cells were cooled on ice, and the remaining cell-surface biotin was cleaved by glutathione treatment, as described for the internalization assay. Internalized biotinylated receptors were thus protected from this biotin stripping. Subsequently cells were reincubated at 37Â°C in DMEM for 7 or 45 min to allow recycling of internalized receptors, followed by a second round of stripping with glutathione to remove biotin from the surface-exposed biotinylated receptors that had recycled back to the cell surface during the previous rewarming period. The TrkA signal lost in the second stripping procedure was considered the fraction of recycled receptors. The biotinylated proteins were then collected with avidin and immunoblotted with TrkA antibodies. These experiments were repeated at least three independent times.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells were grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min or 0.1% saponin plus 5% FBS when cells were fed with Alexa Fluor 594âtransferrin and LysoTracker Red DND-99, blocked with 10% FBS for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h after Alexa Fluorâconjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature.
