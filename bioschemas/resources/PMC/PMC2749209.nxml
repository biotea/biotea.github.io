          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that is not totally eradicated by current therapies. The classification of breast tumors into distinct molecular subtypes by gene profiling and immunodetection of surrogate markers has proven useful for tumor prognosis and prediction of effective targeted treatments. The challenge now is to identify molecular biomarkers that may be of functional relevance for personalized therapy of breast tumors with poor outcome that do not respond to available treatments. The Mitochondrial Tumor Suppressor (<italic>MTUS1</italic>) gene is an interesting candidate whose expression is reduced in colon, pancreas, ovary and oral cancers. The present study investigates the expression and functional effects of <italic>MTUS1</italic> gene products in breast cancer.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>By means of gene array analysis, real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we show here that MTUS1/ATIP3 is significantly down-regulated in a series of 151 infiltrating breast cancer carcinomas as compared to normal breast tissue. Low levels of ATIP3 correlate with high grade of the tumor and the occurrence of distant metastasis. ATIP3 levels are also significantly reduced in triple negative (ER- PR- HER2-) breast carcinomas, a subgroup of highly proliferative tumors with poor outcome and no available targeted therapy. Functional studies indicate that silencing ATIP3 expression by siRNA increases breast cancer cell proliferation. Conversely, restoring endogenous levels of ATIP3 expression leads to reduced cancer cell proliferation, clonogenicity, anchorage-independent growth, and reduces the incidence and size of xenografts grown <italic>in vivo</italic>. We provide evidence that ATIP3 associates with the microtubule cytoskeleton and localizes at the centrosomes, mitotic spindle and intercellular bridge during cell division. Accordingly, live cell imaging indicates that ATIP3 expression alters the progression of cell division by promoting prolonged metaphase, thereby leading to a reduced number of cells ungergoing active mitosis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Our results identify for the first time ATIP3 as a novel microtubule-associated protein whose expression is significantly reduced in highly proliferative breast carcinomas of poor clinical outcome. ATIP3 re-expression limits tumor cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that this protein may represent a novel useful biomarker and an interesting candidate for future targeted therapies of aggressive breast cancer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Despite extensive progress in the field of breast cancer, this disease remains the leading cause of death by malignancy in women worldwide. The identification of novel molecular markers associated with poor clinical outcome of the disease is of considerable interest for tumor classification and treatment, and represents an issue of major public health importance.</p>
      <p>Over the past decade, traditional prognostic and predictive biomarkers including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have been routinely assessed by immunohistochemistry in newly diagnosed breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0007239-Dowsett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Tumors that are positive for ER or PR are generally treated by hormonal therapy whereas patients with HER2 positive tumors are candidates for targeted anti-HER2 therapies. Tumors exhibiting a triple negative phenotype (negative for ER, PR and HER2) currently have no targeted treatment available and remain of poor prognosis <xref rid="pone.0007239-Rakha1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The development of gene profiling studies has proven particularly powerful in classifying breast tumors into distinct molecular subgroups with different biological characteristics and clinical outcome <xref rid="pone.0007239-Sotiriou1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Three main âintrinsicâ sub-types of tumors (luminal, HER2-like and basal-like) have been distinguished that turned out to be similar to, although not just recapitulating, those defined by clinical practice <xref rid="pone.0007239-Perou1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0007239-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, the luminal group of tumors is characterized by ER/PR expression whereas HER2-like tumors are mainly ER negative and strongly HER2 positive. Basal-like carcinomas constitute a heterogeneous subtype of tumors with agressive clinical behavior, that predominantly lack the expression of surrogate markers ER, PR and HER2 <xref rid="pone.0007239-Rakha1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recent high-throughput, genome-wide studies have provided an integrative analysis of genomic copy number alterations and transcriptomic profiles of breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0007239-Chin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007239-Bergamaschi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, that may facilitate the identification of oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways specifically associated with each breast cancer molecular subtype <xref rid="pone.0007239-Adlade1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007239-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A considerable number of genetic elements of interest altered in breast cancer have thus been identified <xref rid="pone.0007239-Chin2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The challenge now is to functionally validate the products of these genes to determine whether they may be used clinically as novel prognostic or predictive biomarkers of breast tumors with poor outcome.</p>
      <p>The mitochondrial tumor suppressor (<italic>MTUS1</italic>) gene localizes at 8p22, a chromosomal region frequently deleted in epithelial cancers including in poor prognosis breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0007239-Hirano1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that <italic>MTUS1</italic> expression levels are reduced in cancers from pancreas <xref rid="pone.0007239-Seibold1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, ovary <xref rid="pone.0007239-Pils1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, colon <xref rid="pone.0007239-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and head-and-neck <xref rid="pone.0007239-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A deletion polymorphism spanning a <italic>MTUS1</italic> coding exon <xref rid="pone.0007239-Hinds1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> has been shown to significantly associate with decreased risk of familial breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0007239-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Our group has previously reported that the <italic>MTUS1</italic> gene contains 17 coding exons which can be alternatively spliced to generate three major transcripts designated ATIP1, ATIP3 and ATIP4 <xref rid="pone.0007239-Nouet1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007239-DiBenedetto1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. By real-time RT-PCR, we showed that ATIP1 and ATIP3 are widely distributed in normal human tissues, while expression of ATIP4 is restricted to the central nervous system. High evolutionary conservation of ATIP amino-acid sequences suggests a pivotal role for these proteins in cellular homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0007239-DiBenedetto1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, but to date only ATIP1 has been cloned and characterized. This isoform has been identified as an interacting partner of the angiotensin II AT2 receptor involved in trans-inactivation of the EGF receptor and subsequent inhibition of extracellular regulated ERK kinase activity and cell proliferation <xref rid="pone.0007239-Seibold1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007239-Nouet1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007239-Wruck1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, the expression and function of ATIP proteins in breast cancer have not yet been explored.</p>
      <p>The present study investigates the expression levels and biological effects of <italic>MTUS1</italic> gene products in infiltrating breast cancer. We show that ATIP3 is the major <italic>MTUS1</italic> splice variant whose expression is significantly reduced in invasive breast tumors of high histological grade and triple-negative phenotype. Molecular cloning and functional studies presented here reveal that ATIP3 is a novel mitotic spindle-associated protein that reduces breast cancer cell division <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>Breast tumor samples</title>
        <p>Infiltrating ductal primary breast carcinomas were obtained from patients included between in the prospective database initiated in 1981 by the Institut Curie Breast Cancer group. All patients gave original verbal consent on the use of tumor specimens for research purposes. Eleven normal breast specimens were obtained from breast mammoplasty surgery. Total RNA was extracted by the cesium chloride method and hybridized to DNA microarrays (Human Genome, Affymetrix HG-U133 set) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0007239-Reyal1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Microarray data reported here are in accordance with MIAME guidelines and have been partially published elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0007239-Reyal1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. All samples were reviewed and classified by the same breast pathologist (AVS). Histologic nuclear grades were scored (I to III) according to Elston and Ellis <xref rid="pone.0007239-Rakha2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression were determined by immunohistochemistry <xref rid="pone.0007239-VincentSalomon1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and were considered negative when less than 10% of the tumor cell nuclei showed staining. HER2 expression was evaluated by immunostaining as described previously <xref rid="pone.0007239-VincentSalomon1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and was considered positive when IHC staining was 3+ (uniform, intense membrane staining of more than 30% of invasive tumor cells), as recommended by Wolff et al. <xref rid="pone.0007239-Wolff1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This study was approved by the institutional review boards and ethics committee of the Institut Curie.</p>

MCF7 breast cancer cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium with 5% FCS. All cancer cell lines are available from <named-content content-type="gene">ATCC</named-content>. HeLa-H2B cells stably expressing the mCherry-histone were kindly provided by Dr. ValÃ©rie Doye (Institut Jacques Monod, Paris). The source, tumor type and histologic characteristics of breast cancer cell lines used in this study have been described in details elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0007239-Neve1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007239-Kenny1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The coding sequence of human ATIP3a (3812 bp) was obtained by ligating partial 3â² ATIP sequence isolated from human lung cDNA library <xref rid="pone.0007239-Nouet1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> with the 5â² region of IMAGE clone ID 3835953 (<named-content content-type="gene">ATCC</named-content>). Sequencing of the complete cDNA confirmed its identity with Genbank accession number NM_001001924. The full-length ATIP3 sequence was then PCR-amplified and subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) so that the initiating codon of ATIP3 is in frame with the carboxy-terminal end of the Green Fluorescent protein (GFP).</p>
        <p>Transfection of plasmid cDNA into HeLa, HeLa-H2B, MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells was performed for 24 h using Lipofectamine Reagent 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected at 50 nM for 72 h using Lipofectamine reagent 2000. Control siRNA duplex (non targeting pool #1), and specific MTUS1 siRNA#1 (on-target plus smart pool, NM020749) and siRNA#2 (on-target plus siRNA duplex, sens strand : <named-content content-type="gene">UGG CAG AGG UUU AAG GUU A</named-content>) were purchased from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL, USA).

        <p>Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 Âµm sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of the breast cancer samples. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed in EDTA buffer pH 9 in water bath for 30 min. Immunostaining was performed on a Dako autostainer using a peroxidase-labeled polymer-based detection system (Envision plus, Dako) and diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Monoclonal anti-MTUS1 antibodies (Abnova) were diluted 1â¶40 and incubated overnight at 4Â°C. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. MCF7 cells transfected with GFP-ATIP3 were used as a positive control and non-transfected MCF7 cells were considered as negative control. MTUS1 immunoreactivity in tissue sections was scored based on the percentage of positive cells and the intensity (1 to 3) of the staining. Tumors were considered MTUS1-positive when more than 60% of the cells showed intense (2â3) staining, and were considered MTUS1-negative when less than 30% of the cells showed weak (0â1) immunostaining.</p>
        <p>For analysis of xenografts, 3 Âµm sections were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, then counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined under an inverted microscope.</p>

<italic>MTUS1</italic> gene expression is reduced in invasive breast cancer samples</title>
        <p>The expression of <italic>MTUS1</italic> transcripts was analyzed in a series of 151 infiltrating ductal breast carcinomas and eleven normal breast tissues. The intensities of each of three specific <italic>MTUS1</italic> probesets (212096_s_at; 212093_s_at; 239576_at) were obtained from our previous U133A Affymetrix DNA array study <xref rid="pone.0007239-Reyal1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and compared to histologic characteristics of the tumors and clinical data for the patients (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007239.s004">Table S2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007239-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007239-t001">Table 1</xref>, <italic>MTUS1</italic> expression levels were significantly reduced in breast cancer samples as compared to normal tissue. <italic>MTUS1</italic> levels were significantly lower in high grade tumors (grade III) as compared to grades I (p&lt;0.0001) and II (pâ=â0.0032), but did not differ significantly between tumors of grades I and II (pâ=â0.06). Similar results were obtained with all three <italic>MTUS1</italic> probesets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007239-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007239.s001">Fig.S1</xref>).

        <p>Immunohistochemical analyses were undertaken to examine the cellular distribution and expression of MTUS1 at the protein level <italic>in situ</italic>. Immunohistochemistry performed on normal breast tissue sections using monoclonal anti-MTUS1 antibodies revealed a strong cytosolic staining in luminal epithelial cells of the breast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007239-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). The same results were obtained using polyclonal anti-ATIP antibodies described previously <xref rid="pone.0007239-Nouet1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> (data not shown). MTUS1 immunostaining was then analyzed in 20 breast cancer samples for which paraffin-embedded tissue sections were available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007239-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Selected tumors were representative of all histological grades (10, 3 and 7 tumors of grade I, II and III, respectively), and main molecular subtypes (12 ER+, 3 HER2+ and 3 triple negative tumors). MTUS1 immunostaining in tumor sections was scored and compared to <italic>MTUS1</italic> mRNA expression levels according to Affymetrix probeset intensities. As presented in supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007239.s005">Table S3</xref>, tumors showing low levels of <italic>MTUS1</italic> transcripts by DNA array and/or real-time RT-PCR analysis also displayed undetectable or weak MTUS1 staining, whereas those expressing high levels of <italic>MTUS1</italic> mRNA were attributed a high score by immunohistochemistry. Thus, results on protein expression paralleled gene array analysis.</p>
        <p>
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> obtained by DNA microarray were further confirmed and extended by real-time RT-PCR. We selected a panel of 29 representative tumor samples whose <italic>MTUS1</italic> Affymetrix probesets intensities ranged from low (nâ=â11), moderate (nâ=â13) to high (nâ=â5).

In order to discriminate between different <italic>MTUS1</italic> spliced variants, real-time RT-PCR was designed to specifically amplify ATIP1 and ATIP3 mRNAs using oligonucleotides located in their specific 5â² exons, respectively. Since ATIP4 transcripts are exclusively expressed in the central nervous system <xref rid="pone.0007239-DiBenedetto1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, these were not included in the present study.

Highest levels of <italic>MTUS1</italic> expression were found in the lung cancer cell line SK-MES, that was therefore selected for further study.

        <title>ATIP3 associates with microtubules</title>
        <p>To further characterize ATIP3 at the molecular level, its subcellular localization was analyzed in SK-MES cancer cells that express high levels of ATIP3 and no detectable ATIP1. Confocal microscopy analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007239-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) allowed the detection of endogenous ATIP3 proteins as filamentous structures in the cytoplasm, with a staining pattern similar to that of microtubules. Incubation with anti-alpha-tubulin antibodies revealed colocalization of ATIP3 with the microtubule network during interphase. During mitosis, endogenous ATIP3 staining decorates the mitotic spindle in metaphase and anaphase, and remains strongly associated with the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007239-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). To confirm that the ATIP3 isoform indeed colocalizes with microtubules, human cell lines were transiently transfected with the GFP-ATIP3 fusion protein and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007239-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, GFP-ATIP3 colocalizes with alpha-tubulin at the microtubule cytoskeleton and microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in cells expressing low levels of the fusion protein. Higher levels of expression of the GFP-ATIP3 construct led to the formation of bundles which is a characteristic feature of stabilized microtubules, suggesting that ATIP3 may regulate the dynamics of microtubule polymerization. The same intracellular localization was observed upon transfection of GFP-ATIP3 into HeLa, RPE1, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells (not shown). As observed for endogenous ATIP3, the GFP-ATIP3 fusion protein also localizes at the mitotic spindle during mitosis (not shown), and stains the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007239-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

To this end, GFP-ATIP3 was transiently transfected into HeLa-H2B cells, that stably express a red fluorescent protein-tagged Histone H2B and constitute a useful tool to monitor mitosis by live cell imaging. Time-lapse fluorescence videomicroscopy analyses revealed the association of GFP-ATIP3 with duplicated centrosomes during prophase, and further confirmed its localization at the mitotic spindle and intercellular bridge at different steps of mitosis in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007239-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007239.s006">video S1</xref> and supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007239.s007">video S2</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results presented here identify ATIP3 as a novel anti-mitotic protein whose expression is reduced in infiltrating breast cancer. Low levels of expression of ATIP3 are associated with high histological grade of the tumor and the occurrence of distant metastasis, indicating a close relationship between reduced ATIP3 expression and breast cancer aggressiveness. In addition, in tumors showing a triple-negative phenotype (ERâ PRâ HER2â) ATIP3 levels are significantly lower than those measured in luminal (ER+) and HER2+, suggesting that ATIP3 may represent a novel molecular marker for poor outcome of breast cancer.</p>
      <p>Immunohistochemical analyses revealed a cytosolic ATIP localization in luminal epithelial cells of normal breast tissue. ATIP protein immunostaining intensity paralleled its mRNA levels determined both by gene microarray and real-time RT-PCR. Thus, immunodetection of ATIP proteins in breast cancer samples may be a simple and useful tool for pathologists to distinguish between ATIP-positive and negative tumors. This may be of particular interest for the identification of a subset of triple negative breast tumors having lost the expression of ATIP3. Indeed, in contrast to the ER+ and HER2+ tumors subtypes that can be efficiently treated with hormonal and anti-HER2 therapy, respectively, triple negative tumors lack targeted treatments. We show here that restoring ATIP3 expression in ATIP3-negative breast cancer cell lines leads to reduced cancer cell proliferation, clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, ATIP3 re-expression lowers the incidence, time-course and size of tumor progression in xenograft models <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that ATIP3 may represent an interesting candidate for future targeted therapies of triple negative breast tumors. Further studies will be necessary to investigate the feasibility of <italic>in vivo</italic> methods aimed at re-expressing ATIP3, or active truncated domains of the protein, by using tumor-targeted systemic delivery of nanocomplexes as recently reported for the tumor suppressor RB94 <xref rid="pone.0007239-Pirollo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ATIP3 belongs to a family of proteins (ATIP1 to ATIP4) encoded by alternative splicing of <italic>MTUS1</italic>, a candidate 8p22 tumor suppressor gene <xref rid="pone.0007239-DiBenedetto1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Previous studies have reported that <italic>MTUS1</italic> expression levels are reduced in cancers from pancreas, colon, ovary and head-and-neck <xref rid="pone.0007239-Seibold1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0007239-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, the question of which <italic>MTUS1</italic> transcript is down-regulated had not been investigated, nor had the <italic>in vivo</italic> consequence of ATIP re-expression been analyzed until now. We report here for the first time that ATIP3 is the major <italic>MTUS1</italic> isoform whose expression is altered in invasive breast cancer. Our results showing that ATIP3 re-expression functionally reduces breast cancer cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> may argue in favor of a tumor suppressor effect of ATIP3. However, whether <italic>MTUS1</italic> corresponds to a âbona fideâ tumor suppressor gene inactivated by epigenetic or genomic alterations remains to be established. Of interest, our previous mutational analysis of <italic>MTUS1</italic> in a series of hepatocellular carcinomas and cell lines has identified five potential gene mutations which are all located in exons specific to the ATIP3 transcript <xref rid="pone.0007239-DiBenedetto2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We and others have also identified <italic>MTUS1</italic> gene variations located on ATIP3-specific exons in head-and-neck carcinoma cell lines <xref rid="pone.0007239-DiBenedetto2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007239-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, Frank et al. have recently reported significant association between copy number variants of MTUS1 exon 4 - specific to the ATIP3 transcript - and familial breast cancer risk <xref rid="pone.0007239-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, further suggesting that alterations of the ATIP3 isoform may be associated with carcinogenesis. To note, the functional consequences of <italic>MTUS1</italic> gene alterations could not be examined until now due to a lack of knowledge on ATIP3 intracellular actions. By providing a molecular and functional analysis of ATIP3, the present study brings a major contribution to the characterization of <italic>MTUS1</italic> gene products and to the identification of potential driver mutations that may lead to a loss of function of the ATIP3 protein in cancer.</p>
      <p>Our results show that ATIP3 is a novel microtubule-associated protein localized at the centrosome, mitotic spindle and intercellular bridge, and that its overexpression delays the progression of mitosis in living cells. ATIP3 thus appears as a new member of a functional family of microtubule-associated proteins, including adenomatous polyposis coli APC <xref rid="pone.0007239-Aoki1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, LZTS1 <xref rid="pone.0007239-Ishii1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and RASSF1A <xref rid="pone.0007239-Rong1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007239-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, that interfere with the microtubule cytoskeleton to regulate essential steps of mitosis and have been clearly identified as tumor suppressors down-regulated or mutated in breast cancer.</p>
      <p>The possibility that ATIP3 may be involved in cell division <italic>via</italic> a regulation of spindle dynamics is consistent with its localization at centrosomes, spindle poles and spindle microtubules, and is supported by its effects on microtubule stability (our unpublished observations). ATIP3 may thus represent a novel interesting target for rational anti-mitotic therapies based on proteins associated with the mitotic spindle <xref rid="pone.0007239-Warner1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007239-Huszar1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, the observation that ATIP3 promotes prolonged mitosis by extending the time of metaphase potentially reflects modulation of spindle checkpoint signalling and provides a molecular basis for elucidating the intracellular functions of ATIP3 in cell division. Thus, the novel microtubule associated protein ATIP3 identified here may represent a useful prognostic biomarker of agressive breast cancer and a promising candidate for the development of new targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>
