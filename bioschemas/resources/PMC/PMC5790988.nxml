      <abstract>
        <p>Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family (SLAMF) receptors are essential regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses. The function of SLAMF5/CD84, a family member with almost ubiquitous expression within the hematopoietic lineage is poorly defined. In this article, we provide evidence that in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) SLAMF5 increases autophagy, a degradative pathway, which is highly active in dendritic cells (DCs) and plays a critical role in orchestration of the immune response. While investigating the underlying mechanism, we found that SLAMF5 inhibited proteolytic degradation of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) a master regulator of the autophagy process by a mechanism dependent on the E3-ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21). Furthermore, we demonstrate that SLAMF5 influences the ratio of CD1a<sup>+</sup> cells in differentiating DCs and partakes in the regulation of IL-1Î², IL-23, and IL-12 production in LPS/IFNÎ³-activated moDCs in a manner that is consistent with its effect on IRF8 stability. In summary, our experiments identified SLAMF5 as a novel cell surface receptor modulator of autophagy and revealed an unexpected link between the SLAMF and IRF8 signaling pathways, both implicated in multiple human pathologies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Macroautophagy (here referred to as autophagy) is a conserved catabolic pathway, whereby cytosolic contents are sequestered by <italic>de novo</italic> formed double-membrane-bound vesicles, called autophagosomes and carried to lysosomes for degradation. It is active at basal levels in most cell types to recycle macromolecules (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and to prevent accumulation of cytotoxic metabolites (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Beyond maintaining cellular homeostasis, autophagy improves cell autonomous and host defense mechanisms against a number of pathogens by regulating intracellular protein trafficking and degradation as well as antigen presentation (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In addition, autophagy guards against both untimely and excessive inflammatory reactions by influencing the activation and duration of inflammation <italic>via</italic> suppression of ROS accumulation and removal of danger signals as well as regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Dendritic cells (DCs) continuously migrate from tissues to lymph nodes to present antigens to antigen-specific T cells. The DC pool of non-lymphoid organs is maintained by constant replenishment from circulating monocytes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) whose differentiation into DCs is dependent on the induction of autophagy (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). DCs exploit autophagy to display cytoplasmic self- or foreign antigens on MHC II molecules for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This mechanism, depending on the presence or absence of danger signal-induced co-stimulation, contributes to the initiation of a pathogen-specific immune response and to establishment or maintenance of peripheral tolerance, respectively (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The rate of autophagy therefore must be stringently controlled to adapt to the actual immune context. Stimulation of DCs by LPS has been shown to transiently reduce autophagy and its associated functions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), presumably to diminish presentation of self-antigens and focus the immune response against an emerging environmental threat. However, as all immune responses, including TLR-mediated functions have the potential to convey damage to host tissues, the recovery of autophagy, reestablishing its anti-inflammatory effects is increasingly recognized as an essential component of the maintenance of host tissue integrity.</p>
      <p>Recent work of the Ozato laboratory identified interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) as a positive regulator of autophagy in murine macrophages and DCs exposed to various stress signals, including starvation, exposure to TLR ligands or infection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Furthermore, their earlier work demonstrated that stimulation of murine macrophages with LPS/FNÎ³ induced secretion of IL-12 that was fully dependent on IRF8 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The amount and activity of the IRF8 protein were found to be controlled by ubiquitin ligases (TRIM21, c-Cbl), the p62 ubiquitin-binding protein (Sequestosome-1) as well as the deubiquitinase USP4, regulating its proteasomal degradation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The tasks of IRF8 as a regulator of autophagy or its role in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) functions have not been properly addressed.</p>
      <p>Members of the cell surface-expressed signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family (SLAMF) receptors (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) have been shown to regulate autophagy. SLAMF1 (CD150) and SLAMF4 (CD244 or 2B4) were reported to bind to the Beclin-1/Vps34 autophagy-associated complex (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) responsible for generation of PI(3)P, a phospholipid involved in autophagic vesicle nucleation. SLAMF1 increased the autophagic flux in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) <italic>via</italic> stabilization of the above autophagic macrocomplex. On the contrary, SLAMF4 was identified as an inhibitor of starvation- and rapamycin-induced autophagy in human lymphoblastoid cell lines and in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages <italic>via</italic> reducing Vps34 lipid kinase activity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
      <p>SLAMF5 is a self-ligand receptor broadly expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells that during cellâcell communication acts both as an adhesion and signaling molecule (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Although its cell surface expression on both the myeloid and plasmacytoid subsets of DCs have been established (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), its function in these cells has not been addressed.</p>
      <p>Overall, regulatory circuits of autophagy and inflammation are interconnected at multiple levels (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), thus molecules involved in the regulation of autophagy have a major impact on the outcome of the immune response. Identification of autophagy regulators, cell surface receptors, readily accessible for antibodies in particular, may provide excellent targets to modulate autophagy in various disease states.</p>
      <p>In this report, we examined the effect of SLAMF5 on human moDC responses induced by LPS/IFNÎ³, frequently used as a model of infection with Gram-negative bacteria. We identify SLAMF5 as a novel cell surface-expressed regulator of basal autophagy that responding to inflammatory signals fine-tunes cytokine production of human moDCs <italic>via</italic> affecting a pathway responsible for proteasomal degradation of IRF8.</p>

        <title>SLAMF5 Is Upregulated during Differentiation and Activation of Human moDCs</title>
        <p>In the process of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of moDCs, expressions of several receptors with immune modulatory function are upregulated. We found that SLAMF5 is strongly induced when monocytes are differentiated into DCs by GM-CSF and IL-4 suggesting that SLAMF5 is required for the proper functions of immature DCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). To evaluate the impact of SLAMF5âSLAMF5 interaction on moDC functions, we performed RNA interference targeting SLAMF5 on freshly isolated monocytes. Based on flow cytometry and western blot analyses, SLAMF5 expression was reduced by 80â95%, and silencing was maintained throughout the entire course of differentiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Although Binsky et al. have recently published that SLAMF5 acts as a survival receptor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and its downregulation results in receptor induced cell death (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), under our experimental conditions neither the viability of moDCs nor the yield of differentiation was affected by <italic>SLAMF5</italic> silencing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). Next, we analyzed whether SLAMF5-deficient cells display any defects in moDC differentiation by measuring CD14, highly expressed on monocytes but downregulated on moDCs, as well as DC-SIGN (CD209), typically expressed by differentiated DCs. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D, cell surface expression of CD14 and DC-SIGN was identical in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced and control moDCs indicating that even grossly diminished levels of SLAMF5 did not affect the differentiation of monocytes into moDCs.</p>

        <p>As simultaneous LPS and IFNÎ³ stimuli further increased its expression level in moDCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A), we analyzed the potential role of SLAMF5 as a modulator of DC activation in response to LPS/IFNÎ³.

The amounts of HLA-A, B, C and HLA-DQ increased to the same extent after stimulation of control and <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced cells. In addition, the expression of the co-stimulatory receptors CD40 and CD86 was identical in control and knockdown cells (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>A in Supplementary Material). Interestingly, silencing of <italic>SLAMF5</italic> at an early phase of moDC differentiation led to a moderate, but significant decrease in the subset of CD1a<sup>+</sup> DCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E).

        <title>SLAMF5 Enhances Autophagy in moDCs</title>
        <p>In light of the recently established link between autophagy and SLAMF receptors (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), we examined whether SLAMF5 partakes in the process of autophagy in resting or activated DCs. Microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3 hereafter) is widely used to monitor autophagy. During autophagy induction the processed LC3 is covalently coupled with phosphatidylethanolamine in the newly forming autophagosomal membrane (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The cleaved cytosolic LC3 (called LC3-I) and the lipid-modified, autophagosome-associated LC3 (LC3-II) can be identified by their different electrophoretic mobility and the level of LC3-II correlates with the amount of autophagosomes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). As displayed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A, we detected lower LC3-II/Î²-actin ratios in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced moDCs than in control cells indicating the importance of SLAMF5 in maintenance of basal autophagy. To evaluate kinetic changes in autophagy during DC activation, we treated control and <italic>SLAMF5</italic> knockdown moDCs with LPS/IFNÎ³ for 4 and 8âh. The expected transient, activation-dependent decrease in LC3-II levels (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) was apparent 4âh past treatment with LPS/IFNÎ³ both in control and <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced moDCs. At 8âh past stimulation, however, LC3-II levels recovered in control but not in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A; Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>A in Supplementary Material). Since LC3-II molecules localized in the inner membrane of autophagosomes are degraded during the autophagic process, lower levels of LC3-II may result from either decreased autophagosome formation or increased autophagic degradation (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). When BafA1, an inhibitor of autophagosomeâlysosome fusion and lysosomal acidification (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) was applied LC3-II levels remained lower in the absence of SLAMF5 compared with controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). As a control for the activity of BafA1, the extent of LC3-II accumulation is shown side by side in BafA1-treated and untreated samples (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>B in Supplementary Material). This observation implies that rather than being involved in the maturation process of autophagosomes, SLAMF5 appears to be a positive regulator of autophagosome biogenesis. To further support SLAMF5-mediated regulation of autophagy we used CYTO-ID, a fluorescent dye that selectively labels autophagic vacuoles in live cells (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and thus can be readily quantified by flow cytometry (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In agreement with the results obtained by LC3 blotting, fluorescence intensity of CYTO-ID was significantly lower in <italic>SLAMF5</italic> knockdown cells than in controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). Confocal microscopy analysis of CYTO-ID staining revealed punctate structures, the number of which increased in the presence of chloroquine (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>C in Supplementary Material). Chloroquine inhibits maturation of autophagosomes by affecting lysosomal acidification, thereby resulting in accumulation of large CYTO-ID positive compartments (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Therefore, the fluorescence signal detected by flow cytometry indeed resulted from accumulation of the dye in autophagic vacuoles.</p>

        <title>Autophagy Defect Observed in the Absence of SLAMF5 Is Not Mended by Rapamycin</title>
        <p>mTOR is one of the key negative regulators of autophagy (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). One potential mechanism by which SLAMF5 could enhance the level of autophagy was inhibition of the mTORC1 complex. To examine this scenario we used rapamycin (RAPA), a specific inhibitor of the mTORC1 complex and a well-known inducer of autophagy (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Control and <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced moDCs were treated with rapamycin for 4âh either in the presence or absence of BafA1. As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A,B, the autophagy defect remained apparent in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced cells even when mTORC1 was suppressed, suggesting that SLAMF5-mediated regulation of autophagy is independent of mTOR activity. To further test this scenario, <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced and control moDCs were activated with LPS/IFNÎ³, and phosphorylation of Akt, a kinase upstream of mTOR, and of the mTOR target protein p70S6K was monitored by western blot analysis. If SLAMF5 increases autophagy by inhibition of mTOR activity, silencing of <italic>SLAMF5</italic> should potentiate the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway resulting in increased phosphorylation of these proteins. However, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C, the amounts of phospho-Akt and phospho-p70S6K were comparable in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced and control cells. The fact that rapamycin failed to restore the autophagy defect present in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced cells together with our findings that phosphorylation of Akt, and p70S6K was unaffected at diminished SLAMF5 protein levels strongly suggest that mTOR is not the main mediator of the autophagy pathway modulated by SLAMF5.</p>

        <title>SLAMF5 Regulates Autophagy <italic>via</italic> Preventing Proteasomal Degradation of IRF8</title>
        <p>Recently, Gupta and colleagues reported that IRF8 is expressed under steady-state conditions in murine bone marrow-derived DCs and its expression level is significantly increased in response to LPS/IFNÎ³ treatment. Moreover, IRF8 was shown to switch on the expression of many genes involved in all phases of autophagy (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Based on the central role of IRF8 in the process of autophagy, we hypothesized that the molecular mechanism by which SLAMF5 promotes autophagy may involve the regulation of IRF8 activity. To test this, first, we silenced <italic>SLAMF5</italic> and analyzed induction of IRF8 expression in response to treatment with LPS/IFNÎ³. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, the amount of IRF8 protein in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced moDCs was significantly decreased. To gain more insight into the effects of decreased IRF8 levels on moDC differentiation and functions, <italic>IRF8</italic> expression was silenced using an <italic>IRF8</italic>-specific siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Interestingly, we found that silencing of <italic>IRF8</italic>, a lineage determining factor for myeloid cells, had no significant effect on the downregulation of CD14 expression or the induction of DC-SIGN expression associated with the differentiation process in the presence of IL-4 and GM-CSF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). Moreover, IRF8 expression was also not requisite for the expression of SLAMF5 that was significantly increased in <italic>IRF8</italic>-silenced cells (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref> in Supplementary Material).</p>

To test whether IRF8 acts as a regulator of autophagy in human moDCs, the intensity of autophagy was compared in <italic>IRF8</italic>-silenced and control moDCs. In line with its function in murine macrophages and DCs, and its suspected role as a mediator of SLAMF5âs effects, <italic>IRF8</italic>-silenced moDCs showed significantly decreased autophagy compared with controls.

These findings demonstrate that similar to murine bone marrow-derived DCs, IRF8 is used for the regulation of autophagy in human moDCs. To determine whether SLAMF5 and IRF8 are part of the same or different autophagy regulatory pathways, SLAMF5 was cross-linked with the above described 152.1D5 mAb antibody on moDCs transfected with control or <italic>IRF8</italic>-specific siRNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>H, cross-linking of SLAMF5 significantly increased autophagy in moDCs transfected with the control oligonucleotides; however, this induction was dependent on the presence of IRF8.

        <p>Protein levels are determined by the rate of transcription followed by translation as well as the rate of protein degradation. When <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced and control moDCs were activated by LPS/IFNÎ³, both the kinetics and the intensity of <italic>IRF8</italic>-transcription were found to be identical between silenced cells and controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A) indicating the lack of SLAMF5-mediated regulation at the level of <italic>IRF8</italic>-transcription. Given that IRF8 activity and its stability are regulated by polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), we examined whether degradation of IRF8 by the proteasome was affected by SLAMF5. When moDCs were activated by LPS/IFNÎ³ in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, IRF8 levels in <italic>SLAMF5</italic> knockdown moDCs were completely restored (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). As a control, enrichment of ubiquitin-linked proteins in the presence of MG132 was confirmed by probing identical blots with a ubiquitin-specific antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S4</xref> in Supplementary Material). Since ubiquitination of IRF8 by the E3-ubiquitin ligases TRIM21 (Ro52) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) has been described in murine macrophages, we tested whether IRF8 degradation in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced cells required the participation of these ligases. To this end, first, we confirmed induction of TRIM21 in response to LPS/IFNÎ³ (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S5</xref> in Supplementary Material) and its silencing in the presence of <italic>TRIM21</italic> gene-specific siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). Next, <italic>SLAMF5</italic> alone, or in combination with <italic>TRIM21</italic>, was silenced, and the level of IRF8 protein was measured in moDCs treated with LPS/IFNÎ³. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D, IRF8 degradation in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced moDCs was blocked when cells were co-transfected with the <italic>TRIM21</italic>-specific, but not with the control oligo. This finding clearly showed that increased degradation of IRF8 in the absence of SLAMF5 was dependent on the presence of TRIM21. In similar experiments, IRF8 was not rescued from degradation by silencing the E3-ubiquitin ligase <italic>c-Cbl</italic> (data not shown).</p>

Based on its reported expression in antigen-presenting cells (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and a recent report describing it as an enhancer of the autophagy process (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), EAT-2 emerges as a potential adapter transmitting SLAMF5 signals. However, when EAT-2 expression was thoroughly examined in our model, we found EAT-2 expressed in human monocytes, but abruptly downregulated in response to the used DC differentiation signals. The EAT-2 protein was absent both in resting and LPS/IFNÎ³-activated moDCs (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S6</xref> in Supplementary Material), indicating that SLAMF5 drives autophagy in moDCs in an EAT-2-independent manner.</p>
        <p>Taken together, unlike its induction of gene expression and translation, the stability of the IRF8 protein is strongly affected by the presence of SLAMF5 that appears to control the activity of TRIM21. These data also support a mechanism connecting SLAMF5 to autophagy as part of the regulatory cascade sustaining activity of IRF8, a major transcription factor of autophagy-related genes.</p>

        <p>To further support our hypothesis that the impact of <italic>SLAMF5</italic> silencing on DC functions is the consequence of IRF8 degradation, hereinafter, we examined whether depletion of IRF8 could induce similar functional changes to those seen in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced moDCs. Given the well-characterized role of autophagy in the inflammatory response, the contribution of SLAMF5 and IRF8 to cytokine production of moDCs was examined. To this end, we measured the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the supernatant of control and knockdown moDCs exposed to LPS/IFNÎ³. <italic>SLAMF5</italic>- (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A) or <italic>IRF8</italic>-silenced cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B) released significantly higher amounts of IL-1Î² and IL-23 than did control cells, implying that both SLAMF5 and IRF8 may function to restrain excessive inflammatory reactions. On the contrary, <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced or <italic>IRF8</italic> knockdown cells produced less IL-12 than control cells. Remarkably, these experiments also showed that IL-12 production in response to LPS/IFNÎ³ stimulation was fully IRF8 dependent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). The finding that loss of IRF8 replicated several changes in DC phenotype (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D,E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C,D) and cytokine production observed in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced cells, lends further support to a model in which SLAMF5 and IRF8 are part of the same regulatory pathway.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>SLAMF receptors regulate various stages of the immune response including the differentiation of innate and classical T cell subsets as well as the T- and B cell memory response (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Consequently, in addition to antimicrobial responses, SLAMF receptors have been shown to contribute to pathological autoimmune responses, i.e., colitis and systemic lupus erythematosus (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>â<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), as well as to neuropsychiatric diseases with inflammatory and neurodegenerative etiologies (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Despite its ubiquitous expression in practically all hematopoietic lineages, mice carrying defective <italic>SLAMF5</italic> alleles at both chromosomes have a relatively mild phenotype. The main defect appears to be restricted to germinal center formation, specifically due to lack of proper adhesion and functional interaction between T follicular helper (Tfh) and B cells, but not DCs (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, normal DC functions in the absence of SLAMF5 may be explained by compensatory mechanisms implemented by other SLAMF members. Alternatively, appearance of the unique functions of SLAMF5 may require specific environmental challenges, yet to be identified. In support of this latter scenario, SLAMF5 has been shown to regulate TCR-, BCR-, and FCÎµRI-mediated signal-transduction (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The function of SLAMF5 in myeloid cells, however, remains poorly understood. In a single report, <italic>SLAMF5</italic> knockdown was found to decrease LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In our work, we set up experiments to analyze the function of SLAMF5 in human moDCs. When SLAMF5 expression was decreased by 80â95% using transfection of specific siRNA, human peripheral blood monocytes readily differentiated into moDCs, suggesting that SLAMF5 may not be required for the main steps of moDC differentiation. In addition, although SLAMF5 was shown to act as a survival factor in certain tumor cell lines (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), viability of SLAMF5-deficient moDCs appeared to be identical to that of control cells, suggesting that the survival-promoting effect of SLAMF5 may be context dependent, lineage-specific, or even restricted to transformed cells.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, production of IL-1Î² and IL-23 was significantly enhanced by cells with reduced SLAMF5 levels while IL-12 secretion was diminished compared with controls. These functional changes occurred in the absence of altered expression of receptors associated with DC activation including HLA proteins or the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86. Thus, SLAMF5-mediated modulation of cytokine production without affecting co-stimulatory receptor expression may allow DCs to alter polarization of naÃ¯ve T cells while supporting their proliferation. In this regard, independent regulation of DC maturation and inflammatory cytokine production has been described by the DâOro group in TLR ligand-activated DCs treated with the pan-Src-kinase inhibitor PP1 or PP2 (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).</p>
      <p>More rigorous analysis of the SLAMF5-deficient moDCs identified a consistent, albeit moderate decrease of CD1a expression that together with an increase in IL-1Î² and IL-23 production was reminiscent of the phenotype of DCs treated with autophagy inhibitors (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Inhibition of autophagy, either with the PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine or with siRNA against the autophagy protein Atg7 significantly increased IL-1Î² production of human PBMC stimulated with either LPS (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) or <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Likewise, LPS-activated human moDCs produced more IL-23 under such circumstances (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). It has also been reported that IL-1Î², produced following autophagy inhibition in DCs, acted in an autocrine manner to drive IL-23 secretion and this appears to be the mechanism through which autophagy exerts its effects on IL-23 (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In our experiments, in response to LPS/IFNÎ³, <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced moDCs showed a similar increase of IL-1Î² and IL-23 production as autophagy-deficient cells, indicating that SLAMF5 may act as a positive regulator of autophagy in moDCs. Our hypothesis that SLAMF5 is a novel cell surface regulator of autophagy was confirmed by two complementary methods; by monitoring conversion of LC3 into its lipid-modified form, and monitoring accumulation of CYTO-ID, an autophagosome-specific dye. In our experiments, however, impaired autophagy was strikingly accompanied by decreased IL-12 secretion, which seems to contradict an earlier study reporting that mice lacking the autophagy protein Atg5 in myeloid cells secrete higher amounts of IL-12 in response to infection with Mtb (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). This discrepancy, however, may be readily resolved by the IRF8 dependence of LPS/IFNÎ³-induced IL-12 production in macrophages (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and, as our results demonstrate, in human moDCs. In addition to IL-12, the transcription of multiple components of the autophagy machinery was recently shown to be under the control of IRF8 in murine DCs. Our work shows that, similarly to murine cells, IRF8 has a pivotal role in the autophagic process of human moDCs. Based on these findings we propose that DC autophagy is controlled by SLAMF5 <italic>via</italic> an IRF8-dependent mechanism. In support of this, we presented evidence that cross-linking with a SLAMF5-specific agonistic antibody significantly increased the autophagic flux of human moDCs both under steady-state conditions and following activation with LPS/IFNÎ³. Importantly, this effect was reversed by silencing <italic>IRF8</italic> expression of moDCs. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of posttranslational modifications in the regulation of IRF8 activity (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored IRF8 protein levels of <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced cells indicating that in moDCs IRF8 is at least in part controlled by SLAMF5 <italic>via</italic> modulating its degradation by the proteasome.</p>
      <p>Taken together, data presented in this work strongly suggest that SLAMF5 controls the production of key inflammatory cytokines <italic>via</italic> regulating autophagy, mediated at least in part by fine-tuning proteasomal degradation of one of the autophagy master regulators, IRF8. Regarding the molecular machinery involved in the described SLAMF5-dependent increase of IRF8 stability, we identified the E3-ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 as a mediator of IRF8 degradation in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced moDCs.</p>
      <p>However compelling the mechanism of IRF8 control by the SLAMF5 signaling pathway in the regulation of autophagy and inflammatory cytokine production regulation seems, we cannot exclude contribution of other pathways. For example, similar to the mechanism described for SLAMF1 and SLAMF4, SLAMF5 may partake in the formation of the Beclin-1/Vps34 autophagy-associated regulatory complex (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Although much of the molecular details of autophagy regulation are yet to be clarified, SLAMF5 should influence the early events of autophagy, steps independent of autophagosome maturation as well as mTOR, as neither BafA1 nor rapamycin rescued the defect seen in <italic>SLAMF5</italic>-silenced moDCs.</p>
      <p>Pharmacological modulation of the autophagy process is of great significance (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). The close to ubiquitous expression of SLAMF5 in hematopoietic cells provides an opportunity to selectively augment autophagic functions in these cells. Immune cell-specific autophagy regulators on one hand could decrease the unwanted pleiotropic effects associated with manipulation of systemic autophagy, and at the same time, increase cell-extrinsic effects of autophagy that operate in the context of host defense.</p>
      <p>MoDCs have been reported to be present in the mammalian brain during infections controlling reactive T-lymphocyte influx and contributing to neurodegenerative processes (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Furthermore, moDCs are also thought to be crucial in brain immunosurveillance, and key players in various neuropathologies associated with Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and Parkinsonâs disease (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). In AD, impaired clearance of amyloid-Î² plaques and tau protein tangles was shown in an SLAMF receptor and Beclin-1 interactome-dependent manner reflecting on the critical involvement of defective autophagy and phagocytosis in AD pathogenesis (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p>
      <p>Based on the central role of autophagy in antimicrobial immunity and inflammation, autophagy upregulation in immune cells can be beneficial in infectious diseases (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). In this regard, Garcia et al. have recently reported that autophagy was induced by Mtb-derived antigens in the adherent population of PBMC of Mtb carriers. The level of autophagy was IFNÎ³ dependent and showed a positive correlation with the level of IFNÎ³ produced by the patientâs PBMC (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Moreover, the same group has shown earlier that T cells isolated from patients with favorable clinical response to Mtb (high responders) had increased expression of SLAMF1 compared with those derived from low responders (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Interestingly, they also demonstrated that IL-17 and SLAMF1 have opposing effects on IFNÎ³ production in tuberculosis patients (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). These findings are in line with our earlier results in LPS-activated moDCs showing a positive effect of SLAMF1 on the IL-12âIFNÎ³ axis in the context of Th1-cell differentiation (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In this article, we report that SLAMF5 modifies the cytokine profile of LPS/IFNÎ³-stimulated moDCs in a manner that would support Th1âcell differentiation in expense to Th17âcell differentiation. However, this interpretation may be overly simplistic. As described by Schmitt et al., IL-12 controls the differentiation of IL-21-producing Tfh-like cells, and induces IL-21 secretion from memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). These findings, together with the well documented role of SLAMF5 in the differentiation of murine Tfh cells imply that SLAMF5 in human DCs may also promote commitment of naÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells toward the Tfh lineage. Altogether, our findings suggest that in human DCs, SLAMF5 supports intracellular pathogen-induced immune responses by both increasing the level of autophagy and by modulation of T-cell differentiation. Further research is required to understand the complexity of the underlying mechanisms, and to establish, to what extent, modulation of autophagy using agonistic SLAMF5-specific antibodies may be used to improve current therapies for various human diseases.</p>
