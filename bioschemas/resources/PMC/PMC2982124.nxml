        <p><italic>PKD2</italic> is mutated in 15% of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The PKD2 protein, polycystin-2 or TRPP2, is a nonselective Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable cation channel that has been shown to function at several locations, including primary cilia, basolateral membrane, and at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Nevertheless, the factors that regulate the channel activity of polycystin-2 are not well understood. Polycystin-2 has been shown previously to be regulated by phosphorylation at two serine residues (Ser<sup>812</sup> and Ser<sup>76</sup>) with distinct functional consequences. Here, we report the identification of a previously unrecognized phosphorylation site within the polycystin-2 C terminus (Ser<sup>801</sup>), and we demonstrate that it is phosphorylated by protein kinase D. Phosphorylation at this site was significantly increased in response to serum and epidermal growth factor stimulation. In nonciliated Madin-Darby canine kidney I cells, inducible expression of polycystin-2 inhibited cell proliferation compared with wild-type cells. Mutagenesis at Ser<sup>801</sup> abolished these effects and reduced ATP-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from ER stores. Finally, we show that a pathogenic mutation (S804N) within the consensus kinase recognition sequence abolished Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation. These results suggest that growth factor-stimulated, protein kinase D-mediated phosphorylation of polycystin-2 is essential for its ER channel function and links extracellular stimuli to its effects on cell growth and intracellular calcium regulation.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited human renal disease (incidence 1 in 1000 live births) and is caused by mutations in two genes, <italic>PKD1</italic> (85%) and <italic>PKD2</italic> (15%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Ong and Harris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Torres and Harris, 2006</xref>). ADPKD is an important cause of end-stage renal failure, accounting for â¼10% of patients on renal replacement therapy. The disease is characterized by the formation of fluid filled cysts in both kidneys of affected individuals, which ultimately result in end-stage renal failure. Other extrarenal manifestations of the disease include hypertension, cardiac valvular abnormalities, and cerebral aneurysms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Calvet and Grantham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Wilson, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>The ADPKD proteins polycystin (PC)-1 and PC2 have been shown to function as a heterodimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hanaoka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Newby <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), activating several key signaling pathways that in turn regulate diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, apoptosis, tubulogenesis, and fluid secretion. This is consistent with the largely overlapping renal and extrarenal phenotypes of PKD1 and PKD2 patients. PC1 and PC2 are likely to function together in many systems, but there is evidence to suggest they also can function independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Ong and Harris, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>PC2 is a 968-aa protein with six transmembrane spans, a pore-forming region, and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal tails. Based on sequence homology, it has been adopted as a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily (TRPP2), which is highly conserved throughout evolution and whose members function as nonselective cation channels responding to a wide range of stimuli. Although PC1 is believed to act at the plasma membrane (PM), PC2 has been shown to function at multiple locations, including primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Nauli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), basolateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Koulen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). PC1 and PC2 have been shown to reconstitute a likely receptorâion channel complex at the PM and PMâendoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions, which regulates epithelial morphogenesis, whereas ER PC2 channels are likely to regulate determination of the leftâright body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Giamarchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>Protein phosphorylation is a major posttranslational mechanism for regulating the function of most proteins, including members of the TRP family of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Yao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In most cases, phosphorylation leads to increased channel activity. For example, PKC phosphorylation on multiple sites increases the activity of TRPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Ahmmed <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and TRPM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Guinamard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Nilius <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Similarly, phosphorylation may regulate PC2 channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Laycock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>In previous studies, work from our group and others had identified two mammalian PC2 serine residues that are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Streets <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Phosphorylation at Ser<sup>812</sup> is mediated by CK2 and is crucial for several functions, including its Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence; its retrograde trafficking via binding to the adaptor proteins, PACS-1 and PACS-2; and the cytoplasmic retention of the cell cycle regulatory protein Id2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Kottgen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In addition, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3âdependent phosphorylation at Ser<sup>76</sup> has been shown to be critical for PC2 retention at the basolateral PM in vitro and essential for zebrafish pronephric development in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Streets <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>In a previous article, we reported that mutation of both Ser<sup>76</sup> and Ser<sup>812</sup> residues did not abolish PC2 phospholabeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Streets <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This led us to seek other potential phosphorylation sites and to define their functional significance. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro kinase assays, and phospho-specific antibody mapping, we have identified a new phosphorylation site within the PC2 C terminus at Ser<sup>801</sup> that contains an evolutionarily conserved recognition sequence for protein kinase D (PrKD), also known as human protein kinase C-Î¼ (PKCÎ¼). In nonciliated Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) I cells with inducible PC2 expression, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at this site specifically regulates cell growth probably mediated through its permissive effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from ER-located PC2 channels. Finally, a pathogenic mutation (Ser<sup>804</sup>) within the PrKD recognition consensus sequence abolished Ser<sup>801</sup>phosphorylation, indicating its likely physiological significance.</p>

        <p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 and MDCK cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was carried out on cells cultured to 90% confluence by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MDCK I FRT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Frohlich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) were transfected with the Tet repressor (pcDNA6/TR; Invitrogen) to generate a Flp-In T-Rex line, and several stable clones were selected in media containing blasticidin (5 Î¼g/ml). Clones were screened for transient receptor (TR) activity by transient expression of a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of a cytomegalovirus/TetO2 promoter and subsequent induction with tetracycline (1 Î¼g/ml). The clone with the highest inducible TR activity was then used to generate tetracycline inducible Flp-In hemagglutinin (HA)-PC2 or HA-PC2 mutant lines by cotransfecting pcDNA5/FRT/TO HA-PC2 and pOG44 Flp recombinase expression plasmids (Invitrogen) followed by selection in media containing hygromycin (100 Î¼g/ml).</p>

        <title>Cell Proliferation Assay</title>
        <p>For the proliferation assay, 5000 cells from each cell line were seeded into 12 separate wells of a 96-well plate and cultured for 48 h. Cell proliferation was determined using a colorimetric immunoassay based on the measurement of 5-bromo-2â²-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation during DNA synthesis (Roche Diagnostics). The BrdU enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were pulsed with 20 Î¼l/well 100 Î¼M BrdU solution for 2 h. Afterward, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were denatured with FixDenat solution and then incubated for 60 min with 1:100 diluted mouse anti-BrdU mAbs conjugated to peroxidase. After removing antibody conjugate, the substrate solution was added for 10 min. The absorbance was measured within 5 min at 450 nm with a reference wavelength at 690 nm using an ELISA plate reader. The blank corresponded to 200 Î¼l of culture medium with or without BrdU. Each experiment was repeated three times.</p>

Cells were incubated in cell-permeant NW Fluo-4 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37Â°C and 30 min at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions in calcium free media.

Dye-loaded cells were excited at 488 nm and increases in intracellular calcium were measured at an emission wavelength of 522 nm. Images were acquired every 10 s. Calcium transients were initiated by the addition of 10 Î¼M ATP. Transient durations were measured from the start of the calcium transients until fluorescence changes returned to the prestimulus background. To confirm that calcium stores in each cell line were equivalent, calcium release from internal stores was measured after ionomycin (1 Î¼M) or after blocking calcium reuptake with thapsigargin (5 Î¼M).

        <title>A PC2 Doublet Band Is Due to Phosphorylation at Ser<sup>801</sup></title>
        <p>Sequence analysis of human PC2 by prediction programs PhosphoBase, DISPHOS 1.3, and NetPhos suggested that it could contain in excess of 100 predicted phosphorylation sites (data not shown). It had been shown previously that PC2 can be constitutively phosphorylated at two residues: Ser<sup>76</sup> and Ser<sup>812</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Streets <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Phosphorylation analysis was performed by <sup>32</sup>P labeling PC2 in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. Nevertheless, we were unable to eliminate PC2 phosphorylation by mutation of both sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Streets <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). These findings led us to hypothesize that PC2 could be phosphorylated on alternative residues.</p>
        <p>In multiple experiments, we observed that native or exogenous PC2 was often detectable as a doublet band by immunoblotting and hypothesized that the upper band might represent a specific phosphorylated form of PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Dephosphorylation with the enzyme, Î» phosphatase (which removes all phosphate groups from serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues) resulted in loss of the upper band in a time-dependent manner, confirming that the reduction in mobility on SDS-PAGE was indeed the result of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Phosphorylation at Ser<sup>76</sup> has been visualized previously as a doublet band in N-terminal PC2 constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Streets <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). We found that a C-terminal PC2 construct was similarly detectable as a doublet band that could be reduced to a single band after treatment with Î»-phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p>

            <p>PC2 is phosphorylated in situ at Ser<sup>801</sup>. (A) Cell lysates from native mouse kidney cells (M8) and HEK-293 cells transfected with epitope-tagged PC2 (pkTag) were treated with Î»-phosphatase for 0 and 60 min and analyzed by Western blotting with PC2- and pkTag-specific antibodies. A clear doublet band is seen in both native and transfected cells (see arrows). The top band disappears after incubation with the enzyme, demonstrating that it is due to phosphorylation. (B) Cell lysates from HEK-293 cells transfected with a C-terminal PKD2 construct were treated with Î»-phosphatase for 0 and 90 min and analyzed by Western blotting with PC2-specific antibodies. A clear doublet band is seen. The top band disappears after incubation with the enzyme, demonstrating that it is due to phosphorylation. (C) To confirm the site responsible for the doublet band, single site mutants of CT2 were immunoblotted with a PC2-specific antibody to detect the presence of a phosphorylated banding pattern. Loss of the top phosphorylated band was only seen in cells transfected with the CT2 Ser<sup>801</sup> mutant construct and not the Ser<sup>812</sup> mutant construct. (D) To confirm the site responsible for the doublet band, single site mutants of PC2 were immunoblotted with an antibody directed to the pkTag epitope tag to detect the presence of a phosphorylated banding pattern. Loss of the top phosphorylated band was only seen in cells transfected with the PC2 Ser<sup>801G</sup> mutant construct. Conversely, a phosphomimic S<sup>801D</sup> mutant reduces the electrophoretic mobility of PC2, demonstrating that phosphorylation of Ser<sup>801</sup> is sufficient to change the mobility of PC2. (E) Diagram showing the main structural motifs of PC2 relative to the position of previously described phosphorylation sites at Ser<sup>76</sup> and Ser<sup>812</sup> and the position of the new site at Ser<sup>801</sup> reported in this study. (F) Active purified PKC was able to phosphorylate recombinant PC2 C terminus (CT2) in an in vitro kinase assay. The histogram shows that in vitro phosphorylation of the C-terminal of PC2 (CT2) by PKC is reduced by 53% (n = 3) when Ser<sup>801</sup> is mutated to Gly (n = 3). Top, autoradiography. Bottom, Coomassie staining showing equal loading of recombinant protein used in the assay. An asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.0065, Student's <italic>t</italic> test). (G) Two-dimensional gel analysis of phosphorylation of CT2 and CT2 S<sup>801G</sup>. After an in vitro kinase assay with purified PKC, samples were electrofocused under a pH gradient of 3â10 followed by separation by molecular weight on an 11% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were then immunoblotted with an anti-thio antibody. Phosphorylation results in a change in the isoelectric point of CT2. Multiple spots indicate multiple phosphorylation events. Wild-type CT2 separates isoelectrically into three distinct spots. CT2 containing a mutation at Ser<sup>801</sup> shows a different pattern of isoelectric separation and has lost the most acidic spot indicating a reduction in overall phosphorylation. (H) A phospho-serine specific antibody (Invitrogen) recognizes HA-PC2 immunoprecipitated from HEK cells. Cell lysates prepared from HA-tagged PC2-expressing HEK cells were immunoprecipitated with an HA antibody. Samples were immunoblotted with an antibody to HA (top) and a phospho-serine antibody (bottom) to detect the presence of a phosphorylated isoform. A clear band was seen with the phospho-serine antibody indicating that PC2 is phosphorylated on serine residues. No signal was seen in mock transfected cells. (I) Immunoblot showing that an anti-phospho-serine antibody (Invitrogen) recognizes the full-length phosphorylated form of PC2 but not serine phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of PC2 (NT2). (J) To confirm the site responsible for C-terminal phosphorylation, HA-tagged single serine site mutants of PC2 were immunoprecipitated from HEK cell lysates followed by detection with a phospho-serine antibody. Loss of the serine phosphorylated band was only seen in cells transfected with the Ser<sup>801</sup> mutant construct. Equal loading was confirmed by stripping and reprobing the same blot with an HA antibody.</p>

        <p>To determine the specific residues responsible for the mobility shift on Western blots, we substituted alanine or glycine at various combinations of five of the highest scoring predicted phosphorylation sites within the C terminus, i.e., Thr<sup>721</sup>, Ser<sup>801</sup>, Ser<sup>812</sup>, Ser<sup>831</sup>, and Ser<sup>943</sup>. Mutation of Thr<sup>721</sup>, Ser<sup>812</sup>, Ser<sup>831</sup>, and Ser<sup>943</sup> did not alter doublet band formation (data not shown), whereas mutation of Ser<sup>801</sup> to Gly<sup>801</sup> resulted in complete loss of the upper band in both C-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) and full-length PC2 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Confirming that phosphorylation at Ser<sup>801</sup> was responsible for the mobility shift, a phosphomimic S<sup>801D</sup> mutation resulted in the complete shift of PC2 to the upper band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). These data suggest that PC2 is constitutively phosphorylated in situ on at least three serine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E).</p>

        <title>Recombinant PC2 C Terminus Can Be Phosphorylated by PKC In Vitro</title>
        <p>Ser<sup>801</sup> in human PC2 is highly conserved in PC2 orthologues from higher and lower vertebrates, forming part of a consensus PKC recognition sequence and indicating its likely functional significance. To determine whether the C terminus of PC2 could act as a substrate for PKC, an in vitro kinase assay was performed using a recombinant C-terminal PC2 fusion protein (700â968 aa) and rat brain purified PKC, which contains a mixture of PKC isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F). Analysis of three separate experiments confirmed that it could be phosphorylated by purified PKC. Mutation of Ser<sup>801</sup> decreased (although it did not abolish) phosphorylation by PKC (p &lt; 0.05), implying the existence of other PKC sites.</p>
        <p>We confirmed these results by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has been successfully used to identify many other phosphorylated proteins. The proteins are first separated in the first dimension by their isoelectric point and then by molecular weight in the second dimension. The 80-Da phosphate does not resolve phosphoproteins from their unphosphorylated counterparts in the molecular weight dimension. However, the negative charge of the phosphate does change the isoelectric point. The result is a âphosphorylation trainââa series of spots on the gel that correspond to the molecular weight of the protein and that are separated in the isoelectric focusing dimension according to the number of associated phosphate groups. Thus, the train also can reflect the existence of multiple phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Duncan and Song, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The predicted p<italic>I</italic> of nonphosphorylated CT2 is pH 5.31. Phosphorylation of CT2 by PKC resulted in the appearance of three distinct spots on 2-D gels. The more acidic, hence more highly phosphorylated, forms are to the left of the gel. Mutation of Ser<sup>801</sup> resulted in loss of the most negatively charged spot (highlighted circle) that also can be seen to be at a slightly higher molecular weight, mirroring what we had seen on a one-dimensional (1-D) gel. The finding that mutation of Ser<sup>801</sup> does not completely eliminate in vitro phospholabeling of CT2 indicates that additional PKC sites are present.</p>

        <title>Phospho-specific Antibody Mapping Identifies PC2 Phosphorylation at Ser<sup>801</sup></title>
        <p>Although the PC2 doublet band was often detected, it was difficult to reproduce the SDS-PAGE and Western blotting conditions consistently to resolve the small mobility shift on 1-D gels. Taking a parallel approach, we screened FIVE commercial phospho-serine antibodies generated to general phospho-serine consensus sequences for their ability to recognize phosphorylated PC2 after immunoprecipitation. Of the antibodies tested, one (Invitrogen) recognized phosphorylated PC2 (â¼110 kDa) from transfected HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>H) and native mouse collecting duct cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).</p>
        <p>To identify the specific phosphorylated PC2 serine residue detected by this antibody, we first tested an N-terminal PC2 construct (1-223 aa) that can be phosphorylated at Ser<sup>76</sup> by GSK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Streets <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This phospho-serine antibody did not recognize the PC2 N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>I), suggesting that it might recognize a C-terminal serine residue instead. Using full-length <italic>PKD2</italic> cDNAs with specific mutations at the highest predicted C-terminal phosphorylation sites, we found that a Ser<sup>801</sup> mutation abolished antibody binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>J).</p>

        <title>PC2 Is Phosphorylated at Ser<sup>801</sup> In Situ by Protein Kinase D</title>
        <p>To confirm our in vitro kinase findings suggesting that PC2 Ser<sup>801</sup> could be phosphorylated by purified PKC, we examined Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation in MDCK cells stably expressing PC2 after pretreatment with a series of PKC inhibitors. Surprisingly, although known PKC inhibitors such as staurosporine and GÃ¶6976 resulted in complete loss of Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation, treatment with another common PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmalemide I, had no effect. Similarly, peptide inhibitors to PKC<sub>Î¶</sub>, PKA, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII; KN93) did not significantly reduce Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>

(A) The consensus PrKD phosphorylation motif (bold residues) and the corresponding motif in human (Q13563), mouse (O35245), and zebrafish (Q2VF27) PC2 are shown with the critical amino acids underlined. (B) To identify the kinase responsible for Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation, MDCK cells stably expressing HA-tagged PC2 were treated with specific kinase inhibitors. These included 0.1 Î¼M staurosporine (broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor), 10 Î¼M bisindolylmalemide I (BisI; PKC inhibitor), 10 Î¼M GÃ¶6976 (PKC inhibitor), 20 Î¼M PKC peptide inhibitor (PKC inhibitor), 20 Î¼M PKA peptide inhibitor (PKA inhibitor), and 20 Î¼M KN93 (CAMKII inhibitor). PC2 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed to the HA epitope tag, followed by detection with a phospho-serine antibody. Loss of Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation was only seen in cells incubated with staurosporine and GÃ¶6976. Equal loading was confirmed by stripping and reprobing the same blot with an HA antibody. (C) MDCK cells stably expressing HA-tagged PC2 were pretreated with DMSO, 10 Î¼M GÃ¶6976, or 10 Î¼M GÃ¶6983 followed by 4-h serum stimulation. PC2 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed to the HA epitope tag, followed by detection with a phospho-serine antibody. Loss of Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation was seen only in cells incubated with GÃ¶6976, suggesting that Ser<sup>801</sup> could be phosphorylated by PrKD. Equal loading was confirmed by stripping and reprobing the same blot with an HA antibody. (D) Expression of PrKD increases PC2 phosphorylation at Ser<sup>801</sup>. Cell lysates prepared from HEK cells coexpressing PrKD with HA-tagged PC2 or PC2 Ser<sup>801G</sup> were immunoprecipitated with an HA antibody. Samples were immunoblotted with an antibody to PC2 (bottom) and a phospho-serine antibody (top) to detect the presence of Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation. A significant increase in phosphorylation was seen when PC2 was coexpressed with PrKD compared with PC2 alone. No signal was seen when PC2 Ser<sup>801G</sup> was coexpressed with PrKD. Equal loading was confirmed by stripping and reprobing the same blot with an HA antibody. An asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.0001, Student's <italic>t</italic> test). (E) HEK cells were treated with control siRNAs or with validated siRNA specific to PrKD as described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>. PrKD knockdown was detected after immunoblotting of cell lysates with a PrKD-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). No reduction was seen in a control protein (calnexin). PC2 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed to the HA epitope tag, followed by detection with a phospho-serine antibody. A significant reduction in Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation was only seen in cells treated with PrKD-specific siRNA.

        <p>In view of these findings, we reanalyzed the PKC consensus sequence around Ser<sup>801</sup>. The consensus recognition sequence of PrKD or PKCÎ¼ shows extreme selectivity for Leu at position â5 as well as selectivity for Arg at â3, Met at â1, and Phe at +4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Nishikawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). This recognition sequence is perfectly preserved around Ser<sup>801</sup> in PC2 orthologues from higher and lower vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The initial description of PrKD as an atypical isoform of PKC and the inclusion of PrKD/PKCÎ¼ in reviews concerning the PKC family, which belongs to the AGC group (named for PKA, PKG, and PKC), contributed to a perception that PrKD belongs to the PKC family. However, it was noted from the outset that the catalytic domain of PrKD has highest sequence homology with myosin light chain kinase and CAMKs. Indeed, the three isoforms of PrKD are now classified as a new protein kinase family within the CAMK group, separate from the AGC group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Wang, 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because there are no known specific PrKD inhibitors, we compared the differential ability of two staurosporine derivatives, GÃ¶6976 and GÃ¶6983, to inhibit Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation. GÃ¶6976 selectively inhibits classical PKC isoforms as well as PrKD, whereas GÃ¶6983 suppresses the activity of all three PKC subgroups (classical, novel, and atypical) but not PrKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Gschwendt <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ivison <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, treatment with GÃ¶6976 but not GÃ¶6983 inhibited Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation, suggesting that Ser<sup>801</sup> was phosphorylated by PrKD. Consistent with this notion, bisindolylmalemide I is known to be a potent inhibitor of several PKC isoforms but not of PrKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Gschwendt <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>).</p>
        <p>We further confirmed this result by investigating Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation under conditions of PrKD overexpression and knockdown. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, enhanced Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation was observed in wild-type PC2 when cotransfected with PrKD; this was not seen in the PC2 Ser<sup>801</sup> mutant. Efficient siRNA knockdown of endogenous PrKD in HEK cells also led to the abolition of PC2 Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). These results indicate that PrKD is the physiological kinase for PC2 Ser<sup>801</sup>.</p>
        <p>Although there are no known pathogenic mutations of PC2 at Ser<sup>801</sup>, a pathogenic mutation in a PKD2 pedigree resulting in an amino acid substitution of Ser<sup>804</sup> to Asn<sup>804</sup> has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rossetti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This residue forms part of the consensus binding domain for PrKD. Using full-length <italic>PKD2</italic> cDNAs with specific mutations at either Ser<sup>801</sup> or S<sup>804</sup>, we found that a Ser<sup>804N</sup> mutation also abolished phosphorylation at Ser<sup>801</sup> as detected by the phosphoserine antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F).</p>

We therefore tested whether Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation could be altered by serum or EGF stimulation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, a significant increase in endogenous PC2 Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation was detected after serum stimulation in mouse collecting duct kidney epithelial cells (M8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Newby <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

To determine whether ATP also was able to stimulate phosphorylation of PC2, transiently transfected HEK cells were stimulated with 10 Î¼M ATP for different time intervals from 0 to 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). Immunoblotting with the anti-phospho-serine antibody revealed low levels of phosphorylation of Ser<sup>801</sup> at 0 min, which increased by 1 min and reached a peak 15 min after treatment with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F) before decreasing to baseline (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>801</sup> Does Not Alter PC2 Localization in MDCK I Cells</title>
        <p>PC2 has been shown to function in several subcellular compartments, and its localization can be dynamically regulated by phosphorylation at two residues, Ser<sup>812</sup> and Ser<sup>76</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Kottgen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Streets <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

        <p>To investigate the effect of Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation on PC2 localization in polarized epithelia, we generated MDCK I clones stably expressing epitope-tagged wild-type or Ser<sup>801</sup> PC2 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). These cells showed low to absent basal HA-PC2 expression that was significantly induced by tetracycline. Staining for a variety of junctional proteins revealed no alterations in desmosomal (desmoplakin), adherens junction (E-cadherin), or tight junction (zona occludens-1) protein localization in the MDCK I FRT parent line or in the TR expression clones (data not shown). Unexpectedly, we could not detect primary cilia in these cells using an antibody to acetylated Î±-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The lack of cilia expression clearly related to its parental origin (MDCK I) rather than further selection because MDCK II cells clearly expressed primary cilia whereas MDCK I cells do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). In these cells, wild-type HA-PC2 localized completely with the ER protein calnexin with no detectable basolateral surface staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Mutagenesis of Ser<sup>801</sup> to glycine or aspartate did not alter PC2 ER localization in these cells. In transiently transfected MDCK II cells, wild-type HA-PC2 localized to primary cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Mutagenesis of Ser<sup>801</sup> to glycine or aspartate did not alter PC2 cilial localization in these cells.</p>

(A) Top, immunofluorescence of stably transfected MDCK cells. Expression of HA-tagged PC2 (red) was induced by the addition of 1 Î¼g/ml tetracycline for 24 h. All lines showed clear inducible expression of PC2. Bar, 25 Î¼m). Bottom, Western blotting demonstrates that protein expression of PC2 and Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation mutants were equally induced in the presence of 1 Î¼g/ml tetracycline for 24 h. Equal loading was confirmed using calnexin as a control. (B) Immunofluorescence was carried out on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed MDCK cells. Top, staining for primary cilia with an antibody to acetylated tubulin in cells grown to 5 d postconfluence on filters. MDCK II expressed well-developed primary cilia but MDCK I and MDCK I FRT showed no detectable primary cilia. Bottom, subcellular localization of PC2 in MDCK cells was not altered after mutation of Ser<sup>801</sup> to either glycine (phospho-deficient) or aspartic acid (phospho-mimic). PC2 (green) was predominantly localized to the ER where it colocalized with calnexin (red). (C) Immunofluorescence was carried out on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed MDCK II cells transiently transfected with either wild-type PC2, S<sup>801G</sup>, or S<sup>801D</sup> mutants. Staining for primary cilia with an antibody to acetylated tubulin in cells grown to 5 d postconfluence on filters showed that MDCK II expressed well-developed primary cilia. Cilial localization of PC2 in MDCK II cells was not altered after mutation of Ser<sup>801</sup> to either glycine (phospho-deficient) or aspartic acid (phospho-mimic). (D) Immunoblot detection with an antibody to HA-PC2 showed that under nonreducing conditions, PC2 forms two higher molecular weight oligomers. Mutation of Ser<sup>801</sup> had no effect on PC2 oligomerization. (E) HEK cells were cotransfected with PC1-FLAG and PC2-Ser<sup>801G</sup>-pkTag. The blots represent protein immunoprecipitated from 0.5 mg of transient transfected HEK-293 total cell lysate by epitope-tagged (FLAG, or Pk) antibodies. Immunoblot detection with 7e12 (for PC1) or pkTag (for PC2) shows that polycystin complex formation was not disrupted by the S<sup>801G</sup> mutation. (F) The proliferation rate of mock transfected MDCK cells or cells expressing PC2 or a Ser<sup>801</sup> phospho-deficient or phospho-mimic mutation was compared using a BrdU ELISA assay (Roche Diagnostics). There was a significant decrease in proliferation in cells expressing PC2 (n = 9). An asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.02). (G) The percentage increase in cells entering S/G2 phase of the cell cycle was significantly reduced after 24-h serum stimulation in cells expressing both PC2 and a Ser<sup>801</sup> phospho-mimic mutation (n = 9). An asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.05).

In agreement with previous studies, we observed that MDCK I cells expressing PC2 or a phosphomimic Ser<sup>801</sup> mutant proliferated more slowly than control cells using a BrDU incorporation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F). This effect was lost in cells expressing the S<sup>801G</sup> mutant protein. These findings were complimented by FACS cell cycle analysis. We observed a significant decrease in cells entering the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle after serum stimulation in MDCK I cells expressing PC2 or a phosphomimic Ser<sup>801</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>G). In contrast, MDCK I cells transfected with a PKD2 shRNA to knockdown endogenous PC2 showed a significant increase in the number of cells entering S/G2 compared with mock shRNA or control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>H). Unlike the effect on proliferation, PC2 expression had no effect on basal apoptosis as measured by an FACS-based assay. Similarly, no difference in apoptosis induced by ceramide or staurosporine was observed among PC2, Ser<sup>801</sup> mutant, and control cells (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Polycystin-2 Phosphorylation at Ser<sup>801</sup> Regulates ATP-induced Calcium Release</title>
        <p>Phosphorylation of PC2 at Ser<sup>812</sup> by CK2 has been reported to regulate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of its channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the activation of purinergic receptors by ATP is able to stimulate ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through PC2 channels in an inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>)-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Gallagher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Giamarchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). This has been confirmed in a recent study that reported a functional interaction between the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor and PC2 in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Sammels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). We therefore used Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging assays to investigate whether Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation could alter channel activity in our MDCK I cell lines.</p>
        <p>Induction of wild-type PC2 resulted in enhanced amplitude and duration of ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores compared with uninduced or control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Mutation of Ser<sup>801</sup> to glycine resulted in loss of this enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, whereas the phosphomimic S<sup>801D</sup> mutation had the same ATP response as wild-type PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this study, we have identified Ser<sup>801</sup> as a previously unrecognized PrKD phosphorylation site in PC2/TRPP2 that is critical for its function as an ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel and in mediating downstream effects on cell proliferation. Previous studies had identified functional phosphorylation sites on PC2 at Ser<sup>76</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Streets <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and Ser<sup>812</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Ser<sup>801</sup> represents the third functional residue to be identified in PC2.</p>
      <p>Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>801</sup> was shown experimentally to be mediated by PrKD or PKCÎ¼. In silico analysis of the sequence inclusive of and surrounding Ser<sup>801</sup> show that it perfectly conforms to a PrKD recognition consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Nishikawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Its evolutionary conservation to teleosts further indicates its likely functional importance in kidney morphogenesis. We have also demonstrated that a pathogenic PKD2 mutation (S<sup>804N</sup>) within the PrKD recognition sequence abolishes Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation, indicating its likely physiological significance.</p>
      <p>PrKD is a highly versatile protein kinase that is predominantly located in the cytoplasm but can be recruited to perform distinct functions in various cellular compartments (e.g., plasma membrane, nucleus, Golgi, mitochondria) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Rykx <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). PrKD is recruited to the plasma membrane by locally generated diacylglycerol where it is activated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation (mainly novel isoforms). In other organelles, alternative activation pathways (such as nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, GÎ²Î³ subunit binding and caspase cleavage) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Wang, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>PrKD has low constitutive activity but is known to be activated after growth factor stimulation in many different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Rozengurt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Wang, 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, phosphorylation of Ser<sup>801</sup> was significantly increased by serum and EGF stimulation in our study. In a previous article, EGF was reported to inhibit plasma membrane PC2 channel activity through a phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate-dependent mechanism independent of PC2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The phosphorylation-dependent regulation of channel activity that we describe thus represents a distinct mechanism for EGF in regulating function of the PC2 ER channel. EGF itself did not directly stimulate ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in our assays (data not shown). Nonetheless, the time course of these events is very different (seconds vs. minutes to hours), suggesting that EGF or serum stimulation is permissive for PC2 channel activity. Similarly, ATP stimulated Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation over a similar time course to EGF, but this effect is clearly different to its acute effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p>
      <p>Activation of PrKD by PKC-dependent phosphorylation of activation loop serines within the kinase domain is its major mode of activation, although PKC-independent activation also has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Brandlin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Lemonnier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The inability of the PKC inhibitor GÃ¶6983 to block Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation in our study may indicate that PrKD is activated independently of PKC. Future work will seek to examine the regulation of this pathway in more detail.</p>
      <p>Our results also provide an alternative explanation for the link between growth factor stimulation and PC2 activity in the regulation of cell proliferation in MDCK I cells. Pkd2 heterozygous kidneys display a significantly increased basal and stimulated tubular proliferative index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Prasad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and PC2 overexpression has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and morphogenesis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Grimm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Our results are consistent with these observations but extend them by showing the dependence of these effects on Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation. The effect seemed to be specific because there was no alteration in basal or stimulated apoptosis. A recent article has suggested that PC2 mediates a passive ER channel leak and that PC2 dosage could regulate sensitivity to certain apoptotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Wegierski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). We were unable to reproduce these findings in MDCK I cells. An unexpected finding was that MDCK I cells do not express primary cilia. It remains to be determined whether Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation of PC2 similarly controls cell growth in ciliated cells. Certainly, it does not alter the cilia localization of exogenous PC2 in MDCK II cells.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that PC2 can function as an ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel but did not distinguish between cilia-dependent and independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Koulen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). By using MDCK I cells that lack cilia, we were able to study ER channel activity in isolation from cilia-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. MDCK I cells are thought to be of cortical collecting duct cell origin based on their high electrical resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Barker and Simmons, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Richardson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981</xref>). In addition, they also can spontaneously initiate tubulogenesis in 3-D culture, unlike MDCK II cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hellman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, this is the first report of a difference in primary cilia expression between MDCK I and II cells.</p>
      <p>We confirmed previous studies showing that PC2 mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER can be stimulated by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Gallagher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Giamarchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Ser<sup>801</sup> lies in the linker region between a predicted EF-hand domain and the recently reported coiled-coil domain essential for C-terminal homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Giamarchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Phosphorylation at Ser<sup>801</sup> seems to be permissive for this activity without altering the subcellular localization nor homophilic and heterophilic (with PC1) interactions of wild-type PC2. This function seems to be distinct from that of Ser<sup>812</sup> phosphorylation that regulates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of PC2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, possibly through regulating PC2âIP<sub>3</sub> receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Koulen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Sammels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Perhaps Ser<sup>801</sup> phosphorylation may alter the conformation of this region to bind other regulatory proteins necessary for PC2 function. Future work will seek to investigate this possibility.</p>
