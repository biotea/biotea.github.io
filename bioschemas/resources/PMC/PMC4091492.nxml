          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (MECR) is involved in mitochondrial synthesis of fatty acids and is highly expressed in mitochondria. MECR is also known as nuclear receptor binding factor-1, which was originally reported with yeast two-hybrid screening as a binding protein of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± (PPARÎ±). However, MECR and PPARÎ± are localized at different compartment, mitochondria, and the nucleus, respectively. Therefore, the presence of a cytosolic or nuclear isoform of MECR is necessary for functional interaction between MECR and PPARÎ±.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>To identify the expression pattern of MECR and the cytosolic form of MECR (cMECR), we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with various tissue samples from Sprague-Dawley rats. To confirm the interaction between cMECR and PPARÎ±, we performed several binding assays such as yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. To observe subcellular localization of these proteins, immunocytochemistry was performed. A luciferase assay was used to measure PPARÎ± activity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We provide evidence of an alternatively spliced variant of the rat MECR gene that yields cMECR. The cMECR lacks the N-terminal 76 amino acids of MECR and shows uniform distribution in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HeLa cells. cMECR directly bound PPARÎ± in the nucleus and increased PPARÎ±-dependent luciferase activity in HeLa cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>We found the cytosolic form of MECR (cMECR) was expressed in the cytosolic and/or nuclear region, directly binds with PPARÎ±, and enhances PPARÎ± activity.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Mammalian mitochondria perform nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis (FAS) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This mitochondrial FAS pathway resembles the well-understood bacterial FAS II pathway [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (MECR) is a component of the mitochondrial FAS II pathway and catalyzes the fatty acid elongation cycle in the last step, which is the NADPH-dependent reduction of the enoyl-acyl carrier protein substrate [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. MECR is primarily localized in mitochondria [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and the N-terminal amino acids of this protein are important for its mitochondrial localization [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. MECR is also known as nuclear receptor binding factor-1 (NRBF-1) because, using yeast two-hybrid screening, it was identified as a binding protein of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± (PPARÎ±) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the biological meaning of the interaction between MECR and PPARÎ± has not been determined.</p>
      <p>PPARÎ± is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is one of three different PPAR subtypes: PPARÎ±, PPARÎ²/Î´, and PPARÎ³. The PPARs play important roles in nutrient homeostasis [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and are localized in the nucleus. Although MECR was previously reported as a binding protein of PPARÎ± [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], interaction between MECR and PPARÎ± seems not to occur in mammalian cells due to their different subcellular localizations, mitochondria and the nucleus, respectively. Therefore, the presence of a cytosolic or nuclear isoform of MECR is necessary for functional interaction between MECR and PPARÎ± in the nuclei of cells.</p>
      <p>Here, we analyzed the expression pattern of MECR in several rat tissues and found a novel splice variant of MECR in which an additional exon was inserted between exon 1 and exon 2. The protein generated from this splicing variant has an N-terminal region that does not contain the mitochondrial targeting signal peptide and thus is not localized in mitochondria. Moreover, this MECR variant bound PPARÎ± in the nucleus and enhanced PPARÎ± transcriptional activity. Based on these results, we propose that this novel variant of MECR, cytosolic MECR (cMECR), plays a role in intracellular signal pathways as an interacting partner of PPARÎ±.</p>

        <title>RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</title>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted from tissues of male Sprague-Dawley rats (14 weeks old) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (1 Âµg) from each sample was reverse transcribed using random primers (50 pmol), SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), and dNTPs (1 mM) at 42â for 1 hour. The forward primer (5'-ATGTTGGTCAGCCGGCGACT-3') and reverse primer (5'-TCACATAGTGAGAATCTGCT-3') were designed to amplify full-length MECR. Additional primers were used for specific detection of MECR and cMECR cDNA: forward primer (5'-GTGCTGGAAGCGGCATGTTG-3') and reverse primer (5'-TGAGCTCCAGGTTCTTCAGT-3'). cMECR and PPARÎ± fragments were amplified under the following cycle conditions: denaturation at 94â for 30 seconds, annealing at 55â for 30 seconds, and extension at 72â for 30 seconds. This cycle was repeated 35 times. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragments were also amplified under the same conditions except that 25 cycles were run. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were analyzed with 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The recombinant plasmids were sequenced.</p>

        <title>Construction of plasmids and antibodies</title>
        <p>The rat full-length MECR (GenBank accession no. AB015724), cytosolic variant of MECR, and PPARÎ± (GenBank accession no. NM_001001928) were cloned using the Gateway Cloning System (Invitrogen) as previously described [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. After amplification of the three genes, PCR products were cloned into the pDONR207 vector and then subcloned into self-constructed destination vectors such as pDS_XB-HA, pDs_XB-Flag, pDS_XB-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and pDS_XB-mCherry expression vectors. Anti-Flag (F6531) antibody was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Anti-EGFP (B-2) and antihemagglutinin (anti-HA) (F-7) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).</p>

        <title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
        <p>HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37â. When needed, cells were seeded onto cover slips for imaging analysis or 60-mm dishes for preparation of lysates for Western blot analysis. Transfection of expression vectors was performed with lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were cultured for an additional 24 hours in growth medium and then used for further analysis.</p>

        <title>Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis</title>
        <p>Transfected cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1% NP-40) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Whole-cell lysates were incubated on ice for 30 minutes and then cleared at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4â. The immune complexes were incubated for 1 hour at 4â with gentle rotation with 20 ÂµL protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that had been prewashed and suspended in 100 mL cold lysis buffer. The samples were washed three times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer and eluted in 20 ÂµL sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. The proteins were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (20 mM Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5) at room temperature for 20 minutes and incubated overnight at 4â with anti-GFP antibody (1:1,000), anti-HA antibody (1:1,000), or anti-FLAG antibody (1:1,000). Blots were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1: 3,000), followed by washing and detection of immunoreactivity with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA).</p>

        <p>Subcellular distribution of MECR, cMECR, and PPARÎ± were confirmed according to the EGFP and mCherry fluorescence detection method with a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For imaging analysis, cells were plated onto glass cover slips. After transfection, the cells were grown for 24 hours and treated with the mitochondrion-selective fluorescent dye mito-tracker red CMXRos (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

        <title>Yeast two-hybrid assay</title>
        <p>cMECR was cloned into pGADT7 encoding the activation domain, and PPARÎ± was ligated into pGBKT7 encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain. To evaluate the protein-protein interaction between cMECR and PPARÎ±, both pGAD-cMECR and pGBK-PPARÎ± were cotransformed into the yeast strain AH109. This strain is unable to synthesize histidine. However, interaction between cMECR and PPARÎ± enables the yeast to make the His3 enzyme, thereby permitting histidine biosynthesis and growth on His minimal medium.</p>

        <p>HeLa cells were plated at a density of 1.0 to 1.5Ã10<sup>5</sup> cells per well onto six-well dishes. Twenty-four hours later, cells were cotransfected with 1 Âµg of PPAR responsive element (PPRE)-3x-TK-Luc, the firefly luciferase reporter gene containing PPRE; 0.2 Âµg of the PPARÎ± expression vector; and either the MECR expression vector or cMECR expression vector. Transfections were accomplished with lipofectamine 2,000 reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The PPRE-3x-TK-Luc plasmid includes three PPREs upstream of an inducible thymidine kinase promoter controlling transcription of the firefly luciferase gene. Cells were harvested 24 hours after the start of exposure to vehicle or inducing agent. Luciferase assays were performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol.</p>

        <title>Identification of a novel alternative transcript variant of MECR</title>
        <p>During reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of MECR expression in the rat brain, two different MECR transcripts were detected. One was the expected MECR mRNA (210 bp), which corresponds to the known MECR mRNA (GenBank accession no. AB015724). The other was a longer 306-bp PCR fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Because PCR was carried out with specific primers corresponding to exons 1 and 2 of rat MECR cDNA, alternative splicing was proposed to account for the presence of this fragment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> shows the 10 exons of rat MECR cDNA. The novel MECR variant has an additional 96 nucleotides between exon 1 and exon 2. Basic local alignment search tool analysis of the aligned sequences of rat genomic DNA (chromosome 5 genomic contig NW_047784) and cDNA of this MECR variant showed that the flanking nucleotides of convergent points between exon 1 and exon 2 followed the GT/AG rule of alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). This addition of 96 nucleotides generated a frame-shifted MECR, and the N-terminal 76 amino acids were deleted by use of another start codon in exon 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Because this splice variant lacked the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences, we named it cMECR.</p>
        <p>Next, to compare expression of cMECR and MECR, RT-PCR analyses were done using RNA samples from eight different tissues with a specific primer set as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, cMECR (306 bp) and MECR (210 bp) were ubiquitously expressed in most tissues examined, although the expression level of cMECR was lower than that of MECR. Furthermore, we found amino acid sequences of human MECR isoform 2 (GenBank accession no. NP001019903.1) were well matched with that of rat cMECR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). These data raise the possibility that cMECR can be produced in other species.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>cMECR localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HeLa cells</title>
        <p>To visualize the intracellular distribution of MECR in HEK cells, we generated two constructs containing EGFP-tagged full-length rat MECR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, when EGFP was tagged to the C-terminal end of MECR (MECR-EGFP), this protein was distinctly expressed in mitochondria, as previously reported [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the N-terminal EGFP-tagged MECR (EGFP-MECR) was diffusely expressed in the cytoplasm of HEK cells. N-terminal tagging of the protein with EGFP might have disrupted the proper mitochondrial localization of MECR, perhaps because the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence of MECR was masked by the EGFP. These results suggest that N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences are critical for mitochondrial localization of MECR proteins.</p>
        <p>Because cMECR lacks the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting
sequences, the intracellular distribution of this protein was unclear. The intracellular distribution of MECR and cMECR was thus compared by tagging both cDNAs with EGFP at their C-terminal ends and then transiently expressing them in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). MECR-EGFP showed a well-defined punctate pattern that clearly colocalized with mito tracker, a marker of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, cMECR-EGFP was expressed in cytosolic and nuclear regions and did not colocalize
with Mito tracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

        <title>cMECR directly interacts with PPARÎ±</title>
        <p>MECR, also known as NRBF-1, was previously identified with yeast two-hybrid screening as a PPARÎ±-interacting protein [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], although explaining how mitochondrial-targeted MECR interacted with the nuclear hormone receptor PPARÎ± was difficult. In contrast to MECR, cMECR was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HeLa cells, and its amino acid sequence is exactly the same as that of MECR, except for the N-terminal 76 amino acids that compose the mitochondrial targeting sequence. Thus, cMECR, rather than mitochondrial MECR, could interact with PPARÎ± in the nucleus. Indeed, the yeast two-hybrid assay showed a direct interaction between cMECR and PPARÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Immunoprecipitation and colocalization analyses also showed that cMECR interacted with PPARÎ± in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Furthermore, cMECR-EGFP colocalized with mCherry-tagged PPARÎ± in the nucleus of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). In contrast, wild-type MECR was not colocalized with PPARÎ± in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly indicate that cMECR, but not MECR, is a bona fide binding partner of PPARÎ±.</p>

        <title>cMECR binds with PPARÎ± in the nucleus and potentiates PPARÎ± activity</title>
        <p>To more clearly investigate whether the interaction between cMECR and PPARÎ± can occur in the nucleus of HeLa cells, we performed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiment. The BiFC assay provides a direct approach for the visualization of molecular interactions in living cells [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We constructed the N-terminal part of venus plasmids tagged to cMECR (cMECR-VN) and the C-terminal portion of venus plasmids tagged to PPARÎ± (VC-PPARÎ±) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consistent with the immunoprecipitation and colocalization analyses, the BiFC experiment also indicated protein-protein interaction between cMECR and PPARÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Only when both constructs were cotransfected was the BiFC signal seen in the nucleus of HeLa cells. Individual constructs (cMECR-VN or VC-PPARÎ±) did not produce fluorescence alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results imply that cMECR interacts with PPARÎ± in the nucleus of HeLa cells.</p>
        <p>cMECR interacts with PPARÎ±, a well-known nuclear hormone receptor. Thus, to examine whether cMECR can modulate PPARÎ± activity, we transfected cMECR into HeLa cells together with PPARÎ± and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a PPAR-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Compared with cells transfected with PPARÎ± only, PPAR-dependent luciferase expression levels were significantly increased in the presence of cMECR. These results indicate that cMECR can act as a coactivator of PPARÎ± in the nucleus of HeLa cells.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>MECR has been reported to be a mitochondrial protein [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction of trans-2-enoyl thioesters to the corresponding saturated acyl thioesters [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, NRBF-1 (also known as MECR) was originally identified as a binding protein of the nuclear receptor PPARÎ± [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In that paper, the authors did not perform any assessment of endogenous binding in cells or report the biological meaning of this protein-protein interaction, although NRBF-1 binds with PPARÎ± in the yeast two-hybrid system.</p>
      <p>Here, we report a cMECR that is generated by alternative splicing. cMECR is an N-terminal-76-amino-acid truncated isoform of MECR. Because mitochondrial targeting signal sequences are contained between amino acids 1 and 53 of MECR [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], cMECR lacks this mitochondrial targeting signal sequence and was preferentially localizes to cytosolic and nuclear regions and was not present in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In addition, our data show that N-terminal EGFP-tagged MECR also lost its proper intracellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, the N-terminal region of MECR is critical for mitochondrial localization of the MECR protein.</p>
      <p>Different intracellular distribution of cMECR strongly implies that its biological functions differ from the functions of MECR. In addition, cMECR mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in eigh<italic>t</italic> tested tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), implying that cMECR could perform common essential functions in the various tissues. Although further studies should be performed to elucidate the function(s) of cMECR, we present its first function in this study. Various nuclear receptors activate transcription of their target genes through interactions with coactivators or corepressors [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Like other coactivators, cMECR directly bound PPARÎ± in the nucleus and potentiated PPARÎ² activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>Generally, PPARÎ± is found in tissues where fatty acid metabolism is important and regulates genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism as well as glucose homeostasis [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Because cMECR potentiates PPARÎ± activity in HeLa cells, cMECR could be involved in these biological phenomena. An earlier study used the yeast two-hybrid assay and demonstrated that MECR (NRBF-1) also interacts with various nuclear hormone receptors such as TRÎ², RARÎ±, RXRÎ±, and HNF-4 [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because our data strongly support the idea that cMECR is a bona fide binding partner of PPARÎ± and its amino acid sequence is the same as that of MECR except that it lacks the N-terminal 76 amino acids, cMECR might also bind with other nuclear hormone receptors. This possibility should be tested in future studies.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results suggest that cMECR, a novel alternatively spliced variant of MECR, directly interacts with PPARÎ± in the nucleus and could be a positive regulator in the physiological regulation of PPARÎ±.</p>

        <p>Subcellular localization of mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (MECR) and cytosolic form of MERC (cMECR) in HeLa cells. (A) The two constructs used in this study: MECR and cMECR were tagged at the C-terminus with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP; green oval). The black box in MECR indicates the mitochondrial targeting domain. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with (B) MECR-EGFP or (C) cMECR-EGFP and then stained with Mito Tracker, a mitochondrial marker (red). Scale bar=20 Âµm.</p>
