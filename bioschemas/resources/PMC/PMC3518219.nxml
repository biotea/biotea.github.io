        <p>The kinesin KIF14 associates with the PDZ domain of Radil and negatively regulates Rap1-mediated inside-out integrin activation by tethering Radil on microtubules.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The small GTPase Rap1 regulates inside-out integrin activation and thereby influences cell adhesion, migration, and polarity. Several Rap1 effectors have been described to mediate the cellular effects of Rap1 in a context-dependent manner. Radil is emerging as an important Rap effector implicated in cell spreading and migration, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its functions are unclear. We report here that the kinesin KIF14 associates with the PDZ domain of Radil and negatively regulates Rap1-mediated inside-out integrin activation by tethering Radil on microtubules. The depletion of KIF14 led to increased cell spreading, altered focal adhesion dynamics, and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. We also show that Radil is important for breast cancer cell proliferation and for metastasis in mice. Our findings provide evidence that the concurrent up-regulation of Rap1 activity and increased KIF14 levels in several cancers is needed to reach optimal levels of Rap1âRadil signaling, integrin activation, and cellâmatrix adhesiveness required for tumor progression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The small G-protein Rap1 is an important mediator of integrin inside-out signaling, which plays a pivotal role in adhesion, spreading, and migration of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arthur et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kinashi and Katagiri, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bos, 2005</xref>). Rap1 acts as a molecular switch that cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states. Rap1 activity is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Epac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Rooij et al., 1998</xref>) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) such as Rap1GAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rubinfeld et al., 1991</xref>). Upon activation, Rap1 has the ability to increase the affinity of integrins for their extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands and to promote their clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sebzda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). In recent years the identification and characterization of downstream Rap effector proteins such as RIAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>), RapL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Katagiri et al., 2003</xref>), Krit1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glading et al., 2007</xref>), AF-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boettner et al., 2000</xref>), and Radil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Smolen et al., 2007</xref>) have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular effects mediated by Rap1. We previously identified the Rap1 effector Radil as a protein associating with GÎ²Î³ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>). Radil was found to be required for the Rap1a-mediated inside-out activation of integrins, adhesion, and spreading of human fibrosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>). Radil is also known to have important functions in Epac1-mediated spreading of lung carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ross et al., 2011</xref>) and to be indispensable for the migration of neural crest cells during zebrafish development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Smolen et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The control of cellâmatrix adhesion plays a fundamental role in controlling cancer cell migration during metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McLean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arjonen et al., 2011</xref>). The implication of Rap1 signaling in the modulation of integrin activity has thus provided a framework to study its implication in tumor progression. Both hyper-activation as well as decreased Rap1 activity is known to affect the migration of breast, melanoma, and prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). This highlights that precise control of cellular adhesion by Rap1 and its effectors is required for efficient cell movements. This requirement for the fine-tuning of Rap1-mediated inside-out signaling for optimal control of cellâmatrix adhesion implies the existence of positive and negative mechanisms of regulation. Although how Rap1 leads to integrin inside-out activation is becoming better defined, the identification of mechanisms buffering or negatively impinging this process is not well understood. Such regulators may be especially relevant in the context of aggressive cancer cells to optimally adjust Rap1 activity where it is known to be elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lorenowicz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lyle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freeman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>Kinesins are molecular motors associated with intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Verhey and Hammond, 2009</xref>). Kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) are important molecular motors that transport various cargoes along microtubules tracks. Several kinesins have been implicated in cancer progression due to their role in mitotic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huszar et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, kinesins were uncovered as playing important regulatory roles in adhesion and migration of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Uchiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Blocking kinesin-1 activity using inactivating antibodies was also shown to lead to increase in the size and number of substrate adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaverina et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Krylyshkina et al., 2002</xref>). Although the precise mechanisms are unclear, kinesins were suggested to control the delivery of factors at adhesion sites to retard their growth or promote their disassembly. KIF14 was initially characterized as a protein involved in cytokinesis by interacting with protein-regulating cytokinesis-1 (PRC1) and Citron kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gruneberg et al., 2006</xref>). KIF14 was also demonstrated to be highly up-regulated in several cancers including retinoblastomas, breast cancers, lung cancers, and ovarian cancers and its high expression levels has been clinically correlated with increased breast cancer invasiveness and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corson et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corson and Gallie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">ThÃ©riault et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>We previously established that the C-terminal PDZ domain of Radil was critical for its function, but the identity of the protein(s) binding to the Radil PDZ domain and how it contributed to Rap1âRadil signaling was, however, not addressed. PDZ domains are present in many scaffolding proteins and are involved in the organization of multi-protein complexes important for numerous biological processes including cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fanning and Anderson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Harris and Lim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sheng and Sala, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Humbert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim and Sheng, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ludford-Menting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Meerschaert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Radziwill et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baumgartner et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we use an integrative proteomic approach based on phage display and mass spectrometry to identify KIF14 as a novel PDZ-binding protein that interacts with Radil. Our results describe KIF14 as a negative regulator of Rap1âRadil-mediated signaling and uncover an essential role for Radil in breast cancer progression.</p>

        <title>Radil associates with kinesin family protein 14 (KIF14)</title>
        <p>To gain further insights into Radil function and regulation, we set out to identify proteins interacting with its C-terminal PDZ domain. We first used a phage display approach to define the preferred C-terminal peptides recognized by the Radil PDZ domain. We panned a phage-displayed peptide library with a recombinant Radil PDZ domain fused to GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and repeated multiple rounds of binding selection. Binding phages were isolated and the sequences of the displayed peptides were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The analysis of the 25 best binding sequences revealed that the Radil PDZ domain recognizes hydrophobic C-terminal ligands with a strong consensus to the sequence [FI]-[FWT]-WV for the last four amino acids as represented by the motif enrichment diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>. Most PDZ domains prefer ligands containing either S/T (class I) or hydrophobic amino acids (class II) at the â2 position (third residue from the end; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tonikian et al., 2008</xref>). Radil appears to contain an atypical PDZ domain because it can bind to both ligands classes. Because the Radil PDZ domain can accommodate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues at the â2 position, we performed a BLAST search against the Swiss-Prot human proteome database to assemble a list of natural proteins with C termini matching the consensus sequence [FI]-x-WV. We compared this list of putative Radil PDZ domain ligands to a list of proteins that we identified in FLAG-Radil complexes using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206051/DC1" id="supp1">Table S1</ext-link>), and we found that KIF14 was present in both lists. Consistent with a physical association between these proteins, the immunoprecipitation of Radil from HEK293T cells led to the coprecipitation of KIF14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The phage display results suggest that KIF14 binds to the PDZ domain of Radil. To confirm this result in a cellular context, lysates from control HEK293T or from cells stably expressing Strep-HA-Radil or Strep-HA-RadilÎPDZ were subjected to affinity purification using Sepharose-streptavidin followed by Western blotting using antibodies specific to KIF14. Whereas endogenous KIF14 copurifies with full-length Radil, it is absent in control or RadilÎPDZ affinity-purified samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, compare lane 2 with lanes 1 and 3). To validate that KIF14 interacts with Radil via its atypical PDZ binding motif, we coexpressed Strep-HA-Radil with wild-type KIF14 or a mutant KIF14-IQAA in which the C-terminal tryptophan and valine were substituted with alanine residues, and we assessed their interaction by affinity purification. Although wild-type KIF14 associates with Radil, KIF14-IQAA does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 3). To also test for the specificity of the Radil-KIF14 interaction we performed affinity purification of Radil and blotted for the unrelated kinesin family protein KIF7 and showed that these proteins do not interact (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206051/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). We also showed that KIF14 does not interact with AF-6, which is closely related to Radil in terms of domain architecture and also possesses a C-terminal PDZ domain whose sequence is 33% identical and 53% homologous to the PDZ domain of Radil (Fig. S1, B and C). To determine if the interaction between KIF14 and Radil is direct, we performed in vitro binding experiments using recombinant proteins. Although the recombinant C-terminal domain of wild-type KIF14 binds to the PDZ domain of Radil, the IQAA mutant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, compare lane 8 and 10). From these experiments we conclude that Radil and KIF14 directly associate through a PDZ domainâligand interaction.</p>

            <p><bold>KIF14 interacts with the Radil PDZ domain.</bold> (A) Recombinant GST-RadilPDZ domain was used as bait in phage display selections using a library of random heptapeptides. 25 unique binding peptides were recovered from the screen and analyzed using a sequence logo generator to identify the preferred binding sequence. The resulting C-terminal binding motif [FI]-x-WV was searched against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot human database; and the C termini of five proteins were found to match this sequence.

Lysates from HEK293T cells stably expressing Strep-HA-Radil or Strep-HA-RadilÎPDZ were affinity purified (AP) using streptavidin Sepharose followed by WB using Î±-HA or Î±-KIF14 antibodies. (D) The KIF14 PDZ ligand is required to bind to Radil. HEK293T cells stably expressing Strep-HA-Radil were transiently transfected with eGFP-KIF14 wild-type (wt) or eGFP-KIF14-IQAA (WVâAA mutant) constructs. Lysates were subjected to AP with streptavidin beads followed by Western blotting with Î±-KIF14 and Î±-HA antibodies. (E) Radil binds to KIF14 directly. Recombinant GST-RadilPDZ was incubated with purified FLAG-tagged KIF14-ctail (wild-type or IQAA mutant) that were immobilized on FLAG-M2 beads.

        <title>Radil localizes with KIF14 on the microtubule network</title>
        <p>Kinesins are ATP-consuming motor proteins that travel along the microtubule network to deliver proteins or organelles as cargo to different cellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Verhey and Hammond, 2009</xref>). We hypothesized that Radil could associate with microtubules through its binding to KIF14. To address this we used confocal microscopy to study the subcellular localizations of Radil and KIF14 in interphase cells. The strong colocalization of KIF14 with Î²-tubulin and acetyl-tubulin validates the presence of KIF14 on microtubules (Fig. S1 D). When coexpressed in HEK293T cells, mCherry-Radil and eGFP-KIF14 colocalize on microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, aâc). The mutant KIF14-IQAA also localizes on microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, e) but fails to recruit Radil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, dâf). Similarly, RadilÎPDZ does not colocalize with KIF14 on microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, gâi). To support these findings, we performed microtubule sedimentation experiments from MDA-MB-231 cells to determine the subcellular localization relationship of endogenous Radil and KIF14. In cells expressing scrambled shRNAs, KIF14 and Radil cosediment with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Sedimentation of KIF14 with microtubules is not affected when Radilâs levels are reduced using shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and Fig. S1 E), but knockdown of KIF14 inhibits the sedimentation of Radil in microtubule fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and Fig. S1 F). We conclude that KIF14 recruits Radil to the microtubule network through a physical association.</p>

        <title>KIF14 negatively regulates Radil function in cell spreading</title>
        <p>KIF14 was first identified as an oncogene in retinoblastoma and is overexpressed in several cancers. Interestingly, KIF14 is highly overexpressed in breast tumors and its expression correlates with a worst outcome of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corson and Gallie, 2006</xref>). We extended these data by measuring KIF14 levels using qPCR in 103 individual primary breast tumors and show that KIF14 expression is increased on average 12.32-fold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206051/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). In contrast, <italic>Radil</italic> mRNA expression remains unchanged among different tumor grades (unpublished data). We could not evaluate KIF14 and Radil levels during breast cancer progression because we did not have access to the metastatic tissues, but elevated KIF14 expression in primary breast tumors is known to correlate with the severity and invasiveness of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corson and Gallie, 2006</xref>). High levels of KIF14 expression in many primary breast tumors and its correlation with breast cancer severity prompted us to measure its abundance in three different breast cancer cell lines. KIF14 expression was 1.6-, 5-, and 14-fold higher in the transformed MCF7, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, respectively, compared with normal breast tissues (Fig. S2 B). Interestingly, KIF14 expression in these cell lines appears to correlate with their migratory and invasive properties because MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells are poorly invasive compared with MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Meng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Naik et al., 2008</xref>). We established that the RadilâKIF14 complex exists in MDA-MB-231 cells using coimmunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). We also analyzed Radil and RadilÎPDZ protein complexes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells using mass spectrometry. As expected, several peptides corresponding to Rap1 and GÎ²Î³ subunits were identified in both wild-type Radil and RadilÎPDZ, but KIF14 peptides were only identified in Radil complexes. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206051/DC1" id="supp4">Table S2</ext-link>). These results confirm that KIF14 interacts with the PDZ domain of Radil and suggest that the RadilÎPDZ mutant is not grossly misfolded because it still interacts with most interactors but selectively lost the ability to bind KIF14. These observations led us to examine a potential functional role for Radil in breast cancer and test the possibility that KIF14 overexpression modulates Radil functions during tumorigenesis.</p>

        <p>Given the established role of Rap1aâRadil signaling in cell adhesion and spreading in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Smolen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ross et al., 2011</xref>), we next tested its requirement for MDA-MB-231 cell spreading. We validated two shRNAs (#4 and #206) that knock down <italic>Radil</italic> mRNA levels by more than 75% and that efficiently decrease Radil protein levels (Fig. S1 E). The depletion of Radil led to a marked impairment in the ability of cells to spread on fibronectin-coated coverslips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref> and Fig. S2 C), a phenotype similar to cells expressing Rap1GAP and therefore have low Rap1a activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Notably, 120 min after plating, most of the scrambled-shRNAâexpressing cells are fully spread, whereas Radil-depleted cells and Rap1GAP-expressing cells still exhibit a rounded morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, quantification of the rate of spreading in right panel). The Radil shRNA is on target because expressing a knockdown-resistant mouse Radil cDNA rescued the spreading defects induced by both shRNAs (Fig. S2 D). However, expression of mouse RadilÎPDZ could not rescue the spreading defects (Fig. S2 D). We conclude that Radil is required for ECM- and Rap1a-mediated spreading in breast cancer cells.</p>
        <p>Because KIF14 interacts physically with Radil we were interested to test whether it was important for cell spreading. After knockdown of KIF14 using shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref> and Fig. S1 F), MDA-MB-231 cells behave opposite to cells in which Radil was depleted, exhibiting increased spreading efficiency and accelerated kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, compare cell spreading at 45 min). Indeed, KIF14-depleted cells are on average three times the area of control shRNA-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, compare cells at 180 min and quantification on right panel). To explore the functional relationship between KIF14, Rap1a, and Radil, we asked if blocking Rap1a activity or decreasing Radil expression could modify the enhanced cell spreading phenotype manifest upon KIF14 depletion. Overexpression of Rap1GAP and depletion of Radil with shRNA both reversed the enhanced spreading phenotype of KIF14-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>, quantification in right panel). These findings indicate that KIF14 negatively regulates cell spreading by controlling Rap1aâRadil activity.</p>

        <title>KIF14 negatively regulates Rap1a- and Radil-dependent inside-out signaling</title>
        <p>Through the engagement of different effectors such as Radil, Rap1a regulates cell spreading by modulating inside-out signaling influencing integrin activation. Using the 9EG7 antibody that specifically recognizes activated Î²1-integrin, we show that Radil knockdown impairs integrin activation during spreading in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, quantification in B). We note that this is likely an underestimation because cells with efficient Radil knockdown have impaired adhesion and were washed off during the experiment. Consistent with the enhanced spreading phenotype, depletion of KIF14 leads to hyperactivation of Î²1-integrin when MDA-MB-231 cells are plated on fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). This results from increased Rap1a-dependent inside-out signaling because integrin activation returns to normal when Radil expression is reduced within KIF14 shRNA-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). We confirmed that the effects are due to change in integrins activation rather than expression because Î²1-integrin levels did not vary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p>

        <p>Integrin engagement by ECM proteins leads to their clustering and to the recruitment and activation of several proteins implicated in the ontogeny and maturation of focal contacts. Hence, we predicted that Radil- and KIF14-depleted cells would have altered focal contact properties given their defects in spreading and integrin activation. We thus visualized focal adhesions by imaging vinculin in cells expressing control, Radil, or KIF14 shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206051/DC1" id="supp7">Fig. S3, A and B</ext-link>), quantified their abundance and size in individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>), and calculated the average focal adhesion sizes in all the cells examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Knockdown of Radil results in cells with fewer and smaller focal contacts, whereas KIF14 depletion dramatically increases focal contact numbers and results in enlarged focal adhesions that are on average approximately twice the size of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C and E</xref>). After the stabilization of adhesion sites, F-actin is known to increase in density leading to formation of compact bundles of stress fiber, which in turn leads to focal adhesion maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gardel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Oakes et al., 2012</xref>). Predictably, hyperactivated integrin signaling and the presence of large mature focal adhesions observed in KIF14-depleted cells correlate with increased stress fiber formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>; Fig. S3, A and B). In all three staining conditions we also noted that Radil- as well as KIF14-depleted cells have unpolarized morphology when compared with control shRNA-infected cells. Presence of large focal adhesions is indicative of mature adhesion and suggests defective adhesion disassembly. To test this hypothesis we performed time-lapse imaging experiments to look at the dynamics of the focal adhesion marker Paxillin fused to Venus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Approximately 80% of adhesion foci in control cells displayed rapid and dynamic turnover of Venus-Paxillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206051/DC1" id="supp8">Video 1</ext-link>). On the other hand, KIF14-shRNAâexpressing cells exhibited stable and large focal adhesions that seldom disassembled over a period of approximately 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206051/DC1" id="supp9">Videos 2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206051/DC1" id="supp10">3</ext-link>).

        <title>KIF14 spatially restricts Radil from interacting with activated Rap1a</title>
        <p>Expression of the constitutively active Rap1a-Q63E mutant leads to plasma membrane recruitment of Radil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>). Having established that KIF14 negatively regulates inside-out signaling and recruits Radil on microtubules, we reasoned that Rap1a activity could modulate the recruitment of Radil on microtubules. Supporting this prediction, expressing the Rap1a-Q63E mutant leads to the dislodging of Radil from the microtubules and to its recruitment at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The release of Radil from microtubules in KIF14-shRNAâexpressing cells could thus explain the increased inside-out integrin signaling observed in these cells. We therefore monitored the localization of Radil in MDA-MB-231 cells while varying the levels of KIF14. Because they express high levels of KIF14, Radil is predominantly localized on microtubules in MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, c). Upon knockdown of KIF14, Radil is redistributed at the cell cortex, presumably at sites of Rap1a activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bivona et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li et al., 2009</xref>), whereas the localization of the control protein Dishevelled2 is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, compare b and d). Likewise, disrupting microtubule networks with nocodazole results in Radil redistribution at the cell periphery (Fig. S3 C). We also tested if Rap1 activity is affected in the knockdown conditions. Rap1-GTP pull-down assays did not reveal any change in Rap1 activity in KIF14-depleted cells compared with control cells but depletion of Radil leads to a slight decrease in Rap1 activity (Fig. S3 D). These observations suggest that KIF14 controls inside-out integrin activation by tethering the Rap1a effector Radil on microtubules and thereby spatially controlling Rap1 signaling.</p>

        <title>The tuning of Rap1aâRadil-mediated inside-out signaling is required for efficient breast cancer cell migration and invasion</title>
        <p>Both decreased or hyperactivated Rap1a or integrin signaling inhibit cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tsygankova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lyle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freeman et al., 2010</xref>). With this in mind, together with the known role of Radil in neural crest cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Smolen et al., 2007</xref>), we tested the requirement of Radil for the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Knockdown of Radil with two different shRNAs (#4 and #206) severely impairs the migratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>) and invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>) properties of these cells. Interestingly, depletion of KIF14 using two independent shRNAs (#816 and #817), which we show leads to hyperactivated Rap1âRadil signaling, also leads to decreased MDA-MB-231 cell migration and matrigel invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, D and E</xref>). Several lines of evidence support the specificity of the phenotypes that we observed. First we obtained similar results with two independent Radil and KIF14 shRNAs. Second, we were able to rescue the migration defects by expressing the RNAi-resistant mouse Radil cDNA or the eGFP-KIF14 coding sequence because the KIF14 shRNAs target the 3â² UTR region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, C and F</xref>). In contrast, expression of mouse RadilÎPDZ and eGFP-KIF14-IQAA mutants fails to rescue the cell migration defects associated with Radil and KIF14 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, C and F</xref>). From these findings we conclude that the optimal balance of Rap1aâRadil signaling controlled by KIF14 is required to sustain the efficient migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.</p>

        <p>It is well established that integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kuwada and Li, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cruet-Hennequart et al., 2003</xref>) and Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dao et al., 2009</xref>) as well as KIF14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gruneberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">ThÃ©riault et al., 2012</xref>) are also important during cell proliferation. We were therefore interested to determine if Radil controls the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Cells expressing Radil shRNA show 42.5% inhibition of cell proliferation when cultured in vitro for 4 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). We also assessed their growth in vivo by injecting cells expressing control or Radil shRNAs subcutaneously in nude mice. 31 d after injection, subcutaneous tumors from all mice were retrieved and their weights and volumes were measured. Radil shRNA-expressing tumors were on average 44% lighter than control shRNA-expressing tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, F and G</xref>; Fig. S4, A and B). We conclude that Radil is required during breast cancer progression by controlling cell proliferation and cell dissemination to the lungs.</p>

      <p>Our results identify the oncogene KIF14 as a negative regulator of Rap1aâRadil signaling. We provide evidence that KIF14 tethers Radil on microtubules and thereby controls inside-out integrin activation by tuning the availability of this Rap effector for binding Rap1-GTP at the plasma membrane. Because KIF14 is frequently up-regulated in several human cancers, this led us to study the role of Radil in cancer progression. Our data show that depletion of Radil and KIF14 using shRNAs affects the migratory and invasive properties of breast cancer cells in vitro. Using xenograft models, we further demonstrated the requirement of Radil for tumor cell proliferation and for the efficient dissemination of breast cancer cells to lungs.</p>
      <p>The regulation of Rap1âRadil signaling by KIF14 highlights the necessity for the fine regulation of integrin activation and cellâmatrix adhesion during cancer cell migration. Indeed, it is known that reduced and hyperactivated Rap1 signaling similarly lead to impaired cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lorenowicz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lyle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freeman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, we show that Radil- and KIF14-depleted cells that respectively exhibit impaired and hyperactivated integrin signaling do not migrate efficiently. In addition to increased spreading and reduced migration, KIF14-depleted cells have lost the polarized morphology that characterizes highly migratory cancer cells. We propose that the spatial control of Radil availability, controlled by microtubules and KIF14, enables rapid changes in localized Rap1âRadil signaling and integrin activation that are known to be critical for the regulation of cellâmatrix adhesion and the establishment of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arthur et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">GÃ©rard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Itoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jeon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freeman et al., 2010</xref>). The modulation of Rap1 signaling through the availability of Radil thus represents another regulatory step for the inside-out activation of integrins during breast cancer cells migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>, model). Although mechanisms differ, other Rap1 effectors localize and are regulated by microtubules. For example, the Rap1 effectors RapL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fujita et al., 2005</xref>) and Krit1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">BÃ©raud-Dufour et al., 2007</xref>) directly interact with microtubules from where they are dislodged and recruited to the plasma membrane when Rap1 is activated. Although a kinesin protein may not be needed in these cases, this suggests that the control of Rap1 effectors by microtubules may be a general mechanism to govern spatiotemporal Rap1 signaling in various contexts.</p>

          <p><bold>Proposed model describing the roles of Radil and KIF14 during cancer cell migration.</bold> (A) In highly motile cancer cells, KIF14 is up-regulated and sequesters Radil on microtubules. This enables optimal RadilâRap1 signaling, inside-out integrin signaling, and cellâmatrix adhesive properties required for efficient cell migration. (B) Depletion of Radil inhibits integrin activation, reduces cellâmatrix adhesion, and causes loss of traction and cell motility. (C) Depletion of KIF14 leads to the release of Radil from microtubules, thereby increasing the pool of Radil available to associate with activated Rap1 at the plasma membrane. This leads to hyperactivated integrins, increases focal adhesion formation, and decreases motility.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>At present, the mechanism by which Radil leads to inside-out activation of integrins is not completely clear. Although other Rap1 effectors such as RIAM have been shown to mediate the formation of an integrinâactivation complex containing Rap1 and Talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lee et al., 2009</xref>) that can directly associate with integrins, our mass spectrometry interrogation of the Radil complex did not reveal the presence of Talin or other integrin-associated proteins. However, we previously identified GÎ²Î³ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins as Radil interactors and demonstrated that GÎ²Î³ overexpression leads to Rap1a-dependent inside-out activation of integrins and cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, GÎ³ subunits were previously shown to localize to the tip of stress fibers and focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hansen et al., 1994</xref>). After G-proteinâcoupled receptor activation, the release of GÎ²Î³ could thus direct the assembly of a GÎ²Î³âRap1aâRadil signaling complex, leading to spatiotemporal activation of integrins. Especially relevant to our findings showing that the depletion of Radil inhibits the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells to lungs, activation of the CXCR4 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">MÃ¼ller et al., 2001</xref>) and GÎ²Î³ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tang et al., 2011</xref>) were previously shown to be required for this process. Additionally, given that loss of function for the ERM protein ezrin was recently demonstrated to be required for the Rap1-induced spreading to similar extent than Radil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ross et al., 2011</xref>), studying the functional relationship between these proteins may reveal further clues about their mechanisms. As the expression of Rap1GAP and knockdown of Radil similarly lead to decreased activation of integrins, impaired focal adhesion formation and defects in spreading of breast cancer cells, our results strongly implicate a requirement for Rap1âRadil signaling in the context of cancer cell migration.</p>
      <p>We previously established that the PDZ domain of Radil was important for its activity in cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>). The integration of the phage-display screen to identify the preferred PDZ ligand for the Radil PDZ domain and the mass spectrometry analysis of Radil-containing protein complex enabled the identification of KIF14 as a protein interacting with the Radil PDZ domain. The C-terminal of KIF14 contains the atypical hydrophobic [F/I]-x-W-V motif revealed by phage display and was found to be critical for its binding to Radil and for recruitment of the latter on microtubules. Further studies will be needed to understand how the binding of Radil to KIF14 is modulated. One possibility is that the recruitment of Rap1-GTP to the N-terminal RA domain of Radil could modulate the availability of the C-terminal PDZ ligand for binding to KIF14.</p>
      <p>KIF14 is frequently overexpressed in several human cancers. Its overexpression in breast cancer was previously shown to be a predictor of poor survival, as it correlates with tumor grade and invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corson and Gallie, 2006</xref>). KIF14 in a complex with citron kinase and PRC1 was identified as a mitotic kinesin with a role during cytokinesis because its knockdown led to binucleated HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carleton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gruneberg et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, Rap1 activity and integrin signaling need to be optimally regulated for normal cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dao et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, at the onset of mitosis, most adherent cells undergo cell retraction characterized by the disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, processes that are controlled by Rap1 and integrins. Given the importance of Radil as a Rap1 effector and its regulation by KIF14, we show that Radil, perhaps not surprisingly, controls cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our results thus position the KIF14âRap1âRadil signaling axis as an important mediator of tumor progression, as it affects both cell proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freeman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>The ability of cells to dynamically change their adhesion to the ECM during cell migration is a property optimized by cancer cells to support metastasis and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Felding-Habermann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Felding-Habermann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 2010</xref>). In the light of our findings, KIF14 overexpression detected in several human cancers may reflect this optimization process required to tune the level of Rap1âRadil signaling and resulting integrin activation needed for efficient cell motility and tumor progression. We validated that KIF14 is highly up-regulated in a cohort of primary breast tumors and showed that KIF14 overexpression in breast cancer cell lines correlates with their invasive properties. In contrast, Radil expression is not significantly changed in breast tumors or in cell lines but Rap1 activity is known to be highly up-regulated in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">SjÃ¶blom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banerjee et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, similar to KIF14, Sharpin was recently identified as an inhibitor of Î²1-integrins by preventing the interaction with Talin and Kindlin, thereby inhibiting the dynamic switching between active and inactive conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rantala et al., 2011</xref>). Sharpin levels are also up-regulated in different cancers and this was found to be important for cell migration.</p>
      <p>The creation and regulation of traction forces in response to interactions of the ECM with different regions of the cell are intrinsic to cell migration and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kaverina et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dao et al., 2009</xref>). Regulated cycles of assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions and focal complexes at adhering and retracting sides of the cells produce the tractions required for cells to move. It is becoming increasingly clear that the precise control of focal adhesion dynamics is important for efficient cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gardel et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nagano et al., 2012</xref>). As such, the presence of fewer focal complexes at the periphery and large focal adhesions are signs of reduced adhesion dynamics and cell movement. The depletion of Radil in MDA-MB-231 impairs integrin activation and leads to reduced focal adhesions, whereas KIF14 depletion leads to dramatically enlarged focal adhesions and increased stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Consistent with this notion, both Radil- and KIF14-depleted cells exhibit reduced cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary this study identifies the oncogene KIF14 as a PDZ ligandâcontaining protein interacting with Radil. KIF14 negatively regulates Rap1a signaling and inside-out integrin activation by tethering Radil on microtubules. Our results describe the role of Radil in cancer progression, and suggest that it is an important nexus integrating GPCR, GÎ²Î³, and Rap1 signaling in this context. Given that KIF14 is frequently overexpressed in several cancers, further studies examining the requirement of Radil for the progression of other cancers will be important. Furthermore, guided by other studies showing the targeting of PDZ-mediated interactions with small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Houslay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thorsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Patra et al., 2012</xref>) and synthetic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tonikian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), inhibiting KIF14âRadil interaction could provide a novel strategy for the treatment of cancer.</p>

For in vitro binding, equimolar amounts of GST-Radil-PDZ and Flag-tagged KIF14 c-tails immobilized on Flag-M2 beads were mixed in the same buffer and incubated with gentle rocking at room temperature for 1 h. Beads were subsequently washed with lysis buffer three times and binding analyzed by Western blotting.</p>

        <p>Approximately 6 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> MDA-MB-231 cells were lysed in 500 Âµl of BRB80 buffer (80 mM Pipes, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, pH 6.8, with KOH and protease inhibitors) followed by sonication for 15 s. Lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4Â°C using an ultracentrifuge (Optima; Beckman Coulter) with an MLA-130 rotor. All the following steps were performed at room temperature. Tubulin in the supernatant was polymerized by adding 2 mM GTP (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and stepwise addition of paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich) to a final concentration of 20 ÂµM. Kinesins were then allowed to bind by adding 2 mM AMP-PNP and letting the reaction incubate at 37Â°C for 30 min. Tubulinâkinesin complex was pelleted by centrifugation at 165,000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h and the gelatinous precipitate was resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.</p>

        <p>HEK293T cells or MDA-MB-231 cells expressing FLAG-mRadil or FLAG-mRadilÎPDZ were lysed in TAP lysis buffer (0.1% Igepal CA630, 10% glycerol, 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM NaF, 0.25 mM NaOVO<sub>3</sub>, 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor cocktail) and immunoprecipitated with Î±-FLAG-M2 beads overnight at 4Â°C. Purified proteins were eluted from the beads using 500 mM ammonium hydroxide at pH 11.0. The proteins in the complex were reduced in 25 mM dithiothreitol and alkylated using 100 mM iodoacetimide (Sigma-Aldrich), and brought to 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The proteins were then directly digested with sequenced-grade trypsin (Promega). Tryptic peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (model LTQ-XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>). The tandem mass spectra generated were searched against the human NCBI protein sequences using SEQUEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eng et al., 1994</xref>) running on the Sorcerer platform (Sage-N Research). The peptides identified by SEQUEST were validated using PeptideProphet and assigned a protein identification using ProteinProphet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keller et al., 2002</xref>). The identified proteins were further filtered against other unrelated FLAG pull-down experiments to subtract background proteins using ProHits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

        <p>Plates or coverslips were coated with 0.5 Âµg/ml fibronectin at 4Â°C overnight, and rinsed with PBS twice the following day and dried before performing the experiments. Cells were incubated at 37Â°C and allowed to adhere and spread for different times. Several phase contrast images of cells were taken from random fields for each condition with a 10Ã/0.25 NA Ph1 objective using an inverted microscope (Eclipse TS100; Nikon). The cell areas were measured by outlining the perimeters of each cell using ImageJ software version 1.44p. Curve was fitted and the rate constant estimated by nonlinear regression analysis using the one-phase association equation: <italic>Y</italic> = <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic> + (<italic>Plateau</italic> â <italic>Y<sub>0</sub></italic>)(<italic>1</italic>â<italic>e</italic><sup>â<italic>KX</italic></sup>), where <italic>Y</italic> is the cell area and <italic>X</italic> is time, plateau is the size of the cell when fully spread.

        <p>For migration assays, 5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells were seeded on the top chamber of Falcon cell culture Transwell inserts with 8-Âµm pores (BD). For Matrigel invasion assays, 50 Âµg of growth factorâreduced Matrigel (50 Âµl; BD) was polymerized on the top chamber of the Transwell inserts for 2 h at 37Â°C and used immediately as described for migration assays. Cells were allowed to settle on the Transwell inserts with serum-free media in the bottom chambers for 1 h. After 1 h, the media in the bottom chamber was supplemented with 20% FBS and cells were incubated at 37Â°C for 10â12 h. At the end of this time point cells at the bottom of the Transwell inserts were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min followed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet in 200 mM 2-(<italic>N</italic>-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. The cells that did not invade or migrate were carefully wiped off the top of the membrane with a cotton swab. Cell migration and invasion were quantified by averaging cell counts from pictures taken from 4â5 random areas on the membranes for each condition using an inverted microscope (Eclipse TS100; Nikon) with a 10Ã objective. Quantified results are presented as Â±SEM.</p>

        <p>For in vivo metastasis experiments, 6â10-wk-old NOD-SCID mice were injected via the tail vein with MDA-MB-231-RLuc cells treated with the indicated shRNAs at a density of 10<sup>6</sup> per mice. Cell metastasis and homing to the lung was monitored by injecting mice intraperitoneally with XenoLight RediJect Coelenterazine h (Caliper) and measured by in vivo bioluminescence imaging using an IVIS Spectrum Bioluminescence system (Xenogen). Animals were sacrificed 45 d after inoculation, and lung tissues were collected and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde followed by 70% ethanol. Lungs were stained with Bouinâs stain (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight. Visible tumor nodules were counted to assess the extent of tumor metastasis. To assess effects on tumor growth 10<sup>6</sup> MDA-MB-231 cells treated with scrambled shRNA or Radil shRNA #4 were implanted subcutaneously into 6-wk-old NOD-SCID mice. After letting tumors grow for 31 d the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were dissected and photographed using a fluorescence stereomicroscope. Each tumor was weighed and their volume measured by liquid displacement. All animals were studied using protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Ontario Cancer Institute, and are in accordance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.</p>

        <p>Fig. S1 shows the specificity of interaction between Radil and KIF14. Radil does not interact with the unrelated KIF7, and KIF14 does not interact with AF-6. The figure also illustrates sequence homology between Radil and AF-6 PDZ domains. Microscopy images show KIF14 localization on microtubules. Fig. S2 shows expression levels of KIF14 in primary human breast tumors and in human breast cancer cell lines. Radil but not RadilÎPDZ cDNA rescues cell spreading defects of Radil shRNA-expressing cells. Cells expressing two different KIF14 shRNAs exhibit increased spreading phenotypes. Fig. S3 shows F-actin and vinculin staining of cells expressing different Radil and KIF14 shRNAs than the ones used in the main figures. Also shown is localization of FLAG-Radil upon nocodazole treatment and Rap1 activation status in cells expressing Radil- or KIF14-specific shRNAs. Fig. S4 shows knockdown efficiency of Radil in cells before subcutaneous injections in mice. Tumors were dissected 31 d after injection and GFP expression confirms the continuous expression of the shRNA containing plasmids. Videos 1â3 accompany <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> and show the effect of KIF14 depletion on focal adhesion dynamics. Table S1 shows FLAG-Radil pull-downs in HEK293T cells.
