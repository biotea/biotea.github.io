      <abstract>
        <p>Recent studies demonstrated that mutations in B3GNT1, an enzyme proposed to be involved in poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis, were causal for congenital muscular dystrophy with hypoglycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan (secondary dystroglycanopathies). Since defects in the O-mannosylation protein glycosylation pathway are primarily responsible for dystroglycanopathies and with no established O-mannose initiated structures containing a Î²3 linked GlcNAc known, we biochemically interrogated this human enzyme. Here we report this enzyme is not a Î²-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase with catalytic activity towards Î²-galactose but rather a Î²-1,4-glucuronyltransferase, designated B4GAT1, towards both Î±- and Î²-anomers of xylose. The dual-activity LARGE enzyme is capable of extending products of B4GAT1 and we provide experimental evidence that B4GAT1 is the priming enzyme for LARGE. Our results further define the functional O-mannosylated glycan structure and indicate that B4GAT1 is involved in the initiation of the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide that is necessary for extracellular matrix protein binding to O-mannosylated Î±-dystroglycan that is lacking in secondary dystroglycanopathies.</p>

        <p>Dystroglycan is a protein that is essential for muscles to function correctly, and helps to connect the interior framework of muscle cells with the external matrix of molecules that hold the cells together in the tissue. As is the case for many proteins, dystroglycan must have particular carbohydrate molecules joined to it in order to work correctly. Enzymes called glycosyltransferases assist with the reactions that build the carbohydrates on a protein.</p>
        <p>Mutations in multiple glycosyltransferases that add carbohydrates to dystroglycan can cause a group of diseases that are characterized by a progressive loss of muscle function, known as congenital muscular dystrophies. Praissman et al. use biochemical experimentation to investigate the role of one of these enzymes, known as B3GNT1. The enzyme's name is based on a code that describes which carbohydrate it helps to bind to proteins. However, Praissman et al. (and independently, Willer et al.) discovered that this enzyme actually works with a different donor and acceptor than previously thought, and so should be called B4GAT1 instead.</p>
        <p>Praissman et al. propose that the B4GAT1 enzyme starts the process of forming the carbohydrate structures that help muscle cells bind to the muscle tissue matrix. B4GAT1 forms short carbohydrates on the surface of the part of dystroglycan that sits on the surface of cells. These carbohydrates are then extended into longer chains by another glycosyltransferase called LARGE. The results of Praissman et al. suggest that another enzyme is also involved in this process, which will require further studies to identify. Understanding the role of B4GAT1 and other glycosyltransferases that build functionally glycosylated dystroglycan could help to develop treatments for diseases such as muscular dystrophies.</p>

      <p>Glycosylation is the most abundant and diverse post-translational modification of proteins (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Varki, 2011</xref>). The synthesis of complex glycans is catalyzed by the action of over 200 individual glycosyltransferases in humans (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Moremen et al., 2012</xref>). For most of the enzymes studied to date, there is exceptional selectivity for the donor sugar nucleotide and the underlying acceptor glycan as well as stereo- and linkage-specificity for the catalyzed additions (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Moremen et al., 2012</xref>). Mutations in the genes encoding many of these glycosyltransferases have been established as causal for a variety of human diseases including congenital muscular dystrophy, specifically the secondary dystroglycanopathies (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barresi and Campbell, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Freeze, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wells, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Praissman and Wells, 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>At least a dozen enzymes/proteins are involved in the synthesis of O-mannose-initiated glycans that when defective lead to various forms of congenital muscular dystrophy, termed secondary dystroglycanopathies, that range from the phenotypically mild Limb-Girdle to the severe Walker-Warburg muscular dystrophies (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Muntoni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mercuri and Muntoni, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dobson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Praissman and Wells, 2014</xref>).

Recently, reports in the literature have connected mutations in B3GNT1 with congenital muscular dystrophies (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>) and specifically to the defective glycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jae et al., 2013</xref>) even though no O-mannose glycan structures containing a Î²3-GlcNAc have yet to be elucidated (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Praissman and Wells, 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>In 1997, B3GNT1 (also known as iGnT) was reported to be the first successfully cloned Î²-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase involved in the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 1997</xref>). Poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains consist of the repeating disaccharide -Î²3-GlcNAc-Î²4-Gal-, a structure termed the i-antigen when unbranched (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ujita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Zhou, 2003</xref>). Poly-N-acetyllactosamine is a prevalent glycan substructure found in N-glycans and O-glycans on proteins whose abnormal levels have been associated with human diseases including cancer (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ujita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Zhou, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). The Fukuda group used an expression cloning strategy enriching for plasmids containing cDNA inserts that substantially increased poly-N-acetyllactosamine, as judged by antibody binding, on the surfaces of Namalwa KJM-1 cells (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 1997</xref>). Shortly thereafter, work carried out by Hennet's and Sasaki's groups led to the cloning of three other Î²-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, B3GNT2, 3, and 4 (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Shiraishi et al., 2001</xref>). However, papers as recently as 2008 continued to use conflicting nomenclature for B3GNT2 by calling it B3GNT1 causing some confusion within the field (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Biellmann et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, B3GNT2, B3GNT3 and B3GNT4 were found to share motifs with Î²3-galactosyl-transferases as well as Î²3-GalNAc-transferases (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Shiraishi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Togayachi et al., 2006</xref>). These three enzymes are in the same Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database (CAZy) family and group together based on primary sequence similarity and motifs hypothesized to play a role in forming the Î²3 linkage (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Shiraishi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Togayachi et al., 2006</xref>). B3GNT1 lacks these motifs and is in a different CaZY family, interestingly one shared with LARGE and LARGE2 that contain both xylosyl- and glucoronsylâtransferase activity and which functionally modify O-mannosylated glycans (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Inamori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Goddeeris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Inamori et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that the B3GNT1 enzyme is a binding partner for LARGE in mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bao et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The combination of data suggesting substantial divergence of B3GNT1 from other B3GNTs and the similarity in primary sequence and disease association with LARGE led us to reexamine the enzymatic activity of B3GNT1 to resolve the apparent inconsistencies and establish its potential enzymatic role in O-mannosylation and secondary dystroglycanopathies. Here we report that B3GNT1 is in fact B4GAT1 (Î²-1,4-glucuronyltransferase 1) that generates the substrate for the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide that is required for interaction of O-mannosylated Î±-dystroglycan with extracellular matrix proteins.</p>

        <p>Given that B3GNT1 clustered into CAZy family GT49, the family containing the glucuronyltransferase domain of LARGE, we performed a multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

        <title>The B4GAT1 disaccharide products are substrates for the xylosytransferase activity of LARGE</title>

        <p>The inability of B4GAT1 to modify trisaccharides ending with xylose does not rule out the possibility that B4GAT1 may possess a branching activity. We tested whether B4GAT1 or LARGE were capable of transferring glucuronic acid to any of the tagged purified disaccharides GlcA-Î²4-Xyl-Î±-pNP, GlcA-Î²4-Xyl-Î²-pNP or GlcA-Î²3-Xyl-Î±-pNP.

        <title>Formation of disaccharide polymer lags in the absence of B4GAT1</title>
        <p>To further characterize the interplay between LARGE and B4GAT1, we examined production of polymer by LARGE both with and without B4GAT1. Incubation of Xyl-Î±-pNP or Xyl-Î²-pNP with either B4GAT1 alone, LARGE alone, or B4GAT1 and LARGE with both sugar nucleotide donors resulted in substantially different polymer production time courses as assayed by radioactive transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Time points were taken at 1, 2, 14 and 36 hr. B4GAT1 rapidly completes transfer to substrate. â¼1200 DPM represents complete transfer to the 10 nmol of substrate present. LARGE is unable to transfer to Xyl-Î²-pNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and shows a significant lag in initial transfer to Xyl-Î±-pNP before the formation of polymer. In contrast, B4GAT1 and LARGE together demonstrate robust initial transfer activity and formation of polymer using either substrate. Analysis of the synthesized polymer via mass spectrometry shows extensive polymerization is achievable following incubation with both enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

      <p>O-mannosylation of Î±-dystroglycan is required for its proper function and when disrupted is a significant cause of a subset of congenital muscular dystrophies referred to as secondary dystroglycanopathies (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barresi and Campbell, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Freeze, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Muntoni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mercuri and Muntoni, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dobson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wells, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Praissman and Wells, 2014</xref>). A phosphorylated O-mannose trisaccharide (core M3, [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Praissman and Wells, 2014</xref>]) attached to Î±-dystroglycan and its extension by LARGE after poorly defined intermediate biosynthetic steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) has been shown to be directly involved in the required ECM ligand binding activity (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Inamori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we have established that B4GAT1 is a Î²-1,4-glucuronyltransferase, not a B3GNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), with activity toward monomeric Î±- and Î²- xylopyranosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We have gone on to show that LARGE can extend the resulting products of B4GAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Prior reports indicated that B4GAT1 (B3GNT1) activity is necessary for expression of LARGE-dependent functional glycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan and that B4GAT1 (B3GNT1) and LARGE form a complex (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>). We were unable to confirm this latter point using our soluble forms of the enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Since we have shown that the specific activity and catalytic efficiency of B4GAT1 towards the tested monosaccharide xylosides is greater by more than an order of magnitude compared to LARGE catalysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), this suggests that B4GAT1 is an initiating enzyme for LARGE-dependent glycan synthesis. This conclusion is further strengthened by data showing a significant lag in the initial rate for synthesis of or a complete failure to produce polymer in the absence of B4GAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It also appears that B4GAT1 serves exclusively as a priming enzyme since we could not detect B4GAT1 modification of LARGE extended trisaccharides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We also demonstrate that neither LARGE nor B4GAT1 is capable of adding GlcA to a disaccharide that has been capped with GlcA suggesting that branching is not occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This leads to the conclusion that there is only one type of repeating disaccharide (Xyl-Î±3-GlcA-Î²3) attached to Î±-dystroglycan that is synthesized by LARGE. This data also serves to highlight the differences in structural isomers by showing both anomeric configuration (Î± and Î², <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig6">Figures 2C and 6</xref>) as well as linkage position (â3 and â4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) of isomeric substrates influences their subsequent ability to be elongated by enzymes (LARGE and B4GAT1). In sum, our data provide a basis for further attempts to fully elucidate the functional LARGE-dependent O-mannose-initiated structure(s) and suggests that at least one of the remaining incompletely characterized genes implicated in functional glycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan (FKTN, FKRP, ISPD, and TMEM5, [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wells, 2013</xref>]) likely encodes a xylosyltransferase to provide a substrate for B4GAT1. Given that B4GAT1 is essential for proper glycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>) and that LARGE is incapable of transferring GlcA to a Î²-xylopyranoside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Inamori et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>]) or generating a polymer from pNP-Î²-Xyl without B4GAT1 present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), our findings strongly suggest that the underlying xylose is in a Î²-linkage on Î±-dystroglycan. This work also clarifies why deficiencies in this enzyme would be associated with loss of functional glycosylation and laminin binding of Î±-dystroglycan and be causal for congenital muscular dystrophy (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>). Further, our results likely clarify how loss of expression of B4GAT1 (B3GNT1), similar to loss of expression of LARGE (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">de Bernabe et al., 2009</xref>), can lead to loss of laminin-binding Î±-dystroglycan and promote metastasis in certain cancers (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bao et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, potential complex interactions between poly-N-acetyllactosamine, as often measured by the i-antigen antibody, and the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide, often measured on Î±-dystroglycan by the IIH6 antibody, need to be reexamined in the context of the newly defined enzymatic activity of B4GAT1 (B3GNT1) (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ujita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yoneyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>). For example, B4GAT1 has previously been observed to be in complex with B4GALT1, an enzyme required for poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). This finding suggested that interaction between these two enzymes, which were thought to generate the repeating disaccharide, potentially influenced poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis. In lieu of our findings, this extrapolated conclusion from the interaction data is no longer valid. Instead, the relationship between poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis and the functional O-mannose glycan pathway needs to be evaluated, especially given that both have been implicated in cancer metastasis (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ujita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yoneyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Buysse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Czeschik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03943.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed role of B4GAT1 in the O-mannosylation pathway.</title><p>The molecular link between the phospho-O-mannose trisaccharide synthesized on Î±-dystroglycan and the LARGE synthesized repeating disaccharide crucial for laminin binding reactivity is still not fully characterized (represented as [X]).

      <p>We propose renaming B3GNT1 according to its defined activity as B4GAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This designation is following in the tradition of the three other known non-proteoglycan glycoprotein glucuronyltransferases that all add GlcA in a Î²3-linkage (B3GAT1-3, [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Morita et al., 2008</xref>]). Interestingly, the only established glycoprotein glycoslytransferases capable of transferring GlcA in a Î²4-linkage are the dual-activity exostoses enzymes involved in heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan polymerization that build the repeating disaccharide (-GlcNAc-Î±4-GlcA-Î²4-) backbone of the glycosaminoglycan (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Zak et al., 2002</xref>). Similarities exist between HS (and other proteoglycan) biosynthesis pathways and the LARGE-dependent functional O-mannose glycan assembly pathway built on Î±-dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Included in these similarities are that they both contain non-reducing end repeating disaccharides (GlcA and GlcNAc for HS and GlcA and Xyl for the functional O-Man structure), they both contain an acidic glycan (GlcA), there is a copolymerase that has dualâenzymatic activity (exostoses enzymes for HS and LARGE for the functional O-Man glycan structure), both require a specific underlying core structure, and each contains specific priming glycosyltransferases (EXTLs for HS [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2001</xref>], B4GAT1 for the functional O-Man glycan structure) that adds one of the sugars found in the repeat to the underlying core structure to initiate elongation. Here we have established that B4GAT1, previously referred to as B3GNT1, is a xylopyranoside Î²1,4-glucuronyltransferase that appears to be the priming enzyme for the LARGE copolymerase for building the functional O-Man structure on Î±-dystroglycan that when defective causes CMD.</p>

        <p>Enzymatic reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min, acidified to 0.1% TFA, and glycoside acceptors were separated from sugar nucleotide using reverse-phase C18 spin (The Nest Group, Inc., Southborough, MA) columns. Transfer was determined by scintillation counting or HPLC with LC-MS/MS verification of species. For scintillation counting, a PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA) Tri-Carb 2910 TR liquid scintillation counter was used with ScintSafe Plus 50% scintillation cocktail under standard settings for the isotope in question. HPLC was carried out on an Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) 1100 LC system equipped with variable wavelength absorbance detector set for monitoring pNP and MU derivatives (310 nm). Quantification was by peak area. Buffer A was 50 mM ammonium formate pH 4.3 and buffer B was 20% buffer A in 80% acetonitrile for all assays discussed. Separations were carried out by isocratic elution using a Grace Vydac 218 TP C18 column (5 Î¼m particle size, 2.1 mm Ã 150 mm). All disaccharide products were separated using 14%B. Trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide separations were noted to be most strongly influenced by the identity of the underlying labeled disaccharide. Hence, all longer chain products and substrates extending GlcA-Î²4-Xyl-Î±-pNP were separated at 8%B, all products and substrates extending GlcA-Î²4-Xyl-Î²-MU were separated using 10%B, and all products and substrates extending GlcA-Î²3-Xyl-Î±-pNP were separated at 5%B. LC-MS and LC-MS/MS of reaction products was performed in positive mode on either a Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA) Orbitrap XL or a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Fusion utilizing short linear gradients from 0.1% formic acid in water to 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Full MS was acquired in the Orbitrap for accurate mass determination while glycoside MS/MS fragmentation spectra were obtained in the linear ion trap and assigned manually.</p>

        <title>Shotgun proteomics and protein SDS-PAGE</title>
        <p>Shotgun proteomics was performed on tryptic digests of purified enzyme samples according to our standard protocol on a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap XL (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Porterfield et al., 2014</xref>). Data was searched in Proteome Discoverer 1.4 using Sequest HT with the percolator node set at a 1% peptide false-discovery rate and a recent human reference proteome from Uniprot to which common contaminant protein sequences had been added. SDS-PAGE was also carried out according to standard protocols using the Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) Precision Plus Protein Kaleidoscope molecular weight ladder. Gels were Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 stained and visualized.</p>

        <title>In vitro complex formation assay</title>
        <p>Uncleaved LARGE and TEV protease cleaved B4GAT1 were combined at equimolar concentrations in 20 mM HEPES pH 7 with 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole. Final protein concentration was 0.5 mg/ml. After incubation at 4Â°C for 15 min, the mixture was applied to Novagen Ni-NTA resin, washed three times with 20 mM imidazole in PBS pH 7 and eluted with 250 mM imidazole in PBS pH 7. The input and collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Porterfield et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

        <title>Enzyme kinetics</title>
        <p>Time course experiments were carried out to ensure that the initial rate condition required for MichaelisâMenten kinetic analysis was met. A 2 hr incubation at 37Â°C was found to be acceptable for B4GAT1 whereas at 16 hr incubation period was judged suitable for LARGE. We compared the activity of B4GAT1 to that of LARGE while varying monosaccharide acceptor concentration. Concentrations ranging from 200 nM to 2 mM were tested to generate typical MichaelisâMenten curves for each enzyme against the substrates Xyl-Î±-pNP and Xyl-Î²-pNP. UDP-GlcA was supplied at 2 mM in all reactions. Reactions were terminated by boiling and processed as described above with quantification by HPLC. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was generated in Microsoft Excel and kinetic parameters determined from it. We were unable to detect the presence of product for LARGE at 2 mM donor and acceptor after 16 hr with Xyl-Î²-pNP.</p>

        <title>NMR</title>
        <p>Samples of the products from action of LARGE and B4GAT1 with UDP-GlcA on Xyl-Î±-pNP were purified as described above, and, for each, â¼1 mg was dissolved in 0.5 ml D<sub>2</sub>O. NMR spectra of each of these samples were obtained on a VNMRS 600 MHz spectrometer with a triple resonance HCN cold probe. 2-Dimensional <sup>1</sup>H double quantum COSY, and TOCSY, and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HSQC and HMBC spectra (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Van de Ven, 1995</xref>) were recorded using standard pulse sequences in the Agilent VnmrJ 4.3 software and processed in that software. The <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C peak assignments were made based on analysis of these data using the single and multiple bond connectivities these experiments reveal. The glycosidic linkages were established based on <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMBC correlations in both directions across the glycosidic linkages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Anomeric stereochemistry was determined from the 1-bond C-H coupling of the anomeric sites where a value of less than 170 Hz indicates a Î²-linkage and one of more than 170 Hz indicates an Î±-linkage (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bock and Pedersen, 1974</xref>). These were further confirmed from the <sup>3</sup>J<sub>H1,H2</sub> couplings of the respective sugar residues. <sup>1</sup>H chemical shifts were calibrated relative to the HDO signal at 4.77 ppm at 25Â°C and the <sup>13</sup>C shifts were then determined by the indirect referencing approach from the proton reference frequency (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wishart et al., 1995</xref>).</p>

        <title>LARGE synthesized polymer analysis by mass spectrometry</title>
        <p>Following a protocol developed to significantly enhance spectra acquired for highly acidic carbohydrates (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Jacobs and Dahlman, 2001</xref>), Nafion 117 solution was applied to a Bruker MSP 96 ground steel target and allowed to dry. Samples of polymerization reaction mixtures were mixed 1:1 with 2,5-DHB resuspended in 50% acetonitrile at 20 mg/ml and spotted on the dried Nafion 117 membrane. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization with time-of-flight detection mass spectrometry spectra were acquired using a Bruker Microflex.</p>

      <p>Thank you for sending your work entitled âB4GAT1 is the Priming Enzyme for the LARGE-dependent Functional Glycosylation of Î±-Dystroglycanâ for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Suzanne Pfeffer, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, while Pamela Stanley has also agreed to reveal her identity.</p>
      <p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p>
      <p>This manuscript describes an exciting new development in our understanding of the synthesis of a functional glycan required for Î±-dystroglycan to interact with laminin and the ECM. The data strongly support the authors' conclusions that the enzyme formerly called B3GNT1 should be renamed B4GAT1. However, the following points and questions should be addressed by the authors:</p>
      <p>1) LARGE has a very low specific activity in these assays. The data in this manuscript should be compared directly for consistency with previous data published by the Campbell and Bakker groups (3 papers) in terms of incubation times, UDP-sugar concentrations, pH, metal ions etc. In addition, the precise conditions for each set of assay conditions should be given in all figure and table legends. It is not sufficient to have general conditions in the Methods.</p>
      <p>2) It is intriguing that B4GAT1 has similar specificity for Xyl-Î±-MU and Xyl-Î²-MU. Could B4GAT1 be a branching enzyme as well as a priming enzyme? The fact that branching is not observed with tri-saccharide substrates under certain conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> does not rule out this possibility.</p>
      <p>3) Does LARGE produce at least a small polymer from di- or trisaccharide substrate when both UDP-xylose and UDP-GlcA are present in the reaction? It would support priming if polymer is only obtained when B4GAT1 is in the mix.</p>
      <p>4) The literature indicates that LARGE and B4GAT1 should form a complex. Is this the case for the purified enzymes? And, if so, does the complex increase the specific activity of LARGE/B4GAT1 for Xyl-Î±-MU? These data would provide important support for the priming activity of B4GAT1.</p>
      <p>5) The study uses artificial substrates and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. The model presented predicts that the alpha-dystroglycan from B4GAT1 deficient cells (KD, KO or patient derived) should display a single branched Xylose (or a terminal Xylose) in addition to the phospho-O-Mannose tri-saccharide. In recognition of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient quantities for structural evidence, indirect evidence that the absence of B4GAT1 results in the production of O-Mannose glycans on alpha-dystroglycan terminating in beta-xylose (or at least xylose) would be helpful.</p>
      <p>6) To explore why B4GAT1 is indispensable and prove it is a priming enzyme, it would be ideal to test whether the first Xylose on the alpha-dystroglycan is indeed branched in Beta as proposed by the authors. Please speculate on how this could be tested.</p>
      <p>7) Lee at al 2009 presents data for intracellular association of B4GAT1/B3GNT1 with B4GALT1. Perhaps the new findings suggest that a variety of Golgi glycosyltransferases are present in larger, oligomeric assemblies in cells? Please speculate. Also, could the authors speculate why the previous work came to the wrong conclusion?</p>

      <p><italic>1) LARGE has a very low specific activity in these assays. The data in this manuscript should be compared directly for consistency with previous data published by the Campbell and Bakker groups (3 papers) in terms of incubation times, UDP-sugar concentrations, pH, metal ions etc. In addition, the precise conditions for each set of assay conditions should be given in all figure and table legends. It is not sufficient to have general conditions in the Methods</italic>.</p>
      <p>We fully agree that LARGE has a low specific activity in these assays using monosaccharides as substrates. The buffering conditions between our assays and those used by others (Inamori K, et al., 2012, Science, 335:93, Goddeeris, MM et al., 2013, Nature, 503:136, and Ashikov, A, et al., 2013, Glycobiology, 23:303, Inamori K, et al., 2013, Glycobiology, 23:295) are essentially the same. However, specific activity was only reported in the Inamori 2013 manuscript as the other experiments used undefined amounts of enzyme and rarely look at initial rates. The Inamori, et al. 2013 manuscript used a disaccharide for establishing rates due to the low activity observed for monosaccharide as a substrate consistent with our findings. As can be clearly observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref> of our manuscript, it is the initial transfer of GlcA to a monomer that appears to be slow and then extension appears to be robustly consistent with the observations of Inamori et al. 2013. Thus, we believe our results are fully consistent with what others have observed though direct comparison is not possible due to undefined reactions and/or different substrates being utilized for establishing kinetic parameters.</p>
      <p><italic>2) It is intriguing that B4GAT1 has similar specificity for Xyl-Î±-MU and Xyl-Î²-MU. Could B4GAT1 be a branching enzyme as well as a priming enzyme? The fact that branching is not observed with tri-saccharide substrates under certain conditions in vitro does not rule out this possibility</italic>.</p>
      <p>Given the fact that the B4GAT1 and the LARGE glycosytransferase add GlcA in different linkages to Î±-xylose, this is an intriguing possibility. To better address this issue, we produced and purified the disaccharides GlcA-Î²3-Xyl-Î±-pNP (product of LARGE) and GlcA-Î²4-Xyl-Î±-pNP (product of B4GAT1). We performed a radioactive GlcA transferase activity with each of these substrates using both enzymes, as well as positive controls for activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In our hands, we were unable to see transfer of radioactivity that would have been indicative for the formation of GlcA-Î²3-(GlcA-Î²4)-Xyl-Î±-pNP. While we are unable to completely rule out this possibility, since it is possible we are not using the correct substrates, our results argue against a branching activity for B4GAT1 or LARGE GlcA activity.</p>
      <p><italic>3) Does LARGE produce at least a small polymer from di- or trisaccharide substrate when both UDP-xylose and UDP-GlcA are present in the reaction? It would support priming if polymer is only obtained when B4GAT1 is in the mix</italic>.</p>
      <p>The production of polymer with LARGE alone has been previously described by others using disaccharide substrates (Inamori K, et al., 2012, Science, 335:93, Goddeeris, MM et al., 2013, Nature, 503:136, and Ashikov, A, et al., 2013, Glycobiology, 23:303). To further address the issue of priming and polymer formation, we have included additional experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This new data clearly demonstrates that LARGE alone is not able to form polymer using the Xyl-Î²-pNP as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, LARGE in the presence of both sugar nucleotides can produce polymer on Xyl-Î±- pNP though the initial rate, for the addition of the first GlcA, is quite slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Further, the addition of B4GAT1 eliminates this initial lag observed with Xyl- Î±-pNP as the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Using the Xyl-Î²-pNP, polymer is only observed when both enzymes are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed the presence of polymer formed when both enzymes are used by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This data strongly supports the model of B4GAT1 being the priming enzyme for LARGE-dependent polymer formation. Further, when coupled with the similar phenotype observed in patients and animal models with mutations/knock-down of B4GAT1 or LARGE, this data suggests that the underlying xylose on the alpha-dystroglycan structure is most likely in a beta-linkage.</p>
      <p><italic>4) The literature indicates that LARGE and B4GAT1 should form a complex. Is this the case for the purified enzymes? And, if so, does the complex increase the specific activity of LARGE/B4GAT1 for Xyl-Î±-MU? These data would provide important support for the priming activity of B4GAT1</italic>.</p>
      <p>Tests carried out with our purified soluble enzymes did not reveal <italic>in vitro</italic> complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This could potentially be attributed to the lack of transmembrane and stalk regions in our proteins. However, in a similar finding to ours, while Bao et al had previously demonstrated that B4GAT1 and LARGE when overexpressed as tagged proteins in cells together could co-immunopurify, they demonstrated that mixing of two cell extracts each overexpressing one of the proteins did not result in complex formation (Bao, X et al, 2009, PNAS, 106:12109). This suggests an unknown need for co-expression for complex formation or it reflects the inherent difficulty in determining specific protein-protein interactions via co-immunoprecipiation for membrane proteins.</p>
      <p>While we were unable to see a complex, we were able to see an enhancement in initial rates for polymer formation when B4GAT1 was added with LARGE to Xyl- Î±-pNP and a complete inability to form polymer except when B4GAT1 was added with LARGE using Xyl-Î²-pNP as the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This strongly supports the proposed priming activity of B4GAT1.</p>
      <p><italic>5) The study uses artificial substrates and in vitro assays. The model presented predicts that the alpha-dystroglycan from B4GAT1 deficient cells (KD, KO or patient derived) should display a single branched Xylose (or a terminal Xylose) in addition to the phospho-O-Mannose tri-saccharide. In recognition of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient quantities for structural evidence, indirect evidence that the absence of B4GAT1 results in the production of O-Mannose glycans on alpha-dystroglycan terminating in beta-xylose (or at least xylose) would be helpful</italic>.</p>
      <p>We agree with reviewers and would direct them to the co-submitted article by Campbellâs laboratory that has the B4GAT1 deficient cells and determines the Xyl is terminal on alpha-dystroglycan in these cells and in a beta linkage based on glycosidase specificity. Our new data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that LARGE cannot generate polymer in the absence of B4GAT1 on Xyl-Î²-pNP is consistent with this argument as well.</p>
      <p><italic>6) To explore why B4GAT1 is indispensable and prove it is a priming enzyme, it would be ideal to test whether the first Xylose on the alpha-dystroglycan is indeed branched in Beta as proposed by the authors. Please speculate on how this could be tested</italic>.</p>
      <p>See answer to question 5 above. Briefly, we have now demonstrated that LARGE cannot produce polymer in the absence of B4GAT1 on Xyl-Î²-pNP but can, albeit with a slow initial rate, on Xyl-Î±-pNP.</p>
      <p><italic>7) Lee at al 2009 presents data for intracellular association of B4GAT1/B3GNT1 with B4GALT1. Perhaps the new findings suggest that a variety of Golgi glycosyltransferases are present in larger, oligomeric assemblies in cells? Please speculate</italic>. <italic>Also, could the authors speculate why the previous work came to the wrong conclusion?</italic></p>
      <p>Given the often-times high Kmâs of glycoslytransferases, the presence of oligomeric assemblies of enzymes in the secretory pathway would be a reasonable proposed mechanism for directed complex glycosylation. Of course, the oligosaccharyl transferase is a known multi-protein complex in the ER responsible for en bloc transfer of glycans from lipid linked oligosaccharides to Asn residues on proteins serving as a proof-of-concept for this model. Furthermore, a recent publication (Babu et al, 2012, Nature, 489:585) clearly established that there are multiple membrane protein-protein interactions occurring in eukaryotic cells. Lee et al 2009 established that B4GAT1 (now known to be involved in the LARGEdependent O-Mannosylation pathway [demonstrated here and in the companion article from the Campbell laboratory]) interacted with B4GALT1 (an enzyme involved in the generation of multiple types of glycans including, importantly in this context, the synthesis of polyLacNAc), and that they could influence each others location in the secretory pathway. We think it is overly strong to state that these authors arrived at a wrong conclusion as this manuscriptâs major conclusion, in our view, was that these two enzymes interact. This appears to be a valid conclusion based on their studies that showed co-immunoprecipitation, co-localization, and the ability of one enzyme to regulate the localization of the other enzyme in the secretory pathway. At the time of these studies, one could postulate that these 2 enzymes associated together to more efficiently produce poly-LacNAc as the 2 activities needed are B3GNT and B4GALT activity. This of course needs to be re-evaluated in light of our findings. Being highly speculative, this complex could be involved in generating the phenomena seen in some cancer types where production of poly-LacNAc goes up and production of the LARGE-dependent glycosylation goes down. However, this remains to be evaluated.</p>
