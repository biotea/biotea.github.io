      <abstract>
        <p>Mutation of the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase OCRL1 results in two disorders in humans, namely Lowe syndrome (characterized by ocular, nervous system, and renal defects) and type 2 Dent disease (in which only the renal symptoms are evident). The disease mechanisms of these syndromes are poorly understood. Here we identify two novel OCRL1-binding proteins, termed inositol polyphosphate phosphatase interacting protein of 27 kDa (IPIP27)A and B (also known as Ses1 and 2), that also bind the related 5-phosphatase Inpp5b. The IPIPs bind to the C-terminal region of these phosphatases via a conserved motif similar to that found in the signaling protein APPL1. IPIP27A and B, which form homo- and heterodimers, localize to early and recycling endosomes and the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN). The IPIPs are required for receptor recycling from endosomes, both to the TGN and to the plasma membrane. Our results identify IPIP27A and B as key players in endocytic trafficking and strongly suggest that defects in this process are responsible for the pathology of Lowe syndrome and Dent disease.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Phosphoinositide (PI) lipids play a key role in many cellular processes, including intracellular signaling, actin dynamics, and membrane traffic (Di Paolo and De Camilli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2006</xref>; Balla <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2009</xref>). There are seven distinct species of PI, generated through the action of specific PI kinases and phosphatases that act upon the 3, 4, or 5 positions of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol. The different PIs are enriched at distinct cellular compartments where they serve to recruit and/or activate proteins that determine compartment function and identity (Behnia and Munro, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2005</xref>; Di Paolo and De Camilli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2006</xref>; Balla <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2009</xref>). This recruitment and/or activation is usually achieved through the specific recognition of PI headgroups by modular binding domains found on proteins (Balla, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2005</xref>; Lemmon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2008</xref>). An increasing number of diseases can be attributed to defective PI metabolism, highlighting the importance of this process (Vicinanza <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2008</xref>; McCrea and De Camilli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2009</xref>).</p><p>OCRL1 is an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase that preferentially hydrolyzes PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, PIs found predominantly at the plasma membrane (Attree <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1992</xref>; Schmid <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2004</xref>; Lowe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2005</xref>). Mutation of OCRL1 causes two X-linked disorders in humans, oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) and type 2 Dent disease (Attree <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1992</xref>; Hoopes <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2005</xref>). These syndromes are characterized by renal tubular dysfunction, with Lowe syndrome also resulting in neurological and ocular defects, including mental retardation, epileptic seizures, congenital cataracts, and glaucoma (Nussbaum and Suchy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2001</xref>; Schurman and Scheinman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2009</xref>). OCRL1 has several domains including an N-terminal PH (pleckstrin homology) domain, a central 5-phosphatase domain, and C-terminal ASH (ASPM, SPD-2, Hydin) and RhoGAP-like domains. It is localized to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN), endosomes, plasma membrane ruffles, and clathrin-coated membrane-trafficking intermediates (Olivos-Glander <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">1995</xref>; Ungewickell <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2004</xref>; Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2005</xref>; Faucherre <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2005</xref>; Erdmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>). Targeting of OCRL1 to the membrane requires interaction with Rab GTPases, which bind to the ASH domain. Rab5 and Rab6 target OCRL1 to endosomes and the TGN respectively, although binding to several other Rabs has also been reported (Hyvola <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>; Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2008</xref>). OCRL1 binds to clathrin heavy chain and the plasma membrane AP2 adaptor subunit Î±-adaptin via distinct peptide motifs located in its N- and C-terminal regions (Ungewickell <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2004</xref>; Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>; Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2009</xref>). The interaction with clathrin concentrates OCRL1 into clathrin-coated buds and vesicles (Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>; Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2009</xref>). The C-terminal RhoGAP-like domain of OCRL1 interacts with Cdc42 and Rac1, which may stabilize membrane association or recruit OCRL1 to actin-rich membrane domains (Faucherre <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2005</xref>; Erdmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>). Recently, the endocytic signaling adaptor APPL1 has also been identified as an OCRL1 binding protein (Erdmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>).</p><p>OCRL1 is related to the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase Inpp5b, with which it shares a similar domain organization and substrate specificity (Matzaris <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1994</xref>; Shin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2005</xref>; Erdmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>; Williams <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2007</xref>). Inpp5b also binds to several of the proteins that interact with OCRL1 and has a similar localization, although notably it lacks binding to the clathrin machinery and is absent from clathrin-coated trafficking intermediates (Erdmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>; Williams <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2007</xref>). OCRL1 and Inpp5b appear to have partially overlapping functions since deletion of OCRL1 in mice fails to give a phenotype, whereas deletion of Inpp5b gives a mild one (male sterility), yet deletion of both 5-phosphatases is embryonic lethal (Janne <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1998</xref>).</p><p>The combined interaction and localization data described earlier in text imply a role for OCRL1 in membrane trafficking within the endocytic pathway, at the TGN, and possibly in actin dynamics or signaling from endomembranes. Functional studies suggest that OCRL1 participates in trafficking between endosomes and the TGN (Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2005</xref>; Cui <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2010</xref>) and possibly in receptor endocytosis (Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>; Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2009</xref>). Analysis of Lowe syndrome fibroblasts indicate that OCRL1 is important for cell migration, although whether this is a consequence of altered membrane traffic or changes in actin dynamics is currently unclear (Suchy and Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2002</xref>; Coon <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2009</xref>). It has also been suggested that OCRL1 can regulate signaling through altered intracellular calcium fluxes (Suchy <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2009</xref>). Despite these studies, however, the cellular role of OCRL1 remains poorly defined; consequently, the disease mechanisms of Lowe syndrome and type 2 Dent disease are not known.</p><p>Here, we report the identification and characterization of inositol polyphosphate phosphatase interacting protein of 27 kDa (IPIP27)A and B, two novel PH domain proteins that interact with OCRL1. These proteins were recently described by De Camilli and colleagues, who used the names Ses1 and 2 (for sesquipedalian, meaning an overly long name for a simple thing) (Swan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>). We show here that the IPIPs are key regulators of endosomal trafficking, linking OCRL1 to the recycling of receptors at sorting and recycling endosomes. Our studies strongly support the hypothesis that defects in endocytic membrane traffic give rise to the symptoms of Lowe syndrome and Dent disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Identification of IPIP27A and B as binding partners for OCRL1 and Inpp5b</title><p>To determine the cellular role of OCRL1, we searched for new interaction partners. In a genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screen using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> proteins, it was reported that the single orthologue of OCRL1 and Inpp5b interacts with a small predicted PH-domain protein, CG12393 (Giot <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2003</xref>). Whereas insect species have only a single orthologue of CG12393, vertebrates have two versions of this protein, which we name IPIP27A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and Supplemental Figure 1). These proteins are the same as Ses1 and 2 recently reported by the De Camilli group (Swan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>). Both IPIP27A and B interact with OCRL1 and Inpp5b in a directed yeast two-hybrid assay, and binding is mediated by the C-terminal regions of the IPIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These interactions were confirmed using pull-down experiments, with recombinant OCRL1 and Inpp5b efficiently binding to full-length and C-terminal regions of GFP-tagged IPIP27A and B, but not to the PH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The regions of OCRL1 and Inpp5b responsible for binding to the IPIPs were mapped using yeast two-hybrid and pull-down experiments to the C terminus, with both the ASH and RhoGAP-like domains required for efficient binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). These findings are in agreement with those reported by Swan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Interaction of OCRL1 and Inpp5b with IPIP27A and B.

(F) Dimerization of IPIP27 was assessed using extracts from HeLa cells coexpressing GFP- or Myc-tagged IPIP27A and/or IPIP27B followed by native immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP or anti-Myc antibodies and Western blotting with antibodies to these tags.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="606fig1"/></fig><p>To confirm that endogenous OCRL1 and IPIPs interact in vivo, we performed native coimmunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, antibodies to OCRL1 efficiently coimmunoprecipitated both IPIP27A and B, whereas antibodies to either IPIP27A or B coimmunoprecipitated OCRL1. Note that the majority of either IPIP27 was brought down with OCRL1 antibodies, suggesting that a large proportion of cellular IPIPs are found in a complex with OCRL1. In contrast, we could not detect coimmunoprecipitation of OCRL1 and APPL1 under the same conditions, suggesting that the interaction between these proteins is weak or transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Comparatively lower levels of OCRL1 were found in the IPIP27 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that a minority of cellular OCRL1 is bound to the IPIPs at any one time. Interestingly, IPIP27A coimmunoprecipitated with IPIP27B and vice versa, suggesting that they associate with one another in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). This suggestion was confirmed by coexpressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)- or myc-tagged IPIP27A and B and performing coimmunoprecipitation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, both IPIPs can homodimerize, with IPIP27B dimerizing more efficiently than IPIP27A, most likely due to its longer coiled-coiled region. The IPIPs were also able to form heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, IPIP27 heterodimer formation was more efficient than IPIP27A homodimerization, although not as efficient as IPIP27B homodimerization, consistent with IPIP27B having a higher propensity than IPIP27A to dimerize.</p></sec><sec><title>IPIP27A and B share a conserved motif for OCRL1 binding</title><p>Swan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>) identified a conserved C-terminal F&amp;H motif as the OCRL1 binding site in IPIP27/Ses, a motif that is also required for APPL1 binding to OCRL1 (see Supplemental Figure 1 and Figure 2A). As expected, pull-down experiments using truncated versions of IPIP27A and B indicated that binding to OCRL1 and Inpp5b was observed only in the presence of the C-terminal region containing the F&amp;H motif (Supplemental Figure 2). Mutation of either the F or H residues to alanine in IPIP27A or B significantly decreased binding to OCRL1, in agreement with the findings of Swan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Mutation of the conserved glutamateâisoleucine (EI) pair of residues also strongly reduced binding to OCRL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with an important role for these residues in conferring high-affinity binding to OCRL1 (Swan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>). Peptide binding experiments previously suggested that the IPIPs and APPL1 bind to a common binding site in the C-terminal region of OCRL1 (Swan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>). To confirm this suggestion, we performed competition binding experiments with recombinant proteins. Purified recombinant OCRL1 bound to purified IPIP27A and B, confirming that these proteins interact directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Purified OCRL1 also bound to purified APPL1, as observed previously (Erdmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>). Addition of a molar excess of IPIP27A or B, however, efficiently competed for this interaction, with binding completely abolished at a 10-fold excess of IPIP27A or B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, binding was retained with up to a 50-fold molar excess of Rab5, Rac1, or clathrin heavy-chain terminal domain, that all bind to the ASH-RhoGAP regions of OCRL1, indicating that the competition of APPL1 by IPIPs is specific. These results, together with those of Swan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>), strongly suggest the IPIPs and APPL1 share a common mode of binding to OCRL1.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Mutational analysis of the IPIP27-OCRL/Inpp5b interaction.

Several of these mutations have been shown to abolish interaction with APPL1, suggesting that loss of APPL1 binding may contribute to Lowe syndrome (Erdmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>; McCrea and De Camilli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2009</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated, however, that the same missense mutations also abolish IPIP27/Ses binding (Swan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>). We obtained a similar result using V577E and ÎE585 mutations that reside in the ASH domain, and L687P and I768N mutations in the RhoGAP-like domain. All mutations abolished both IPIP27 and APPL1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Structural analysis suggests that these mutations may impair folding of the OCRL1 C terminus (Erdmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>). We therefore performed limited proteolysis on the GFP-tagged wild-type OCRL1 and the Lowe syndrome mutants. Each of the missense mutants exhibited a distinct tryptic digestion pattern to that of the wild-type protein, suggesting that folding of the protein is indeed impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This effect likely explains why binding to Rab5, clathrin, and Rac1 is also affected by these mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the Rab binding mutant G664D did not affect binding to IPIP27 or the other interaction partners, and gave a similar digestion pattern to wild-type OCRL1 as previously reported (Hyvola <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of IPIP27A and B</title><p>Unfortunately we were unable to localize endogenous IPIP27 as our antibodies failed to work in immunofluorescence microscopy (unpublished data). We therefore transiently expressed GFP-tagged proteins at low levels in hTERT-RPE1 and HeLa cells. Western blotting indicated that the GFP-tagged IPIPs were expressed at comparable levels to the endogenous proteins, and we observed a similar localization regardless of the type of tag used (Supplemental Figure 3). Both IPIP27A and B exhibited the same localization. In addition to cytosolic and nuclear pools, there was localization to early endosomes, indicated by overlap with EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This finding supports those of Swan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>), who reported colocalization of IPIP27/Ses with EEA1 and WDFY2, which mark Rab5-positive early endosomes. We also observed a high degree of overlap with the transferrin receptor (TfR), both in punctate early endosomes and in the perinuclear recycling compartment. Consistent with this observation, the IPIPs overlapped with Rab11, a marker of perinuclear recycling endosomes (Supplemental Figure 4A). We also observed partial overlap with TGN46 and Golgin-97 in the perinuclear region, suggesting localization to the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and Supplemental Figure 3C). We failed to detect localization of either IPIP to late endosomes or lysosomes (Supplemental Figure 4A). To better resolve the perinuclear staining, we treated cells with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules and disperse Golgi and recycling endosomes. Both IPIP27A and B were present on dispersed TGN and recycling endosome elements, indicating localization to both compartments (Supplemental Figure 4B). Thus, we conclude that IPIP27A and B are localized to early and recycling endosomes and to the TGN.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3:</label><caption><p>IPIP27A and B are localized to early and recycling endosomes and the TGN and present in clathrin-coated vesicles.

IPIP27A and B colocalize extensively with OCRL1 on endosomes containing EEA1 and TfR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and unpublished data). There is little overlap between coexpressed IPIP27A or B and APPL1, in line with the findings of Swan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>), indicating localization to different endosomal subpopulations. OCRL1 overlaps more extensively with coexpressed IPIP27A and B compared with APPL1, consistent with the IPIPs being the predominant OCRL1-binding partners in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Previous work has shown that OCRL1 is enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles (Ungewickell <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2004</xref>; Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>). Both IPIP27A and B are also enriched in purified clathrin-coated vesicles, with a similar degree of enrichment to that seen with OCRL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, we could not detect APPL1 in the vesicle fraction. Together, our binding and localization results are consistent with a role for the IPIPs in clathrin- and possibly nonclathrin-mediated membrane trafficking, most likely at early and recycling endosomes and at the TGN.</p></sec><sec><title>Membrane targeting of IPIP27</title><p>To determine which domains of IPIP27A and B are required for targeting the proteins to endosomes and the TGN, GFP-tagged versions comprising the PH or C-terminal domains were expressed in cells and their localization analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, A and B). The PH domains of IPIP27A and B were weakly targeted to these compartments, whereas the C-terminal domains of both proteins gave a stronger localization, similar to that seen with full-length IPIP27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and unpublished data). To determine whether this localization is due to interaction with membrane-associated OCRL1 and Inpp5b, versions of IPIP27 containing the F224A mutation that abolishes OCRL1/Inpp5b binding were analyzed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, full-length and C-terminal IPIP27 F224A exhibited dramatically reduced membrane targeting, suggesting that OCRL1/Inpp5b interaction is a major determinant in IPIP27 localization. In support of this finding, we observe a significant enhancement of IPIP27 recruitment onto endosomal and TGN membranes when OCRL1 is coexpressed with wild-type IPIP27 but not the F224A mutant (Supplemental Figure 5A). The OCRL1/Inpp5b interaction is therefore important for IPIP27 targeting in vivo. Additional interactions are involved, however, most likely with the PH domain and other binding sites in the C-terminal region of the IPIPs. Conversely, binding to the IPIPs is not required for OCRL1 recruitment to the membrane, since depletion of the IPIPs alone or together does not diminish OCRL1 targeting (Supplemental Figure 5B). This finding is consistent with previous work showing that binding to Rab GTPases targets OCRL1 to the TGN and endosomes (Hyvola <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4:</label><caption><p>Membrane targeting of IPIP27.

Importantly we obtained the same results using two independent oligos for each protein (details of small interfering RNA [siRNA] oligos are in Materials and Methods). Depletion of IPIP27A altered endosome morphology, resulting in enlarged EEA1-positive early endosomes that clustered in the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, B and C). The Golgi also appeared more compact in the IPIP27A-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Depletion of IPIP27A or B alone or together had little effect on the amount of transferrin internalized into cells over a 30-min time period, indicating that the IPIPs are not essential for transferrin endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The recycling of internalized transferrin was clearly impaired, however, upon depletion of either IPIP alone or when they were codepleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, A and B). Transferrin was retained in clustered perinuclear endosomes upon depletion of IPIP27A and in more peripheral endosomes when IPIP27B was depleted, consistent with the redistribution of TfR observed under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6:</label><caption><p>Depletion of IPIP27A impairs transferrin recycling.

Previous work has suggested a role for OCRL1 in trafficking between endosomes and the TGN (Ungewickell <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2004</xref>; Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2005</xref>; Cui <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2010</xref>), leading us to test whether the IPIPs are also involved in this trafficking step. A major receptor that follows this route is the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR), which transports newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases from the TGN to endosomes. The CIMPR undergoes continual cycling between the TGN and endosomes, as well as a lower amount of trafficking via the plasma membrane. To study CIMPR trafficking we exploited a cell line stably expressing a chimeric CD8-CIMPR reporter (Seaman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2004</xref>). Depletion of IPIP27A or B in these cells resulted in partial redistribution of CD8-CIMPR to endosomes, suggesting that endosome to TGN trafficking may be impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, A and C). This finding was confirmed by incubating cells with an antibody that binds to the CD8-CIMPR ectodomain at the cell surface and by monitoring uptake and delivery from endosomes to the TGN by fluorescence microscopy. In control cells the CD8-CIMPR was efficiently internalized into endosomes at early times and was delivered to the TGN after a 30-min uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, B and C). In contrast, there remained a significant amount of CIMPR retained within endosomes at this time in IPIP27-depleted cells, indicating reduced delivery to the TGN. Interestingly, depletion of IPIP27B also reduced the amount of CD8 antibody bound to the cell surface prior to uptake. This result indicates a lower amount of receptor at the cell surface, suggesting an additional role for IPIP27B in recycling of the CIMPR to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7:</label><caption><p>CD8-CIMPR trafficking in IPIP27-depleted cells.

STxB is internalized via non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis and delivered to early endosomes, from where it is transported to the TGN in a clathrin-dependent manner (Saint-Pol <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2004</xref>). We exploited this assay to determine whether the IPIPs are required for trafficking of other cargoes from endosomes to the TGN. In control cells, STxB was efficiently transported to the Golgi apparatus after a 45-min internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, A and B). In contrast, in cells depleted of IPIP27A or B, a significant amount of STxB was retained within cytoplasmic puncta corresponding to endosomes at 45-min internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, A and B). IPIP27 depletion therefore impairs endosome-to-TGN trafficking of STxB.

To test this expectation, we monitored processing of the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin-D, which is synthesized as a 53-kDa precursor that undergoes cleavage to 47 kDa intermediate and 31 kDa mature forms upon delivery to endosomes and then lysosomes, respectively (Davidson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1995</xref>).

Interestingly, this was most apparent for IPIP27B depletion, suggesting a stronger defect in CIMPR recycling. We observed a similar result when analyzing the sorting of another lysosomal hydrolase hexosaminidase. Depletion of either IPIP caused increased secretion of hexosaminidase compared with controls, with a concomitant decrease in the amount of cell-associated hexosaminidase activity, and again the effect was more pronounced upon IPIP27B depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9:</label><caption><p>IPIP27 depletion causes lysosomal hydrolase missorting.

Wild-type and mutant forms of IPIP27 were coexpressed in cells with OCRL1 lacking the entire 5-phosphatase domain (ÎPIP<sub>2</sub>) or containing a point mutation in the 5-phosphatase domain that renders it catalytically inactive (D499A) (Jefferson and Majerus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1996</xref>), and effects on endosome morphology and receptor distribution were analyzed. The OCRL1 ÎPIP<sub>2</sub> mutant acts as a dominant negative in its own right, causing endosome enlargement and redistribution of the TfR and CIMPR to the aberrant endosomes, as described in earlier studies (Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2005</xref>; Hyvola <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>, A and B). The effects on both endosomal morphology and receptor protein distribution, however, are greatly exacerbated by coexpression with IPIP27A. To confirm that IPIP27 binding to OCRL1 is required to induce these effects, IPIP27A F224A was coexpressed with OCRL1 ÎPIP<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>, A and B, the effect of coexpressing IPIP27 with OCRL1 ÎPIP<sub>2</sub> on endosome morphology and receptor distribution is abolished by the F224A mutation. Similar results were observed with IPIP27B (unpublished data). In contrast to the ÎPIP<sub>2</sub> mutant, OCRL1 D499A alone had little effect on endosome morphology and receptor distribution (Supplemental Figure 6). Coexpression with IPIP27A again caused endosome enlargement, albeit to a lesser degree than with the OCRL1 ÎPIP<sub>2</sub> mutant, and there was redistribution of both TfR and CIMPR to the aberrant endosomal compartments, consistent with a defect in their trafficking (Supplemental Figure 6). Again, these effects were abolished by the F224A mutation in IPIP27A, and similar results were seen with IPIP27B (Supplemental Figure 6 and unpublished data).

We identify the OCRL1/Inpp5b binding site in the IPIPs and show that they are localized to endosomes and the TGN. Our IPIP27 binding and localization results are in agreement with those of De Camilli and colleagues, who refer to the IPIPs as Ses1 and 2 (Swan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>). In this study we now show that these proteins are key regulators of endocytic trafficking.</p><p>Early and recycling endosomes represent hubs for receptor sorting and trafficking within the endocytic pathway (Bonifacino and Rojas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2006</xref>; Grant and Donaldson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2009</xref>; Hsu and Prekeris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010</xref>). Nutrient receptors such as TfR are recycled back to the plasma membrane, whereas others are targeted to the lysosome for degradation or sorted into carriers destined for the TGN, as in the case of CIMPR (Bonifacino and Rojas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2006</xref>; Johannes and Popoff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2008</xref>). The IPIPs are localized to both sorting and recycling endosomes, and our studies indicate a role in multiple trafficking routes out of these compartments. We observe a strong effect of IPIP27 depletion upon CIMPR trafficking, with consequent defects in lysosomal hydrolase sorting. It has previously been reported that depletion of OCRL1 results in CIMPR missorting, although the effects are more subtle than we observe with IPIP27 depletion (Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2005</xref>; Cui <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2010</xref>). Importantly, Lowe syndrome patients have elevated levels of lysosomal hydrolases in their plasma, indicating that missorting occurs in the disease state (Ungewickell and Majerus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">1999</xref>). We propose that some Lowe syndrome symptoms, such as those of the CNS, may arise through lysosomal dysfunction. It is interesting to note that neurological problems are commonly observed in lysosomal storage disorders (Parkinson-Lawrence <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010).</p><p>We also observe defects in recycling of plasma membrane receptors upon IPIP27 depletion. Defective endocytic recycling to the plasma membrane could explain the renal symptoms of Lowe syndrome, since loss of the multiligand endocytic receptor megalin or its impaired recycling from endosomes gives a similar renal dysfunction to that observed in Lowe and Dent patients (Christensen and Birn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2002</xref>; Norden <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2002</xref>; Christensen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2003</xref>; Lowe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2005</xref>). A recent study failed to observe defects in trafficking of ectopically expressed megalin in OCRL1-depleted MDCK cells, although recycling was not specifically analyzed (Cui <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2010</xref>). Whether this is also true for endogenous megalin in the kidney proximal tubule remains to be investigated. Lowe syndrome patients appear to have less megalin at the cell surface, consistent with a recycling defect, although altered intramembrane proteolysis could also be responsible (Norden <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2002</xref>; Cui <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2010</xref>). Further experiments using an appropriate model will be required to more thoroughly test the involvement of OCRL1 and IPIP27 in megalin trafficking.</p><p>OCRL1 and Inpp5b appear able to partially or, in the case of the mouse, fully compensate for the loss of each other (Janne <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1998</xref>). How this compensation occurs is unclear, since OCRL1 is associated with the clathrin trafficking machinery whereas Inpp5b is not (Ungewickell <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2004</xref>; Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2005</xref>; Erdmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>; Williams <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2007</xref>; Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>; Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2009</xref>). Our results with the IPIPs provide a potential explanation for this apparent conundrum. The recycling of receptors within the endosomal system is complex, with more than one trafficking route possible for the same receptor (Bonifacino and Rojas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2006</xref>; Johannes and Popoff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2008</xref>; Grant and Donaldson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2009</xref>; Hsu and Prekeris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010</xref>). For example, TfR can be recycled to the plasma membrane from both early and recycling endosomes, whereas the CIMPR can be trafficked from different endosomes to the TGN. Deficiency of OCRL1 or Inpp5b likely affects distinct trafficking routes out of the endosome, with OCRL1 participating in clathrin-dependent and Inpp5b participating in clathrin-independent trafficking. The loss of either enzyme could therefore be compensated by the ability of cargo to use an alternative endosomal recycling pathway. The extent of defect observed would depend on the relative levels of the two phosphatases and the nature of the receptors and trafficking routes they follow, which is largely dependent on cell type, explaining why Lowe syndrome affects only certain tissues. Because the IPIPs bind to both OCRL1 and Inpp5b, their depletion would be expected to inhibit pathways used by both phosphatases, which may explain the strong trafficking defects we observe when these proteins are depleted.</p><p>The mechanism by which the IPIPs function in receptor recycling at endosomes is currently unclear. Their presence in clathrin-coated vesicles is consistent with a role at a late stage of carrier formation, or possibly in events that occur after carrier fission. The presence of numerous PxxP motifs in the C-terminal regions of the IPIPs suggests that they act as adaptors, linking OCRL1 and Inpp5b to the machinery required for the formation or maturation of endosome-derived carriers. Endocytic recycling requires several proteins that bind to PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (Mills <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2003</xref>; Zimmermann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2005</xref>; Jovic <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2009</xref>), and both lipids have been localized to endosomal recycling intermediates (Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2001</xref>; Jovic <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2009</xref>). OCRL1 and Inpp5b, via interaction with the IPIPs, likely participate in controlling the levels of these lipids in a highly temporally and spatially controlled manner to ensure efficient formation or maturation of carriers. The majority of Rab binding partners for OCRL1 and Inpp5b are involved in endocytic recycling (Rab6, Rab8, Rab10, Rab14, Rab22A, Rab35), supporting a role for the phosphatases in this process (Hyvola <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>; Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2008</xref>; Grant and Donaldson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2009</xref>; Lowe and Barr, unpublished data).</p><p>It has previously been reported that all known missense mutations in the C-terminal region of OCRL1 abolish binding to APPL1, suggesting that loss of this interaction may be responsible for the defects in Lowe syndrome (Erdmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>; McCrea and De Camilli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2009</xref>). Our results indicate that binding to the IPIPs is also abolished by these mutations, and further analysis indicates altered interactions with other known binding proteins. We could show that OCRL1 folding is impaired by the mutations, suggesting a more global disruption in protein function rather than a specific effect on protein interactions. This hypothesis would fit with the observations that many of the disease-causing missense mutations in OCRL1 lead to loss of protein expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/lowe/">http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/lowe/</ext-link>).</p><p>APPL1 is associated with signaling endosomes that appear transiently during growth factor receptor endocytosis (Miaczynska <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2004</xref>). APPL1-positive signaling endosomes lie upstream of sorting endosomes, and their maturation is controlled by a PI switch (Zoncu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2009</xref>). Loss of APPL1 and termination of signaling are mediated by the production of PtdIns(3)P, which is abundant at the sorting endosome (Zoncu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2009</xref>). Our results suggest that the IPIPs contribute to this process, since they localize to sorting endosomes and share a common binding site on OCRL1 and Inpp5b with APPL1. Moreover, they bind more strongly to OCRL1 and Inpp5b than does APPL1. The IPIPs are therefore ideally placed to displace APPL1 from the membrane, as would occur upon fusion of a signaling endosome with the sorting endosome, to help ensure the strict demarcation that exists between these types of endosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials and antibodies</title><p>All reagents were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or Merck (Whitehouse Station, NJ) unless stated otherwise.
