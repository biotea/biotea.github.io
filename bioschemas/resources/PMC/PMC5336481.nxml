        <p id="P1">Organellar ion channels are essential for cell physiology. Their activities are often regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>, which are concentrated in many organelles. Here we report a novel structural element critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/pH dual regulation of TRPML1, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel crucial for endolysosomal functions. TRPML1 mutations cause mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), a severe lysosomal storage disorder characterized by neurodegeneration, mental retardation and blindness. We obtained high-resolution crystal structures of a 213-amino acid luminal domain of human TRPML1 that harbors three missense MLIV-causing mutations. This domain forms a tetramer with a highly electronegative central pore formed by a novel luminal pore-loop. Cysteine crosslinking and cryo-EM confirm this structure in the full-length channel. Structure-function studies demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> interact with the luminal pore to exert physiologically important regulation. The MLIV-causing mutations disrupt the luminal domain structure and cause TRPML1 mislocalization. Our study provides a structural underpinning for TRPML1's regulation, assembly and pathogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Many types of ion channels are present in the membranes of intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, endosomes and lysosomes<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These channels help establish and maintain ionic concentration gradients across organellar membranes, and/or serve as release channels for key signaling ions, including Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>. Many organelles have high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> in their lumen<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. These ions, in turn, regulate the activities of numerous organellar ion channels<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying this universal regulation is instrumental in understanding the physiological and pathophysiological functions of organellar ion channels.</p>
      <p id="P3">TRPML1 is a member of the transient receptor potential mucolipin (TRPML) channel subfamily, first identified as a genetic determinant of mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, one of â¼50 lysosomal storage disorders. Children with MLIV often show cognitive, linguistic and motor deficits in their early years of age and are sometimes blind<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. TRPML1 is located primarily in lysosomes where its main role is to conduct Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the lysosome lumen to the cytoplasm<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. This Ca<sup>2+</sup> release step is important for many lysosome-dependent cellular events, including exocytosis<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, membrane trafficking<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, and autophagy<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. TRPML1 activity is markedly regulated by luminal/extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. In the presence of divalent ions, TRPML1 currents are greatly potentiated by H<sup>+</sup>, via unknown mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. The dual regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> has clear physiological relevance: TRPML1 exists primarily in lysosomes, and during biogenesis and lysosomal exocytosis, it can also be present in other organelles, including late endosomes and the plasma membrane<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. These distinct subcellular compartments have different pH and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The extracellular side of the plasma membrane has 1.8-2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a near-neutral pH of 7.2-7.4, whereas late endosomes have 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and an acidic pH of 5.5-6.0. Lysosomes have 0.5-0.6 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and an even more acidic pH of 4.5-5.0, a condition crucial for the activity of their native hydrolases<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Thus, depending on its subcellular location, TRPML1 may be regulated to different extents by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH to exhibit different activities. The molecular mechanism of this dual regulation is unknown.</p>
      <p id="P4">The crucial role of TRPML1 in cellular processes is further demonstrated by the existence of &gt;20 mutations in the TRPML1 gene that have been linked to MLIV<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Of these mutations, some (such as frameshift or nonsense mutations) completely abolish TRPML1 expression, but many (&gt;12) are single amino acid missense mutations<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. How these missense mutations alter the structure and function of TRPML1 is largely unclear.</p>
      <p id="P5">We undertook a structural approach to investigate the molecular mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/pH dual regulation of TRPML1 and MLIV pathogenesis, focusing on the linker between the first two transmembrane segments (S1 and S2) of TRPML1, which we refer to as the I-II linker. Like other TRP channel subunits, TRPML1 contains six transmembrane segments (S1-S6, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). The I-II linker accounts for more than one third of the channel's length (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). In lysosomes and endosomes, this linker faces the lumen (it is therefore also referred to as the âluminal linkerâ); on the plasma membrane, it faces the extracellular solution (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Moreover, it contains three single-amino acid missense mutations that cause MLIV (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. We solved the crystal structures of the luminal linker at three different pH conditions (corresponding to the pH in lysosomes, endosomes and the extracellular milieu) and elucidated its role in the dual regulation of TRPML1 by luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH, TRPML1 channel assembly, and MLIV pathogenesis.</p>

        <title>TRPML1 channel activity is regulated by luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH</title>
        <p id="P6">To obtain human TRPML1 currents, we followed a well-established method by expressing a constitutively active mutant channel named TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic> (tagged with EGFP on its N-terminus) in HEK 293T cells<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic> contains the V432P mutation, which mimics a spontaneous gain-of-function mutation (A419P) in mouse TRPML3 that causes the <italic>varitint-waddler</italic> (<italic>Va</italic>) phenotype<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>-<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. The V432P mutation enables TRPML1 to traffic to the plasma membrane and become spontaneously active<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic> produced a strong inward-rectifying current in a nominal divalent ion-free (NDF) extracellular/luminal solution at pH 7.4 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the extracellular/luminal solution inhibited the current in a dose-dependent manner. A dose-response curve yielded an apparent IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.27 mM, with a Hill coefficient of 1 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting a one-to-one blocking mechanism.</p>
        <p id="P7">Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition of TRPML1 was strongly dependent on extracellular/luminal pH, becoming much weaker when the pH of the extracellular/luminal solution was lowered from 7.4 to 4.6, the pH of the lysosome lumen. The dose-response curve was shifted to the right at pH 4.6 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), increasing the apparent IC<sub>50</sub> by 14-fold to 3.8 mM. Intriguingly, the shape of the dose-response curve was different and the Hill coefficient was changed from 1 to 0.5 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting negative cooperativity between extracellular/luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>. Due to attenuated Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition at pH 4.6, TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic> currents were augmented when the extracellular/luminal pH was lowered from 7.4 to 4.6 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P8">It should be mentioned that the dual regulation by luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH described above was observed in a gain-of-function mutant rather than the wildtype (WT) channel. Since the V432P mutation enables the channel to open constitutively, any effect of luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> on gating.</p>

        <title>Crystal structure of the luminal linker</title>
        <p id="P9">Because the TRPML1 luminal linker faces the endolysosomal lumen and constitutes a large part (&gt;1/3) of the channel, we investigated its role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/pH regulation of TRPML1. We first determined the X-ray crystal structure of the luminal linker (G84-S296) of human TRPML1 at a 2.3 Ã resolution at pH 6.0 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The structure shows that the linker forms a tetramer with a four-fold rotational symmetry (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The structure is â¼90 Ã wide (outer diameter) and â¼30 Ã tall. At the center of the tetramer exists a highly electronegative pore, named the luminal pore (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Each protomer has a structural fold that consists of two long Î±-helices (Î±1 and Î±2, with 22 and 17 residues, respectively), two short Î±-helices (Î±3 and Î±4), eight Î²-strands, and three loops with &gt;15 residues (between Î±1 and Î±2, Î±3 and Î²1, Î²4 and Î²5, respectively) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The four Î±-helices are packed tightly against a 5-stranded Î² sheet formed by Î²1, Î²4, Î²5, Î²6 and Î²7. One side of this Î² sheet faces the luminal pore, and the other side faces the outside of the tetramer (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, c</xref>). Two intrasubunit disulfide bonds are present, one between C166 in Î²1 and C192 in Î²4, and another between C253 in Î²6 and C284 in the short loop between Î²7 and Î²8. The structure of E199-K219 (which constitutes part of the loop between Î²4 and Î²5) was unresolved, presumably due to its flexibility.</p>
        <p id="P10">The TRPML1 I-II linker structure has a number of unique and noteworthy features: (1) The luminal pore is lined by a novel 16-amino acid, reentrant luminal pore-loop (L106-T121) that connects to helices Î±1 and Î±2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, d</xref>). The narrowest region of the luminal pore is 14 Ã, wide enough to allow fully hydrated Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to pass through. (2) The luminal pore contains twelve Asp residues (D111, D114, and D115 in each linker) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, d</xref>), making this region highly electronegative at neutral pH (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). (3) The first 22 amino acids of the luminal linker (G84-F105) form an Î±-helix (Î±1) that may be of strategic importance for allosteric modulation: it connects directly to S1 at the amino end and to the luminal pore-loop at the carboxyl end (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). When the TRPML1 I-II linker was placed on top of the transmembrane segments of the TRPV1 structure<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, Î±1 aligns reasonably well with S1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Indeed, Î±1 appears to form a continuous Î±-helix with S1, thereby anchoring the I-II linker to the rest of the channel. We speculate that in the full-length channel, sequential movements of cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions may propagate to the luminal pore through Î±1. (4) Another Î±-helix (Î±2, R122-A138), whose N-terminus is connected to the luminal pore-loop, forms a flat perimeter on the top of the luminal pore (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>

        <title>Confirmation of the luminal linker structure in full-length TRPML1</title>
        <p id="P11">The structure described above was obtained from an isolated channel domain. Is this tetrameric structure preserved in the full-length channel? We took two approaches to address this question. First, the crystal structure shows that each luminal linker interacts with two neighboring linkers (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), so we performed biochemical experiments to examine crosslinking among them. In this experiment, we used <italic>C. elegans</italic> instead of human TRPML1 because for unknown reasons the human TRPML1 protein remained tetrameric even in reducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Based on the intersubunit interface of the human TRPML1 I-II linker, we engineered three complementary pairs of cysteines in full-length <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRPML1 that are predicted to form intersubunit disulfide bonds; these include D104C in linker A and T293C in linker B, H111C in linker A and Y136C in linker B, and D158C in linker A and D137C in linker B (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We also engineered six non-complementary pairs of cysteines in two neighboring linkers that are predicted <italic>not</italic> to form intersubunit disulfide bonds: D104C and Y136C, D104C and D137C, H111C and T293C, H111C and D137C, D158C and T293C, and D158C and Y136C. The results were as predicted: Under non-reducing conditions (i.e., without DTT), purified full-length TRPML1 proteins containing complementary cysteine mutations formed oligomeric bands in SDS-PAGE at the expense of the monomeric bands (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, upper panel, lanes 2, 6 and 10). However, those proteins containing non-complementary cysteine mutations remained monomeric (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, upper panel, lanes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8). (The D158C/Y136C protein in lane 9 appeared to have been degraded or precipitated and did not show a band.) Under reducing conditions (i.e., with DTT), all proteins existed as monomers (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, lower panel). That the oligomer bands exist only in the complementary cysteine pairs and only under non-reducing conditions is consistent with disulfide bond formation between the engineered cysteines, even though the molecular weight (MW) of the oligomer bands was larger than that of a predicted tetramer, which could be due to tetramer aggregation.</p>
        <p id="P12">Second, we carried out single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the purified full-length WT TRPML1 protein (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The cryo-EM density of the extracellular domain (ED) was clear and robust, but that of the transmembrane domain (TMD) was unclear and heterogeneous (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 3c, d</xref>). The ED and TMD could be distinguished and recognized based on their dimensions and the gross similarity of the TRPML1 TMD and TRPV1 TMD. We therefore used a masking procedure that allowed us to segregate the ED from the TMD during subsequent cryo-EM analysis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). A cryo-EM density map of the ED was obtained at an overall resolution of 5.28 Ã with <italic>C</italic><sub>4</sub> symmetry imposed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). At this resolution, it can be seen that the ED, â¼79% of which is made up of the luminal linker, is a tetramer and has a large pore in the center (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), confirming two of the most salient hallmarks of the crystal structure of the luminal linker. Due to the limited resolution, we did not build an atomic model or identify secondary structures on this density map; however, the crystal structure of the luminal linker can fit into the density map with a correlation coefficient of 0.75, suggesting a reasonably good fit (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The extra density not covered by the luminal linker crystal structure in the composite may come from the E199-K219 loop (which is unresolved in the crystal structure), other extracellular loops, and glycosylation.</p>
        <p id="P13">Together, the above biochemical and cryo-EM studies suggest that the TRPML1 luminal linker has the same structure in the full-length channel as in the isolated domain: it forms a tetramer and contains a large central pore. This conclusion is further supported by structure-guided mutagenesis studies described directly below.</p>

        <title>The luminal linker tetramer is crucial for full-length TRPML1 assembly</title>
        <p id="P14">The crystal structure of the luminal linker shows that it forms a tight tetramer through extensive intersubunit interactions. These interactions include hydrogen bonding, ion pairs, hydrophobic interactions, and an antiparallel, domain-swapped 3-stranded Î²-sheet formed between two neighboring subunits (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). The interface between two adjacent linkers has a buried surface area of 1430 Ã<sup>2</sup>. To examine whether the tetrameric assembly of the luminal linker is important for the tetrameric assembly of full-length TRPML1, we mutated L144 and R146, two residues that are engaged in intersubunit interactions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), to lysine and serine, respectively, in both the isolated luminal linker and full-length human TRPML1. We then examined the oligomeric state of wild-type (WT) and mutant domain proteins or full-length proteins by native gel electrophoresis. In a non-denaturing gel, the isolated luminal linker containing the L144K/R146S mutation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, upper panel, lane 2) migrated at a much lower molecular weight than did the WT linker (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, upper panel, lane 1), consistent with them being monomer and tetramer, respectively, and indicating that the double mutation disrupted the tetrameric assembly of the isolated linker. In a blue native gel, full-length WT TRPML1 showed a distinct band, which presumably corresponds to tetramer (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, lower panel, lane 1). This band was absent with the mutant full-length TRPML1, which migrated as aggregated oligomers (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, lower panel, lane 2), suggesting that the L144K/R146S mutation disrupted the tetrameric assembly of full-length TRPML1.</p>
        <p id="P15">Consistent with the above biochemical observations, a mutant TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic> channel containing the L144K/R146S mutation (named TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic>-LR) produced little whole-cell currents when expressed in HEK 293T cells, in a NDF solution at either pH 7.4 or 4.6 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). We then examined the subcellular localization of TRPML1-LR, which contains the L144K/R146S mutation, by using confocal fluorescence microscopy. The wild-type and mutant channels tagged with EGFP were expressed in HeLa cells, which were labeled with the lysosomal marker LysoTracker to identify lysosomes. WT TRPML1 had a punctuate distribution and localized to lysosomes, as previously observed<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>-<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>; TRPML1-LR, however, had a diffuse distribution throughout the cell and did not localize to lysosomes (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that proper formation of the luminal linker tetramer is critical for the proper assembly and proper subcellular organelle targeting of TRPML1.</p>

        <title>MLIV-causing mutations in the luminal linker disrupt TRPML1 assembly and localization</title>
        <p id="P16">Three MLIV-causing single amino acid missense mutations (L106P, C166F, and T232P) are present in the TRPML1 luminal linker (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). These mutations produce milder MLIV symptoms than do truncation/frame-shift mutations<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>-<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>, which generally result in a complete loss of the TRPML1 protein. The pathogenic mechanisms of these missense mutations at the channel level are unknown. The crystal structure of the luminal linker provides a structural context to investigate how these mutations affect TRPML1 structure, assembly, localization and activity.</p>
        <p id="P17">In the structure, L106 is at the junction of the anchoring Î±-helix (Î±1) and the luminal pore-loop, C166 forms a disulfide bond with C192, and T232 is located on Î²5 of a core Î² sheet (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 1b and 4a</xref>). The luminal linker protein containing any one of the three pathogenic mutations could still be expressed but with low yields. Circular dichroism measurements of the purified proteins revealed marked changes in the secondary structure of all three mutant linkers (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). In a blue native gel, the full-length WT protein migrated as a distinct putative tetramer band (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, lane 1), whereas the full-length mutant proteins migrated as aggregated oligomers (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, lanes 2, 3 and 4). Size-exclusion chromatography further confirmed increased aggregation of the mutant proteins (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). These results indicate that all three mutations disrupt the structure of the luminal pore and the tetrameric assembly of the full-length channel. These detrimental effects are not unexpected since two of the mutations (L106P and T232P) introduce a proline and one of the mutations (C166F) disrupts an intrasubunit disulfide bond and replaces a small amino acid with a larger hydrophobic one.</p>
        <p id="P18">Consistent with the biochemical characterizations, confocal imaging showed that the mutant channels expressed in HeLa cells were diffusely distributed in the cells and did not localized to lysosomes, where the WT channels were mostly found (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). As expected, because of abnormal assembly, the mutant channels produced little or no currents in HEK 293T cells when the mutations were introduced in TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>

        <title>The luminal pore is critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH regulation of TRPML1</title>
        <p id="P19">The existence of a luminal pore is a distinct feature of TRPML1. The manual docking model shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref> suggests that the luminal pore is a part of the ion conduction pathway. To test this hypothesis, we simultaneously mutated three amino acids with relatively small side chains (S110, G112 and A113) in the luminal pore-loop to cysteine in TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic>, and examined the effect of MTSET (a sulfhydryl-specific modifying reagent with a head group of 5.8 Ã wide) on ion conduction in the mutant channel (named TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic>-3C). The whole-cell current of TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic> did not change significantly after extracellular application of 5 mM MTSET, but the current of TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic>-3C was quickly and irreversibly inhibited (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), supporting the hypothesis above. Consistent with the structural revelation of a wide luminal pore, the current reduction after MTSET modification was only partial (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 5b-d</xref>). Further supporting the notion of a wide luminal pore and the specificity of thiol modification, the currents of TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic> channels carrying a S110C/G112C or G112C/A113C double mutation were not inhibited by 5 mM extracellular MTSET (data not shown).</p>
        <p id="P20">The presence of 12 Asp residues in close proximity within the luminal pore (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2a, d</xref>) raises a strong possibility that this pore region plays a role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH regulation. We tested this by simultaneously mutating all 12 Asp residues (D111, D114, and D115 in each subunit) to glutamine in TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic>, generating a mutant channel named TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic>-3DQ. These mutations greatly reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition at pH 7.4, increasing the apparent IC<sub>50</sub> by 20-fold, from 0.27 mM to 5.5 mM while keeping the Hill coefficient at 1 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>, decreasing the pH from 7.4 to 4.6 attenuated Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition of TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic>. The AspâGln mutations further decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition at pH 4.6, increasing the apparent IC<sub>50</sub> from 3.8 mM to &gt;10 mM (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). These results indicate that the luminal pore Asp residues are important for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH regulation of TRPML1.</p>
        <p id="P21">The high electronegativity of the luminal pore is also expected to enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction by attracting and concentrating Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, the effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction is likely complex and pH-dependent. On the one hand, the luminal pore aspartates attract and concentrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hence increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction; on the other hand, they bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> to block the luminal pore and thereby decrease Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction. Thus, the end result on Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction is a balance of these two opposite effects, depending on the protonation state of the luminal pore aspartates.</p>
        <p id="P22">To examine the importance of the luminal pore on Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction, we measured (by using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging) Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into HEK 293T cells expressing TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic> upon switching from an extracellular solution without Ca<sup>2+</sup> to one with 3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This concentration was chosen to achieve a balance between a strong enough Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and physiological relevance. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased gradually with time upon switching from 0 to 3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). The slow rise time was not due to a slow solution exchange, which was complete in 100-300 ms; it might be due to a slow accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> inside the cells. Regardless, the rise time was significantly faster at pH 4.6 than at pH 7.4, presumably reflecting a faster Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction at pH 4.6. This outcome is likely mainly due to a weaker inhibition of the channel by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, even though the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrating effect is also attenuated at this acidic pH.</p>
        <p id="P23">We next examined the effect of the AspâGln mutations on Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction. These mutations are expected to produce two opposite effects: (i) less Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition and hence increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction, and (ii) less Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrating effect and hence decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction. The initial rise time of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase was similar at pH 4.6 and 7.4 for TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic>-3DQ, consistent with the expected effect of the AspâGln substitutions (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). At pH 7.4, the time course of Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase of TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic>-3DQ was similar to that TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>), which was strongly inhibited by Ca<sup>2+</sup> at this pH. However, at pH 4.6, the AspâGln mutations significantly slowed the time course of Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>). This result can probably be attributed to a much reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrating effect in the mutant channel. Altogether, these results suggest that the luminal pore Asp residues play a role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> conduction through TRPML1. It is noticeable, however, that the TRPML1<italic><sup>VP</sup></italic>-3DQ channel currents still exhibited strong inward rectification, indicating that this property is not controlled by the luminal pore Asp residues (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

        <title>The luminal pore structure is not significantly altered by pH</title>
        <p id="P24">There are two possibilities of how acidic pH attenuates Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition of TRPML1. First, low pH changes the structure of the luminal pore, either globally or locally. Second, low pH simply protonates the luminal pore aspartates without causing significant structural changes. To distinguish between these possibilities, we obtained crystal structures of the TRPML1 luminal linker at pH 4.5, mimicking its native physiological state, and 7.5, mimicking the pH at the plasma membrane. Both structures were determined at a 2.4 Ã resolution (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref> and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Since residues E199-K219 were unresolved in the pH 6.0 structure, we removed R200-E213 in the constructs used in the pH 4.5 and pH 7.5 structures. The different structures show some differences in the periphery; e.g., at pH4.5, the first 9 amino acids of Î±1 became unstructured and several Î² strands (Î²2, Î²3 and Î²8â²) could not be resolved. These differences might be caused by different crystal packing in different pH conditions. Remarkably, the structures are almost identical in most regions, including the luminal pore-loop (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a, b</xref>). Even the side-chain orientation of the luminal pore aspartates is virtually the same (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>), although the crystals at different pH are in completely different crystal forms (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These structures indicate that the I-II linker exists in a highly stable state. Thus, the attenuated Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition at the acidic pH (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) is likely due to protonation of the luminal pore aspartates rather than large conformational changes in the luminal pore.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P25">The long luminal/extracellular linker between the first two transmembrane segments is a unique but shared feature of the mucolipin (TRPML) and polycystin (TRPP) subfamilies of TRP channels. Our crystal structure of the TRPML1 I-II linker is the first high-resolution structure of a TRPML channel. Since the I-II linkers of TRPML2 and TRPML3 share high amino acid sequence homology with TRPML1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>), they likely have the same or similar structures. Recently, a 3.0 Ã-resolution cryo-EM structure of a human TRPP2 construct containing the ED and TMD was obtained <sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Comparisons of the structures of the TRPML1 and TRPP2 I-II linkers show that despite divergent primary sequences (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>), the two linkers have a very similar overall structural fold (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>) and form tightly bound tetramers (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7c, d</xref>). Given its unique presence in both TRPP and TRPML channels, we suggest that the I-II linker domain be named âthe polycystin-mucolipin domainâ instead of âthe polycystin domainâ, as proposed recently<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. On the other hand, structural comparisons also reveal that the highly electronegative luminal pore-loop is a unique hallmark of TRPML1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7e</xref>). In TRPML1 this loop extends downward toward the ion selectivity filter, whereas in TRPP2 it bends upward toward the luminal/extracellular entryway.</p>
      <p id="P26">Our studies show that the novel luminal pore of TRPML1 has an important physiological function. Because of TRPML1's crucial role in numerous cellular processes, especially lysosome-dependent events, the subcellular localization and activity of TRPML1 must be tightly regulated. Although TRPML1 localizes mainly to lysosomes, it can be inserted into the plasma membrane under certain circumstances, such as during lysosomal exocytosis<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Cells appear to employ multiple regulatory mechanisms to ensure proper levels of TRPML1 activity in different subcellular compartments â high activity in lysosomes and low activity in the plasma membrane. One mechanism is subcellular compartment-dependent regulation by phosphoinositides. Thus, TRPML1 is activated by PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub><sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, which is enriched on the lysosome membrane<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. On the other hand, TRPML1 is inhibited by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub><sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, which is abundant on the plasma membrane. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>/pH dual regulation represents another subcellular compartmentalized regulatory mechanism. The acidic environment of the lysosome ensures high TRPML1 conductance in lysosomes by diminishing TRPML1 inhibition by luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast, the neutral extracellular pH ensures low TRPML1 conductance on the cell surface by enhancing TRPML1 inhibition by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
      <p id="P27">It should be mentioned that the dual regulation by luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH we described was observed in a gain-of-function mutant rather than the wildtype (WT) channel. Since the V432P mutation enables the channel to open constitutively, any allosteric effect of luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> on channel gating might not have been revealed. Our studies suggest, however, that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/pH dual regulation is due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> block of the luminal pore and modulation of this block by protonation. This dual regulation is largely conferred by the luminal pore Asp residues, which either form a low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site or attract extracellular/luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> through electrostatic interactions to bind a site in the transmembrane pore. Based on our structural and functional studies, we propose a molecular model for the dual regulation of TRPML1 by extracellular/luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH. At pH 7.4, virtually all luminal pore aspartates carry negative charges (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, upper left). These negative charges attract and bind extracellular/luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thereby blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> as well as monovalent cation conduction (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, upper right). Lowering the pH to 4.6, which is close to the pKa of the aspartate side chain, results in protonation of the aspartates, reducing the net amount of negative charges and hence attenuating Ca<sup>2+</sup> block (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, lower right). There is residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> block at pH 4.6, because some of the aspartates are unprotonated and can attract and bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The negative cooperativity observed at pH 4.6 between H<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) is in good agreement with the protonation hypothesis. Mutating the aspartates to glutamines removes all the negative charges in the luminal pore and markedly further reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> block (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, lower left).</p>
      <p id="P28">A docking model (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) suggests that the TRPML1 I-II linker constitutes virtually all of the exposed surface of TRPML1 in the endolysosomal lumen and thus may contain all the interaction sites between TRPML1 and the lipids and proteins in the lumen. It is notable that the structure of E199-K219 in the TRPML1 I-II linker was unresolved (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>), probably due to its flexibility. This 21-amino acid loop may protrude into the endolysosomal lumen, beyond an otherwise rigid structure, and is thus a candidate interaction site with endolysosomal lumen molecules. Finally, the architecture and strong electronegativity of the luminal pore suggests that it may be a suitable site for structure-based design of TRPML1-specific blockers.</p>

        <title>Expression and purification of the TRPML1 I-II linker protein</title>
        <p id="P32">A DNA fragment encoding the I-II linker (residues 84-296) of human TRPML1 was obtained by PCR and cloned into a modified pET26b(+) vector. A maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag was added to the N-terminus of the I-II linker, and a DNA fragment encoding the recognition site of thrombin was inserted between the MBP tag and I-II linker. The resulted construct thus encodes a fusion protein that consists of an N-terminal MBP tag followed by the thrombin recognition site, the I-II linker, and a C-terminal 6ÃHistidine tag.</p>
        <p id="P33">Rosetta-gamiâ¢ 2 (DE3) cells were used to express the I-II linker to allow proper disulfide bond formation. Transformed cells were selected and grown at 37 Â°C in 10 liters of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 ug/ml kanamycin and 34 ug/ml chloramphenicol in an incubator shaker at 250 rpm. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 1.0, the culture was cooled down to 22 Â°C and 0.1 mM isopropyl Î²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added. The bacterial cells were incubated for another 12 hours in the shaker at 22 Â°C before they were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 15 min. The cells were resuspended in a solution containing 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 2.5% (w/w) glycerol (solution A). Five mM imidazole, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 25 ug/ml DNase and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were added, and the cells were disrupted by sonication. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA His-Bind resin (Novagen) with gentle agitation at 4 Â°C for 1 hour. The beads were spun down at 800 Ã g for 1 min and transferred to a gravity-flow chromatography column. After the resin was washed with 10 volumes of solution A containing 5 mM imidazole, the bound protein was eluted with 500 mM imidazole in solution A. The eluted protein was incubated with amylose resin (NEB) at 4 Â°C for 2.5 hours. The resin was collected by centrifugation at 800 g for 1 min, transferred to a column, and washed with solution A. The MBP-tagged protein was eluted by 20 mM maltose in solution A. Thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at 4 units per milligram protein to cut off the MBP tag. After incubation at 16 Â°C for overnight, the protein was concentrated and purified on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) to remove MBP. The gel filtration solution contained 10 mM HPEPS and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The peak fractions corresponding to the tetrameric I-II linker protein were collected and concentrated to a concentration of 4 mg/ml for crystallization.</p>

For the pH 6.0 crystal, protein solution was mixed with reservoir solution at a 1:1 ratio. The reservoir solution contained 1.38 M sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate and 0.42 M potassium phosphate dibasic, pH 6.0, and 5% pentaerythritol ethoxylate (3/4 EO/OH) (Hampton Research). Best crystals grew from drops formed by 4 mg/ml protein. For the pH 4.5 crystal, the protein concentration was 4 mg/ml and the reservoir solution contained 200 mM magnesium sulfate, 5.3% PEG 3350, and 100 mM acetate pH 4.5. Crystals at pH 7.5 were obtained by macroseeding in a reservoir solution of 100 mM magnesium sulfate, 4% PEG 3350, 100 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, with a protein concentration of 4 mg/ml. Heavy atom derivative crystals were prepared by soaking crystals in a solution containing 1.53 M sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate and 0.47 M potassium phosphate dibasic, pH 6.0 and 1 mM K<sub>2</sub>Pt(CN)<sub>4</sub> for 24 hours.</p>
